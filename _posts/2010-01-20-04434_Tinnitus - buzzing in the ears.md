## Tinnitus - buzzing in the ears

My left ear is almost deaf and I suffer from tinnitus almost all the time.  
Well I only _suffer_ from it during the night but it is present always. I  
wonder if there is any mantras or other ways that it could be removed.

Dear snow,   
I do not know whether there are any specific mantras for specific   
problems. The Hindu Ayurveda and Mantra Sastra have some such   
prescriptions. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was an expert in that   
field. But I know only one mantra, which is, I believe, a cure-all.   
You may try this Arunachala Siva...Arunachala Siva. Total faith   
and unflinching conviction are required.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well I'll give it a try anyway. Just chanting Arunachala Siva makes me feel  
good.

Dear I,   
I don't know if it was Sri Ramana Maharshi or some other saint. A middle aged  
man who was blind and at the same time even spiritually oriented came to this  
saint and had some conversations over some spiritual query he had. After a  
long session of talk, this man felt so sorry and sad for Himself that he was  
not able to see the Saint from his eyes to his heart's content. He cried to  
the saint over his this disability.   
The saint patted his shoulders and said to him, "oye, why do you worry over  
this? just be thankful for God that one of your senses is conquered. The eyes  
sees only external things, after all is this not what various Sadhakas aspire  
for? controlling you senses. Naturally you are gifted in way that your eyes  
don't lead you outwards and it is that much more easier for you to control  
your senses now"   
The eyes sees only external things the ear hears only external sounds. these  
are all distractions. Do you need any ear to listed to your consciousness? The  
lesser you are hearing, the better, for much lesser you will be pondering over  
what you heard, just a little more easier to abide as Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
