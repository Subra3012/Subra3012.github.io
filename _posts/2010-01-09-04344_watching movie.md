## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 6

Siva is said to be the greatest Mukunda-priya. Hari (Narayana)   
is said to be the greatest Siva Jnani. They merge in jnana-bhakti.   
Sri Sankara brings this idea in Verse 82 of Sri Sivananda Lahari.   
Banatvam vrushabhatvam artha vaphusha bharyatvam- arya pathe,   
Gonitvam sakitha mrudhanga vahata chetyadi rupam dadhou   
tvatpade nayanarpananja krutavan tvadeha bhago hari,   
pujyataras sa eva hi na cheth ko va dadhanyodhika   
O the concorporate of Ambika! Hari because of his having become an arrow for  
you, having become a bull as a vehicle, with half of   
your body as wife (Ardhanareeswara), having been a boar, a girl-   
friend, and a drummer became the most lovable for you. He has   
also donated his eye for you. He is also a part of your Hari-Hara   
form. Because of these, he becomes adorable by all devotees.   
Who is a greater than Hari in this world?   
#   
arrow - in Tripura Samhara, Hari became the arrow for Siva's   
 bow.   
bull - in the same Tripura Samhara, Hari became the bull,(as   
a vehicle), when Siva's chariot-wheel broke.   
#   
wife - in Hari-Hara avatara, Hari is the wife of Hara (Siva).   
Saint Tirunavukkarasar sings: "Where is the wife for you, O   
Siva, without Hari?" Hari and Parvati are brother and sisters.   
Hari and Parvati are said to be the same principle.   
boar - in Arunachala Puranam, it is said that Hari (Vishnu) went   
as a boar to dig the earth to see Siva's feet.   
girl-friend - sakita - When the milky ocean was churned and when   
Siva was called to take the poison, Hari came as Mohini, the seductive girl.  
(Srimad Bhagavatam).   
drummer - in the Pradoshakala Natya, when Siva dances, the drummer is Hari.   
donating the eye - During a puja by Hari to Siva, it so happened,   
one lotus (out of 1000 lotuses) became less. The lotus eyed   
Narayana, submitted his eye in lieu of lotus. There is a temple   
in Thanjavur District of Tamil Nadu for Siva, where he is called   
Hari Netrarpaneswarar. Siva, for whom Hari submitted his eye, in puja.   
Arunachala Siva.

## superset and subset  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 12:40:52 PM

A student was asked to give an example of superset-subset relationship: He wrote: Superset A = {}   
Subset B = {mind, ego, thought}   
The teacher was angry. He asked: Why did you make the superset null?   
How will you get things from a null superset in a subset?   
The student scratched his head and replied: That is what I am learning.   
The teaching gave him 0, a rejection of null.   
A holy man saw it and gave him 0, a blessing of null.   
(A set is an unordered collection of elements)

## Thief  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 03:34:05 AM  
---  
How is the ego to be destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks  
this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree to kill itself? This  
question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the  
ego you will find it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   
In this connection I am often reminded of a funny incident which took place  
when I was living in the West Chitrai Street in Madura. A neighbour in an  
adjoining house anticipated the visit of a thief to his house. He took  
precautions to catch him. He posted policemen in mufti to guard the two ends  
of the lane, the entrance and the back-door to his own house. The thief came  
as expected and the men rushed to catch him. He took in the situation at a  
glance and shouted "Hold him, hold him. There-he runs-there-there.'' Saying so  
he made good his escape.   
So it is with the ego. Look for it and it will not be found. That is the way  
to get rid of it.

## watching movie  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 09, 2010, 05:50:46 AM

A debate was going on whether it was possible to watch a movie and at the same  
time be conscious of oneself. A survey was conducted on the first show of a  
new movie from a random sample of viewers. The movie was both emotional as  
well as thrilling.   
All except one said that they were completely lost in the movie. The movie was  
too good. The person of exception said that he was conscious of himself all  
along the movie. Comments were passed that he was telling lie, showing  
himself, having stomach ache during the movie and to the extent that:"such  
insensitiveness, why come to watch a movie at all if you cannot enjoy it; some  
other person could have enjoyed the first show"   
The surveyor caught the person alone and asked: "Sir, I am a bit surprised. I expected that someone will either like a movie  
or hate it. In either case he should be involved in the movie and lose  
oneself. If you tell me the secret, I promise to keep the reason confidential  
and only publish the result."   
The exceptional person said: "Sir, I am the producer and director of the movie. Being a producer, each  
scene brought me the thought how I will recover the money I invested in the  
movie. Being a director the thought came how others are liking the scene and  
what impressions they are having about me. So I was getting double reminders  
of 'I' with each scene."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent anecdote. Staying in I amness is possible, only when   
we are in the state of that producer. "I am the King of all that I   
survey." Whenever I see some photographs of Bhagavan Ramana,   
smiling widely or laughing, (like the one on the first month of monthly  
calendarof 2010, which I had bought in T'malai during my   
Jayanti visit), He is like telling me: "You fellow! Who cares?"   
Arunachala Siva.
