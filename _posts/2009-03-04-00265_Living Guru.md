Muruganar says in Verse 179 of GVK: If those genuises who assert that they have known thorugh intellectual  
analysis, that the body and the world really exist, in the way that their  
senses tell them, let them examine the situation along with us and we will  
tell them, "Not only does the perceived world truly exists, but also the  
innumerable worlds of the gods, the heavens and hells, and so on, that are  
mentioned in books.   
If the Jnanis tell the immature ones the truth of the world, as it really is,  
these immature ones, who are under the sway of Vasanas, will not believe it.  
And will therefore not get ride of their desires, realize the Truth and attain  
Peace. Even if they happen to believe   
it, they will lose even the little interest they had before in Jnana-sadhanam,  
which comprises karma, bhakti and suffer in this world and in the next.   
{The position of immature ones is quite difficult. They do not believe in the  
unreality of the world. But if they believe it, then they would speak stop  
what ever steps they are taking for Jnana, like the preliminary steps of  
nishkamya karma and bhakti. Hence these immature ones have to be handled by  
Jnanis very carefully. This is why, we have seen, why Bhagavan was telling  
each devotee to continue their own path, be it niskamya karma, bhakti, raja  
yoga, so that they will first attain maturity in that and that maturity will  
take them to the royal path of Atma Vichara. You cannot teach abstract  
algebra to a class 8 student!}

Dear Subramanian,   
 Bhagavan was teaching them to follow their own path, coz perhaps they would not accept atma vichara even if told. Some people would even try to convince Bhagavan to accept that their method is right... what is the use of telling them atma vichara ?   
Perhaps he told atma vichara to only those who were ready to take it up. ..  
that is perhaps the simple definition of maturity for it. .. are you ready to  
take it or are you looking for alternatives?   
Love!   
Silence

Dear non duel, at the outset, my comp did not work for 15 days   
due to some unknown problem, hence there is some break in my   
prattiling! For most of us, the idea of a living guru appeals more,   
because we are so much used to names and forms. Again not one   
living guru, one seeks several living gurus! Bhagavan has said on   
many occasions that the devotees need not worry about being in   
a body permanently. Bhagavan lived 70 years in His body as an   
'avatara' to drive home the Truth but it is too much to expect Him   
to live always in body. The Guru need not be a living Guru. His   
Presence is always felt by genuine seekers even today. For people   
who seek miracles, He is causing miracles even today. For example,   
after 15 days, He has set right my comp on a fee of $ 6.00. No parts   
changed, no parts added, only a simple correction by a young engineer!   
I was only praying to Him: "You have made me go without even doing   
something in your glory? Why?" Then I chanted the famous Tiruvachakam verse,  
" You know what I want. You will give me all that   
you want. You are unreachable even to Bramha and Vishnu, who always   
wanted something or other from you. You have always given me what   
I had wanted. Even you know what I have to want from you, and that is what  
you want!" Arunachala Siva.
