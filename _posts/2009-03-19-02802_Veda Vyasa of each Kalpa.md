Maitreya says- "O Lord! How did God divide Vedas in the form of Vedavyasa  
during different Yugas?"   
Parashar says- During each Dwaparyug, in every Kalpa, Lord Vishnu takes  
incarnation as Vedavyasa   
and effects the division of Vedas for the benefit of human beings.   
During every Dwaparyug of the present Vaivasvat Manvantara, different Vyasas  
have divided the   
Vedas twenty-eight times. During the first Dwapar, Brahma himself had divided  
the Vedas. During the   
second Dwapar, Prajapati was Vedavyasa. During the third Dwapar, Shukracharya  
was Vedavyasa.   
During fourth Dwapara, Brihaspati acted as Vedavyasa.   
Description of other sages who acted as Vedavyasa during the subsequent  
Dwapars is as follows- Surya- fifth   
Vedavyasa; Mrityu- sixth Vedavyasa, Indra- seventh Vedavyasa, Vashishta-  
eighth Vedavyasa, Saraswat- ninth   
Vedavyasa, Tridhama- tenth Vedavyasa, Trishikh- eleventh Vedavyasa, Bharadwaj-  
twelfth Vedavyasa,   
Antariksh- thirteenth Vedavyasa, Varani- fourteenth Vedavyasa. Names of next  
fourteen Vedavyasas are as   
follows- Trayyarun, Dhananjay, Krutunjay, Jay, Bharadwaj, Gautam, Haryatma,  
Vaajshrava, Trinbindhu, Riksh   
(Valmiki), Shakti, Parashar, Jaatukarn and Krishnadwaipayan.   
After Krishnadwaipayan, DronaÂ’s son, Ashwatthama will be the next Vedavyasa.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. The Hindu philosophy has got that concept. In Saiva Siddhantam, it is  
said, that millions of Brahmas and Vishnus are born and dead and Siva is the  
only one, ever-living, without birth and death! Saint Manikkavachagar says: O! On this land, many Brahmas and Vishnus take birth and die and You are the  
one who is beyond birth and death. For every 100 Brahmas, there is one  
Vishnu and they all take birth and die.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Excellent. I fully agree with you. Ganapati Muni has written an   
incomplete work called Kala Jnana. There he says, that Kaliyuga,   
which is the shortest of 4 yugas will be only for about 8000 (?)   
years. Taking Krishna's disappearance, after the Mahabharata   
War, (he was killed by a hunter's arrow, when he was sitting on   
a tree, with flute in his hand), it is about 4000 years. There may   
be another 4000 years at best.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
There is a gentleman by name Mr. Natesan in Tiruvannamalai. He   
is the Secretary of Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri Devotees Sangh.   
He has given some details about Kala Jnana work of Sastri, in a Tamil book  
titled Kavyakanta Ganaapati Munivar, written by one Muruganandan. Several  
unpublished manuscripts of Sastri are said to be with that Sangh.   
Arunachala Siva.

We have come across some facts in our Ramanyana and Mahabharatha etc.. which  
states that Sri Rama ruled Ayodhya for 20000 years etc...   
I read in some book that in old days, poets had some penchant for the number  
1000. 1000 years signifies 4 years actually. Therefore when Rama ruled Ayodhya  
for 20000 yeards, he has actually ruled exactly for 80 years. Similarly the  
Yuga calculations etc.. must also have some inspiration behind the number of  
years. Maybe if we could calculate the 1000 years = 4 years, we could get the  
realistic number!

Dear Nagaraj and munagala,   
This is called Gadapatati Sankhya in Sanskrit.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Gadapatati Sankhya is the one where the letters Ga, Da, Pa, Ta in   
Sanskrit have got some values to be added with with zeros to   
various digits. This is explained by Kayakanta Ganapati Muni in   
his incomplete work called Kala Jnanam. I do not know any more   
details.   
Arunachala Siva.
