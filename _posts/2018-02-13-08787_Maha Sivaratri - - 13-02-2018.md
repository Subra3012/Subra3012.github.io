Nishta   
opening as a new thread...   
the main difficulty why forum is not active is, at least few like me got lot  
of worldly responsibilities...with all these endless chores one gets only  
small portion of time..that is spent on japa, hearing nochur pravachanam etc.  
so there is no time to read or reply.   
some told the forum will become active again. i dont think so. that period is  
over. it was required that time and it happened in Brahman.   
in 2011-2012 i would get individual replies in separate emails from Graham.  
still i am in touch with few other gem of the devotees i got from this forum.   
that was peak sadhana period for me and it coincided with the outer  
expression.   
currently also i am picking up on sadhana but Self has chosen to respond in  
various other ways.

## Maha Sivaratri - - 13.02.2018

Today is Maha Sivaratri. According to Bhagavan Ramana's poems, on this day,   
the Jyothir Lingam of Annamalai, became the Hill and all devas, under the  
leadership   
of Hari, prayed to Siva today.   
There is celebration in all Siva temples in Karnataka. The celebration in  
Nanjangud   
is said to be the greatest.   
What do people like me do? There is a simple puja at night around 7 pm.   
After that milk is placed as naivedyam.   
People like me cannot do upavasa, nor stay awake at night. What I do is to   
chant Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva for quite some time.   
Arunachala Siva.

You know that Bhagavan never slept, at least after coming to Arunachala.   
He lied down on the sofa only for rest, after giri pradakshina etc., He never  
slept.   
He was beyond Jagrat, Swapna, and Sushupti. He always remained in Turiya.   
Arunachala Siva.
