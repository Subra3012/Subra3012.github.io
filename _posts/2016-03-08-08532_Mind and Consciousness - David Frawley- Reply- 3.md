Chit is pure consciousness unmodified by any mental activity. Chit is  
awareness of what is called the Purusha,   
the inner Being, for which the mind is but a tool of perception and  
expression. Yoga similarly regards   
mind and brain as different though related. The brain is the physical vehicle  
for the mind, but not the   
mind itself.   
The Purusha is our inner Self while the mind, we could say, is like our  
computer and the body is like the   
car we drive. Mind and body are our internal and external instruments but not  
our real identity. Just   
as you are not your computer, so too, your true Self and Being is not the  
mind. The light that allows   
the mind to function comes from the Purusha. The mind does not have any light  
of its own. Your sense   
of self being, that you are unique, whole and continuous center of awareness,  
derives from the inner   
consciousness, not from the mind.
