## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ MIND IS ALL By Swami SIVANANDA

Mind alone is the whole world, with its pains, old age, death, sin, earth,  
water, fire, air and ether, and all the internal organs. **Mind binds man. He  
who has controlled his mind is a veritable god on earth.** We live in a world  
of thoughts. First there is the thought, and then there is the expression of  
that thought through the organ of speech.   
Thought and language are intimately connected. Loving thoughts uplift and  
encourage others. Unkind thoughts, thoughts of anger, bitterness and malice  
injure others. Thoughts are things. Sound, touch, taste, form and odour, the  
waking, dream and deep sleep states - all are the products of the mind only.   
Thoughts such as passion, anger, bondage, time - know all these to be the  
results of the mind. The only true laboratory is the mind. Study it, test it  
and then go beyond it. Then you will realise the truth; then you will discover  
the hidden soul. **Only if your mind is quiet will you enjoy peace in your own  
home, as you will enjoy it in the forest.**   
 **Man has a mind. But mind is not man. Mind is a good servant. It is an  
instrument only. Utilise it tactfully and properly. The prime requisite for  
happiness is control of the mind or lower self.** Your thought is imprinted on  
your face. Mind is a bridge that connects the human with the divine.   
Your body, your business, your house, are all only ideas within your own mind.  
Thought is a dynamic force. Good thought is the first perfection; it is the  
real wealth. Emotion is the driving force at the back of the mind. Will-power  
is the master-key to success. Knowledge, thought, intellect and reason are  
one.   
Appetite, instinct, impulse and desire are one. Emotion, ambition, spirit and  
courage are one. **The mind is the master of the body. The soul is the master  
of the mind.** Thou art, in essence, immortal soul. Thou art above body and  
mind. Always remember this supreme fact and live in the awareness of thy  
spiritual nature.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. As Swami Sivananda has said that the mind should be controlled and must  
be treated tactfully and also as a good servant.   
Let us see what Bhagavan Ramana says about the mind/ego/intellect.   
 Our individual self, which is the limited and distorted consciousness that  
we call our 'mind' or 'ego', and that in theological terminology is called our  
'soul', nourishes its 'seeming' existence by attending to things that other  
than itself. When we cease attending to other things, as in sleep, our mind or  
individual self subsides, but as soon as we begin to 'think of other things',   
it again rises and flourishes. Without thinking of things other than   
'I', our mind cannot stand. Therefore, when we attempt to turn our attention  
away from all objects and towards our fundamental consciousness 'I', we are  
surrendering or denying our individual self, our mind or ego. Self attention  
or self abidance is thus the perfect means to attain the state of 'self-  
surrender' or 'self denial'.   
This is why in Verse 31 of Vivekachoodamani, Sri Sankara defines bhakti or  
devotion as sva-svarupa-anusandhanam, or self attention, the close inspection  
of our own true form or essential nature, which is our fundamental self-  
consciousness - our non dual consciousness of our own being 'I am".   
Bhagavan also explains this similar idea in the 13th paragraph of His brief  
treatise Nan Yaar? [Who am I?]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
In this connection, Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman brings a new   
dimension. He says that there is thinking and there is also 'thoughting'.  
Thinking is deliberate indulgence in a thought or an   
emotion. For example, tomorrow my son is coming. Should I keep   
the alarm-ring since he arrives by very early morning flight and be   
at home around 3.30 AM. This is thinking, and there is a chain   
of thoughts.   
Now what is this 'thoughting'? Thoughts just come and go without   
any effort on my part. Suddenly on a rainy evening in Bangalore,   
I think of my sister falling while alighting from the bus in Chennai,   
since the road was wet and slippery due to rain. Suddenly I think   
of modakams that my mother would prepare for Sri Ganesa   
Chaturthi. I think of my old house in Tiruchy with rickety doors   
and windowless rooms, where one had to put on the light even during day time.  
There are so many examples. Nochur Venkataraman says that these thoughtings  
are also coming out of vasanas but they are harmless, and there is no ego  
involved there.   
Arunachala Siva.
