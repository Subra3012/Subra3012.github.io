Some 700 years ago, Deiva Sigamani Desika Paramacharya lived in a cottage on  
the eastern side of Arunachala. He worshipped Arunachala and spread Saivism  
through his followers. Hearing of his greatness, a certain king came to see  
him. Just then his horse was bitten by a snake and died. The king was upset,  
but his minister persuaded him to meet the sage. When the saint heard about  
the horse, he came out, and praying to Arunachala, tapped the horses body  
with his cane and brought it back to life. The saint asked the king to  
undertake the renovation of the   
Arunachaleswara temple. The king inscribed the story of the miracle performed  
by the saint on the south wall of the third prakara of the temple. The saints  
samadhi is outside the limits of Tiruvannamalai town and is now the  
Gurumurtham of Kunrakudi Aadinam. It is known as jeeva samadhi. Kunrakudi  
Aadinam was established at Tiruvannamalai and then shifted to Piran hills. Now  
it is situated at Kunrakudi. The heads of the mutt bearing the title,  
Kunrakudi Aadinam still pay their respects to their first Gurumurtham in  
Tiruvannamalai. Bhagavan Ramana stayed at Gurumurtham for six months in the  
year 1897 before shifting to the mango grove nearby.

Dear Nagaraj,   
I visited Gurumurtham once. It is inside the town. The shrine is not well   
taken care of. There is a Sivalingam inside. We have to take the keys   
from the nearby house, who are the custodians and open the doors and go   
inside. People who visit there, sometimes give some money and the   
custodians buy oil and light lamps, some flowers. Whereas the Isanya   
Desikar Math, at the fag end of Girivalam route, is well maintained by   
Kovilur Math.   
Arunachala Siva.
