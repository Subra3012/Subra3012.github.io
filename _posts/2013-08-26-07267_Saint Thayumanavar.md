Bodhidharma sat facing the stone wall. The Second Patriarch of Chinese Câhan  
(Zen), Suika, stood long in the thick snow. Finally, he severed his own arm  
and presented it to Bodhidharma. He said, âYour student cannot pacify his  
mind. You, the First Patriarch, please, give me peace of mind!â The First  
Patriarch replied, _**âBring that mind, I will calm it down!â**_ The  
Second Patriarch said, âI search for it everywhere, but I cannot find it!â  
Bodhidharma replied, _**âI have already pacified it for you!â**_

One day Chuang Tzu and a friend were walking by a river.   
"Look at the fish swimming about," said Chuang Tzu, "They are really enjoying  
themselves."   
"You are not a fish," replied the friend, "So you can't truly know that they  
are enjoying themselves."   
 _ **" You are not me," **_said Chuang Tzu. _**" So how do you know that I do

The Zen Master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living pure life. A  
beautiful girl whose parents owned a food store   
lived near him. Suddenly without warning, her parents discovered that the  
beautiful girl was pregnant. This made them very angry.   
The girl would not confess who the father was, but, after much harassment, at  
last named Hakuin!   
The enraged parents went to the Master. 'Is that so?' was all he would say.   
After the child was born, it was brought to Hakuin. By the time, he had lost  
his reputation, which did not trouble him at all, but he took   
very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors, and  
everything else, the little one needed.   
A year later, the girl- mother could stand it no longer. She told her parents  
the truth -- that the real father of the child was a   
young man who worked in the fish market.   
The parents of the girl at once went to the Master, to ask his forgiveness,   
to apologize at length and to get the child back again.   
Hakuin was willing. In yielding he child, all he said, was, "Is that so?'   
Arunachala Siva.

_**" Donât think that only sitting with the eyes closed is practice. If you  
do think this way, then quickly change your thinking. Steady practice is  
keeping mindful in every posture, whether sitting, walking, standing or lying  
down. When coming out of sitting, donât think that youâre coming out of  
meditation, but that you are only changing postures. If you reflect in this  
way, you will have peace. Wherever you are, you will have this attitude of  
practice with you constantly. You will have a steady awareness within  
yourself."**_

_ **" It is extremely hard to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, even  
for a moment, let alone to self-liberate a single thought or emotion as it  
rises. We often assume that simply because we understand something  
intellectually, - or think we do - we have actually realised it. This is a  
great delusion. It requires the maturity that only years of listening,  
contemplation, reflection, meditation, and sustained practice can ripen."**_

A wise old Zen master, very near death, lay quietly on his mat with his eyes  
closed, all his disciples gathered around. Kneeling closest to him was his  
number one disciple, a longtime practitioner who would succeed the old man as  
head of the monastery. At one point the old master opened his eyes, and  
lovingly gazed at each and every one of his disciples assembled in the crowded  
room. Finally his glance rested on his successor, and he managed to speak his  
last words to the man: ?Ah, my son, you have a very thorough knowledge of the  
teachings and scriptures, and you have shown great discipline in keeping the  
precepts. Your behavior has, in fact, been flawless. Yet there is one more  
thing remaining to be cleared up: you still reek and stink of ?Zen?!?

One day cguru was sitting under the banyan tree with one hand closed and  
another hand open.   
The disciple said: d: What does that closed hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to capture space.   
d: What does that open hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to release space.   
d: Were you able to capture space?   
cguru: Can space be captured?   
d: Were you able to release space?   
cguru: How can you release something which cannot be captured?   
d: Then?   
cguru: In the junction of this trying one discovers one's relationship with  
space.   
d: I did not understand.   
cguru: Don't say that. Say, did I not understand?   
d: Still it is confusing.   
cguru: Don't say that. Say, Is it not fusing?   
d: What?   
cguru: That.   
d: I find no point in pursuing this conversation.   
cguru: The best course therefore is to remain silent.

cguru: Why are you just sitting?

cguru: How?   
d: I am waiting for god to give me food. I am waiting for god to give me  
clothes. I am waiting for god to give me meditation.   
cguru: So what is your overall view?   
d: Everything is divine lila and we wait for god.   
cguru then moved to another disciple who was running about.   
cguru: Why are you running about?   
d: I am observing divine lila.   
cguru: How?   
d: I am running to give food to god (as puja offering). I am running to give  
clothes to god. I am running to give meditation to god.   
cguru: So what is your overall view?

silentgreen,   
you may like to be introduced to Swami Bananananda!   
Swami Bananananda lives in the high branches of the tallest mangrove tree in  
the Sunderbans Tiger Preserve of the Gangetic delta. He is considered to be a  
partial manifestation (less than 5% by weight) of Lord Rama's great devotee  
Hanumanji.   
Here is an excerpt from an article featuring our Swami bananandaji: Q: If you don't mind my asking, Swami, when did you first realize that you  
were an incarnation of Hanumanji?   
A: The first sign, I believe, appeared when I was about three years old. My  
grandfather used to wear a pair of glasses with bright shiny gold wire rims.  
One day I sneaked up behind him, jumped on his head, grabbed the glasses and  
scampered off to hide under the kitchen table. Then when I was about seven I  
took to climbing to the top of the dining room hutch and throwing peanut  
shells down into my aunt's plate of dal. A couple of years later during  
monsoon season I insisted on trying to jump over every puddle I saw in the  
road, no matter how big it might be. By then we had pretty much figured it  
out. If you dig deeply into our hole-y books, you'll find that all the signs  
and symptoms described for a manifestation were in evidence. But enough about  
me?it is merely a fiery monkey's tale. I thought you had some questions.   
Excerpted from 'Global Vedanta' magazine,Fall 2009 edition-Good articles are  
featured in this edition -Swami Damodarananda of R K Mutt reminiscing on his  
meeting with Sri Bhagavan and other articles.

Cguru:Is the world apart from your mind?   
D:No,it is not apart from my mind.   
Cguru:So,it is not outside of you!   
D:It seems that it is not outside of myself.   
Cguru:So you need to take into account only the two-yourself and God.   
D:Yes.   
Cguru:Are you in God or is God in you?   
D:!!!   
Cguru:God alone is.God alone has become the universe and all Living beings.

One day cguru was sitting under the banyan tree with one hand closed and  
another hand open.   
The disciple said: d: What does that closed hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to capture space.   
d: What does that open hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to release space.   
d: Were you able to capture space?   
cguru: Can space be captured?   
d: Were you able to release space?   
cguru: How can you release something which cannot be captured?   
d: Then?   
cguru: In the junction of this trying one discovers one's relationship with  
space.   
d: I did not understand.   
cguru: Don't say that. Say, did I not understand?

silentgreen,   
you may like to be introduced to Swami Bananananda!   
Swami Bananananda lives in the high branches of the tallest mangrove tree in  
the Sunderbans Tiger Preserve of the Gangetic delta. He is considered to be a  
partial manifestation (less than 5% by weight) of Lord Rama's great devotee  
Hanumanji.   
Here is an excerpt from an article featuring our Swami bananandaji: Q: If you don't mind my asking, Swami, when did you first realize that you  
were an incarnation of Hanumanji?   
A: The first sign, I believe, appeared when I was about three years old. My  
grandfather used to wear a pair of glasses with bright shiny gold wire rims.  
One day I sneaked up behind him, jumped on his head, grabbed the glasses and  
scampered off to hide under the kitchen table. Then when I was about seven I  
took to climbing to the top of the dining room hutch and throwing peanut  
shells down into my aunt's plate of dal. A couple of years later during  
monsoon season I insisted on trying to jump over every puddle I saw in the  
road, no matter how big it might be. By then we had pretty much figured it  
out. If you dig deeply into our hole-y books, you'll find that all the signs  
and symptoms described for a manifestation were in evidence. But enough about  
me?it is merely a fiery monkey's tale. I thought you had some questions.

Hearing of cguru, one day a man came to get a name for his baby girl. cguru  
was sitting under the banyan tree. A short trident was planted on the ground  
beside him.   
man: Maharaj, I came to get a name for my baby girl.   
cguru: (After some pause) There is a name.   
man: Maharaj, then please bestow that.   
cguru: (Looking at the trident) The name is not common.   
man: Maharaj, the girl is also not common. She is special, very beautiful and  
tender.   
cguru: (Running his hands over the vertical part of the trident) The name is  
not of this world.   
man: Maharaj, same is the case with the girl. Her parents love her so much  
that her feet does not touch this world.   
cguru: (Running his hands over the curved part of the trident) The name  
connects to place far off.   
man: Maharaj, same is the case with the girl. Her mother says that she feels a  
cord connect her with the baby. Her relatives say that they hear her anklets  
from their houses far off.   
cguru: (Now examining the sharpness of the trident) The name once taken must  
be given.   
man: Maharaj, that is why I came here from so far.   
cguru: (Looking upwards where the trident is pointing) This should be the only  
name.   
man: Maharaj, after getting a name from your holy being, what need is there  
for me for other names?   
... to be continued.

... continued   
cguru: Then receive the first part of the name.   
The man took some flowers on his palm and placed the palm reverentially before  
cguru. He saw the face of his baby girl on his palm; smiling and adorned with  
many small jewellery.   
cguru wrote the name and dropped it over his palm. Immediately the flowers  
flew off and got scattered over the ground. The man became confused with this  
omen and looked around. Then he looked at the name. The name written was  
"Mrityu".   
The man was shocked. He said: Did I come here to receive a name or a curse?  
Then pressing both his ears with his hands and chanting "Hari", "Hari", he  
turned away and started walking. Immediately the trident got uprooted  
automatically from the ground and started following the man in the sky over  
his head. Seeing the trident in the sky above his head the man was confounded.  
He increased the pace of his walk. But the trident did not leave him and  
continued to follow. The man felt that the trident will follow him till his  
house and then harm the girl. This is because he has not kept his promise of  
giving the name. He thought: Where has fate brought me today? What have I done  
to deserve this? And how can I give such a name to my girl and spoil her life?  
The only she must have.   
Being confounded by the turn of events, the man turned back and returned to  
cguru, as if by a force. His exuberance had died down. He thoughts have also  
subsided, and he was in a state of surrender to the fate.

The man returned to cguru and said: man: Maharaj, please bestow the full name.   
cguru wrote the full name and again dropped it on his palm. Now the flowers  
which flew off returned to his palm. The uprooted trident came back and got  
planted again. The man looked around and observed all this. His mind was not  
in a position to analyze things. He looked over the sky and looked at the  
ground. And finally looked at his palm. He saw the face of his baby girl.  
Beneath that was written the name - "Mrityunjayi".

Silentgreen,   
Cguru is always entertaining and educative...seems to have the flavour Of the  
Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna..ha ha...Half knowledge of anything  
leads to confusion and Fear.   
Strangely I received a Whats app message on the very same day...and am copying  
it here: Admin : Adding Laxmi to the group.   
Vivek : Hi Laxmi welcome to the group.   
Laxmi : Hi guys am new to the city   
Venu : Hi Laxmi dont worry, am there...any problems i will be the solution   
Rajan : Hi Laxmi.. tell me if you have any problem, will arrange a solution  
for u   
Vijay : Hi Laxmi, if you need anything tell me, it will be arranged.   
Ratan : Hi Laxmi mera bhai Hyderabad me hee hai, koi bhi problem ho i will  
manage it for you..   
Laxmi : Thanx guys for your support   
Ratan : Laxmi whats your full name..   
Laxmi : Laxminarayan Rao.   
Venu left   
Ratan left   
Vijay left   
Rajan left   
Admin left...

Hearing of cguru, one day a man came to get a name for his baby girl. cguru  
was sitting under the banyan tree. A short trident was planted on the ground  
beside him.   
man: Maharaj, I came to get a name for my baby girl.   
cguru: (After some pause) There is a name.   
man: Maharaj, then please bestow that.   
cguru: (Looking at the trident) The name is not common.   
man: Maharaj, the girl is also not common. She is special, very beautiful and  
tender.   
cguru: (Running his hands over the vertical part of the trident) The name is  
not of this world.   
man: Maharaj, same is the case with the girl. Her parents love her so much  
that her feet does not touch this world.   
cguru: (Running his hands over the curved part of the trident) The name  
connects to place far off.   
man: Maharaj, same is the case with the girl. Her mother says that she feels a  
cord connect her with the baby. Her relatives say that they hear her anklets  
from their houses far off.   
cguru: (Now examining the sharpness of the trident) The name once taken must  
be given.   
man: Maharaj, that is why I came here from so far.   
cguru: (Looking upwards where the trident is pointing) This should be the only  
name.   
man: Maharaj, after getting a name from your holy being, what need is there  
for me for other names?   
... to be continued.

... continued   
cguru: Then receive the first part of the name.   
The man took some flowers on his palm and placed the palm reverentially before  
cguru. He saw the face of his baby girl on his palm; smiling and adorned with  
many small jewellery.   
cguru wrote the name and dropped it over his palm. Immediately the flowers  
flew off and got scattered over the ground. The man became confused with this  
omen and looked around. Then he looked at the name. The name written was  
"Mrityu".   
The man was shocked. He said: Did I come here to receive a name or a curse?  
Then pressing both his ears with his hands and chanting "Hari", "Hari", he  
turned away and started walking. Immediately the trident got uprooted  
automatically from the ground and started following the man in the sky over  
his head. Seeing the trident in the sky above his head the man was confounded.  
He increased the pace of his walk. But the trident did not leave him and  
continued to follow. The man felt that the trident will follow him till his  
house and then harm the girl. This is because he has not kept his promise of  
giving the name. He thought: Where has fate brought me today? What have I done  
to deserve this? And how can I give such a name to my girl and spoil her life?  
The only she must have.   
Being confounded by the turn of events, the man turned back and returned to  
cguru, as if by a force. His exuberance had died down. He thoughts have also  
subsided, and he was in a state of surrender to the fate.

Cguru:Hmm...   
D:I am now convinced that God is within me.   
Cguru:So,are you sure that God is only within and not outside?   
D:Yes.   
Cguru:What is within and outside?   
D:'Within' means hidden behind 'my mind' and 'outside' means the 'world ' that  
i see and interact with in my waking state.   
Cguru:Is the world apart from your mind?   
D:No,it is not apart from my mind.   
Cguru:So,it is not outside of you!   
D:It seems that it is not outside of myself.   
Cguru:So you need to take into account only the two-yourself and God.

Cguru:Are you in God or is God in you?   
D:!!!

One day cguru was sitting under the banyan tree with one hand closed and  
another hand open.   
The disciple said: d: What does that closed hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to capture space.   
d: What does that open hand signify?   
cguru: I am trying to release space.   
d: Were you able to capture space?   
cguru: Can space be captured?   
d: Were you able to release space?   
cguru: How can you release something which cannot be captured?   
d: Then?   
cguru: In the junction of this trying one discovers one's relationship with  
space.   
d: I did not understand.   
cguru: Don't say that. Say, did I not understand?   
d: Still it is confusing.   
cguru: Don't say that. Say, Is it not fusing?   
d: What?   
cguru: That.   
d: I find no point in pursuing this conversation.   
cguru: The best course therefore is to remain silent.

cguru was moving around the banyan tree ashram to see the different types of  
disciples. He came across one disciple who was sitting under a tree.   
cguru: Why are you just sitting?   
d: I am observing divine lila.   
cguru: How?   
d: I am waiting for god to give me food. I am waiting for god to give me  
clothes. I am waiting for god to give me meditation.   
cguru: So what is your overall view?   
d: Everything is divine lila and we wait for god.   
cguru then moved to another disciple who was running about.   
cguru: Why are you running about?   
d: I am observing divine lila.   
cguru: How?   
d: I am running to give food to god (as puja offering). I am running to give  
clothes to god. I am running to give meditation to god.   
cguru: So what is your overall view?   
d: Everything is divine lila and god waits for us.

silentgreen,   
you may like to be introduced to Swami Bananananda!   
Swami Bananananda lives in the high branches of the tallest mangrove tree in  
the Sunderbans Tiger Preserve of the Gangetic delta. He is considered to be a  
partial manifestation (less than 5% by weight) of Lord Rama's great devotee  
Hanumanji.   
Here is an excerpt from an article featuring our Swami bananandaji: Q: If you don't mind my asking, Swami, when did you first realize that you  
were an incarnation of Hanumanji?   
A: The first sign, I believe, appeared when I was about three years old. My  
grandfather used to wear a pair of glasses with bright shiny gold wire rims.  
One day I sneaked up behind him, jumped on his head, grabbed the glasses and  
scampered off to hide under the kitchen table. Then when I was about seven I  
took to climbing to the top of the dining room hutch and throwing peanut  
shells down into my aunt's plate of dal. A couple of years later during  
monsoon season I insisted on trying to jump over every puddle I saw in the  
road, no matter how big it might be. By then we had pretty much figured it  
out. If you dig deeply into our hole-y books, you'll find that all the signs  
and symptoms described for a manifestation were in evidence. But enough about  
me?it is merely a fiery monkey's tale. I thought you had some questions.

cguru wrote the full name and again dropped it on his palm. Now the flowers

planted again. The man looked around and observed all this. His mind was not  
in a position to analyze things. He looked over the sky and looked at the  
ground. And finally looked at his palm. He saw the face of his baby girl.  
Beneath that was written the name - "Mrityunjayi".

Silentgreen,   
Cguru is always entertaining and educative...seems to have the flavour Of the  
Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna..ha ha...Half knowledge of anything  
leads to confusion and Fear.   
Strangely I received a Whats app message on the very same day...and am copying  
it here: Admin : Adding Laxmi to the group.   
Vivek : Hi Laxmi welcome to the group.   
Laxmi : Hi guys am new to the city   
Venu : Hi Laxmi dont worry, am there...any problems i will be the solution   
Rajan : Hi Laxmi.. tell me if you have any problem, will arrange a solution  
for u   
Vijay : Hi Laxmi, if you need anything tell me, it will be arranged.   
Ratan : Hi Laxmi mera bhai Hyderabad me hee hai, koi bhi problem ho i will  
manage it for you..   
Laxmi : Thanx guys for your support   
Ratan : Laxmi whats your full name..   
Laxmi : Laxminarayan Rao.   
Venu left   
Ratan left   
Vijay left   
Rajan left   
Admin left...   
Laxmi is the admin now!(Admin of the Whats App group and only member)

And listening to their sweet speech day in and day out;   
And bedecking their tresses with far lands diverse,   
Buzzing like striped bees   
Around the lotus of their breasts,   
Exulting in the tinkling music of their anklets   
Listening to it in earful cadences   
The nostrils inhaling the fragrance of the fine   
turmeric cosmetics,   
Kissing their feet and bearing them on the head   
\- Thus in deep passion steeped;   
Alternating between confusion and clarity   
Forgetting the heavenly goal entire;   
The tidal waves of Love-God swelling;   
Arunachala Siva.

He is the Beginning;   
He is the Beginningless;   
He is the Bliss;   
He is the Knowledge   
He is the Light;   
As a Silent One He appeared;   
And spoke a word unspeakable   
O, Maid! (Chorus) *[1]   
FootNotes: [1] Chorus: Sankara, Sankara, Sambhu, Siva, Sankara, Sankara, Sankara, Sambhu)   
What the word was   
I will say;   
In guile He called me apart,   
And in impassivity made me sit;   
And nothing whatever before me,   
He enveloped me in Bliss Perfect,   
And seized hold of me tight;   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
Giving up desires within   
That give self-attachment,   
He asked me to clutch at Him tight;   
And when I did so,   
How will I speak what I got?   
He spoke words hardly speakable ever;   
O Maid! (Chorus).   
Speaking evil words unspeakable,   
I went about raving   
Like a veritable devil's mate;   
He the Lord drove away the devil of desire   
And kept me guarded close under His Feet,   
O Maid! (Chorus)

56. Ananda Kalippu - continued: Detaching myself from the senses,   
I suppressed them,   
And fostered my love   
For the body that is He;   
And lo! He contained me entire within Him;   
And established the law that I should not speak.   
(Chorus)   
I broke the understanding   
And I was ruined;   
If I speak this out,   
No more is there life for me;   
A paramour He is not;   
He is the Supreme God   
That protects me,   
O, My Pet! (Chorus)   
Unto opening the flood-gates of the Ocean   
My twin eyes streamed in tears of joy;   
My body horripillated in ecstasy   
And my heart melted in love of Him;   
Towards such an end, He worked some trick.   
(Chorus)   
"Whatever your awareness knew,   
Whatever your heart saw,   
Truth and untruth,   
Discard all"   
Thus my Lord made me His own;   
See, how clever my Lord is!   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
My Lord, indeed, is dear unto His devotees   
He is Truth embodied;   
He is the Silent One of Bliss   
He is the Gracious Master Guru;   
He placed His Feet on my forehead;   
I knew myself   
And became dead to my mind. (Chorus)   
Thou art not the earth   
And the rest of elements;   
Think sharp;   
Thou art not the sense organs   
Internal or external;   
Thou art the Awareness   
That inquires;   
The loving words the Lord Said   
Art Bliss indeed;   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
When I think of it   
How this birth and death came to me,   
I realized,   
It is all by this wily mayaic mind,   
That alternates between remembering (1)   
and forgetting (2)   
(Chorus)   
FootNotes: [1] Sakala State   
[2] Kevala State   
Arunachala Siva.   
Into my mind as the Wild Banyan Tree,   
He came, the Silent Guru Divine;   
And with His hand gesture (of Cin Mudra)   
Erased my Karma entire;   
And in the sweet Waters of His Grace;   
He placed me;   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
Arunachala Siva.

56\. Ananda Kalippuj -Contd.,   
Into my mind as the Wild Banyan Tree,   
He came, the Silent Guru Divine;   
And with His hand gesture (of Cin Mudra)   
Erased my Karma entire;   
And in the sweet Waters of His Grace;   
He placed me;   
O, Maid! (Chorus).   
"See thou through the eyes of Grace", He said;   
Knowing not how to do it   
I saw through my knowledge, differentiated;   
And I saw nothing but darkness then;   
Even I, the seer, was not seen to be;   
How strange is all this!   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
"Think not 'I' and 'Thou' as Two;   
Stand as One in union inextricable"   
All these, He said in One Word;   
But how shall I describe the felicity   
That was of that Word born?   
(Chorus)   
The fertile land of Sivananda Bliss   
To that Vast Void I went;   
There I uprooted the evil weed of dark ignorance   
And then I looked round again;   
I saw nothing else   
But the Lord's beauty   
O, Maid! (Chorus)   
Laughable indeed is this life,   
For those who see;   
With our own eyes we saw people depart;   
Even in sleep life may ebb away;   
What use is there, what good is there in this?   
Speak thee, O Maid!   
(Chorus)   
Arunachala Siva.

56\. Ananda Kalippu - contd.,   
On me who knows good none,   
He bestowed His glance   
Of Nadanta Silentness Pure;   
And all agitation ceasing,   
The Omnipotent One placed   
His Feet on my head and blessed,   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
He, the goodly Bliss-Light,   
By His Grace He made me,   
Who is smaller than atom,   
Into the Perfection   
That knows no birth and death   
A miracle it is!   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
He creates, preserves and dissolves;   
All these He doth; and yet stands unwearied;   
What a doughty Being is He!   
Thy heart is the witness;   
Ask indeed of it to think;   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
There it was that thought was born;   
There it was that thought died;   
There it was that thought, purified, reawakened;   
There it was I saw the states all;   
There it was that I remained as one in Him.   
(Chorus)   
Is there anything as 'here' and 'there';   
When the Light of Truth-Knowledge-Bliss   
Rises to cosmic dimensions and fills everywhere;   
Is there anything to say: 'One' and 'Two'?   
(Chorus)   
Any day will this body perish;   
Why did thou hold it as real,   
Ye Men of the world?   
Can thou, who know so little,   
Have the answer to Death's summons   
When it doth arrive? (Chorus)   
Arunachala Siva.

56\. Ananda Kalippu -contd.,   
Are there any men   
Of self-deception like up?   
How can you hold this body real   
When it is so full of impurities?   
Should you not consider the Divine Form as real?   
(Chorus)   
Likes and dislikes arise   
From that compulsive impediment (birth and death)   
Life but shapes as the Creator Ordaines;   
Be in total quietude, impassive,   
Thy thoughts filled with Knowledge Supreme   
(Chorus)   
Is there no one to recognize me?   
In the body-land where none knows me   
Needless am I caught in the fire of lust,   
To lose my possessions heavenly;   
Is it for this I came?   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
Forgetting why I came,   
I was caught total   
In the allurement of women, gold and land;   
To cut this glittering fetter asunder,   
My Father granted me the Sword of Jnana True.   
(Chorus)   
Arunachala Siva.

56. Ananda Kalippu -contd.,   
The lust for women of sword-sharp eyes   
Will feed the fire of Death's ways in the body;   
It is realizing the truth of this   
That the God of Love himself gave up his body;   
If so, is it not proper for the goodly men to renounce?   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
All the expansive world of matter created   
Are unto the dew before the sun's rays pure;   
Thus do the Vedas and Agamas firm hold;   
Those who this respect are not of ways devious;   
Will they ever be of the Path Righteous?   
O, fawn-like Maid! (Chorus)   
Is there any, 'no' and 'yes'?   
If Bliss thou seek,   
Stand awhile as Knowledge True;   
Then wilt Thou know;   
Thus did the scriptural truth   
Our Primal One declare;   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
The allurements of evil women   
Are not for the men of pure mind, I say;   
The conduct of Janaka is an example high; (1)   
Is he not the man in the enjoyment   
Of Bliss Finale?   
(Chorus)   
FootNotes: [1] Janaka was a kind of Mithila, who is said to have been detached in his  
ways of life, He was involved and uninvolved in day to day things of royal  
life.   
Is there any, 'no' and 'yes'?   
If Bliss thou seek,   
Stand awhile as Knowledge True;   
Then wilt Thou know;   
Thus did the scriptural truth   
Our Primal One declare;   
O Maid! (Chorus)   
Tayumana Swamigal - composition concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.

**_Unto the spinning top at the end of the cord
