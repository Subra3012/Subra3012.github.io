## A Jesuit Father and Tiruvachakam

Several members of Christian missionary came to the then Madras   
Presidency during British rule and they started schools, established   
churches, opened hospitals etc., Many of them, started learning Tamil,  
primarily to communciate to the local people. In fact, Bible   
was translated into Tamil during this time. The Biblical Tamil is very  
delightful to read with a lot of Sanskritized Tamil words. Some of the Jesuit  
fathers showed interest in Tamil devotional literature. One such person took  
up Tiruvachakam. He was living in Tirunelveli, where Saiva Siddhantam first  
flourished in South. Soon he lost himself in Tiruvachakam and he was reading  
the book as regularly as he would read Bible. One Dr.G.U. Pope even  
translated Tiruvachakam in English blank verses, and this came in 1990! This  
Jesuit father found Saivism which speaks primarily of love for fellow beings,  
even animals, birds and plants, quite true and attractive as these are also  
said in Christian theology.   
He became quite sick in his old days. He was death bed. One morning, he  
asked his servant to bring Tiruvachakam and read the famous, Adaikala Pathu,  
verse 8, (The Decad of Surrender)   
which reads as: Maavadu vahiranna kaNNi panga, nin malar adike kooviduvay  
kumbikke iduvai....   
O the Consort of the woman, with eyes like cut-baby mango like eyes, You call  
me,   
To your lotus feet or place me in hell, I do not know Your Will,   
My heart is tossing like a shuttle in weaver's machine and is crying,   
O I will be lost, O Lord, this slave is in your surrender!   
Arunachala Siva.   
After listening to this verse, tears gushed from his eyes and he passed away!

What is there in labels like one is Christian or Hindu,what counts is devotion  
to the ultimate reality which is "one".The Jesuit father Pope is a blessed  
one.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Dr. G.U. Pope's English translation of Tiruvachakam, came in 1890.   
Even today, it is considered to be the best English translation in versified  
form on Tiruvachakam. Dr. Vanmika Nathan has also done   
a English verse translation and a Tamil prose translation.   
Arunachala Siva.
