Dear Ramanaduli,   
I think that confessions and prayer go hand in hand. Confession   
is of two kinds. One is speaking frankly about inability to do   
certain [good] things, and seeking through prayer God's help.   
The other type of confession to speaking to God frankly about   
our sins and errors and again imploring God's forgiveness.   
Both the categories go with prayers.   
Sri Bhagavan says about the first one in Verse 105 of Sri   
Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: May You live for ever, as the loving saviour of poor and helpless   
people like me, O Arunachala!   
The second one is mentioned in Verse 19 of Sri AAMM: O Arunachala, You stand and shine before me in the form of   
my Guru, destroy utterly my faults, cure me and convert me   
and as your servant govern me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Confession is often associated with a guilty feeling and emptying one's heart  
before God, confessing the guilt and asking for forgiveness. Prayer on the  
other hand is often used in a much broader sense to include remembrance of God  
also. So if a person does not have any guilty feelings, confession is not  
required; but a person can pray at all times. A person can pray even after  
self-realization to remember God, chant His name etc. So prayer has a more  
broader scope.

I don't know how you could measure these two things. Confession can be plenty  
"powerful" when someone has something bottled up inside and has tried to  
ignore it for years confessing it can be the first step to correcting it or  
releasing it. I think a lot of neuroses comes from people not facing their  
imperfections or past bad actions. The common idea is to blame the world for  
all your problems and never give an inch to recognizing your own  
imperfections... this discord gets worse and worse as it builds up. Confession  
can be a release valve.   
Prayer, as we all know can be powerful spiritual tool also, but it can be  
nothing more than constantly asking for things to when not understood  
correctly.   
The question seems like asking "Which is food: A sandwich or soup"?   
They both are.

Dear soham3,   
Yes. Kaivayla Navaneetam says that there are 7 stages of   
ignorance and 7 stages of knowledge, before liberation. The   
latter 7 are called mental states or planes of enlightenment.   
The eighth one is added later. Sri Bhagavan does not accept   
the eighth one.   
The 7 stages of ignorance: 1\. Brihat Jagrat - the germinal state of waking.   
2\. Jagrat - Waking state.   
3\. Maha Jagrat - the waking state firmly established.   
4\. Jagrat Svapna - day dreaming   
5\. Svapna - dreaming state   
6\. Svapna Jagrat - cogitation of the dream after waking up from it.   
7\. Sushupti - dreamless deep sleep.   
The 7 stages of knowledge or planes of enlightenment: 1\. Subeccha - desire for Truth   
2\. Vicharana - investigation into the Truth.   
3\. Tanumanasi - Pure and attenuated mind.   
4\. Sattvpatti - Realization of Truth.   
5\. Asamskti - a detached outlook on the universe and its contents.   
6\. Padarthabhavani - untained awareness of the Self.   
7\. Turiya - the highest and indescribable state.   
8\. Turiyatita \- actually it is a state after Videha Mukti, the state   
of liberation after disembodiment. But Bhagavan Ramana does not accept this  
since it cannot be established by a person living and   
explaining all these. There is nothing to speak of, says Sri   
Bhagavan.   
Arunachala Siva.

No. Sri Bhagavan did not say anything like that. How to be aware   
of Awareness? If I am a man, should I be always aware that I am a man? Even  
the state that 'I am' is natural to everyone.   
Arunachala Siva.
