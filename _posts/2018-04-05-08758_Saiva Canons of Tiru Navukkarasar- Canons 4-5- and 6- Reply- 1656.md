Verse 4: மின்னின் நேரிடை யாளுமை பங்கனைத்   
தன்னை நேரொப் பிலாத தலைவனைப்   
புன்னைக் கானற் பொழிற்புக லூரனை   
என்னு ளாகவைத் தின்புற் றிருப்பனே.   
Siva who has Uma who has a waist as flexible as the lightning, as a half, the  
chief who has nothing to be compared to him. I shall feel happy by placing the  
Lord in Pukalūr which has sea-shore gardens of mast-wood trees, in my heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
