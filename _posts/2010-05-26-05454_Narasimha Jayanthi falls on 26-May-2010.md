Ugram Viram Maha-Vishnum   
Jvalantam Sarvato Mukham   
Nrisimham Bhishanam Bhadram   
Mrityur Mrityum Namamy Aham   
 **" I bow down to the ferocious and heroic like Lord Vishnu. He is burning  
from every side. He protects us and is auspicious and the death of death  
personified."**   
 **The fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu amongst his ten  
prime avataras is Lord Narasimha who emerged out of a pillar as Man-Lion,  
i.e.,Lion 's head on Man's trunk. He devoured Demon-Lord Hiranyakashyapu who  
was Master Prahalada's father. When Prahalada was in the womb of his mother,  
Queen Kayaadu, he had the fortune of listening to Devarishi Naradha regarding  
Lord Vishnu's compassion towards his devotees. Hence right from his birth  
Prahalada was dedicated to the name of Lord Vishnu.**   
Hiranyakashyapu who was an arch rival of Lord Vishnu and a symbol of torture  
to noble souls, could not bear with his son and started torturing young  
Prahalada in many ways after trying through his henchmen to advice Prahalada  
that Hiranyakashyapu himself was the prime god and Lord Vishnu stood null in  
front of Hiranyakashyapu. Young Prahalada denounced such thoughts and stuck to  
his wisdom that Lord Vishnu was "Purushothama", the supreme. One day,  
Hiranyakashyapu screamed at Prahalada and questioned him as to where his Lord  
Vishnu was present and whether he could save Prahalada from death at his own  
hands.   
To this, Prahalada replied that Lord Vishnu is omnipresent. Hiranyakashyapu  
pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Vishnu was  
present in it. Prahalada's reply was affirmative. The Demon using his  
Gadha(Mace) broke open the pillar and there emerged **Lord Narasimha who slain  
the demon using his sharp paws and blessed Prahalad as his topmost devotee on  
earth.** To mark the above incidence and to pay our respect to the Lord,  
Narasimha Jayanthi is celebrated at several temples.   
 **Narasimha kavacham given here under may be chanted on this pious day.**   
Sri nrisimha kavacham   
nrisimha-kavacham vakshye,   
prahlaadenoditam puraa   
sarva-raksha-karam punyam,   
sarvopadrava-naashanam   
1\. I shall now recite the Narasimha-kavacha, formerly spoken by Prahlada  
Maharaja. It is most pious, vanquishes all kinds of impediments, and provides  
one all protection.   
sarva-sampat-karam chaiva,   
svarga-moksha-pradaayakama   
dhyaatvaa nrisinham devesham,   
hema-simhaasana-sthitam   
2\. It bestows upon one all opulences and can give one elevation to the  
heavenly planets or liberation. One should meditate on Lord Narasimha, Lord of  
the universe, seated upon a golden throne.   
vivritaasyam trinayanam,   
sharad-indu-sama-prabham   
lakshmy aalingita-vaamaangam,   
vibhuutibhir-upaashritam   
3\. His mouth is wide open, He has three eyes, and He is as radiant as the  
autumn moon. He is embraced by Lakshmi devi on his left side, and His form is  
the shelter of all opulences, both material and spiritual.   
chatur-bhujam komalaangam,   
svarna-kundala-shobhitam   
saroja-shobitoraskam,   
ratna-keyuura-mudritam   
4\. The Lord has four arms, and His limbs are very soft. He is decorated with  
golden earrings. His chest is resplendent like the lotus flower, and His arms  
are decorated with jewel-studded ornaments.   
tapta-kaajnchana-sankaasham,   
piita-nirmala-vaasasam   
indraadi-sura-mauli-sthah,   
sphuran maanikya-diiptibhih   
5\. He is dressed in a spotless yellow garment, which exactly resembles molten  
gold. He is the original cause of existence, beyond the mundane sphere, for  
the great demigods headed by Indra. He appears bedecked with rubies which are  
blazingly effulgent.   
viraajita-paada-dvandvam,   
sankha-chakraadi hetibhih   
garutmataa cha vinayaat,   
stuuyamaanam mudaanvitam   
6\. His two feet are very attractive, and He is armed with various weapons  
such as the conch, disc, etc. GaruDa joyfully offers prayers with great  
reverence.   
sva-hrit-kamala-samvaasam,   
kritvaa tu kavacham pathet   
7\. Having seated Lord Narasimhadeva upon the lotus of one's heart, one should  
recite the following mantra: =====================================================   
Om nrisimho me shirah paatu,   
loka-rakshaartha-sambhavah   
sarva-go 'pi stambha-vaasah,   
phalam me rakshatu dhvanim   
nrisimho me drishau paatu,   
soma-suuryaagni-lochanah   
8\. May Lord Narasimha, who protects all the planetary systems, protect my  
head. 9. Although the Lord is all-pervading, He hid Himself within a pillar.  
May He protect my speech and the results of my activities. May Lord Narasimha,  
whose eyes are the sun, and fire, protect my eyes.   
smitam me paatu nriharih,   
muni-varya-stuti-priyah   
naasam me sinha-naashas tu,   
mukham lakshmii-mukha-priyah   
10\. May Lord Nrihari, who is pleased by the prayers offered by the best of  
sages, protect my memory. May He who has the nose of a lion protect my nose,  
and may He whose face is very dear to the goddess of fortune protect my mouth.   
sarva-vidyaadhipah paatu,   
nrisinho rasanam mama   
vaktram paatv indu-vadanam,   
sadaa prahlaada-vanditah   
11\. May Lord Narasimha, who is the knower of all sciences, protect my sense  
of taste. May He whose face is beautiful as the full moon and who is offered  
prayers by Prahlaada Mahaaraaja protect my face.   
nrisimhah paatu me kantham,   
skandhau bhuubhrid ananta-krit   
divyaastra-shobhita-bhujo,   
nrisimhah paatu me bhujau   
12\. May Lord Narasimha protect my throat. He is the sustainer of the earth  
and the performer of unlimitedly wonderful activities. May He protect my  
shoulders. His arms are resplendent with transcendental weapons. May He  
protect my shoulders.   
karau me deva-varado,   
nrisimhah paatu sarvatah   
hridayam yogi-saadhyash cha,   
nivaasam paatu me harih   
13\. May the Lord, who bestows benedictions upon the demigods, protect my  
hands, and may He protect me from all sides. May He who is achieved by the  
perfect yogis protect my heart, and may Lord Hari protect my dwelling place.   
madhyam paatu hiranyaaksha,   
vaksha-hkukshi-vidaaranah   
naabhim me paatu nriharih,   
sva-naabhi-brahma-sanstutah   
14\. May He who ripped apart the chest and abdomen of the great demon  
HiraNyaaksha protect my waist, and may Lord Nrihari protect my navel. He is  
offered prayers by Lord Brahmaa, who has sprung from his own navel.   
brahmanda-kotayah katyaam,   
yasyaasau paatu me katim   
guhyam me paatu guhyaanaam,   
mantraanaam guhya-ruupa-drik   
15\. May He on whose hips rest all the universes protect my hips. May the Lord  
protect my private parts. He is the knower of all mantras and all mysteries,  
but He Himself is not visible.   
uuruu mano-bhavah paatu,   
jaanunii nara-ruupa-drik   
janghe paatu dharaa-bhara,   
hartaa yo 'sau nrikesharii   
16\. May He who is the original Cupid protect my thighs. May He who exhibits a  
human-like form protect my knees. May the remover of the burden of the earth,  
who appears in a form which is half-man and half-lion, protect my calves.   
sura-raajya-pradah paatu,   
paadau me nrihariishvarah   
sahasra-shiirshaa-purushah,   
paatu me sarvashas tanum   
17\. May the bestower of heavenly opulence protect my feet. He is the Supreme  
Controller in the form of a man and lion combined. May the thousand-headed  
Supreme enjoyer protect my body from all sides and in all respects.   
mahograh puurvatah paatu,   
mahaa-viiraagrajo 'gnitah   
mahaa-vishhnur dakshine tu,   
mahaa-jvalas tu nairritah   
18\. May that most ferocious personality protect me from the east. May He who  
is superior to the greatest heroes protect me from the southeast, which is  
presided over by Agni. May the Supreme Vishnu protect me from the south, and  
may that person of blazing luster protect me from the southwest.   
pashchime paatu sarvesho,   
dishi me sarvato mukhah   
nrisimhah paatu vaayavyaam,   
saumyaam bhuushana-vigrahah   
19\. May the Lord of everything protect me from the west. His faces are  
everywhere, so please may He protect me from this direction. May Lord  
Narasimha protect me from the northwest, which is predominated by Vaayu, and  
may He whose form is in itself the supreme ornament protect me from the north,  
where Soma resides.   
iishanyam paatu bhadro me,   
sarva-mangala-daayakah   
samsaara-bhayatah paatu,   
mrityor mrityur nri-kesharii   
20\. May the all-auspicious Lord, who Himself bestows all-auspiciousness,  
protect from the northeast, the direction of the sun-god, and may He who is  
death personified protect me from fear of death and rotation in this material  
world.   
idam nrisinha-kavacham,   
prahlaada-mukha-manditam   
bhaktimaan yah pathen nityam,   
sarva-paapaih pramuchyate   
21\. This Narasimha-kavacha has been ornamented by issuing from the mouth of  
Prahlaada Mahaaraaja. A devotee who reads this becomes freed from all sins.   
putravaan dhanavaan loke,   
diirghaayur upajaayate   
yam yam kaamayate kaamam,   
tam tam praapnoty asanshayam   
22\. Whatever one desires in this world he can attain without doubt. One can  
have wealth, many sons, and a long life.   
sarvatra jayam aapnoti,   
sarvatra vijayii bhavet   
bhuumy antariiksha divyaanaam,   
grahaanaam vinivaaranam   
23\. He becomes victorious who desires victory, and indeed becomes a  
conqueror. He wards off the influence of all planets, earthly, heavenly, and  
everything in between.   
vrishchikoraga-sambhuuta,   
vishhaapaharanam param   
brahma-raakshasa-yakshaanaam,   
duurotsaarana-kaaranam   
24\. This is the supreme remedy for the poisonous effects of serpents and  
scorpions, and Brahma-raakshasa ghosts and Yakshas are driven away.   
bhuurje vaa taala-patre vaa,   
kavacham likhitam shubham   
karamuule dhritam yena,   
sidhyeyuh karma-siddhayah   
devaasura-manushyeshu,   
svam svam eva jayam labhet   
25\. If this most auspicious prayer is written either on a bhoja-patra or on a  
palm-leaf and if one attaches it to his wrist, all his activities will become  
perfect. He becomes victorious whether among demigods, demons, or human  
beings.   
eka-sandhyam tri-sandhyam vaa,   
yah pathen niyato narah   
sarva-mangala-maangalyam,   
bhuktim muktim cha vindati   
26\. One who regularly chants this prayer, whether once or thrice (daily), he  
attains the most auspicious of all auspicious things, and material enjoyment  
and liberation are already understood to be available to such a person.   
dvaa-trinshati-sahasraani,   
pathet shuddhaatmanaam nrinaam   
kavachasyaasya mantrasya,   
mantra-siddhih prajaayate   
27\. One who with purified heart recites this prayer 32,000 times, achieves  
the (mantra-siddhi) perfection of this Nrisimha-kavacha mantra.   
anena mantra-raajena,   
kritvaa bhasmaabhi-mantranam   
tilakam vinyased yas tu,   
tasya graha-bhayam haret   
28\. One who marks his body with the tilak of ashes after having empowered by  
the chanting of this mantra-raja, the king of all mantras, will find that the  
fear of all inauspicious planets is removed.   
tri-vaaram japamaanas tu,   
dattam vaary abhimantrya cha   
prashayed yo naro mantram,   
nrisinha-dhyaanam aacharet   
tasya rogah pranashyanti,   
ye cha syuh kukshi-sambhavaah   
29\. If a sick person drinks a cup of water which is sanctified by reciting  
this mantra three times, while meditating upon Lord Narasimhadeva, has all of  
his diseases vanquished, including those of the abdomen.   
garjantam gaarjayantam nija-bhuja-patalam sphotayantam hatantam   
ruupyantam taapayantam divi bhuvi ditijam kshepayantam kshipantam   
krandantam roshhayantam dishi dishi satatam samharantam bharantam   
viikshantam puurnayantam kara-nikara-shatair divya-simham namaami   
30\. Lord Narasimha roars loudly and causes others to roar. With His  
multitudes of arms He tears the demons asunder and kills them in this way. He  
is always seeking out and tormenting the demonic descendants of Diti, both on  
this earth planet and in the higher planets, and Hs throws them down and  
scatters them. He cries with great anger as He destroys the demons in all  
directions, yet with His unlimited hands He sustains, protects, and nourishes  
the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, who  
has assumed the form of a transcendental lion.

## Re:[1] Narasimha Jayanthi falls on 26-May-2010  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 28, 2010, 10:15:06 AM

Dear prasanth,   
1\. I am very glad you have taken pains to write this long poem   
with English rendering. If I am correct, it is called Nrisimha   
Mantra Raja Stavam. This is supposed to be the king of mantras,   
for overcoming obstacles and miseries and debts. There is also   
a Runa Vimochana Lakshmi Nrisimha Stotram and also Sri Sankaras   
Sri Lakshmi Nrisimha Karavalamba Stotram. All are ensuring results   
if chanted with great devotion. The first verse, you have quoted   
is called Nrisimha Gayatri. Ugram veeram mahavishnum... This   
can also be chanted as a penance for a fixed number of days. He   
is like Siva, the Effulgence, the Jvalantam. He the remover of   
fears and anxieties.   
2. Nrisimha avatara was only for a short while. He appeared from the pillar, in an evening, which was neither day nor light, tore the demon Hiranyakashyap into pieces, and then disappeared swiftly!   
3. There is no reference to Nrisimha in Srimad Valmiki Ramayanam.   
However, Kamban, the Tamil poet who was a great devotee of   
Nrisimha included one sargam in his Kamba Ramayanam about   
Nrisimha Avataram. The Tamil Kamba Ramayanam, dated early   
10th century A.D. was first read in Sri Rangam Temple in the presence of one  
Chola King. When Kamban was reading the Nrisimha avatara sargam, the poet  
read: That ferocious Lion   
roared and laughed.... Immediately, one lion image on the pillar   
in that Hall, roared and laughed. The listeners including the King   
became surprised and also were afraid! Even today you can see   
that Lion image in Sri Rangam Temple.   
4\. Swami Vedanta Desikan wrote: When Prahlada said that the Narayana would  
appear in any place, anytime, the demon king   
retored: Even from the pillar. Prahlada said: Yes. From Pillar.   
Any Pillar that you want! At this juncture, it was Narayana who became the  
most anxious of the three. He was hiding in all the   
1000 pillars of the Hall, because the demon king may hit any one of the  
pillars! Swami Desikan humorously put it: You are the one who kept 1000  
mothers ready to take birth! ( Each pillar was a mother to give birth to  
Nrisimha!).   
5\. Nrisimha's ferocity is said to have been doused by Siva, as   
Sri Sarabheswara, the form of Bird and Tiger, and with its wide wings hugged  
the Nrisimha to quell his anger. There is one   
Sri Sarabheswara Temple near Kumbakonam, in a semi urban town called  
Tiruvidaimaruthur (or Tribhuvanam?) in Tamil Nadu.   
Thanks once again for your painstaking and quite useful post.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi's selected verses of Bhagavad Gita  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 30, 2010, 09:53:28 AM  
---  
Bhagavan was speaking once with a visiting pandit about the great merits of  
the Bhagavad Gita, when a devotee complained that it was difficult to keep all  
the seven hundred verses in mind and asked if there was not one verse that  
could be remembered as the quintessence of the Gita. **Bhagavan thereupon  
mentioned Chapter X, verse 20: I am the Self, Oh Gudakesa, dwelling in the  
Heart of every being; I am the beginning and the middle and also the end of  
all beings.** Later he selected forty-two verses that here follow (of which  
that quoted above comes fourth) and arranged them in an appropriate order to  
serve as guidance. He also prepared Tamil and Malayalam versions of these  
verses.   
Said Sanjaya: 1\. Despondent, overwhelmed with compassion (as he sat), his troubled eyes  
filled with tears, Krishna, the slayer of Madhu spoke to him. ii: 1   
Sri Bhagavan said: 2\. This body, O Son of Kunti,1 is known as the field; and he who is aware of  
it is called the Knower of the Field by the wise. xiii:1   
3\. And know that I am the Knower of the Field in all the fields, O Bharata.  
The knowledge of the field and the knower of that, in my opinion, is true  
knowledge. xiii:2   
4\. I am the Self, O Gudakesa, dwelling in the Hearts of all beings. I am the  
beginning and the middle and the end of all beings. x:20   
5\. For to him who is born death is indeed certain, and to him who dies birth  
is certain. Therefore you should not grieve for the inevitable. ii:27   
6\. That is not born, nor does It ever die; nor, having been,does It ever  
cease to be. That unborn, eternal, abiding, primeval Being is not slain when  
the body is slain. ii:20   
7\. Invulnerable He is, not to be burnt, not to be drenched or dried. He is  
eternal, all pervading, changeless, motionless, enduring. ii:24   
8\. Know that which pervades all this to be indestructible. That immutable  
none can destroy. ii:27   
9\. The unreal has no being, the Real no non-being. These two facts the Truth-  
seers perceive. ii:16   
10\. Just as the all pervading ether, being subtle, is not affected, (tainted  
or contaminated by anything), even so, the Self pervading the whole body is  
not tainted. xiii:33   
11\. Neither sun, nor moon, nor fire illumine this state on attaining which  
one does not return. And this is My supreme abode. xv:6   
12\. This Supreme State is called the Unmanifest Imperishable (avyakto  
akshara). That is My highest abode.   
For those who attain to It, there is no return. viii:21   
13\. The undeluded, those who are free from pride and ignorance, who have  
overcome the evil of attachment, who are ever devoted to the Self, who have  
turned away from desires and are entirely beyond the dualities of pleasure and  
pain, attain that imperishable state. xv:5   
14\. He who abandons the injunctions of the scriptures and behaves according  
to the impulses of his desires, attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor  
the highest state of salvation. xvi:23   
15\. He who sees the Supreme Lord, residing equally in all beings  the  
Imperishable One among the perishables  sees (truly). xiii:27   
16\. Only by unswerving devotion can I be known and truly seen in this form,  
Arjuna, and even be entered into, O tormentor of the foe. xi:54   
17\. The faith of everyone is according to his nature, O Bharata. Man is  
essentially endowed with faith. What his faith is, that indeed is he. xvii:3   
18\. One who has faith and concentration and has subdued his senses attains  
knowledge. Having gained knowledge he speedily attains Supreme Peace. iv:39   
19\. To them ever steadfast in loving worship, I give the yoga of  
understanding by which they attain to Me. x:10   
20\. Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their Heart,destroy the  
darkness born of ignorance with the effulgent light of knowledge. x:11   
21\. But in those whose unwisdom is destroyed by wisdom, that wisdom like the  
Sun, reveals the Supreme   
(Param). v:16   
22\. Mighty, they say, are the senses, mightier than these, the mind, mightier  
than that the intellect, but mightier still is He. iii:42   
23\. Thus knowing Him who is beyond the intellect,O mighty in arms, control  
your self by the Self and slay the enemy in the form of desire, hard though it  
may be. iii:43   
24\. As a well lit fire consumes its fuel, Arjuna, so does the fire of  
knowledge reduce all activity to ashes. iv:37   
25\. One whose undertakings are all free from desire and whose activity has  
been purified in the flame of wisdom is termed a sage by those who know. iv: 19   
26\. Brahma Nirvana lies around those who have freed themselves from anger and  
desire, who have subdued their minds and have known the Self. v:26   
27\. One should gradually, gradually attain quietude with the intellect  
(buddhi) held steadfast and the mind sunk in the Self, allowing no thought to  
arise. vi:25   
28\. To whatever side the restless, unsteady mind wanders away, one should  
check it and bring it back controlled to the Self. vi:26   
29\. With the senses, mind and intellect subdued, the saint who devoutly seeks  
liberation, without desire, fear or wrath  he is indeed ever liberated. v:28   
30\. One who is thus integrated in yoga (yoga yuktatma) sees all with an equal  
eye, seeing himself in all beings and all beings in himself. vi:29   
31\. To those, however, who dwell on Me in single minded worship I guarantee  
fulfilment of their needs and security. ix:22   
32\. The foremost of these is the wise one (jnani) who is ever steadfast and  
devoted to the One. Very dear am I to the wise man and he to Me. vii: 17   
33\. At the end of many births the man of wisdom comes to Me, realising that  
Vasudeva is all. Such a great soul is very rare to find. vii: 19   
34\. When a man casts out all desires of the mind, O son of Pritha, and is  
content in himself he is said to be steadfast in wisdom. ii:35   
35\. He attains peace who abandons all desires, acting without attachment,  
free from I and mine. ii:71   
36\. He by whom the world is not afflicted and who is not afflicted by the  
world, who is free from pleasure, anger, fear and anxiety  he is dear to Me.  
xii: 15   
37\. The same in honour and dishonour, towards friends and foes; he who  
abandons the initiative in all undertakings, is called one beyond qualities.  
xiv:25   
38\. For him, however, who rejoices only in the Self, is gratified with the  
Self and content with the Self, no action is incumbent. iii: 17   
39\. He has nothing to gain by actions done or to lose by those undone. He is  
not dependent on anyone for the achievement of any object. iii:18   
40\. Satisfied with what comes to him by chance, beyond the pairs of  
opposites, free from envy, equal in success and failure, he is not bound by  
his actions. iv:22   
41\. The Lord resides in the Hearts of all, O Arjuna,revolving all creatures  
by prakriti as if mounted on a machine. xviii:61   
42\. Surrender unto Him with all your heart, O Bharata.Through His grace you  
will attain Supreme peace and the perennial abode. xviii:62

Ugram Viram Maha-Vishnum   
Jvalantam Sarvato Mukham   
Nrisimham Bhishanam Bhadram   
Mrityur Mrityum Namamy Aham   
 **" I bow down to the ferocious and heroic like Lord Vishnu. He is burning  
from every side. He protects us and is auspicious and the death of death  
personified."**   
 **The fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu amongst his ten  
prime avataras is Lord Narasimha who emerged out of a pillar as Man-Lion,  
i.e.,Lion 's head on Man's trunk. He devoured Demon-Lord Hiranyakashyapu who  
was Master Prahalada's father. When Prahalada was in the womb of his mother,  
Queen Kayaadu, he had the fortune of listening to Devarishi Naradha regarding  
Lord Vishnu's compassion towards his devotees. Hence right from his birth  
Prahalada was dedicated to the name of Lord Vishnu.**   
Hiranyakashyapu who was an arch rival of Lord Vishnu and a symbol of torture  
to noble souls, could not bear with his son and started torturing young  
Prahalada in many ways after trying through his henchmen to advice Prahalada  
that Hiranyakashyapu himself was the prime god and Lord Vishnu stood null in  
front of Hiranyakashyapu. Young Prahalada denounced such thoughts and stuck to  
his wisdom that Lord Vishnu was "Purushothama", the supreme. One day,  
Hiranyakashyapu screamed at Prahalada and questioned him as to where his Lord  
Vishnu was present and whether he could save Prahalada from death at his own  
hands.   
To this, Prahalada replied that Lord Vishnu is omnipresent. Hiranyakashyapu  
pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Vishnu was  
present in it. Prahalada's reply was affirmative. The Demon using his  
Gadha(Mace) broke open the pillar and there emerged **Lord Narasimha who slain  
the demon using his sharp paws and blessed Prahalad as his topmost devotee on  
earth.** To mark the above incidence and to pay our respect to the Lord,  
Narasimha Jayanthi is celebrated at several temples.   
 **Narasimha kavacham given here under may be chanted on this pious day.**   
Sri nrisimha kavacham   
nrisimha-kavacham vakshye,   
prahlaadenoditam puraa   
sarva-raksha-karam punyam,   
sarvopadrava-naashanam   
1\. I shall now recite the Narasimha-kavacha, formerly spoken by Prahlada  
Maharaja. It is most pious, vanquishes all kinds of impediments, and provides  
one all protection.   
sarva-sampat-karam chaiva,   
svarga-moksha-pradaayakama   
dhyaatvaa nrisinham devesham,   
hema-simhaasana-sthitam   
2\. It bestows upon one all opulences and can give one elevation to the  
heavenly planets or liberation. One should meditate on Lord Narasimha, Lord of  
the universe, seated upon a golden throne.   
vivritaasyam trinayanam,   
sharad-indu-sama-prabham   
lakshmy aalingita-vaamaangam,   
vibhuutibhir-upaashritam   
3\. His mouth is wide open, He has three eyes, and He is as radiant as the  
autumn moon. He is embraced by Lakshmi devi on his left side, and His form is  
the shelter of all opulences, both material and spiritual.   
chatur-bhujam komalaangam,   
svarna-kundala-shobhitam   
saroja-shobitoraskam,   
ratna-keyuura-mudritam   
4\. The Lord has four arms, and His limbs are very soft. He is decorated with  
golden earrings. His chest is resplendent like the lotus flower, and His arms  
are decorated with jewel-studded ornaments.   
tapta-kaajnchana-sankaasham,   
piita-nirmala-vaasasam   
indraadi-sura-mauli-sthah,   
sphuran maanikya-diiptibhih   
5\. He is dressed in a spotless yellow garment, which exactly resembles molten  
gold. He is the original cause of existence, beyond the mundane sphere, for  
the great demigods headed by Indra. He appears bedecked with rubies which are  
blazingly effulgent.   
viraajita-paada-dvandvam,   
sankha-chakraadi hetibhih   
garutmataa cha vinayaat,   
stuuyamaanam mudaanvitam   
6\. His two feet are very attractive, and He is armed with various weapons  
such as the conch, disc, etc. GaruDa joyfully offers prayers with great  
reverence.   
sva-hrit-kamala-samvaasam,   
kritvaa tu kavacham pathet   
7\. Having seated Lord Narasimhadeva upon the lotus of one's heart, one should  
recite the following mantra: =====================================================   
Om nrisimho me shirah paatu,   
loka-rakshaartha-sambhavah   
sarva-go 'pi stambha-vaasah,   
phalam me rakshatu dhvanim   
nrisimho me drishau paatu,   
soma-suuryaagni-lochanah   
8\. May Lord Narasimha, who protects all the planetary systems, protect my  
head. 9. Although the Lord is all-pervading, He hid Himself within a pillar.  
May He protect my speech and the results of my activities. May Lord Narasimha,  
whose eyes are the sun, and fire, protect my eyes.   
smitam me paatu nriharih,   
muni-varya-stuti-priyah   
naasam me sinha-naashas tu,   
mukham lakshmii-mukha-priyah   
10\. May Lord Nrihari, who is pleased by the prayers offered by the best of  
sages, protect my memory. May He who has the nose of a lion protect my nose,  
and may He whose face is very dear to the goddess of fortune protect my mouth.   
sarva-vidyaadhipah paatu,   
nrisinho rasanam mama   
vaktram paatv indu-vadanam,   
sadaa prahlaada-vanditah   
11\. May Lord Narasimha, who is the knower of all sciences, protect my sense  
of taste. May He whose face is beautiful as the full moon and who is offered  
prayers by Prahlaada Mahaaraaja protect my face.   
nrisimhah paatu me kantham,   
skandhau bhuubhrid ananta-krit   
divyaastra-shobhita-bhujo,   
nrisimhah paatu me bhujau   
12\. May Lord Narasimha protect my throat. He is the sustainer of the earth  
and the performer of unlimitedly wonderful activities. May He protect my  
shoulders. His arms are resplendent with transcendental weapons. May He  
protect my shoulders.   
karau me deva-varado,   
nrisimhah paatu sarvatah   
hridayam yogi-saadhyash cha,   
nivaasam paatu me harih   
13\. May the Lord, who bestows benedictions upon the demigods, protect my  
hands, and may He protect me from all sides. May He who is achieved by the  
perfect yogis protect my heart, and may Lord Hari protect my dwelling place.   
madhyam paatu hiranyaaksha,   
vaksha-hkukshi-vidaaranah   
naabhim me paatu nriharih,   
sva-naabhi-brahma-sanstutah   
14\. May He who ripped apart the chest and abdomen of the great demon  
HiraNyaaksha protect my waist, and may Lord Nrihari protect my navel. He is  
offered prayers by Lord Brahmaa, who has sprung from his own navel.   
brahmanda-kotayah katyaam,   
yasyaasau paatu me katim   
guhyam me paatu guhyaanaam,   
mantraanaam guhya-ruupa-drik   
15\. May He on whose hips rest all the universes protect my hips. May the Lord  
protect my private parts. He is the knower of all mantras and all mysteries,  
but He Himself is not visible.   
uuruu mano-bhavah paatu,   
jaanunii nara-ruupa-drik   
janghe paatu dharaa-bhara,   
hartaa yo 'sau nrikesharii   
16\. May He who is the original Cupid protect my thighs. May He who exhibits a  
human-like form protect my knees. May the remover of the burden of the earth,  
who appears in a form which is half-man and half-lion, protect my calves.   
sura-raajya-pradah paatu,   
paadau me nrihariishvarah   
sahasra-shiirshaa-purushah,   
paatu me sarvashas tanum   
17\. May the bestower of heavenly opulence protect my feet. He is the Supreme  
Controller in the form of a man and lion combined. May the thousand-headed  
Supreme enjoyer protect my body from all sides and in all respects.   
mahograh puurvatah paatu,   
mahaa-viiraagrajo 'gnitah   
mahaa-vishhnur dakshine tu,   
mahaa-jvalas tu nairritah   
18\. May that most ferocious personality protect me from the east. May He who  
is superior to the greatest heroes protect me from the southeast, which is  
presided over by Agni. May the Supreme Vishnu protect me from the south, and  
may that person of blazing luster protect me from the southwest.   
pashchime paatu sarvesho,   
dishi me sarvato mukhah   
nrisimhah paatu vaayavyaam,   
saumyaam bhuushana-vigrahah   
19\. May the Lord of everything protect me from the west. His faces are  
everywhere, so please may He protect me from this direction. May Lord  
Narasimha protect me from the northwest, which is predominated by Vaayu, and  
may He whose form is in itself the supreme ornament protect me from the north,  
where Soma resides.   
iishanyam paatu bhadro me,   
sarva-mangala-daayakah   
samsaara-bhayatah paatu,   
mrityor mrityur nri-kesharii   
20\. May the all-auspicious Lord, who Himself bestows all-auspiciousness,  
protect from the northeast, the direction of the sun-god, and may He who is  
death personified protect me from fear of death and rotation in this material  
world.   
idam nrisinha-kavacham,   
prahlaada-mukha-manditam   
bhaktimaan yah pathen nityam,   
sarva-paapaih pramuchyate   
21\. This Narasimha-kavacha has been ornamented by issuing from the mouth of  
Prahlaada Mahaaraaja. A devotee who reads this becomes freed from all sins.   
putravaan dhanavaan loke,   
diirghaayur upajaayate   
yam yam kaamayate kaamam,   
tam tam praapnoty asanshayam   
22\. Whatever one desires in this world he can attain without doubt. One can  
have wealth, many sons, and a long life.   
sarvatra jayam aapnoti,   
sarvatra vijayii bhavet   
bhuumy antariiksha divyaanaam,   
grahaanaam vinivaaranam   
23\. He becomes victorious who desires victory, and indeed becomes a  
conqueror. He wards off the influence of all planets, earthly, heavenly, and  
everything in between.   
vrishchikoraga-sambhuuta,   
vishhaapaharanam param   
brahma-raakshasa-yakshaanaam,   
duurotsaarana-kaaranam   
24\. This is the supreme remedy for the poisonous effects of serpents and  
scorpions, and Brahma-raakshasa ghosts and Yakshas are driven away.   
bhuurje vaa taala-patre vaa,   
kavacham likhitam shubham   
karamuule dhritam yena,   
sidhyeyuh karma-siddhayah   
devaasura-manushyeshu,   
svam svam eva jayam labhet   
25\. If this most auspicious prayer is written either on a bhoja-patra or on a  
palm-leaf and if one attaches it to his wrist, all his activities will become  
perfect. He becomes victorious whether among demigods, demons, or human  
beings.   
eka-sandhyam tri-sandhyam vaa,   
yah pathen niyato narah   
sarva-mangala-maangalyam,   
bhuktim muktim cha vindati   
26\. One who regularly chants this prayer, whether once or thrice (daily), he  
attains the most auspicious of all auspicious things, and material enjoyment  
and liberation are already understood to be available to such a person.   
dvaa-trinshati-sahasraani,   
pathet shuddhaatmanaam nrinaam   
kavachasyaasya mantrasya,   
mantra-siddhih prajaayate   
27\. One who with purified heart recites this prayer 32,000 times, achieves  
the (mantra-siddhi) perfection of this Nrisimha-kavacha mantra.   
anena mantra-raajena,   
kritvaa bhasmaabhi-mantranam   
tilakam vinyased yas tu,   
tasya graha-bhayam haret   
28\. One who marks his body with the tilak of ashes after having empowered by  
the chanting of this mantra-raja, the king of all mantras, will find that the  
fear of all inauspicious planets is removed.   
tri-vaaram japamaanas tu,   
dattam vaary abhimantrya cha   
prashayed yo naro mantram,   
nrisinha-dhyaanam aacharet   
tasya rogah pranashyanti,   
ye cha syuh kukshi-sambhavaah   
29\. If a sick person drinks a cup of water which is sanctified by reciting  
this mantra three times, while meditating upon Lord Narasimhadeva, has all of  
his diseases vanquished, including those of the abdomen.   
garjantam gaarjayantam nija-bhuja-patalam sphotayantam hatantam   
ruupyantam taapayantam divi bhuvi ditijam kshepayantam kshipantam   
krandantam roshhayantam dishi dishi satatam samharantam bharantam   
viikshantam puurnayantam kara-nikara-shatair divya-simham namaami   
30\. Lord Narasimha roars loudly and causes others to roar. With His  
multitudes of arms He tears the demons asunder and kills them in this way. He  
is always seeking out and tormenting the demonic descendants of Diti, both on  
this earth planet and in the higher planets, and Hs throws them down and  
scatters them. He cries with great anger as He destroys the demons in all  
directions, yet with His unlimited hands He sustains, protects, and nourishes  
the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, who  
has assumed the form of a transcendental lion.

## Re:[1] Narasimha Jayanthi falls on 26-May-2010

Dear prasanth,   
1\. I am very glad you have taken pains to write this long poem   
with English rendering. If I am correct, it is called Nrisimha   
Mantra Raja Stavam. This is supposed to be the king of mantras,   
for overcoming obstacles and miseries and debts. There is also   
a Runa Vimochana Lakshmi Nrisimha Stotram and also Sri Sankaras   
Sri Lakshmi Nrisimha Karavalamba Stotram. All are ensuring results   
if chanted with great devotion. The first verse, you have quoted   
is called Nrisimha Gayatri. Ugram veeram mahavishnum... This   
can also be chanted as a penance for a fixed number of days. He   
is like Siva, the Effulgence, the Jvalantam. He the remover of   
fears and anxieties.   
2. Nrisimha avatara was only for a short while. He appeared from the pillar, in an evening, which was neither day nor light, tore the demon Hiranyakashyap into pieces, and then disappeared swiftly!   
3. There is no reference to Nrisimha in Srimad Valmiki Ramayanam.   
However, Kamban, the Tamil poet who was a great devotee of   
Nrisimha included one sargam in his Kamba Ramayanam about   
Nrisimha Avataram. The Tamil Kamba Ramayanam, dated early   
10th century A.D. was first read in Sri Rangam Temple in the presence of one  
Chola King. When Kamban was reading the Nrisimha avatara sargam, the poet  
read: That ferocious Lion   
roared and laughed.... Immediately, one lion image on the pillar   
in that Hall, roared and laughed. The listeners including the King   
became surprised and also were afraid! Even today you can see   
that Lion image in Sri Rangam Temple.   
4\. Swami Vedanta Desikan wrote: When Prahlada said that the Narayana would  
appear in any place, anytime, the demon king   
retored: Even from the pillar. Prahlada said: Yes. From Pillar.   
Any Pillar that you want! At this juncture, it was Narayana who became the  
most anxious of the three. He was hiding in all the   
1000 pillars of the Hall, because the demon king may hit any one of the  
pillars! Swami Desikan humorously put it: You are the one who kept 1000  
mothers ready to take birth! ( Each pillar was a mother to give birth to  
Nrisimha!).   
5\. Nrisimha's ferocity is said to have been doused by Siva, as   
Sri Sarabheswara, the form of Bird and Tiger, and with its wide wings hugged  
the Nrisimha to quell his anger. There is one   
Sri Sarabheswara Temple near Kumbakonam, in a semi urban town called  
Tiruvidaimaruthur (or Tribhuvanam?) in Tamil Nadu.   
Thanks once again for your painstaking and quite useful post.   
Arunachala Siva.
