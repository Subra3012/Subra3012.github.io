Sri Ramakrishna once asked M: What do you think of me?   
M said: Sir, God has made you with His own hands. God has made others with  
machines.   
Sri Ramakrishna laughed.

Bhagavan Ramana was as usual sitting on His sofa. The office   
people had brought a table fan, since it was very hot in that summer. The  
table fan was making a lot of noise and it often   
also got stuck. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Why this fan should be   
here? I have no work. I have got a hand fan and that is adequate   
for me. The table fan is making "more speeches ' than me. Please take it to  
the office. In fact, they need the table fan because they   
work hard!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Thief

How is the ego to be destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks  
this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree to kill itself? This  
question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the  
ego you will find it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   
In this connection I am often reminded of a funny incident which took place  
when I was living in the West Chitrai Street in Madura. A neighbour in an  
adjoining house anticipated the visit of a thief to his house. He took  
precautions to catch him. He posted policemen in mufti to guard the two ends  
of the lane, the entrance and the back-door to his own house. The thief came  
as expected and the men rushed to catch him. He took in the situation at a  
glance and shouted "Hold him, hold him. There-he runs-there-there.'' Saying so  
he made good his escape.   
So it is with the ego. Look for it and it will not be found. That is the way  
to get rid of it.
