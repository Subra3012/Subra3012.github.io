Dear Nagaraj,   
I am not very sure about a Sanskrit version. It has been   
done in Telugu, as per information given by a devotee   
in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Dear Subramanian,   
I was trying to read the Tamizh rendering of Akshara Mani Malai. Its so  
beautiful. Unfotunately, I have not learnt Tamizh thought its my mother tongue  
as I was bought up here in Bangalore. But due to personal interest, I learnt  
Tamizh myself, Though I manage to read easy tamizh reading and understand most  
of it, still I find it little difficult to understand few words in all tamizh  
works of Bhagawan. I have to stick to English and learn the meanings, thats  
the only resort now

Dear Nagaraj   
There is one web site. They play recorded akshara mani malai song. If you  
download it, you can sing along with them.   
In Ramana kendra people also sing on specific days in group. So you can catch  
the correct prounciation.   
There are plenty of great works in tamil literature in the field of advaitam  
but outside India do not know. It is Bhagavan's grace, lots of western people   
have a chance of Tamil language. The credit goes to Bhagavan.

Dear Nagaraj and Ramanaduli,   
There is an official blog of Sri Ramanasramam, www.sriramanamaharshi.org. You  
can go there and there   
is a sub-route to "e library". There all songs of Bhagavan   
Ramana have been recorded in melodious music. You can   
pick up AAMM and listen to it, while reading from the book.   
You are sure to learn it without mastering the language, as   
my wife does many Kannada songs of Purandara Dasa and   
Jnanadeva's Marathi abangams.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, yes, Silence is the Self. Here again it is very difficult   
to practise. Bhagavan said that silence does not simply mean not   
mouthing words, but it is stillness of the mind. The so called mouna-   
yogis who abound today, are silent without words, but write answers   
on a slate to the seeker's questions. Is it silence. The silence is the   
halting of the ever grinding machine, that is mind! It is the stillness   
of the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

how may one can practise.

When it is silence, it is not merely not mouthing of words, but   
it is silence of the mind. It is, as you said, the Self. Bhagavan

Dear Sankar, Yes. Silence is where nothing else appears. Silence

nothing appears. (Who am I?)

Dear Subrahmaniyan ji   
No here I learnt another definition for self. First I knew it is everywhere  
all the time and it is only bliss, consiousness and awarness. Now it is  
silence also.   
They say in Tamil, UMAI KANDA KANAVU. Means, after realisation, silence comes  
to that person so he becomes dumb.   
When other asks him, he may not express what he has seen and he may not like  
to express. By the way, I tried Mouna vratham. But I found mind chaters lot  
rather than normal days.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mounam or Silence is not merely abstaining from mouthing of words.\   
In silence, mind works out so many thoughts. True Silence is a   
thoughtlessness. When the words and thoughts cease their work,   
naturally, the deeds also will not take place. In Kanchipuram, Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswati used to observe kashta mounam, where   
even swallowing the saliva will not be there, since swallowing of   
saliva will also make a noise.   
Bhagavan Ramana's mounam was speechless, thoughtless and   
actionless. That is the state, by practising which, one can attain   
the self. Bhagavan also said that the mounam is an uninturrupted   
speech, in the sense that at that stage the individual souls talks   
for ever with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
