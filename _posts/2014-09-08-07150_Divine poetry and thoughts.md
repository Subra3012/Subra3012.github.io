**Need for daily self analysis   
Daily self-analysis or self-examination is an indispensable requisite. Then  
alone can you remove your defects and can grow rapidly in spirituality. A  
gardener watches the young plants very carefully. He removes the weeds daily.  
He puts a strong fence around them. He waters them at the proper time. Then  
alone they grow beautifully and yield fruits quickly. Even so, you should find  
out your defects through daily introspection and self-analysis and then  
eradicate them through suitable methods~Swami Sivananda**

Advice to spiritual aspirants - retire periodically from worldly atmosphere   
The life of a spiritual aspirant in the world is verily like a fierce struggle  
and fight with deadly serpent. Samsara or worldly life is a terrible and  
deadly serpent. Man must keep constant and alert watchfulness lest the  
Samsara-sarpa take you unawares. Keep the twin eyes of Viveka (discrimination)  
and Vichara (enquiry) wide open. At times the man becomes poisoned in the  
course of his Vyavahara (worldly activities). He must retire periodically from  
the worldly atmosphere and take recourse to Satsanga (association with the  
wise), Sadhana, seclusion and silent meditation~Swami Sivananda**

**Here is an excellent view from Swami Satyananda ( Disciple of Swami  
Sivananda and also founder of Bihar School of Yoga ) on Swami Sivananda 's  
Innocent Faith and Purity   
Swami Sivananda was not intellectual; he was purely a bhakta, with a very  
innocent mind. If anyone came to him or wrote to him with problems, at once he  
would ask everybody to please sit down, close their eyes and repeat the mantra  
for that person's recovery. He had such faith that immediately after the  
mantra was repeated, he would have us write a letter saying, 'We have  
conducted the mantra prayer for you and now you will be alright.'   
Unless you have faith, you cannot believe in this. We are all intellectuals.  
We know all the mantras, but we have no faith in them. If we practise a mantra  
for someone who is sick, we will not dare to write and tell him, because we  
cannot be sure he has gotten better. Whereas faith leaves no room for doubt,  
knowledge has fissures in it. I am not against intellect, but at the same time  
its limitations must be pointed out.   
Faith is very innocent but it is so powerful that the miracles you see in the  
lives of the great saints are a product of that innocence. Innocence is not  
childishness; it is the blossoming of the purity in man's structure. To be  
innocent you don't have to do anything or be anything. Rather, whatever you  
have acquired you have to throw away: knowledge, proceeds, wealth, power,  
status and political and religious background. You have to believe, 'I am  
nothing.' When this attitude takes hold within you, it becomes the centre of  
faith and in Swami Sivananda I found this faith in absolutely living form.**

Note : Most of the messages of Swami Sivananda here will be directed to the  
Mind, Body and not to Atma ( which is what Bhagavan Ramana always points to )  
.This should not be seen as a contradiction as Swami Sivananda's advise to  
aspirants is to first prepare the mind and body before you focus on Atma and  
the reasons are given below . **   
 **When it comes to Swami Sivananda 's Teachings, I wish to point out that his  
teachings will be a combination of Yoga and Vedanta. He combined the  
teachings of both Yoga and Vedanta and in fact he started the first Yoga  
Vedanta Forest Academy in Rishikesh to train spiritual aspirants in the  
Science of Yoga & Vedanta. He used the Science of Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga and  
also Bhakti Yoga to basically prepare the body, mind & heart to make it fit  
to receive the Atma Jnana i.e preparing the body ( Hatha Yoga ), mind ( Raja  
Yoga ) and heart( Bhakthi Yoga ) . In fact his entire mission was to prepare  
a spiritual aspirant fit enough for Atma Jnana. In traditional terminology  
this qualification is called "Sadhana Chatusthaya- Four Fold Qualifications "  
.   
But at the same time Swami Sivananda knew that few aspirants are very ripe and  
they do not need this preliminary steps and are fully qualified for Atma Jnana  
and he used to pick those people and send them to Swami Tapovan for receiving  
Atma Jnana. In his book "Sadhana Chatushtaya ", Swami Sivananda has mentioned  
in the end of the book that there are few people who may feel that going  
through all these preliminary disciplines are too time consuming and they just  
want to go ahead with the direct path and Swami Sivananda has welcomed that  
approach also. He considered such aspirants to be highly mature and they are  
fit for the direct path from the start itself.   
This is what Swami Sivananda has said in conclusion : "A first class student can adopt this method, because he had cultivated the  
four means in his previous birth. A mediocre student will not be able to think  
of Brahman at the very outset. How can one think of Brahman when the mind is  
filled with impurities, when it is turbulent and the senses are jumping and  
revolting ? Absolutely impossible. He may sit for thinking on the Self, but  
he will be building castles in the air and thinking of other objects. He will  
mistake deep sleep for samadhi. Many are delued in this manner. They do not  
have any spiritual progress. They can have no idea of Brahman. It is only the  
mind that is rendered pure by the practice of Viveka, Vairagya, Sama, Dama  
etc that can have the definite conception of Brahman. Ideas of Brahman cannot  
be lodged in a restless, impure mind. "- Swami Sivananda  
**The reason why I am sharing the above message is that I have myself gone  
through the Yoga Training of Swami Sivananda through the institution of one  
of his senior disciple by name Swami Vishnu devananda who was the founder of  
the International Sivananada Yoga Vedanta Centres worldwide (  
www.sivananda.org and this institution should should not be confused with the  
Divine Life Society / Sivananda Ashram at Rishikesh whose website is  
http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/ ) I did get lot of benefit from  
the same and sharing here some of the good things that I learned from those  
Yoga Sadhanas.

**This is the Mother River Ganga in Rishikesh, Ram Jhula area. The Sivananda  
Ghat is visible. The Sivananda Ashram is much above this . Just like you  
cant separate Arunachala from Bhagavan Ramana, you cant separate Mother Ganga  
from Swami Sivananda. Swami Sivananda's room was on the banks of River Ganga  
adjoining the Ghat. He did not stay in the Ashram but used to go from his  
room up to the Ashram only to Give Talks, Satsangh and supervise the works.   
This is my favorite spot to sit silently during my annual trips to Rishikesh.

**Disciples of Swami Sivananda.   
Swami Sivananda had many disciples but beauty of Swami Sivananda was that he  
shaped some of his disciples to become powerful spiritual lights the world  
over guiding many people . Many of the disciples of Swami Sivananda went all  
over the world and set up institutions carrying his message indifferent forms  
. Some of his notable disciples are : 1) Swami Krishnananda ( a great Vedantic speaker, spiritual writer and  
spiritual guide and who too took over the Divine Life Society in Rishikesh  
after Swami Sivananda's Samadhi ) http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/index.html   
2) Swami Chidananda ( a great Saint and a spiritual guide to many people and  
who also took charge of the Divine Life Society after Swami Sivananda's  
MahaSamadhi ).   
3) Swami Chinmayanada ( a great Vedantic Teacher who started the Chinmaya  
Missions world over. Swami Sivananda was his diksha guru but then later Swami  
Sivananda sent him to Swami Tapovan for Vedantic studies )  
.http://www.chinmayamission.com/   
4) Swami Venkatesananda - a great teacher, speaker and write of spiritual  
books. He is popular for his book on Yoga Vashishta.   
http://www.swamivenkatesananda.org/   
5) Swami Satyananda - again a great Yogi and who started the Bihar School of  
Yoga. He reviewed the Kriya Yoga Sadhana and Many Yoga Sadhana. Bihar School  
of Yoga has published many books on Yoga Sadhana.   
http://www.biharyoga.net/   
6) Swami Satchidananda - a great Yogi who started the Integral Yoga Institute  
in America . His book on Patanjali Yoga Sutra is quite popular.   
http://iyiny.org/ Dr.Dean Ornish who wrote the book "Reversing the Heart  
Disease " was a student of Swami Satchidananda and that book deals with how to  
reverse heart disease through the science of Yoga.   
7) Swami Vishnu devananda - a great Yogi who founded the International  
Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres world over with Head Quarters in Quebec,   
Canada http://www.sivananda.org/. He was a master of Hatha Yoga & Raja Yoga  
and famous for his books "Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga ", "Meditation &  
Mantras ", & commentary on Hatha Yoga Pradipika. He was the first one to  
structure the Yoga Teachings in the ancient Gurukula method of learning  
through his Yoga Teachers Training Courses, Advanced Yoga Taechers Training  
Courses, Sadhana Intensives etc . He did not believe much in giving lectures  
or writing books and wanted people to get immersed in Yoga Sadhana practically  
. He is my Yoga Guru. Even though I have not met him personally I went through  
all the levels of Yoga training in his institute and was fortunate to be  
trained and guided by his direct disciples. The Practical Yoga training that  
I received at the Sivananda Ashrams of Swami Vishnu devananda was the best  
thing that happened in my life.   
8 Swami Chaitanyananda - http://chaitanyadham.tripod.com/ a great Vedantic  
Teacher who remained quite reclusive in the Himalayas in his Uttar Kashi  
Ashram. He was one of the few people ( along with Swami Chinmayananda )  
selected by Swami Sivananda to undergo Vedantic studies under Swami Tapovan.   
Though very reclusive he was well known among the spiritual community in  
Himalayas and was also called as Uttar Kashi Swami. I was blessed to have his  
darshan when he came down from the Himalayas after many decades of stay there  
and had wonderful conversations with him. He cleared many of my spiritual  
doubts, knocked out all the stupid and wrong opinions I had about the  
Vedantic Tradition and other matters pertaining to spirituality and made be  
aware that Yoga Sadhana without Vedantic Study is incomplete and I understood  
the same after I started attending the Vedantic Classes of Swami  
Paramarthananda, a great Vedantic Teacher ( belonging to the Arsha Vidya  
Group of Teachers ).   
The list goes on but these are the most popular ones that I am aware of. **

**HOW GRACE WORKS   
In the beginning we see God's Grace working behind a veil and understand it  
vaguely. As we become purified and our faith in Him increases, we see clearly  
how His Grace works. Then our losses, failures and sorrows have little  
meaning. We see them as opportunities for making our contact with God more  
intimate.   
?Sri Swami Sivananda**

**Law of Retribution   
by Swami Sivananda   
Every wrong action or crime brings its own punishment, in accordance with the  
law of retribution. The law of causation, the law of action and reaction, the  
law of compensation and the law of retribution-all these operate together. He  
who robs another man robs himself. He who hurts another man hurts himself  
first. He who cheats another cheats himself first. Every wrong action causes  
punishment first in the inner nature or soul and externally in circumstances  
in the form of pain, misery, loss, failure, misfortune, disease, etc.   
Man is ignorant. He is swayed by impulses, wrath, passion, attachment, pride  
and repulsion. He does various sorts of wicked actions. His intellect becomes  
perverted. He loses his memory. His understanding gets clouded by selfishness  
and greed. He does not know what he is exactly doing. Later on he repents.  
Discipline of the Indriyas is necessary. He should remember the law of  
causation, the law of action and reaction, and the law of retribution at every  
step, at every moment of his daily life. He should control his emotions and  
impulses through the practice of Pranayama and meditation. Then only will he  
not do any wrong action.   
Remember that God is neither partial nor unjust. You suffer on account of your  
own wicked actions. Sow the seeds which will bring pleasant fruits and which  
will make you happy herein and hereafter. Do not sow the seeds which will  
bring unpleasant fruits and which will make you miserable and unhappy in this  
life or hereafter. Be cautious in doing your daily duties. Watch every  
thought, word and action. Go to the root and purify the thoughts first.  
Prayer, Japa, meditation, study of philosophical books, pure food, Vichara and  
Satsanga will purify your mind and eradicate ignoble and wicked thoughts.  
Observe the vow of silence, you will then be able to control your speech.  
Practise Yama and Niyama, Ahimsa, Satyam, Asteyam, Brahmacharya and  
Aparigraha. Develop Sattvic qualities. Slowly eradicate negative qualities. By  
these practices you will not be able to do any wrong action. The force of  
Sattvic habits will goad you on to do virtuous actions only.   
Orthodox Christians and theologians believe that God settles and fixes the  
destiny of a man before his birth. This is not logical and tenable. The  
hypothesis falls to the ground on account of its unsound nature. Man becomes  
like a piece of straw that is tossed about hither and thither in the wind. He  
has no independence and freedom. This makes God partial, unjust and whimsical.  
The moral responsibility and liberty of a man are destroyed. The man becomes  
like a prisoner whose hands and legs are tied with chains. Why should God make  
one happy and another unhappy? Is He so whimsical and eccentric? Why should  
one get His Grace before he is born? Is he so biased? If God is all-merciful  
why can He not make all equally noble, virtuous, happy, good, moral and  
spiritual? Why is one born blind? Why should a sinner be responsible for his  
actions? Is he pre-ordained to sin? Why should he suffer owing to the whim of  
such a Creator? Questions like these remain a puzzle if you accept the theory  
of 'pre-ordination and Grace'. The doctrine of Karma alone will give  
satisfaction. It is sound. It appeals to reason. It throws a flood of dear  
light. Everyone reaps the fruits of his own actions. Man can do and undo his  
destiny by his own thoughts and character. He is a free agent. He may be a bad  
man in this birth, but he can change his thoughts, habits, tendencies and  
character and can become a good man or a saint in the next birth. He has free  
will. He can choose between two alternatives at every step. The theory of  
'preordination and Grace' cannot be accepted. It falls to the ground as it is  
unsound and untenable.   
The doctrine of Karma only can explain the mysterious problem of good and evil  
in this world. The doctrine of Karma only can bring solace, contentment and  
strength to the afflicted and the desperate. It solves our difficulties and  
problems of life. It gives encouragement to the hopeless and the forlorn. It  
pushes a man to right thinking, right speech and right action. It brings a  
brilliant future for that man who lives according to this universal law. If  
all people understand this law correctly and discharge their daily duties  
carefully they would rise to sublime heights in the ladder of spirituality.  
They will be moral and virtuous and have a happy, peaceful and contented life.  
They can bear the burden of Samsara with patience, endurance and strength of  
mind. There will not be any room for complaint when they see inequalities in  
birth, fortune, intelligence and capacities. There will be heaven on earth.  
All will rejoice even in suffering. Greed, jealousy, hatred, anger and passion  
will vanish. Virtue will reign supreme everywhere. We will have a glorious  
Satyayuga now with peace and plenty everywhere. Blessed is the man who  
understands and lives in the law, for he will soon attain God-consciousness  
and become one with the Law-giver. Then the law will no longer operate on him.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: continues....   
Disciple: How?   
Master: As soon as the power lying dormant shows forth as mind, the latencies  
of the mind sprout forth, and grow up   
like trees which together form the universe. The mind sports with its  
latencies. They rise up as thoughts and materialize   
as the universe, which is thus only a dream vision. The Jivas and Isvara  
being its contents are as illusory as this day dream.   
Disciple: Please explain their illusory character.   
Master: The world is an object and seen as the result of the sport of mind.  
The Jivas and Isvara are contained in it. Parts   
can be only as real as the whole. Suppose the universe is painted in colors  
on a wall. The Jivas and Isvara will be figures   
in the painting. The figure can be only as real as the painting itself.   
Here the universe is itself a product of the mind and Isvara and the Jivas  
form parts of the same product. Therefore, they   
must be only mental projections and nothing more. This is clear from the  
Sruti which says that Maya gave rise to the   
illusions of Isvara and the Jivas, and from the Vasishta Smrti where Vasishta  
says that as if by magic the latencies dance   
about in mind as, he_I-you-this-that my son - property etc.,   
contd.,

**In a sense,   
speaking of Self-Realisation is a delusion.   
It is only because people have been under the delusion   
that the not-self is the Self   
and the unreal the real that they have to be wean and out of it   
by the other delusion called Self-Realisation;   
because actually the Self always is the Self   
and there is no such thing as realising it.   
Who is to realise what,   
and how,   
when all that exists is the Self   
and nothing but the Self?

**God is "what is nearer to you than your neck-vein,"   
God is "what is nearer to you than your neck-vein,"   
You have cast the arrow of speculation afar off.   
O you, who have made ready your bow and arrows,   
The game is close to you, and you shoot too far off.   
The further a man shoots, the further off he is,   
And the more removed from the treasure he seeks.   
The philosopher kills himself with thinking,   
Tell him that his back is turned to that treasure;   
Tell him that the more he runs to and fro,   
The further he is removed from his heart's desire.

**Secretly we spoke,   
Secretly we spoke,   
 that wise one and me.   
I said, Tell me the secrets of the world.   
He said, Sh... Let silence   
Tell you the secrets of the world.

**Visit to the Cold Clear Spring   
Ah! when the darkness blinds the orb of day   
This cold clear spring chatters my grief away,   
And, as the current whirls along,   
She lilts a little wordless song;   
This little wizard, clear and cold,   
Echoes the thoughts I left untold,   
And for music I have the sound   
Of the tall pines surging round.   
 Li Po**

**Seizing my life in your hands, you thrashed me clean   
...Glorious is the moment we sit in the palace, you and I   
Two forms, two faces, but a single soul, you and I   
The flowers will blaze and bird cries shower us with immortality   
The moment we enter the garden, you and I   
All the stars of heaven will run out to gaze at us   
As we burn as the full moon itself, you and I   
The fire winged birds of heaven will rage with envy   
In that place we laugh ecstatically, you and I   
What a miracle, you and I, entwined in the same nest   
While I am here in Konya, and you are in Khorassan   
What a miracle, you and I, one love, one lover, one Fire   
In this world and the next, in an ecstasy without end.   
Rumi**

**Authenticity   
Milarepa and the false teacher   
The real thing is not a path. The real thing is the authenticity of the  
seeker. Let me emphasize this.   
You can travel on any path. If you are sincere and authentic, you will reach  
the goal. Some paths may be hard, some may be easier, some may have greenery  
on both sides, some may be moving through deserts, some may have beautiful  
scenery around them, some may not have any scenery around them, that's another  
thing; but if you are sincere and honest and authentic and true, then each  
path leads to the goal.   
So it simply can be reduced to one thing: that authenticity is the path. No  
matter what path you follow, if you are authentic, every path leads to the  
goal. And the opposite is also true: no matter what path you follow, if you  
are not authentic you will not reach anywhere. Your authenticity brings you  
back home, nothing else. All paths are secondary. The basic thing is to be  
authentic, to be true.   
It is reported about one great mystic, Milarepa: When he went to his master in Tibet he was so humble, so pure, so authentic,  
that other disciples became jealous of him. It was certain that he would be  
the successor. And of course there was politics, so they tried to kill him.   
One day they said to him, "If you really believe in the master, can you jump  
from the hill? If you really believe, if the trust is there, then nothing, no  
harm, is going to happen." And Milarepa jumped without even hesitating for a  
single moment. They rushed down... because it was almost a three-thousand-foot  
deep valley. They went down to find his scattered bones--but he was sitting  
there in a lotus posture, very happy, tremendously happy. He opened his eyes  
and said, "You are right, trust protects."   
They thought it must be some coincidence, so when a house was on fire one day  
they told him, "If you love your master and you trust, you can go in." He  
rushed in to save the woman and the child who were left inside. He rushed in,  
and the fire was so great that the other disciples were hoping that he would  
die--but when he came back out with the woman and child, he was not burned at  
all. And he became more and more radiant, because the trust....   
One day they were going somewhere, they were to cross a river, and they told  
him, "You need not go in the boat. You have such great trust, you can walk on  
the river"\--and he walked.   
That was the first time the master saw him. He was not aware that Milarepa had  
been told to jump into the valley and told to go into the burning house. But  
that time he was there on the bank and he saw Milarepa walking on the water  
and he said, "What are you doing? It is impossible!"   
And Milarepa said, "Not impossible at all! I am doing it by your power, sir."   
Now the Master thought, "If my name and my power can do this to this ignorant,  
stupid man.... I have never tried it myself,"...so he tried. He drowned.  
Nothing has been heard about him after that.   
Osho**

**What the world wants is character.   
The world is in need of those whose life is one burning loveâselfless.   
That love will make every word tell like a thunderbolt.   
Aware, awake, great souls!   
The world is burning in misery.   
Can you sleep?   
When once you consider an action,   
do not let anything dissuade you.   
Consult your heart, not others,   
and then follow its dictates.   
Whatever you believe, that you will be.   
If you believe yourselves to be sages,   
sages you will be tomorrow.   
There is nothing to obstruct you.

**FREE AND EASY   
Happiness cannot be found   
through great effort and willpower,   
but is already present, in open relaxation   
and letting go.   
Don't strain yourself: there is nothing to do nor undo.   
Whatever momentarily arises in the body mind   
has no real importance at all,   
has little reality whatsoever.   
Why identify with, and become attached to it,   
passing judgement upon it and ourselves?   
Far better to simply   
let the entire game happen on its own,   
springing up and falling back like waves -   
without changing or manipulating anything -   
and notice how everything vanishes and   
reappears, magically, again and again,   
time without end.   
Only our searching for happiness   
prevents us from seeing it.   
It's like a vivid rainbow which you pursue   
without ever catching,   
or a dog chasing its own tail.   
Although peace and happiness do not exist   
as an actual thing or place,   
it is always available   
and accompanies you every instant.   
Don't believe in the reality   
of good and bad experiences;   
they are like today's ephemeral weather,   
like rainbows in the sky.   
Wanting to grasp the ungraspable,   
you exhaust yourself in vain.   
As soon as you open and relax   
this tight fist of grasping,   
infinite space is there -   
open, inviting and comfortable.   
Make use of this spaciousness, this freedom   
and natural ease.   
Don't search any further.   
Don't go into the entangled jungle   
looking for the great awakened elephant   
who is already resting quietly at home   
in front of your own hearth.   
Nothing to do or undo.   
Nothing to force,   
nothing to want   
and nothing missing.   
Emaho! Marvellous!   
Everything happens by itself.

**THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR   
THE Way of the Warrior is simple, my dear ones. However, it may be simple but  
it's not always easy. Today I would like to give you a few of my simple  
guidelines or "rules of the road", if you will. And that road is the Way of  
the Warrior.   
The Warrior always speaks her truth - no matter what the circumstances.   
The Warrior is totally detached from what others think and say about her.  
[This is absolutely necessary if she's going to observe the first rule above.]   
The Warrior always does her best to see the Divinity in all that is. In this  
way, she shall never have any desire to own, control, manipulate, misuse or  
abuse any of the Great Spirit's creatures.   
The Warrior always follows the highest path as dictated by the highest  
authority in the universe - herself.   
The Warrior totally trusts in - and surrenders to - the flow of her life. She  
knows all is as it should be. Therefore, she must always completely trust in -  
and surrender to - her higher Self, her Soul, the Great Spirit.   
The Warrior knows all Love, all Wisdom, all Power lie within her - within her  
mind, her body, her heart, her Soul. There is nothing to seek, nothing to  
find, nowhere to go - except WITHIN.   
The Warrior knows with absolute certainty she has never made a mistake - she  
can never make a mistake. All of her life is simply a lesson in this classroom  
called planet Earth. She learns as she goes. All is as it should be.   
The Warrior never takes life on planet Earth too seriously. It's all a game,  
after all - a game in the classroom of planet Earth. And games should be fun.  
Enjoy the game - it won't last forever!   
The Warrior's heart is always full - and always grateful. She never knows lack  
or emptiness - except, that is, when she creates those illusions by getting  
too infatuated with the Great Illusion - the human experience.   
The Warrior knows the Great Illusion creates some highly interesting  
challenges - for example, the challenge to rise above the Great Illusion.   
As she rises above the Great Illusion, the Warrior knows this experience is as  
it should be - she has chosen it. And in this choosing, she is remembering her  
way back to the Light - back to her Home. That was the only reason for  
choosing the Great Illusion in the first place.   
The Warrior knows all her brothers and sisters on planet Earth have the same  
destination she does - HOME. But each may take a different path. And the  
Warrior knows that's okay! All will get Home - no matter what path they take.  
It cannot be otherwise - for ALL paths lead Home.   
The Warrior knows the way of the wind. She loves the wind, but she knows she  
cannot capture it - she cannot own it. She can love it, luxuriate in its  
presence, glory in its energy. But if she tries to capture it, it becomes  
something other than what it truly is - it becomes still and stagnant air.   
She can never possess it completely - unless she refuses to ever own it -  
unless she refuses to ever have sovereignty over it. She can possess it only  
by letting it be free - by letting it be what it is.   
It cannot be otherwise. The Way of the Warrior is the Way of the Wind.   
 Chief Joseph

**NOW   
NOW is the only 'time' one is ever concerned with.   
Reader, consider this a moment, because here and now, a magnificent first fact  
of Truth begins to unfold. It has to do with now; the primacy of now; the  
allness of now; the absoluteness of now.   
When do we see a flower? That is, what time does does the seeing take place? I  
see the flower now, we say.   
When do we see the picture of a flower in a book? Now. When do we smell the  
fragrance of a rose? When do we touch it, enjoy it, experience it? Now.   
When does one hear a voice or a melody? When does one experience the  
occurrence of any event? Now!   
Listen carefully: When do we remember the event? When do we reminisce about  
the event? When do we think about the past? Now; always now!   
When do we dream of a future event? When do we plan and calculate concerning  
future activities? Now. All experience, all activity, all memory of the past,  
dream of the future, thinking and thought taking are inevitably, invariably  
'happening' in the now. Isn't this so? So you see, it becomes evident to  
anyone who stops long enough to acknowledge it, now is the only time we are  
ever concerned with. It is always now! We cannot escape it.   
Even so, what has humanity done to now? What has man done to this ubiquitious,  
all-inclusive, ever-present now? He has made it the most infinitesimal part of  
a great time system. He has sandwiched it between a past that stretches  
infinitely in one direction, and a future that extends forever in the other.  
He has relegated it to the merest razor's edge on a sliding scale between a  
past and a future. Is this not so? To humanity, now - this very moment of  
Awareness - is so fleeting, so ephemeral and transitory, that one cannot find  
it on the very device used to measure it. Try to point to now on your watch  
and it is instantly past, a memory.   
Ah, but when do we recall the memory? Now. When do we see the watch? Now. When  
does one speculate about the fleeting nature of humanity's time? Now. When  
does one awaken to the fact that he is never concerned with a past or a future  
except right now? Now! When does one experience? Now. So, reader, when do you  
expect to discover Reality? When do you expect to experience a 'healing' or a  
'demonstration'? When do you expect to experience completeness and happiness?  
Now!   
WILLIAM SAMUEL**

**_Solitary bird, you sing   
from the crest of the ancient tower   
to the landscape, while day dies: while music wanders the valley.   
Spring brightens   
the air around, exults in the fields,   
so the heart is moved to see it.   
Flocks are bleating, herds are lowing: more birds happily make a thousand   
circles in the clear sky, all around,   
celebrating these happy times: you gaze pensively, apart, at it all: no companions, and no flight,   
no pleasures call you, no play: you sing, and so see out   
the year, the sweet flowering of your life._**   
(Leopardi)

**Song of Solomon   
The song of songs, which is Solomon's.   
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.   
Because of the savour of thy good ointments   
thy name is as ointment poured forth,   
therefore do the virgins love thee.   
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee,   
we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.   
\--I have compared thee,   
O my love,   
to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.   
Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels,   
thy neck with chains of gold.   
We will make thee borders of gold   
with studs of silver.   
\--My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire   
in the vineyards of Engedi.   
Behold, thou art fair, my love;   
behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.   
Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yes,   
pleasant: also our bed is green.   
The beams of our house are cedar,   
and our rafters of fir.

**_He speaks to the rose 's ear, and causes it to bloom;   
He speaks to the tulip, and makes it blossom.   
He speaks a spell to body, and it becomes soul;   
He speaks to the sun, and it becomes a fount of light.   
Again, in its ear He whispers a word of power,   
And its face is darkened as by a hundred eclipses.   
What is it that God says to the ear of earth,   
That it attends thereto and rests steadfast?   
What is it that Speaker says to the cloud,   
That it pours forth rain-water like a water-skin?   
Whosoever is bewildered by wavering will,   
In his ear hath God whispered His riddle,   
That He may bind him on the horns of a dilemma;   
For he says, 'Shall I do this or its reverse?'   
Also from God comes the preference of one alternative;   
'Tis from God's impulsion that man chooses one of the two.   
If you desire sanity in this embarrassment,   
Stuff not the ear of your mind with cotton.   
Take the cotton of evil suggestions from the mind's ear,   
That the heavenly voice from above may enter it,   
That you may understand that riddle of His,   
That you may be cognisant of that open secret.   
Then the mind's ear becomes the sensorium of inspiration;   
For what is this Divine voice but the inward voice?

**_Come then, O Lord!   
Who art exalted above description and explanation!   
Is it possible for the bodily eye to behold Thee?   
Can mind of man conceive Thy frowns and Thy smiles?   
Are hearts, when bewitched by Thy smiles and frowns,   
In a fit state to see the vision of Thyself?   
When our hearts are bewitched by Thy smiles and frowns,   
Can we gain life from these two alternating states?   
The fertile garden of love, as it is boundless,   
Contains other fruits besides joy and sorrow.   
The true lover is exalted above these two states,   
He is fresh and green independently of autumn or spring!   
Pay tithe on Thy beauty, O Beauteous One!   
Tell forth the tale of the Beloved, every whit!   
For through coquetry His glances   
Are still inflicting fresh wounds on my heart.   
I gave Him leave to shed my blood, if He willed it;   
I only said, "Is it right? " and He forsook me.   
Why dost Thou flee from the cries of us on earth?   
Why pourest Thou sorrow on the heart of the sorrowful?   
O Thou who, as each new morn dawns from the east,   
Art seen uprising anew, like a bright fountain!   
What excuse makest Thou for Thy witcheries?   
O Thou whose lips are sweeter than sugar,   
Thou that ever renewest the life of this old world,   
Hear the cry of this lifeless body and heart!

**_Speak to me, speak to me, dear, and tell me, O tell me,   
Where is the land where my darling dwells?   
For Madan's burning arrows, my body is ablaze   
To hear some news of him.   
What like is she my Lord has met,   
That he is so enamoured?   
Some maid he must have found, my Lord is glad.   
And plunges in my heart an arrow.   
Shatter my bangles of shell, take off my fine array,   
And break my necklace of ivory-pearls,-   
If my dear will forsake me, what is the use of jewels?   
Cast them all in the waves of the Jamuna.   
Wipe from my hair the scarlet line and put it far away.   
All is hopeless without my darling.   
Vidyapati says: Hearken young damsel: Your sorrow is come to an end.

**_The Fowler and the Bird   
A fowler went out to catch birds, and disguised himself by wrapping his head  
up in leaves and grass, so as to avoid frightening the birds away from his  
snare. A bird of some sagacity came near him, and suspected something wrong,  
but foolishly lingered near, and began to question him as to his business. The  
fowler said he was a hermit who had retired from the world and dressed himself  
in weeds for the health of his soul. The bird said he was surprised to see a  
Mosalman doing this in contravention of the Prophet's precept, "There is no  
monkery in Islam," and his repeated declarations that Islam involves  
association with the faithful and avoidance of a solitary life. The fowler  
replied that a solitary life was allowed in heathen countries for the soul's  
health. The bird then asked what the grains of wheat were that were strewed on  
the trap. The fowler replied that they were the property of an orphan, which  
had been deposited with him in consequence of his known probity. The bird then  
asked permission to eat some, as he was very hungry, and the fowler, with much  
pretended reluctance, allowed him to do so. The moment he touched the grain  
the trap closed upon him, and he found himself a prisoner. He then abused the  
fowler for his trickery, but the fowler said he had only himself to blame for  
his greediness in eating the food which belonged to an orphan.   
The moral is, that it is not destiny which leads people into afflictions, but  
their own errors and vices.   
The bird's cries to God for aid.   
When he had eaten the grain he was caught in the trap,   
And began to recite the chapters "Yasin" and "An'am."   
Then he began to wail and cry loudly,   
So that the very fowler and his trap shook with grief.   
He said, "My back is broken by the conflict of my thoughts;   
O Beloved One, come and stroke my head in mercy!   
The palm of Thy hand on my head gives me rest,   
Thy hand is a sign of Thy bounteous providence.   
Remove not Thy shadow from my head,   
I am afflicted, afflicted, afflicted!   
Sleep has deserted my eyes   
Through my longing for Thee, O Envy of cypresses!   
Though I be unworthy of Thy favor, how were it   
If thou shouldst regard the grieves of unworthy me?   
What claim of right can a non-existent thing make   
To have the doors of Thy bounty opened to it?   
Yet Thy bounty had regard to my senseless dust   
And endued it with the ten jewels of the senses   
Five external senses and five internal senses,   
Whereby inanimate seed became a living man.   
O Light on high! what is repentance without Thy grace   
But a mere mockery of the beard of repentance;   
Thou rootest up the hairs of such repentance,   
Repentance is the shadow, Thou the shining Moon.   
Alas! Thou hast ruined my house and home;   
How can I cease wailing while Thou oppressest me?   
How can I flee away when there is no living away?   
Without Thy sustaining lordship there is no slave.   
O take my life, Thou that art the source of life!   
For apart from Thee I am wearied of my life.   
I am a lover well versed in lovers' madness,   
I am weary of learning and sense.   
Since my bashfulness is destroyed, I will publish secrets;   
How long must I bear this trepidation and anxiety?   
Formerly I was covered by modesty as by a veil,   
Now I will leap from it under Thy coverlet!   
O comrades, our Beloved has closed up all paths;   
We are as lame deer, and He as a raging lion.   
Say what remedy is there but resignation   
(To God I commit my case" (Koran xl. 47))   
When one is fallen into the hands of the raging lion?"   
Constant watchfulness is needed, in order to avoid the snares of the world,  
and not to miss the divine blessing whenever it may appear. There is a  
tradition, "When half the night has passed Allah will descend to earth, and  
cry, 'Ho, ye that ask, it shall be answered to you; and ye that crave pardon,  
it shall be pardoned to you; and ye that petition, your petitions shall be  
granted.'"   
But all who sleep the sleep of negligence will miss the promised blessing.   
Rumi

**_Never mind the struggles, the mistakes.

So never mind these failures, these little backslidings;   
hold the ideal a thousand times,and if you fail a thousand times,   
make the attempt once more.   
No need for looking behind. FORWARD!   
We want infinite energy, infinite zeal, infinite courage,   
and infinite patience, then only will great things achieved.   
Purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles.   
All great things must of necessity be slow._**

How did I ever think silence the language of love?   
What I thought would not come to light was in plain sight.   
I hear my silence talked of in every lane;   
The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.   
The beloved's regard was but a flash of light;   
How innocent to think I'd found eternal bliss.   
These, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind   
And that handful of pitiful straws I'd called my nest.   
Darshan, the glances I'd fancied voiced my love --   
Even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing.

**WEAN YOURSELF   
Little by little, wean yourself.   
This is the gist of what I have to say.   
From an embryo, whose nourishment comes in the blood,   
move to an infant drinking milk,   
to a child on solid food,   
to a searcher after wisdom,   
to a hunter of more invisible game.   
Think how it is to have a conversation with an embryo.   
You might say, "The world outside is vast and intricate.   
There are wheatfields and mountain passes,   
and orchards in bloom.   
At night there are millions of galaxies, and in sunlight   
the beauty of friends dancing at a wedding."   
You ask the embryo why he, or she, stays cooped up   
in the dark with eyes closed.   
Listen to the answer of the embryo.   
''There is no "other world."   
I only know what I've experienced.   
You must be hallucinating.''   
― Rumi, The Essential Rumi

**_You 've so distracted me,   
your absence fans my love.   
 Don't ask how.

'Do not' I say,   
and 'Do not', you answer.   
Don't ask why this delights me.

All The World's A Stage   
All the world's a stage,   
And all the men and women merely players;   
They have their exits and their entrances,   
And one man in his time plays many parts,   
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,   
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.   
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel   
And shining morning face, creeping like snail   
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,   
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad   
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,   
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,   
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,   
Seeking the bubble reputation   
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,   
In fair round belly with good capon lined,   
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,   
Full of wise saws and modern instances;   
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts   
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,   
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;   
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide   
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,   
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes   
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,   
That ends this strange eventful history,   
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,   
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.   
As You Like It, Sri William Shakespeare

**_Not Here   
There's courage involved

I want a howling hurt

**_I am the personification of Vedic wisdom, full of austerity,   
 the worshipable master of all the forefathers and a self-realized expert in  
the practice of yoga,   
 yet I could not fathom Him from whom I myself generated.   
 I am [therefore] devoted to the all-auspicious feet of the Lord of the  
surrendered souls,   
which stop the repetition of births and deaths and grant the vision of  
happiness.   
One surely cannot estimate the potency of His personal energies   
\- just like the sky that cannot see its own limit. Therefore, how can others  
know?   
Since neither I, nor you oh sons, nor the Destroyer have an idea of the true  
nature of His movements,   
one cannot expect that the other God-conscious ones would do any better.   
With one's intelligence bewildered by the illusory energy of what is created   
one is only able to see as far as one's abilty reaches.

**_Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)   
You call me out upon the waters   
The great unknown where feet may fail   
And there I find You in the mystery   
In oceans deep   
My faith will stand   
And I will call upon Your name   
And keep my eyes above the waves   
When oceans rise   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
For I am Yours and You are mine   
Your grace abounds in deepest waters   
Your sovereign hand   
Will be my guide   
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me   
You've never failed and You won't start now   
So I will call upon Your name   
And keep my eyes above the waves   
When oceans rise   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
For I am Yours and You are mine   
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders   
Let me walk upon the waters   
Wherever You would call me   
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander   
And my faith will be made stronger   
In the presence of my Savior   
I will call upon Your Name   
Keep my eyes above the waves   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
I am Yours and You are mine.

**_O my God,   
our intoxicated eyes have blurred our vision.   
Our burdens have become heavy, forgive us.   
You are hidden, and yet from East to West You have filled the world with Your  
radiance.   
Your Light is more magnificent than sunrise or sunset,   
and You are the inmost ground of consciousness   
revealing the secrets we hold.   
You are an explosive force causing our damned up rivers to burst forth.   
You whose essence is hidden while   
Your gifts are manifest,   
You are like water and we are like millstones.   
You are like wind and we are like dust.   
The wind is hidden while the dust is plainly seen.   
You are the invisible spring, and we are Your lush garden.   
You are the Spirit of life and we are like hand and foot.   
Spirit causes the hand to close and open.   
You are intelligence; we are Your voice.   
Your intelligence causes this tongue to speak.   
You are joy and we are laughter,   
for we are the result of the blessing of Your joy.   
All our movement is really a continual profession of faith,   
bearing witness to Your eternal power,   
just as the powerful turning of the millstone professes faith in the river?s  
existence.   
Dust settles upon my head and upon my metaphors,   
for You are beyond anything we can ever think or say.   
And yet, this servant cannot stop trying to express Your beauty,   
in every moment, let my soul be Your carpet.   
Rumi

**_If there are a hundred religious books, they are but one chapter: a hundred different religions seek one place of worship.   
All these roads end in one House: all these thousand ears of corn are from one Seed.   
All the hundred thousand sorts of food and drink   
are but one thing if one looks to their final cause.   
When you are entirely satiated with one kind of food,   
fifty other kinds of food become displeasing to your heart.   
In hunger, then, you are seeing double,   
for you have regarded as more than a hundred thousand   
that which is but One.

**KALI THE MOTHER**   
The stars are blotted out,   
The clouds are covering clouds,   
It is darkness vibrant, sonant.   
In the roaring, whirling wind   
Are the souls of a million lunatics   
Just loose from the prison-house,   
Wrenching trees by the roots,   
Sweeping all from the path.   
The sea has joined the fray,   
And swirls up mountain-waves,   
To reach the pitchy sky.   
The flash of lurid light   
Reveals on every side   
A thousand, thousand shades   
Of Death begrimed and black ?   
Scattering plagues and sorrows,   
Dancing mad with joy,   
Come, Mother, come!   
For Terror is Thy name,   
Death is in Thy breath,   
And every shaking step   
Destroys a world for e'er.   
Thou "Time", the All-Destroyer!   
Come, O Mother, come!   
Who dares misery love,   
And hug the form of Death,   
Dance in Destruction's dance,   
To him the Mother comes.   
Swami Vivekananda

**MAHAKALI**   
Mahakali is of another nature.   
Not of wideness but of height, not wisdom but force and strength are her  
peculiar power. There is in her a overwhelming intensity, a mighty passion of  
force to achieve, a divine violence rushing to shatter every limit and  
obstacle.   
All her divinity leaps out in a splendour of tempestuous action; she is  
therefore swiftness, for the immediately effective process, the rapid and  
direct stroke, the frontal assault that carries everything, before it.   
Terrible is her face to the Asura, dangerous and ruthless her mood against the  
haters of the Divine; for she is the Warrior of the Worlds who never shrinks  
from the battle. Intolerant of imperfection, she deals roughly with all in man  
that is unwilling and she is severe to all that is obstinately ignorant and  
obscure; her wrath is immediate and dire against treachery and falsehood and  
malignity, ill-will is smitten at once by her scourge.   
Indifference, negligence and sloth in the divine work she cannot bear and she  
smites awake at once with sharp pain, if need be, the untimely slumberer and  
the loiterer. The impulses that are swift and straight and frank, the  
movements that are unreserved and absolute, the aspiration that mounts in  
flame are the motion of Mahakali.   
Her spirit is tameless, her vision and will are high and far-reaching like the  
flight of an eagle, her feet are rapid on the upward way and her hands are  
outstretched to strike and to succour.   
For she too is the Mother and her love is as intense as her wrath and she has  
a deep and passionate kindness. When she is allowed to intervene in her  
strength, then in one moment are broken like things without consistence the  
obstacles that immobilise or the enemies that assail the seeker.   
If her anger is dreadful to the hostile and the vehemence of her pressure  
painful to the weak and timid, she is loved and worshipped by the great, the  
strong and the noble; for they feel that her blows beat what is rebellious in  
their material into strength and perfect truth, hammer straight what is wry  
and perverse and expel what is impure or defective.   
But for her what is done in a day might have taken centuries; without her  
Ananda might be wide and grave or soft and sweet and beautiful but would lose  
the flaming joy of its most absolute intensities. To knowledge she gives a  
conquering might, brings to beauty and harmony a high and mounting movement  
and imparts to the slow and difficult labour after perfection an impetus that  
multiplies the power and shortens the long way.   
Nothing can satisfy her that falls short of the supreme ecstasies, the highest  
heights, the noblest aims, the largest vistas. Therefore with her is the  
victorious force of the Divine and it is by grace of her fire and passion and  
speed if the great achievement can be done now than hereafter.   
Sri Aurobindo

**_The temple of love is not love itself;   
True love is the treasure,   
Not the walls about it.   
Do not admire the decoration,   
But involve yourself in the essence,   
The perfume that invades and touches you-   
The beginning and the end.   
Discovered, this replace all else,   
The apparent and the unknowable.   
Time and space are slaves to this presence. _**

And what kind of God would He be   
if a leaf?s prayer was not as precious to creation   
as the prayer His own son sang   
from the glorious depth   
of his soul ?   
for us.   
And what kind of God would He be   
if the vote of millions in this world could sway Him   
to change the divine   
law of   
love   
that speaks so clearly with compassion?s elegant tongue,   
saying, eternally saying: all are forgiven ? moreover, dears,   
no one has ever been   
guilty.   
What   
kind of God would He be   
if He did not count the blinks   
of your   
eyes   
and is in absolute awe of their movements?   
What a God - what a God we   
have.   
Kabir_**

**_How humbe is God   
God is the tree in the forests that   
allows itself to die and will not defend itself in front of those   
with the ax, not wanting to cause them   
shame.   
And God is the earth that will allow itself to   
be deformed by man's tools, but He cries; yes, God cries,   
but only in front of His closest ones.   
And a beautiful animal is being beaten to death,   
but nothing can make God break His silence   
to the masses   
and say,   
"Stop, please stop, why are you doing this   
to Me? "   
How humble is God?   
Kabir wept   
when I   
knew.

_IF_   
If you can keep your head when all about you   
 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,   
 But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,   
 Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,   
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,   
 And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;   
 If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster   
 And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken   
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,   
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,   
 And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings   
 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,   
And lose, and start again at your beginnings   
 And never breathe a word about your loss;   
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew   
 To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you   
 Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'   
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
 Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,   
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,   
 If all men count with you, but none too much;   
If you can fill the unforgiving minute   
 With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that?s in it,   
 And-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son!   
Rudyard Kipling
