Question: It is said that the old lady Keerai Patti was born as Lakshmi. How  
can one, who had the unique good fortune of serving Bhagavan well and  
lovingly, have to be born again at all, and even if she had to be born, how  
could she be born as a cow? Is it not said in all our books that birth as a  
human being is the best birth one can have?   
 **Bhagavan** : I never said Keerai Patti had been born as a cow.I said, I  
have already told Rani so. But she says, It has been said and also written  
down in so many books and articles and Bhagavan has not denied it. So we can  
take it as the truth.   
I added, But she puts the question on the assumption that the cow is the old  
woman reborn, whether Bhagavan has said so or not, and she desires an answer.   
**Thereupon Bhagavan said,It is not true that birth as a man is necessarily  
the highest, and that one must attain realisation only from being a man.Even  
an animal can attain Self-realisation.**   
 _In the conversation that followed on this, Bhagavan said,Even as a calf  
only some days old, Lakshmi behaved in an extraordinary way. She would daily  
come to me and place her head at my feet. On the day the foundation was laid  
for the goshala (cow-shed), she was so jubilant and came and took me for the  
function. Again on the day of grahapravesam she came straight to me at the  
time appointed and took me. In so many ways and on so many occasions, she  
behaved in such a sensible and extremely intelligent way that one cannot but  
regard it as an extraordinary cow. What are we to say about it?_

Dear prasanth,   
It is quite true. Sri Arunachala Maahatmyam says that while   
Parvati was doing tapas in Gautama Maharshi Ashram, she   
unknowing stepped on a cactus bush and the cactus bush caught   
fire and it went into the Pure Space as a huge light. The cactus   
bush got liberated by her feet.   
Arunachala Siva.
