This post was prompted by a simple question asked by Swayam in the topic  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=6418.msg24676#msg24676  
and the responses thereof. On some contemplation, i came about with my musings  
as follows -   
Knowledge alone relieves. Stopping a thought process ain't going to help  
really! We could use all our manly efforts with deep fervor to stop some  
thought pattern without really understanding it, but, eventually, we will only  
cause damage to ourselves.   
The way to go about is proper scrutinisation and proper understanding of  
everything. Krishna's famous revelation in the Bhagavad Gita, that we have  
right to only act and not on its fruits, and, that it is best to dedicate the  
fruits to God, is not some proverb or diktat. It ought to be properly  
understood and only then it makes sense. Otherwise, it becomes like what  
happened in Russia. The banned The Bhagavad Gita. I do not blame them. Their  
worry is true. They felt that Bhagavad Gita encourages fighting for Krishna  
asked Arjuna to fight  They are true, but we without properly understanding  
are blindly believing Krishna, Ramana, Ramakrishna without proper  
discernments.   
There is no possibility of surrendering the fruits to God without proper  
understanding. It only amounts to blind belief and blind belief is not going  
to help in life. A person who wants to make millions of $ is better than a  
person who lives in a life of penury, who talks about spirituality and makes  
claims that one has right over only action and not its fruits, life is for  
only realization, etcâ¦ without really knowing what he is saying so. It is  
like a Sanyasi who thinks about world compared to a Gruhasta who things about  
Sanyasa!   
Every thought has a cause. The cause is a desire to enjoy some fruits. Some  
notion, that, by doing something, we will be happy. Unless, we, by ourselves,  
properly understand the dynamics of thought process, we will never be able to  
be like Krishna or be like the famous verse of his - surrendering the fruits  
of action. We are merely repeating the words uttered by Krishna, Ramana,  
Ramakrishna, etc... But the fact is what they have said is not yet REAL in our  
case. For instance, we still derive happiness from the world more than the  
desire to realise the Self and we try to suppress ourselves out of happiness  
we are deriving just because Krishna has said so, or, Ramana has said so, or,  
just because scriptures says so. We go about and claim that everybody has to  
realise the Self. We all have shades of hypocracy in us. The reason is due to  
lack of proper discernment.   
Bhagavan says, for every thought, there is this 'I' that is the substratum of  
all thoughts. He says, enquire where from this 'I' originates. Untill this is  
properly discerned, all these quotes about surrendering fruits to God, all is  
God, all remain mere book knowledge.   
Now, if Krishna has said so, or, Ramana has said so, we believe that there is  
truth in it blindly, because of their stature. Yes they do have that stature,  
but that does not mean that we begin to blindly impose onto ourselves what  
they say without really understanding. Krishna has said so, so I should not  
expecting fruits for my actions, Ramana has said so, so I should enquire who  
am I. We all have to study, go to the basics, the roots and begin. I felt.   
We ought to, (no other option) but to properly dedicate ourselves properly in  
understanding the scheme of things independently. Now, Krishna has said  
something, Ramana Maharshi has said something, Vedanta says something, now let  
me sit and scrutinise things myself independently and see for myself what  
really it is.   
This is Tapas. One has to work out oneâs own salvation. And, it is not going  
to help by just saying this moment, that, I surrender my fruits to God and  
resume our worldly duties. That is Unconscious surrendering of fruits, it is  
just like sleep, the world resumes once again after sleep! It remains as Karma  
still continues. Only proper understanding shall relieve one from all his  
Karmas.   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Nagaraj   
Taking the liberty to type fast in a rough language. Please dont mind.   
It is all very confusing for me in your current post: what do you mean by this line   
"There is no possibility of surrendering the fruits to God without proper  
understanding. "   
What understanding you mean here? Intellectual understanding or final  
spiritual understanding ?   
"Knowledge alone relieves. Stopping a thought process ain't going to help  
really!"   
What is this again? what is Knowledge? Intellecutal knowledge never relieves  
anybody. Stopping the flow of thoughts is very good for sadhana right? Why  
that is not going to help?   
Even giving away fruits of work one must start intellectually right? How can  
one call Ishwara in person and then as a token of giving away fruits, give  
some apples or some betel leaves and say mantras?   
What is giving away of fruits? It is and it has to start as an intellectual  
surrender only right? Unfortunately all our sadhana has to start in the  
alrady heated and confused brain only. For a long time, we continue doing  
brain sadhana only.   
There is nothing wrong in whatsover way we are doing our so called sadhana.  
In fact everything is wrong. Only reason we are to do continuously is to give  
up all efforts and sit in a corner with 'summa iru' state.   
So what else I can do than merely repeating the words of great jnanis? Let me  
tell from my experience, no matter how many times I chant my Gurus name and  
bang my head against my wall of brain, I cannot realise saradamma's state.  
Yes world's mean lust pleasures still attract me more than anything else. But  
atleast let me turn to these jnanis and observe all the time their external  
life and teachings. Even though I understand or not, let me write as some  
science theorum and again and again repeat it madly.   
Let me l have shades of hypocracy. Let me not have proper discernment. But  
in the deep corner of my heart, I have developed a utter distaste and infact  
utter restlessness with my current state of affairs. That deep corner makes  
me wander after my Guru and Ramana \-- my Guru's Guru's Guru. So let that  
infintesimal spark remain as it is, even if it does not melt antartica.

Dear Krishnan,   
Please feel free to reject anything and accept what is relevant to your self,  
with the light that is guiding you.   
Salutations to Bhagavan
