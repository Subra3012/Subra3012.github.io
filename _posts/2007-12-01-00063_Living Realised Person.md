Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Jaggi Vasudev of Isha foundation,coimbattur is a self-realised master with a

not their body

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who   
has been already treaded by many others, and who have   
now become the ocean.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Jaggi Vasudev of Isha foundation,coimbattur is a self-realised master with a  
body.It makes no difference whether saints have a body or not because it is  
not their body   
which confers self-knowledge to us.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who   
has been already treaded by many others, and who have   
now become the ocean.

I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught

Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the

And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

I wanted to know if any one knew of any realized persons living in this world  
now. I would be happy to meet someone like Ramana today. If any one knew  
please do respond.   
Thanks

you.   
 in my experience at any time,any where when I think BAGAVAN, I feel more satisfaction in mind and heart

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Hi sonagiri.   
Thanks for the great info. By the way, here's a rare video of the darshan of  
Sri Laxmana Swamy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-BeVGCINic   
It may not be so rare since its on youtube now..but we are lucky to have found  
it.

WHO AM I? PRANA CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE  
MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW  
MOMENTS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF PRANA IS ALSO THE CIRCULATION OF

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.

require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji

Could some one tell me "Who Am I" really. Or Why am I ?   
As Ramana said its inner journey.And intellectual reasoning will lead no

WHO AM I? PRANA CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE  
MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW  
MOMENTS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF PRANA IS ALSO THE CIRCULATION OF  
BLOOD, DIGESTION ETC ETC. WITHOUT PRANA YOU ARE DEAD. SO WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF  
THIS PRANA?   
GO TO THE SOURCE TO FIND WHO YOU ARE

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the

b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Hi sonagiri.   
Thanks for the great info. By the way, here's a rare video of the darshan of  
Sri Laxmana Swamy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-BeVGCINic   
It may not be so rare since its on youtube now..but we are lucky to have found  
it.   
Peace

WHO AM I? PRANA CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE  
MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW  
MOMENTS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF PRANA IS ALSO THE CIRCULATION OF  
BLOOD, DIGESTION ETC ETC. WITHOUT PRANA YOU ARE DEAD. SO WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi

others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Jaggi Vasudev of Isha foundation,coimbattur is a self-realised master with a  
body.It makes no difference whether saints have a body or not because it is  
not their body   
which confers self-knowledge to us.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who   
has been already treaded by many others, and who have   
now become the ocean.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Are you anti Chinmaya \ just kidding[be sure i am not an affiliate of his in any way]. But, i guess, what he said was just a joke ! he was attached, and he accepted it i think that was genuine.   
Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !

Dear srkudai, yes, you are correct. Certain characteristics of   
Jnanis are inscrutable. But they are like a burnt rope, it is   
neither harmful to them nor to others. Even Sri Ramakrishna used   
to have "hookah". Saint Tirunavukkarasar says, " Even if   
some one is a dog eater, if he prays to Siva, I am his servant."   
Hunter Kannappa (of Kalahasti), was a meat eater.

be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives

places. He is married and is having a male child.

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Are you anti Chinmaya \ just kidding[be sure i am not an affiliate of his in any way]. But, i guess, what he said was just a joke ! he was attached, and he accepted it i think that was genuine.   
Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !

For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need

He is the follower of advaita vedanta and admirer of bhagavan ramana maharshi.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some

Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad

Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may

Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !

For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need

and he has great depth of understanding.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, yes, you are correct. Certain characteristics of   
Jnanis are inscrutable. But they are like a burnt rope, it is   
neither harmful to them nor to others. Even Sri Ramakrishna used   
to have "hookah". Saint Tirunavukkarasar says, " Even if   
some one is a dog eater, if he prays to Siva, I am his servant."   
Hunter Kannappa (of Kalahasti), was a meat eater.

Dear All,   
For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need  
guidance from a living guru then i suggest Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami.   
He is the follower of advaita vedanta and admirer of bhagavan ramana maharshi.   
I have watched few of his discourses on Updasa Saram,Bhaja Govindam.....etc  
and he has great depth of understanding.

He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot

There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some

Dear All,   
For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need  
guidance from a living guru then i suggest Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami.   
He is the follower of advaita vedanta and admirer of bhagavan ramana maharshi.   
I have watched few of his discourses on Updasa Saram,Bhaja Govindam.....etc  
and he has great depth of understanding.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Are you anti Chinmaya \ just kidding[be sure i am not an affiliate of his in any way]. But, i guess, what he said was just a joke ! he was attached, and he accepted it i think that was genuine.   
Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !   
Love!

Jnanis are inscrutable. But they are like a burnt rope, it is   
neither harmful to them nor to others. Even Sri Ramakrishna used

jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Are you anti Chinmaya \ just kidding[be sure i am not an affiliate of his in any way]. But, i guess, what he said was just a joke ! he was attached, and he accepted it i think that was genuine.   
Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !   
Love!

Dear All,   
For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need  
guidance from a living guru then i suggest Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami.   
He is the follower of advaita vedanta and admirer of bhagavan ramana maharshi.   
I have watched few of his discourses on Updasa Saram,Bhaja Govindam.....etc  
and he has great depth of understanding.

Dear kde, prasanth,   
I you could meet Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman, it will also   
be a wonderful experience. He conducts Satsangh on ULLadu   
Narpadu, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Maneesa Panchakam, Srimad   
Bhagavatam, XI Skanda etc., He is a Self realized person, as per   
the views of some advanced seekers in Sri Ramanasramam. He visits Thrissur  
(Kerala), Coimbatore, Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai,   
Hardwar, Delhi, and Bangalore also. He also conducts once a year   
Satsangh in Tiruvannamalai on Bhagavan's teachings. He lives   
in Tiruvannamalai and many months in a year, he visits the above   
places. He is married and is having a male child.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's

it.   
Peace

Could some one tell me "Who Am I" really. Or Why am I ?   
As Ramana said its inner journey.And intellectual reasoning will lead no  
where.   
Knowing this I still do not know and I'm no where near to Who Am I   
But what can "I" do?   
I do not KNOW.   
Please help me

WHO AM I? PRANA CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE  
MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW  
MOMENTS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF PRANA IS ALSO THE CIRCULATION OF  
BLOOD, DIGESTION ETC ETC. WITHOUT PRANA YOU ARE DEAD. SO WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF  
THIS PRANA?   
GO TO THE SOURCE TO FIND WHO YOU ARE

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Jaggi Vasudev of Isha foundation,coimbattur is a self-realised master with a  
body.It makes no difference whether saints have a body or not because it is  
not their body   
which confers self-knowledge to us.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who   
has been already treaded by many others, and who have   
now become the ocean.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 I mentioned Jaggi vasudev because sunilbabu99 is insisting on a master with a body.As far as i am concerned i do not need anybody   
except Bhagawan.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.   
Arunachala Siva.
