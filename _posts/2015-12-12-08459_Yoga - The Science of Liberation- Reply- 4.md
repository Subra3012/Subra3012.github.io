There is a transition from the Savichara to the Nirvichara, the latter being a  
perception without   
the perceiver in a similar manner,the further subtle impressions alone  
remaining, constituting   
the next state of Asamprajna. This state of void for utter want of objects  
leads to Samadhi   
of the object-less bliss. An abidance here results in the abandonment of bliss  
even in view of its   
involving duality still, even in view of its involving duality still, albeit  
in a very subtle way, this   
being the precursor to the meditation on the very fundamental substratum of  
the mind itself,   
this being known as Asmita in yoga parlance. The term Asmita refers to the  
bare ego, the nearest   
approximation.to the spirit, being the matrix of all phenomena. Here there  
are no objects to   
be meditated upon, but only a discriminative knowledge, involving the unbroken  
awareness   
of the distinction between Buddhi, the finest essence of objective knowledge,  
and the Purusha   
which is beyond all phenomena, being the sanctum sanctorum of existence, which  
is an illimitable   
Void, devoid of the distinctions of subject and object, existence and non  
existence, the matter   
and spirit.   
Patanjali says that in the higher state of Samadhi, there is no overlapping of  
the word, the thought   
behind the word and the intended object, which enables the yogi to understand  
the essence of   
everything without the intermediary of language. This can be equated with the  
statement of   
the modern spiritual teacher, J. Krishnamurti, that in the total emptiness of  
the mind, one can   
hear the very sound of the Universe, and have a total insight into it. In the  
state of Samadhi,   
involving the removal of the yoke between the buddhi and the Self, the entire  
existence,   
involving the identification of the pure spirit with material process, comes  
to a grinding halt,   
with the energy of intelligence no longer informing the undifferentiated  
matter.

Arunachala Siva.
