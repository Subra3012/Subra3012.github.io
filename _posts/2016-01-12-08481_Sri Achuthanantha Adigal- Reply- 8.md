Achyuta Dasar composed more than three hundred songs set to the ragas (musical  
meters) of   
Carnatic music. He was not only a composer but also was an exceptionally  
gifted singer. Once when   
he sat on a hill in a village called Chatrawadi and sang one of his  
compositions, the cows that were   
scattered on the grassy slopes of the hill gathered together and listened  
spell bound to his singing.   
While all songs are available to us, there is no recording of his mesmerizing  
voice.   
Achyuta Dasar's songs, which are marked by literary charm, written in the  
style and language of that time,   
and full of devotional fervor, bear witness to his profound spiritual  
maturity. In his songs, he pleads for   
the mercy and grace of infinite, non dual bliss to redeem him who is perplexed  
and agitated in the darkness   
of samsara. In many songs, he asks for the joy of inwardness. He asks for the  
end of the triputis (triad)   
of the knower, the object and the act of knowing so that he can focus inwardly  
and revel in the transcendental   
turiyatita (the Forth.) state beyond wakefulness, dream and deep sleep. He  
exhorts his mind to ardently   
worship the feet of the Lord who dispels the darkness of constant toil for  
worldly pleasure and gives inner bliss. He says he is rid of the delusion of  
religious creeds and their differences and incessantly worships   
the Self, the inner seer.

Arunachala Siva.
