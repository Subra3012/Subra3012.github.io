## Unity in Diversity with numbers

Those who have gone to the essence of numbers often find that there is a  
divine quality in numbers. It does not load the mind like names.   
There is an unity in diversity.   
The same Being ( **ripe I** ) has manifested in so many forms.   
So how to capture this diversity?   
We use names for persons, places, things etc, in sentences like John, market,  
apple etc.   
An alternative is to use numbers.   
If we write the sentence   
" _John is going to the market to buy apples._ "   
as   
" _I is going to the I to buy I._ "   
it will create confusion.   
A solution is to assign numbers to each person, place, object and then **marry  
them** with " **I** ": John = 121, market = 243, apple = 765   
Once the mapping sinks inside the mind (after which it becomes more or less  
automatic), the sentence is written as: " _I121 is going to the I243 to buy I765._ "   
It loads the mind less than the names.   
While writing, the numbers are there (visual), but while reading (listening)  
they are kept silent.   
So the sentence is inwardly pronounced as: " _I is going to the I to buy I._ "   
By constantly repeating the _I,I_ we feel the unity.   
The numbers with their divine quality gives the diversity.   
Since the numbers are married to the " **I** " ( **the Purusha** ) they will  
always remain subordinate and never raise their heads.   
So there is unity in diversity.   
For the Bhakta, God is everything. So "I" should be replaced by " **L** " (for  
**Lord** ), " **Y** " (for **You** ), or " **K** " (for **Krishna** ), " **S**  
" (for **Shiva** ) etc.   
So the sentence becomes: " _L121 is going to the L243 to buy L765._ "   
Keeping the numbers silent during pronounciation gives: " _Lord is going to the Lord to buy Lord._ "   
Correction for the ego (or unripe I): It is often uncomfortable to attribute every bad deed to "I" or "Lord".   
In that case "I" or "L" can be replaced by " _e_ " (for _ego_ ) knowing that  
"e" will one day lose its temporary identity to "I" or "L".   
The sentence: "The unkind person beat the dog mercilessly" becomes   
" _The unkind e123 beat the L141 mercilessly_ ".   
Those who want to see the Lord even in the unkind person can use "l"  
(lowercase L) for the unkind person.   
" _The unkind l123 beat the L141 mercilessly_ ".   
The equivalent for the Jnani will be "i" (lowercase I) and the sentence  
becomes: " _The unkind i123 beat the I141 mercilessly_ ".   
The vocal repetition still gives the continuity of "i-I" with a little  
reservation of small "i".   
So there is unity in diversity.   
And scope for spiritual growth.

Dear silentgreen,   
An unique and excellent post. Bhagavan Ramana has said there is only   
1. All numbers are adding 1 to each resultant number. If zero is added,   
if no-activity in mind, words and deeds is added, then 1 remains only   
as 1, the Unitary Principle. If on the other hand, zero kept to the right   
of 1, the value multiplies. Thus a Jnani's activity, with no-thought, is   
an excellent activity for benefit of others. Bhagavan Ramana's kitchen   
preparations, His stroll with devotees in the Hill, His preparing a nice   
stick for the shepherd, His careful keeping of the egg which was showing   
a clevage, to its maturity as a bird -- all these are examples of a Jnani's   
no-mind activity for the benefit of fellow beings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Excellent. Cosmic Law or God's Law acts very subtly. Bhagavan Ramana calls  
it as   
Iswara Niyathi (Who am I?). He says in raja yoga, when breath is controlled,  
the   
mind is controlled, albeit temporarily. But in sleep, when the mind is  
controlled,   
the breath does not stop. It comes in and goes out steadily. Why? Why this   
deviation from general rule? Because, when you sleep, and if breath too  
stops   
as the mind, then the fellows near your bed will think that you are dead! To   
prevent this misunderstanding (and a possible cremation), your breath  
continues.   
This is Cosmic Law. This is the most powerful of all laws. One earth quake  
can   
kill thousands of people. One Tusnami can kill lakhs of people. The Haiti  
earthquake   
even slowed down the earth rotation by one and a half micro second!   
It is god's stretching out his limbs, because he is bored with human beings!   
Arunachala Siva.
