## a request to make public some of Graham's precious articles

Dear administrator,   
I am a good devotee friend of Sri Graham Byod from the year 2011.   
Sri Graham used to share a series of articles describing his life experiences  
, his contact with Bhagavan Ramana and his encounters in Thiruvannamalai.   
But these series of articles he shared only with selected people whom he  
considered appropriate to read and get benefited from.   
In that way I was fortunate to had given the access to the four or five set of  
articles which were password protected.   
my wish   
======   
Now that Graham Byod is no more, I would kindly request you to consider  
publicize those articles which are powered with full spiritual power and  
intense longing of a mumukshu ( sadhaka) like Sri Graham.   
This request I am making as it is generally a prevailing protocol to publish  
such private readings after passing away of a person.   
I will keep those readings only to myself but if you decide to publish to all,  
I will be very happy.   
Regards,   
Krishna

Whenever I see a picture of Arunachala it makes me sad how bleak it is, no  
trees and no grass.   
It seems that the grow of population has destroyed the green of the hill.   
Are there any plans to do something about this problem?

I believe that there was a time when all vegetation on the mountain had  
stopped, but right now there are many trees and plants! I know that there is  
at least one organization (probably multiple) in Tiru that is making an effort  
to plant more trees. If you climb up Arunachala from Ramanasramam, you'll see  
many holes alongside the stone path which I'm sure were dug to plant trees.  
Even the inner girivalam path was closed off in part (or in whole) by the  
Forest Department because people had been mistreating the land...
