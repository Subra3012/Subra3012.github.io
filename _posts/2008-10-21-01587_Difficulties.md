## Difficulties  
Author: laith               Date: October 21, 2008, 06:16:10 AM

Hello   
At times, I find myself completely detached and unmotivated to do anything.   
I am in 3-4th year university and living alone.   
Procrastination, handling responsibilities etc..   
I am unable to even form a coherent sentence right now.   
God: Help.

Dear laith, You are in your student life. Attend to the work   
of reading well and passing the exams. If you place full   
faith in Bhagavan Ramana, He is sure to help you. Whenever   
you are free during holidays, please read books on Bhagavan and   
books by Him. You will understand His philosphy, which will go   
a long way in your worldly life and also in your pursuit of Truth.   
If you can afford to spend some money, please visit Tiruvannamalai.   
That will be an added strength to you.   
Stay with Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear laith,   
 You feel unmotivated means, when you get up to do a work, you have no "encouraging thoughts" and too many "discouraging thoughts". .. Do not listen to thoughts.   
The thought will say: "ah, what is there in this !" when you open your book,  
say.   
That is the moment, catch the thought. This thought is a suggestion. You have  
to decide whether to follow it or not. Do not follow it. .. and right at that  
moment. .. exactly at that moment... [just to prove your superiority over the  
thought and not allow it to command you], pick up the book and pay complete  
attention to the content of the book.   
And above all... this state is not anything spiritual. To get affected by  
mental states is not spirituality. True Detachment is the ability to not get  
touched by mental moods and feelings. That is the ability to do what you want  
to do... that is liberation as the mind cannot bind u. .. it can atmost give u  
a thought suggestion; it cannot command you.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Laith,   
When you are a student live the life of a student. Be an inquisitive person to  
learn things and get your knowledge updated. procrastination and other such  
mental states are not only bad for your studies but even for any of your urge  
in spirituality. Surrender yourself sincerely and start doing your duties as a  
student. Soon you will come out of this feel

Things haven't got much better.   
Due to me being extremely ovewhelmed with all the duties, I do not know where  
to start -to get things going again.   
This past week I've been waking up late, not handing in assignments and not  
attending an important exam.   
Each day I dig deeper into the whole.   
I was doing "Who am I" meditation everyday ~1hr for around two months prior to  
this. But I haven't meditated also for the past week almost.   
I think this meditation is great, but too powerful.   
Pray for me   
Laith

Dear Laith,   
I am praaying for you. One hour self enquriy or meditation is quite   
good. If there are interruptions, due to any reason, do not get   
disheartened. Pursue after the interruptions are over. These   
interruptions will automatically cease, with Guru's Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Arunachala Siva   
I have realised that what is being felt by me is alot of frustration.   
On top of that there is fear, fear becuase of not currently doing what I  
'should' be doing.   
This is a strange period, and I guess I know that it will also pass.   
Your words are soothing.   
Laith

Dear Laith,   
I just now posted under General Topic, one message, under the   
title Getting angry with God. Kindly read that, in case it suits you.   
God and the Self within you are one and the same. So, getting   
frustragted with God or your Self is the same. Seek Guru's Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Laith,   
 Please follow the advise i posted in this thread. ..   
why at all should you stop attending exams and assignments ? that is  
important...   
i do not see a reason why spirituality should stop one from doing it ! for  
me... my being spiritual helps me perform better in exams and assignments..

I do not know why I do and don't do what I do and don't.

Dear Laith,   
Quote  
I do not know why I do and don't do what I do and don't   
Is that an escape sir? Please understand sir, i am not trying to force my  
point. i am trying to be a good friend. .. i passed through this stage of  
yours[or something similar] and much later i felt i was cheating myself in the  
name of religion. And that there is really no excuse to avoid studies or one's  
duties for being spiritual. .. and i learnt that the proof of my being  
spiritual is the ability to perform better and with much ease.   
This is my understanding. Lofty terms and Lofty spiritual peaks are not  
emotions.   
Please dont mind if you think this was not related to your being/feeling.   
Thanks   
Udai Shankar

Dear Laith,   
Being spiritual in life is not abandoning the duties expected of you.   
Very rarely Jnanis like Sankaa and Bhagavan Ramana left their kith   
and kin to pursue the sadhana or tapas. But that should not be the   
case of all of us. Krishna advised the same thing to Arjuna. The   
same Jnanis that I mentioned above did the work with astute   
abilities, because for them it is the Self which they have already   
realized,was doing, without any doership. Sankara stitched old   
chappals better than a regular cobbler. Bhagavan did   
cooking in the Asram better than a trained cook. But these cases   
are rare. For most of us, we should not abandon our worldly work   
and at the same time, simultaneously pursue the prayers, meditation   
and self enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai   
I understand what you are saying.   
But, I will try to clarify my situation as best I can. At a point in  
September, I was doing quiet well. Probably the best I've been in a long time,  
in many aspects of worldly and spiritual pursuits. Things -studying, cooking,  
activities- were happening almost effortlessly.   
Three weeks ago, some baggage was being felt, reaching a high point of a week  
ago.   
As you can see this is not about any discouraging thoughts and what not, this  
seems to be issues at a deeper level.   
I have resolved to drinking alcohol on a few nights this week, though I  
haven't for many months before.   
Anyway, its almost 5.30am here. I will be going to sleep soon.   
I don't know if this is a mind game that I'm playing with myself.   
Take care   
Laith

Dear Arunachala Siva   
My wish is not to abandon the duties expected, but the opposite.   
This seems to be difficult. Especially now.   
Laith   
P.S. I've read the poem you posted and it's inspiring.   
What I go through has been gone through and it is God's plan.   
I guess there is a feeling of guilt also inside of me, due to many unfulfilled  
expectations imposed on myself.

Dear Laith,   
Yes. .. it is a game your mind is playing with you.   
Need to come out of it.   
Please sleep early... avoid alcohol... and do your duties.   
Not doing these has nothing to do with spirituality or spiritual evolution.   
Above all... Know your thoughts and understand your inner lanscape. .. how  
thoughts/feelings/sensations are driving you... need to see them within.   
This is my advise as a friend... not someone here to criticize. .. but someone  
ever with you to support and help if sought.   
Love!   
Silence

I pray for your peace, and that you may return to the point in your middle  
soon...   
ken Wilber said: in the eye of the hurricane you are safe...   
It is very important to do the work you should do, you will feel much better  
if you are in tune with the plan of god (this means working, studding and  
whatever is happening in your life as a worldy duty)...   
No Alcohol Sir, Meditaiton and Drugs are two different worlds.....   
I guess you sit alot, so please go jogging..... and make some hatha yoga, a  
healthy body is easier to transcend   
drink alot of water to purify you, sometimes we do not have much energy  
because we do not drink water....this can make us frustrated and angry   
2 glass of water before every meal and 1 glass afterwards   
I wish you peace
