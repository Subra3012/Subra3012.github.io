Dear karthikeyan. M,   
When King Anabhaya Chozha wanted to renovate and expand   
the temple in Chidambaram, he found both Vishnu, in lying   
posture and Nataraja as dancing Siva had been in the same   
sanctum sanctorum and he wanted to place them in two   
different places so that the devotees could worship them   
as per their liking. He took up great penance and fasted   
for 40 days. After that, he went and lifted Govinda Raja,   
such a large stone image, single handedly and placed it   
a little away from Nataraja. He renovated both the shrines   
and started independent poojas through priests.   
While Nataraja is in the Dancing Hall called Tiruchitrambalam,   
Govindaraja is in, what is called Tiru Chitra Kootam. While   
Saivite poets have sung the glory of Thillai Tiruchitrambalam,   
Azhwaras have sung the glory of Tiru Chitra Kootam. Tiru   
Chitra Kootam, is one of 108 holy shrines of Vishnu. But   
today Sri Vaishanavites do not go to Tiru Chitra Kootam, since   
Siva is there nearby. But Advaitis and Saivites go there.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyanji   
Today in Podhigai I heard the story by Vellukudi Krishnana said that There is  
one Govinda perumal in Thruchannur (Kezh thrupathi). This idol came from   
Chidambaram. If you want to hear this story u can here to day evening at 6  
p.m. or 6.30 pm in the evening in the same podhigai channel.
