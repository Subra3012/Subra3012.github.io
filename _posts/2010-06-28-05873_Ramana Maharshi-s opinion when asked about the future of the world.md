Question: Will the Maharshi express an opinion about the future of the world,  
for we are living in critical times?   
 **Ramana Maharshi: Why should you trouble yourself about the future? demands the Sage. You do  
not even properly know about the present! Take care of the present; the future  
will then take care of itself.**   
 **There is One who governs the world, and it is His lookout to look after  
the world.** He who has given life to the world knows how to look after it  
also. He bears the burden of this world, not you. Yet if one looks around  
with unprejudiced eyes, it is difficult to see where this benevolent regard  
comes in, I object.   
The Sage appears to be still less pleased. Yet his answer comes: As you are, so is the world. **Without understanding yourself, what is the  
use of trying to understand the world?** This is a question that seekers after  
truth need not consider.People waste their energies over all such questions.  
First, find out the truth behind yourself; then you will be in a better  
position to understand the truth behind the world, of which yourself is a  
part.

Dear prasanth,   
Ajata Vada says that the world itself is unreal and it is only one's   
mental projection. One should therefore start with his mind and see   
whether it really exists. Without that, worrying about the future of the  
world, which is itself not real, is only a delusion. Bhagavan Ramana says in  
Verse 16 of ULLadu Narpadu: "Without us, where is   
the day [time] and country [space]?"   
Gaudapada says in his Karika (Chapter III, Advaita Prakaranam.): Verse 28: The unreal cannot be born either really or through Maya.   
For the son of a barren woman is neither in reality, not in illusion.   
Verse 29: As in dream, the mind acts through Maya presenting the appearance  
of duality, so also in the waking state the mind acts,   
through Maya, presenting the appearance of duality.   
Verse 30: There is no doubt that the mind, which is, in fact, non-   
dual appears as dual in dream. In like manner undoubtedly that   
which is non-dual, appears as dual in the waking state also.   
Verse 31: All these dual objects, comprising everything that is movable and  
immovable, perceived by the mind and are mind alone.   
For, duality, is never experienced when the mind ceases to act.   
Verse 32: When the mind does not imagine on account of the knowledge of the  
Truth which is Atman, then it ceases to be mind and becomes free from all idea  
of cognition, for want of objects   
to be cognized.   
Verse 33: The knowledge {Jnanam} which is unborn and free from all  
imaginations is every inseparable from the knowable. The   
immutable and birthless Brahman is the sole object of knowledge. The  
birthless is known by the birthless.   
Arunachala Siva.
