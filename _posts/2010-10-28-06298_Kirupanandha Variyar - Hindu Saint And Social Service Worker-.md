Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned  
scholars.**   
According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga  
Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal  
received upadesam 'Satakshra Mantram' from his father and received upadesam

life was available to call them as 'father'. So was the case in Variyar  
Swamigal also.**   
Variyar Swamigal started publishing Thiruppugazh Amirtham, the monthly  
magazine in the year 1936 and continued the edition for 37 years. The contents  
of this magazine were a comprehensive elaborate detailed description on one  
song in 'Thiruppugazh' and other verses of Arunagirinathar like Kandar  
Alangaram, stories emphasizing morality and chastity and short literary  
composition of other scholars.

life made men to live as men.

music. He conquered, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast  
knowledge of texts.   
 **He never gave up performing pooja not even for a day. Never thought of  
taking food without performing pooja. There was not even a single day in his  
life without taking bath and performing pooja.**   
Swamigal played eminent roles to emphasis the faith in trusting God in the  
following pictures produced by Devar films :Thunaivan, Thiruvarul, Deivamand  
also in other pictures like Miruthanga Chakravarthi, Navagraha Nayagi and

other. So is a statement in Thirukkural and according to that, Variyar  
Swamigal toiled for others, for the people, for the world throughout his life  
span.   
It is said that one who sees a thousand crescents in his life has lived for a  
full span with entire fulfilment in all aspects of life.

is why he was born in this earth and attained eternal life in the space on  
07.11.1993.

endowing to the best possible extend to eradicate poverty, providing food,  
clothing and shelter for the aged people who are in the autumn season of their  
last days of life, irrespective of their caste, creed and race were the  
services rendered to the society by Swamigal as his day to day duties.**

continued up to his collegiate education. Then Swamigal helped in getting him  
a job, conducted his marriage and helped considerably to build his home, even  
though the person who received help from swamigal was unknown and not a  
relation to him. Thus many people have become beneficiary out of his help, and

Dear prasanth,   
Variyar Swamigal was famous for his discourses on Mahabharatam,   
Ramayanam and Skandam. He spent all his money in philanthropy.   
He had helped thousands of children for eduction and food. His   
single handed work on the temple of Vayalur near Tiruchirapalli   
is famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. The newspaper The Hindu   
reported that he is spending money for renovation of Vadalur instead   
of Vayalur. On seeing this newspaper, he decided that it was God's   
command to renovate Vadalur Temple of Saint Ramalingam also.   
He did that and initiated annadhanam, [food, bhiksha] for all visitors. This  
annadhanam is going on even today. He trained   
many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and   
mind] are clean. So I am telling people that I have whitewashed   
my wall since the house is already pure and clean. I think your   
house [body and mind] are not yet clean. So you are yet to whitewash your  
walls. [forehead]." The questioner became ashamed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
You know Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram. The back ground   
story is that the brahmins of Daruka forest were bent only on   
karmas, without Jnana vicharam. They had a lot of powers but   
they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Variyar Swamigal was famous for his discourses on Mahabharatam,   
Ramayanam and Skandam. He spent all his money in philanthropy.   
He had helped thousands of children for eduction and food. His   
single handed work on the temple of Vayalur near Tiruchirapalli   
is famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. The newspaper The Hindu   
reported that he is spending money for renovation of Vadalur instead   
of Vayalur. On seeing this newspaper, he decided that it was God's   
command to renovate Vadalur Temple of Saint Ramalingam also.   
He did that and initiated annadhanam, [food, bhiksha] for all visitors. This  
annadhanam is going on even today. He trained   
many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and   
mind] are clean. So I am telling people that I have whitewashed   
my wall since the house is already pure and clean. I think your   
house [body and mind] are not yet clean. So you are yet to whitewash your  
walls. [forehead]." The questioner became ashamed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
You know Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram. The back ground   
story is that the brahmins of Daruka forest were bent only on   
karmas, without Jnana vicharam. They had a lot of powers but   
they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kirupanandha Variyar ( Hindu Saint And Social Service Worker)  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: October 28, 2010, 01:20:30 PM

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirupanandha_Variyar   
http://variyarswamigal.com/   
Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called  
Variyar Swamigal was born at Kangeyanallur, a small village on the northern  
bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore  
and Katpadi in **Vellore District.**   
**His father Siva Thiru Mallayadasa Bhagavathar was well known for his  
discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge  
and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited.** Hence, he was  
conferred with the title "Puranethikasa Paarangathar". He established  
'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate "Thirupugazh",   
**the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.**   
Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, his mother was a noble, highly discipline  
calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her  
husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly  
towards poor was endless. His parents belong to Sengunthar group following  
Veerashaiva traditions (Primarily followers of Lord Siva). They had 11  
children and swamigal was the fourth child.   
 **Variyar Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar  
taught him education, Literature, grammar, music and instrumental music,  
particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year  
of his age. Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric)  
at his eighth year of age. At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems  
and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga  
Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned  
scholars.**   
According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga  
Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal  
received upadesam 'Satakshra Mantram' from his father and received upadesam  
'Sutchuma Satakshra Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal. Palani Easana  
Sivachariya Swamigal graced Variyar Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him  
as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri  
Then Madam Varadhachariyar.   
Variyar Swamigal married Amirtha Lakshmi, daughter of his maternal uncle at  
his 19th age.   
 **It is said that saints like Thiruvalluvar had no children since no sacred  
life was available to call them as 'father'. So was the case in Variyar  
Swamigal also.**   
Variyar Swamigal started publishing Thiruppugazh Amirtham, the monthly  
magazine in the year 1936 and continued the edition for 37 years. The contents  
of this magazine were a comprehensive elaborate detailed description on one  
song in 'Thiruppugazh' and other verses of Arunagirinathar like Kandar  
Alangaram, stories emphasizing morality and chastity and short literary  
composition of other scholars.   
Variyar Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal  
came to this world at the beginning of 20th century. Life of Swamigal spread  
over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made  
Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.   
Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and  
appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and  
ideals. Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his  
life made men to live as men.   
Variyar Swamigal had enormous, deep knowledge and practice of literature and  
music. He conquered, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast  
knowledge of texts.   
 **He never gave up performing pooja not even for a day. Never thought of  
taking food without performing pooja. There was not even a single day in his  
life without taking bath and performing pooja.**   
Swamigal played eminent roles to emphasis the faith in trusting God in the  
following pictures produced by Devar films :Thunaivan, Thiruvarul, Deivamand  
also in other pictures like Miruthanga Chakravarthi, Navagraha Nayagi and  
Kandhar Alangaram   
Swamigal also written screenplay for the picture ' Sivakavi' in which the  
glorious actor M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was the hero   
The motto of being a human in this world is to serve others before self. The  
people love other live for other, even the bone of kind people belongs to all  
other. So is a statement in Thirukkural and according to that, Variyar  
Swamigal toiled for others, for the people, for the world throughout his life  
span.   
It is said that one who sees a thousand crescents in his life has lived for a  
full span with entire fulfilment in all aspects of life.   
Thus Variyar Swamigal lived as a pearl representing the Pancha Boodhas. That  
is why he was born in this earth and attained eternal life in the space on  
07.11.1993.   
 **Helping the poor, abounding compassion towards the helpless people,  
endowing to the best possible extend to eradicate poverty, providing food,  
clothing and shelter for the aged people who are in the autumn season of their  
last days of life, irrespective of their caste, creed and race were the  
services rendered to the society by Swamigal as his day to day duties.**   
Above all, the embedded crown like service is the contribution to the  
Ramakrishna Kudil, Thirupparai Thurai (by collecting donation). Swamigal  
devoted most of his days for the lively hood of the 'Kudil', an asylum for 365  
orphan children.   
 **Swamigal contributed a formidable sum of Rs.27.0 Lakhs to the Ramakrishna  
Kudil by collecting donation, touring around Tamil Nadu to meet the  
expenditure for the children at Rs.5000/- per child.**   
Out of many services rendered by Swamigal, Swamigal thought that the services  
rendered to the Ramakrishna Kudil was his pride. Swamigal had told that he  
wanted to stay in the Kudil during his last days of life. Swamigal was much  
happy on the occasion of every annual day celebration of the Kudil conducted  
on first Sunday of January by performing bajans with the children of the  
Kudil.   
Variyar Swamigal observed as one of his important principles was to help for  
any one who sought monetary help for the medical, educational and or the  
wedding expenditure without any hesitation.   
Swamigal contributed enormous amount for many poor pupils for their  
educational expenditure every month.   
For instance, a student sought help for his S.S.L.C and got the Scholarship  
continued up to his collegiate education. Then Swamigal helped in getting him  
a job, conducted his marriage and helped considerably to build his home, even  
though the person who received help from swamigal was unknown and not a  
relation to him. Thus many people have become beneficiary out of his help, and  
came up in their lives.   
Every year, Swamigal received (during the months of May and June) a lot of  
letters from all parts of Tamil Nadu seeking help for buying books, paying  
tuition fee, Stitching uniforms etc. Swamigal honoured their needs by sending  
them thousands of Rupees.   
In the place of his manifestation Kangeyanallur, he established a primary  
school, a middle school, a girls high school and a higher secondary school for  
boys. Now the school name has been changed to "Thirumuruga Kirubanda Variyar  
boys/girls higher secondary school"   
Swamigal had been a root cause for the establishment of many educational  
institution in many places like the High School in at Kumarasamy Pettai,  
Dharmapurai.   
A home at KangeyaNallur has the pride of being a place in which Variyar  
Swamigal was grown and played around with figurine, toys like temple cars from  
his childhood. This home has been renovated and remodelled as a Memorial hall.   
An array of texts, books and literary works which swamigal read and wrote,  
Awards and Monumental articles presented to him, Things and articles which  
were in his possession and use, are being kept as an exhibition in this  
memorial hall.

many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and   
mind] are clean. So I am telling people that I have whitewashed   
my wall since the house is already pure and clean. I think your   
house [body and mind] are not yet clean. So you are yet to whitewash your  
walls. [forehead]." The questioner became ashamed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
You know Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram. The back ground   
story is that the brahmins of Daruka forest were bent only on   
karmas, without Jnana vicharam. They had a lot of powers but   
they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirupanandha_Variyar   
http://variyarswamigal.com/   
Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called  
Variyar Swamigal was born at Kangeyanallur, a small village on the northern  
bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore  
and Katpadi in **Vellore District.**   
**His father Siva Thiru Mallayadasa Bhagavathar was well known for his  
discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge  
and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited.** Hence, he was  
conferred with the title "Puranethikasa Paarangathar". He established  
'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate "Thirupugazh",   
**the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.**   
Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, his mother was a noble, highly discipline  
calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her  
husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly  
towards poor was endless. His parents belong to Sengunthar group following  
Veerashaiva traditions (Primarily followers of Lord Siva). They had 11  
children and swamigal was the fourth child.   
 **Variyar Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar  
taught him education, Literature, grammar, music and instrumental music,  
particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year  
of his age. Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric)  
at his eighth year of age. At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems  
and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga  
Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned  
scholars.**   
According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga  
Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal  
received upadesam 'Satakshra Mantram' from his father and received upadesam  
'Sutchuma Satakshra Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal. Palani Easana  
Sivachariya Swamigal graced Variyar Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him  
as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri  
Then Madam Varadhachariyar.   
Variyar Swamigal married Amirtha Lakshmi, daughter of his maternal uncle at  
his 19th age.   
 **It is said that saints like Thiruvalluvar had no children since no sacred  
life was available to call them as 'father'. So was the case in Variyar  
Swamigal also.**   
Variyar Swamigal started publishing Thiruppugazh Amirtham, the monthly  
magazine in the year 1936 and continued the edition for 37 years. The contents  
of this magazine were a comprehensive elaborate detailed description on one  
song in 'Thiruppugazh' and other verses of Arunagirinathar like Kandar  
Alangaram, stories emphasizing morality and chastity and short literary  
composition of other scholars.   
Variyar Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal  
came to this world at the beginning of 20th century. Life of Swamigal spread  
over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made  
Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.   
Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and  
appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and  
ideals. Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his  
life made men to live as men.   
Variyar Swamigal had enormous, deep knowledge and practice of literature and  
music. He conquered, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast  
knowledge of texts.   
 **He never gave up performing pooja not even for a day. Never thought of  
taking food without performing pooja. There was not even a single day in his  
life without taking bath and performing pooja.**   
Swamigal played eminent roles to emphasis the faith in trusting God in the  
following pictures produced by Devar films :Thunaivan, Thiruvarul, Deivamand  
also in other pictures like Miruthanga Chakravarthi, Navagraha Nayagi and  
Kandhar Alangaram   
Swamigal also written screenplay for the picture ' Sivakavi' in which the  
glorious actor M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was the hero   
The motto of being a human in this world is to serve others before self. The  
people love other live for other, even the bone of kind people belongs to all  
other. So is a statement in Thirukkural and according to that, Variyar  
Swamigal toiled for others, for the people, for the world throughout his life  
span.   
It is said that one who sees a thousand crescents in his life has lived for a  
full span with entire fulfilment in all aspects of life.   
Thus Variyar Swamigal lived as a pearl representing the Pancha Boodhas. That  
is why he was born in this earth and attained eternal life in the space on  
07.11.1993.   
 **Helping the poor, abounding compassion towards the helpless people,  
endowing to the best possible extend to eradicate poverty, providing food,  
clothing and shelter for the aged people who are in the autumn season of their  
last days of life, irrespective of their caste, creed and race were the  
services rendered to the society by Swamigal as his day to day duties.**   
Above all, the embedded crown like service is the contribution to the  
Ramakrishna Kudil, Thirupparai Thurai (by collecting donation). Swamigal  
devoted most of his days for the lively hood of the 'Kudil', an asylum for 365  
orphan children.   
 **Swamigal contributed a formidable sum of Rs.27.0 Lakhs to the Ramakrishna  
Kudil by collecting donation, touring around Tamil Nadu to meet the  
expenditure for the children at Rs.5000/- per child.**   
Out of many services rendered by Swamigal, Swamigal thought that the services  
rendered to the Ramakrishna Kudil was his pride. Swamigal had told that he  
wanted to stay in the Kudil during his last days of life. Swamigal was much  
happy on the occasion of every annual day celebration of the Kudil conducted  
on first Sunday of January by performing bajans with the children of the  
Kudil.   
Variyar Swamigal observed as one of his important principles was to help for  
any one who sought monetary help for the medical, educational and or the  
wedding expenditure without any hesitation.   
Swamigal contributed enormous amount for many poor pupils for their  
educational expenditure every month.   
For instance, a student sought help for his S.S.L.C and got the Scholarship  
continued up to his collegiate education. Then Swamigal helped in getting him  
a job, conducted his marriage and helped considerably to build his home, even  
though the person who received help from swamigal was unknown and not a  
relation to him. Thus many people have become beneficiary out of his help, and  
came up in their lives.   
Every year, Swamigal received (during the months of May and June) a lot of  
letters from all parts of Tamil Nadu seeking help for buying books, paying  
tuition fee, Stitching uniforms etc. Swamigal honoured their needs by sending  
them thousands of Rupees.   
In the place of his manifestation Kangeyanallur, he established a primary  
school, a middle school, a girls high school and a higher secondary school for  
boys. Now the school name has been changed to "Thirumuruga Kirubanda Variyar  
boys/girls higher secondary school"   
Swamigal had been a root cause for the establishment of many educational  
institution in many places like the High School in at Kumarasamy Pettai,  
Dharmapurai.   
A home at KangeyaNallur has the pride of being a place in which Variyar  
Swamigal was grown and played around with figurine, toys like temple cars from  
his childhood. This home has been renovated and remodelled as a Memorial hall.   
An array of texts, books and literary works which swamigal read and wrote,  
Awards and Monumental articles presented to him, Things and articles which  
were in his possession and use, are being kept as an exhibition in this  
memorial hall.

Dear prasanth,   
Variyar Swamigal was famous for his discourses on Mahabharatam,   
Ramayanam and Skandam. He spent all his money in philanthropy.   
He had helped thousands of children for eduction and food. His   
single handed work on the temple of Vayalur near Tiruchirapalli   
is famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. The newspaper The Hindu   
reported that he is spending money for renovation of Vadalur instead   
of Vayalur. On seeing this newspaper, he decided that it was God's   
command to renovate Vadalur Temple of Saint Ramalingam also.   
He did that and initiated annadhanam, [food, bhiksha] for all visitors. This  
annadhanam is going on even today. He trained   
many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and

Then Madam Varadhachariyar.   
Variyar Swamigal married Amirtha Lakshmi, daughter of his maternal uncle at  
his 19th age.   
 **It is said that saints like Thiruvalluvar had no children since no sacred  
life was available to call them as 'father'. So was the case in Variyar  
Swamigal also.**   
Variyar Swamigal started publishing Thiruppugazh Amirtham, the monthly  
magazine in the year 1936 and continued the edition for 37 years. The contents  
of this magazine were a comprehensive elaborate detailed description on one  
song in 'Thiruppugazh' and other verses of Arunagirinathar like Kandar  
Alangaram, stories emphasizing morality and chastity and short literary  
composition of other scholars.   
Variyar Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal  
came to this world at the beginning of 20th century. Life of Swamigal spread  
over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made  
Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.   
Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and  
appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and  
ideals. Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his  
life made men to live as men.   
Variyar Swamigal had enormous, deep knowledge and practice of literature and  
music. He conquered, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast  
knowledge of texts.   
 **He never gave up performing pooja not even for a day. Never thought of  
taking food without performing pooja. There was not even a single day in his  
life without taking bath and performing pooja.**   
Swamigal played eminent roles to emphasis the faith in trusting God in the  
following pictures produced by Devar films :Thunaivan, Thiruvarul, Deivamand  
also in other pictures like Miruthanga Chakravarthi, Navagraha Nayagi and  
Kandhar Alangaram   
Swamigal also written screenplay for the picture ' Sivakavi' in which the  
glorious actor M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was the hero   
The motto of being a human in this world is to serve others before self. The  
people love other live for other, even the bone of kind people belongs to all  
other. So is a statement in Thirukkural and according to that, Variyar  
Swamigal toiled for others, for the people, for the world throughout his life  
span.   
It is said that one who sees a thousand crescents in his life has lived for a  
full span with entire fulfilment in all aspects of life.   
Thus Variyar Swamigal lived as a pearl representing the Pancha Boodhas. That  
is why he was born in this earth and attained eternal life in the space on  
07.11.1993.   
 **Helping the poor, abounding compassion towards the helpless people,  
endowing to the best possible extend to eradicate poverty, providing food,  
clothing and shelter for the aged people who are in the autumn season of their  
last days of life, irrespective of their caste, creed and race were the  
services rendered to the society by Swamigal as his day to day duties.**   
Above all, the embedded crown like service is the contribution to the  
Ramakrishna Kudil, Thirupparai Thurai (by collecting donation). Swamigal  
devoted most of his days for the lively hood of the 'Kudil', an asylum for 365  
orphan children.   
 **Swamigal contributed a formidable sum of Rs.27.0 Lakhs to the Ramakrishna  
Kudil by collecting donation, touring around Tamil Nadu to meet the  
expenditure for the children at Rs.5000/- per child.**   
Out of many services rendered by Swamigal, Swamigal thought that the services  
rendered to the Ramakrishna Kudil was his pride. Swamigal had told that he  
wanted to stay in the Kudil during his last days of life. Swamigal was much  
happy on the occasion of every annual day celebration of the Kudil conducted  
on first Sunday of January by performing bajans with the children of the  
Kudil.   
Variyar Swamigal observed as one of his important principles was to help for  
any one who sought monetary help for the medical, educational and or the  
wedding expenditure without any hesitation.   
Swamigal contributed enormous amount for many poor pupils for their  
educational expenditure every month.   
For instance, a student sought help for his S.S.L.C and got the Scholarship  
continued up to his collegiate education. Then Swamigal helped in getting him  
a job, conducted his marriage and helped considerably to build his home, even  
though the person who received help from swamigal was unknown and not a  
relation to him. Thus many people have become beneficiary out of his help, and  
came up in their lives.   
Every year, Swamigal received (during the months of May and June) a lot of  
letters from all parts of Tamil Nadu seeking help for buying books, paying  
tuition fee, Stitching uniforms etc. Swamigal honoured their needs by sending  
them thousands of Rupees.   
In the place of his manifestation Kangeyanallur, he established a primary  
school, a middle school, a girls high school and a higher secondary school for  
boys. Now the school name has been changed to "Thirumuruga Kirubanda Variyar  
boys/girls higher secondary school"   
Swamigal had been a root cause for the establishment of many educational  
institution in many places like the High School in at Kumarasamy Pettai,  
Dharmapurai.   
A home at KangeyaNallur has the pride of being a place in which Variyar  
Swamigal was grown and played around with figurine, toys like temple cars from  
his childhood. This home has been renovated and remodelled as a Memorial hall.   
An array of texts, books and literary works which swamigal read and wrote,  
Awards and Monumental articles presented to him, Things and articles which  
were in his possession and use, are being kept as an exhibition in this  
memorial hall.

Dear prasanth,   
Variyar Swamigal was famous for his discourses on Mahabharatam,   
Ramayanam and Skandam. He spent all his money in philanthropy.   
He had helped thousands of children for eduction and food. His   
single handed work on the temple of Vayalur near Tiruchirapalli   
is famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. The newspaper The Hindu   
reported that he is spending money for renovation of Vadalur instead   
of Vayalur. On seeing this newspaper, he decided that it was God's   
command to renovate Vadalur Temple of Saint Ramalingam also.   
He did that and initiated annadhanam, [food, bhiksha] for all visitors. This  
annadhanam is going on even today. He trained   
many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and   
mind] are clean. So I am telling people that I have whitewashed   
my wall since the house is already pure and clean. I think your   
house [body and mind] are not yet clean. So you are yet to whitewash your  
walls. [forehead]." The questioner became ashamed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
You know Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram. The back ground   
story is that the brahmins of Daruka forest were bent only on   
karmas, without Jnana vicharam. They had a lot of powers but   
they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.

discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge  
and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited.** Hence, he was  
conferred with the title "Puranethikasa Paarangathar". He established  
'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate "Thirupugazh",   
**the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.**

at his eighth year of age. At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems  
and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga  
Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned  
scholars.**   
According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga  
Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal

Dear prasanth,   
Variyar Swamigal was famous for his discourses on Mahabharatam,   
Ramayanam and Skandam. He spent all his money in philanthropy.   
He had helped thousands of children for eduction and food. His   
single handed work on the temple of Vayalur near Tiruchirapalli   
is famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. The newspaper The Hindu   
reported that he is spending money for renovation of Vadalur instead   
of Vayalur. On seeing this newspaper, he decided that it was God's   
command to renovate Vadalur Temple of Saint Ramalingam also.   
He did that and initiated annadhanam, [food, bhiksha] for all visitors. This  
annadhanam is going on even today. He trained   
many young men and women in conducting discourses. His Tamizh book on Kanda  
VeL Karunai [Skandha Puranam] is quite famous   
and is used as a reference book by many. He has also written   
commentary on Kandar Alankaram, a 108 song collection of   
Arunagiri Natha.   
Variyar was a quick witted person. Seeing him wearing holy ashes all the  
time, one fellow remarked: What is it, you have white washed your forehead!  
Variyar said: "Yes. Forehead is like a wall and I   
have white washed it. Only when the house is cleaned up, finally one will  
take up whitewashing of the walls. My house [body and   
mind] are clean. So I am telling people that I have whitewashed   
my wall since the house is already pure and clean. I think your   
house [body and mind] are not yet clean. So you are yet to whitewash your  
walls. [forehead]." The questioner became ashamed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
You know Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram. The back ground   
story is that the brahmins of Daruka forest were bent only on   
karmas, without Jnana vicharam. They had a lot of powers but   
they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kirupanandha Variyar ( Hindu Saint And Social Service Worker)  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: October 28, 2010, 01:20:30 PM

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirupanandha_Variyar   
http://variyarswamigal.com/   
Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called  
Variyar Swamigal was born at Kangeyanallur, a small village on the northern  
bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore  
and Katpadi in **Vellore District.**   
**His father Siva Thiru Mallayadasa Bhagavathar was well known for his  
discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge  
and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited.** Hence, he was  
conferred with the title "Puranethikasa Paarangathar". He established  
'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate "Thirupugazh",   
**the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.**   
Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, his mother was a noble, highly discipline  
calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her  
husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly  
towards poor was endless. His parents belong to Sengunthar group following  
Veerashaiva traditions (Primarily followers of Lord Siva). They had 11  
children and swamigal was the fourth child.   
 **Variyar Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar  
taught him education, Literature, grammar, music and instrumental music,  
particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year  
of his age. Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric)  
at his eighth year of age. At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems  
and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga  
Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned  
scholars.**   
According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga  
Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal  
received upadesam 'Satakshra Mantram' from his father and received upadesam  
'Sutchuma Satakshra Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal. Palani Easana  
Sivachariya Swamigal graced Variyar Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him  
as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri  
Then Madam Varadhachariyar.   
Variyar Swamigal married Amirtha Lakshmi, daughter of his maternal uncle at  
his 19th age.   
 **It is said that saints like Thiruvalluvar had no children since no sacred  
life was available to call them as 'father'. So was the case in Variyar  
Swamigal also.**   
Variyar Swamigal started publishing Thiruppugazh Amirtham, the monthly  
magazine in the year 1936 and continued the edition for 37 years. The contents  
of this magazine were a comprehensive elaborate detailed description on one  
song in 'Thiruppugazh' and other verses of Arunagirinathar like Kandar  
Alangaram, stories emphasizing morality and chastity and short literary  
composition of other scholars.   
Variyar Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal  
came to this world at the beginning of 20th century. Life of Swamigal spread  
over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made  
Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.   
Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and  
appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and  
ideals. Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his  
life made men to live as men.   
Variyar Swamigal had enormous, deep knowledge and practice of literature and  
music. He conquered, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast  
knowledge of texts.   
 **He never gave up performing pooja not even for a day. Never thought of  
taking food without performing pooja. There was not even a single day in his  
life without taking bath and performing pooja.**   
Swamigal played eminent roles to emphasis the faith in trusting God in the  
following pictures produced by Devar films :Thunaivan, Thiruvarul, Deivamand  
also in other pictures like Miruthanga Chakravarthi, Navagraha Nayagi and  
Kandhar Alangaram   
Swamigal also written screenplay for the picture ' Sivakavi' in which the  
glorious actor M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was the hero   
The motto of being a human in this world is to serve others before self. The  
people love other live for other, even the bone of kind people belongs to all  
other. So is a statement in Thirukkural and according to that, Variyar  
Swamigal toiled for others, for the people, for the world throughout his life  
span.   
It is said that one who sees a thousand crescents in his life has lived for a  
full span with entire fulfilment in all aspects of life.   
Thus Variyar Swamigal lived as a pearl representing the Pancha Boodhas. That  
is why he was born in this earth and attained eternal life in the space on  
07.11.1993.   
 **Helping the poor, abounding compassion towards the helpless people,  
endowing to the best possible extend to eradicate poverty, providing food,  
clothing and shelter for the aged people who are in the autumn season of their  
last days of life, irrespective of their caste, creed and race were the  
services rendered to the society by Swamigal as his day to day duties.**   
Above all, the embedded crown like service is the contribution to the  
Ramakrishna Kudil, Thirupparai Thurai (by collecting donation). Swamigal  
devoted most of his days for the lively hood of the 'Kudil', an asylum for 365  
orphan children.   
 **Swamigal contributed a formidable sum of Rs.27.0 Lakhs to the Ramakrishna  
Kudil by collecting donation, touring around Tamil Nadu to meet the  
expenditure for the children at Rs.5000/- per child.**   
Out of many services rendered by Swamigal, Swamigal thought that the services  
rendered to the Ramakrishna Kudil was his pride. Swamigal had told that he  
wanted to stay in the Kudil during his last days of life. Swamigal was much  
happy on the occasion of every annual day celebration of the Kudil conducted  
on first Sunday of January by performing bajans with the children of the  
Kudil.   
Variyar Swamigal observed as one of his important principles was to help for  
any one who sought monetary help for the medical, educational and or the  
wedding expenditure without any hesitation.   
Swamigal contributed enormous amount for many poor pupils for their  
educational expenditure every month.   
For instance, a student sought help for his S.S.L.C and got the Scholarship  
continued up to his collegiate education. Then Swamigal helped in getting him  
a job, conducted his marriage and helped considerably to build his home, even  
though the person who received help from swamigal was unknown and not a  
relation to him. Thus many people have become beneficiary out of his help, and  
came up in their lives.   
Every year, Swamigal received (during the months of May and June) a lot of  
letters from all parts of Tamil Nadu seeking help for buying books, paying  
tuition fee, Stitching uniforms etc. Swamigal honoured their needs by sending  
them thousands of Rupees.   
In the place of his manifestation Kangeyanallur, he established a primary  
school, a middle school, a girls high school and a higher secondary school for  
boys. Now the school name has been changed to "Thirumuruga Kirubanda Variyar  
boys/girls higher secondary school"   
Swamigal had been a root cause for the establishment of many educational  
institution in many places like the High School in at Kumarasamy Pettai,  
Dharmapurai.   
A home at KangeyaNallur has the pride of being a place in which Variyar  
Swamigal was grown and played around with figurine, toys like temple cars from  
his childhood. This home has been renovated and remodelled as a Memorial hall.   
An array of texts, books and literary works which swamigal read and wrote,  
Awards and Monumental articles presented to him, Things and articles which  
were in his possession and use, are being kept as an exhibition in this  
memorial hall.

they were of no use. Then Siva comes with Narayana and Mohini.   
The wives of brahmins, while coming out of their houses for giving   
food for Siva, [as beggar], they were enchanted by his handsomeness   
and lost their balance. The brahmins got annoyed with this beggar   
of surpassing handsomeness, and they sent a tiger, an elephant,   
a dwarf like demon etc., Siva tore the tiger and the elephant   
and wore their skins as waist cloth and upper cloth. The apsmara,   
the dwarf was crushed under his feet and Siva danced. The brahmins were also  
lost their balance at the sight of astonishing beauty of Mohini.   
After all this, Siva told them about Jnana Vicharam.   
This story is in Skandam. This comes under Dadichi's advice to   
his disciple. This back ground story comes only in Skandam. Nowhere Siva  
advising about Jnana Vicharam comes. In case of Sri   
Dakshinamurty, He merely gazed the four sages in silence. Mouna   
Vaakya....   
I could catch hold of this story only from Kirupananda Variyar's Tamizh prose  
book on Skandam. As Siva gave upadesa, Ramana-   
Siva in this Upadesa Saram gave the essence of Jnana Marga.   
Arunachala Siva.
