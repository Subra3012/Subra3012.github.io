## Eka Jiva and what is this concept all about?

Below is the Q & A that happened on David Godman forum. June 2, 2010 at 10:34  
PM   
The question is simple and answer has ten points. But I want the learned  
members to give some background on the ten scriptures pointed out here.   
 **The Question**   
david do you know about any texts which propound the eka jiva doctrine in  
detail?kindly list the same if you can.   
**David Godman Replies**   
I consulted a friend who is an expert on this and he sent me the following  
reply: Well, the Whoâs Who of recent scholars (i.e. 1920âs and later) from  
Hiriyanna, Suryanarayana Shastri, V. Iyer (Swami Siddheswaranandaâs mentor)  
onwards to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Warrier etc have certainly rubbished eka-jiva  
as solipsistic nonsense. Even T.M.P. Mahadevan seems to belong to this camp,  
though in his writings, perhaps due to Sri Bhagavanâs influence, he only  
expresses skepticism towards, rather than outright rejection of eka-jiva. In  
fact, the later Acharyas openly propounding eka-jiva have been somewhat  
derisively dubbed as âneo-Advaitinsâ by this lot (now of course, the term  
has moved-on to new connotations). Personally, I have found it shocking that  
such learned men could close their minds so easily to a teaching obviously at  
the very core of Advaita. But to be fair to them, eka-jiva, undoubtedly, is  
the most difficult of concepts to really understand without considerable  
spiritual advancement as an accompaniment.   
I believe some confusion may also have arisen because the technical term  
âeka-jivaâ itself seems to have been formalized only in the 15th â 16th  
Century, thoâ the ideas it represents form the core of Advaita right from  
the beginning. And there is confusion also because doctrinal Advaita supports  
both eka-jiva & aneka-jiva at different levels; the former being the  
âhigherâ view, with aneka-jiva or multiple jivas being acceptable at the  
empirical level. And then there is some muddying of waters because of the term  
âeka-atmaâ, as used in the Mandukya.   
But the indisputable, and largely unknown, fact is that virtually all the  
Great Acharyas of Advaita, ancient & medieval, staunchly support eka-jiva. I  
believe that the Upanisads (esp. Mandukya + Karika), the Brahma Sutras & Sri  
Sankara himself propound eka-jiva if studied properly. Sri Sarvajnatman in his  
great work Samsksepa-Sariraka, itself a seminal work of Advaita, says so in so  
many words. [And we know that the Yoga-Vasista propounds dristi-sristi  
(therefore implying eka-jiva) in many verses].   
Here is a representative list of post-Sankara writers who propound eka-jiva  
(and dristi-sristi): 1\. Samsksepa-Sariraka by Sri Sarvajnatman, disciple of Sri Suresvara, and  
said to have been initiated by Sri Sankara himself, and thus from Sri  
Sankaraâs times. But scholars place him much later at around 1000 CE because  
he has commented on a particular doctrine said to be authored by Sri  
Vimuktatman below.   
2\. Ista-Siddhi by Sri Vimuktataman, (1000 CE by scholars).   
3\. Advaita-Siddhi by Sri Madhusudana Saraswati (1500âs CE). Sri Madhusudana  
Saraswati was an acknowledged genius the likes of whom have been rare even  
amongst the Great Acharyas. He proves that dristi-sristi necessarily has to  
imply eka-jiva also, and the 2 cannot be separated.   
4\. Siddhanta-Bindu by Sri Madhusudan Saraswati   
5\. Vedanta-Siddhanta-Muktavali by Sri Prakasananda (1500âs CE)   
6\. Vedanta-Tattva-Viveka by Sri Narasimhasrama (1500âs CE)   
7\. Siddhantalesasangraha by Sri Appaya Diksitar (late 1500âs CE)   
Also   
8\. Pancapadika with Vivarana by Sri Prakakastman, again said to be a disciple  
of Sri Sankara, but scholars place him at around 1000 CE.   
9\. Khandanakhandakhadya by Sriharsa (1100âs CE)   
10\. Citsukhi by Sri Citsukha (1200âs CE)   
Can personally vouch that the first 6 propound eka-jiva & dristi-sristi; the  
7th is sort of an encyclopedia of all the extant Advaita ideas. The last 3  
also apparently support eka-jiva, but I havenât studied them yet and thus  
cannot confirm the same from personal knowledge.

Dear Krishnan,   
Eka Jiva means that there is only Atma. There is no Paramatma and Jivatma  
business here. The life in Jiva is only a reflection   
of Ekatma, as the sunlight falling in each water filled pot. Each pot shows  
the surya bhimba and the real Sun which is one   
is elsewhere. See Sri Bhagavan's Ekatma Panchakam. A Brahma Jnani sees all  
the living beings as one Jiva (Eka Jiva) shining   
within the Ekatama (the only Atma)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Krishna, eka-jiva vada and drishti-srishti vada are the Indian equivalent  
of the Western solipsism. It suggests that even in the phenomenal level there  
is only one jiva which imagines that there are other jivas, world and God. I  
can only say that I don't agree that all Advaita Sages are proponent of eka-  
jiva vada. This is just David Godman's presumption. If I (the jiva) imagine  
Ishvara (meaning that He is just imagination in my mind) then I am ruling my  
and other jivas karma which is absurd. Sri Shankara would never accept such  
theory. Bhagavan has accepted eka-jiva vada for advanced sadhakas as good  
working theory, to make them more dispassionate towards goal but He clearly  
declared that drishti-srishti vada is also wrong and He taught only ajata-vada  
(nothing is created). But we can generally say that Bhagavan is proponent of  
eka-jiva vada. This is what He has said in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Quote  
> Let highly mature and courageous aspirants who have a bright and sharp  
> intellect, firmly accept that soul [jiva] is only one [eka] and thereby be  
> established deep in the heart [by enquiring 'Who am I, that one jiva?']. It  
> is only to suit immature minds that scriptures generally say that souls  
> [jivas] are many [nana].  
I can only disagree that Sri Shankara has taught eka-jiva vada. This is just  
not true in my view. What Subramanian has said is ekatma-jiva vada which is  
different theory from eka-jiva vada. Eka-jiva vada is total denial of  
everything outside jiva's mind. It says that there are not other minds or  
souls and everything is creation of the jiva's mind.

Dear Hari,   
Only Ekatma Bhavam can bring about Eka Jiva experience. See Sri Arunachala  
Pancharatnam, Verse 5 of Sri Bhagavan.

Dear Subramanian, I was talking about the general understanding of eka-jiva  
vada, not just Bhagavan's view. And eka-jiva vada is definitely = drishti-  
srishti vada = western solipsism.

**The world is a dream**   
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The  
fisherman, to be sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to  
those who live in the world? Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who  
could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an  
office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life  
there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street?  
Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as before. Even  
after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live in  
the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were  
living as householders.   
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"   
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."   
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing  
him, the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father.  
Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are  
even.'   
During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night  
on the formless God. _Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize  
God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without  
form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted_. Sambhu Mallick used  
to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a  
friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you  
come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set  
out repeating the name of God! What danger can befall me?' _Through faith  
alone one attains everything._ I used to say, 'I shall take all this to be  
true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden  
talks to me.' What I would think of would   
invariably come to pass."

M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that  
only superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with  
actual events. Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"   
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the  
name of God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would  
invariably come to pass.(To Manilal) _But you must remember, unless one is  
guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith._ Bony people, the  
hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot  
easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?"   
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and  
some other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The  
Master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine  
Mother. There was complete silence.   
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered  
the room and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit  
down. The Master had known her for many years. In her younger days she had  
lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he  
began to converse with her.   
MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy  
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"   
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"   
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"   
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place,  
and my name is inscribed there on a slab."   
MASTER: "Indeed!"   
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."   
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"   
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him,  
touching his feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up  
and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer  
of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed with the holy water the  
spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were amazed to see  
this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead.   
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should  
salute me from a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment,  
the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a few songs."

The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight   
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet.. . .   
Then he sang: High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite,   
When came a gust of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth..   
..   
Again: Dwell, O mind, within yourself;   
Enter no other's home.   
If you but seek there, you will find   
All you are searching for.   
God, the true Philosopher's Stone,   
Who answers every prayer,   
Lies hidden deep within your heart,   
The richest gem of all.   
How many pearls and precious stones   
Are scattered all about   
The outer court that lies before   
The chamber of your heart!

**Tuesday, June 5, 1883**   
Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at  
Dakshineswar. M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a  
week-day there were only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered  
there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays.   
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his  
experiences during his God-intoxicated state.   
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat  
my meals here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at  
Baranagore or at Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just  
sit down there without saying a word. If the members of the household asked me  
why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to eat.' _Now and then I  
would go, uninvited of course_, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to  
the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the  
Choudhurys' house.   
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: _'  
Devendra chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?_'  
Mathur Babu was a very proud man. _How could one expect him to go to another  
man 's house uninvited? _ At first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right.  
Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.'   
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar  
near the bridge. _He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding  
me insistent, he took me to Dina 's house in a carriage. It was a small  
place_. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage embarrassed the inmates.  
We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with the  
sacred thread. _The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina  
to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really a  
distressing situation_. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never  
listen to you again.' I laughed.

"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the  
sadhus and invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When  
I sat down for the meal, several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt  
like leaving them and sitting alone. I wondered why they should bother about  
all that. The sadhus took their seats. I began to eat before they had started.  
I heard several of them remark, 'Oh! What sort of man   
is this?' "   
 **Parable of the farmer**   
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the  
steps of his verandah. Hazra, Rakhal, and M. were near him. _Hazra had the  
attitude of a Vedantist: "I am He."_   
MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the  
farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son  
was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the  
boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the  
wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he hasn't even  
one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you  
know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and the  
father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as virtuous.  
They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts.  
Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those  
seven children or this one boy.'   
_To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the dream state. "God  
alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will."_

**Law of karma**   
HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the  
sadhu of Bhukailas. How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They  
had found him in   
samadhi. First they buried him, then they put him under water, and then they  
branded him with a hot iron. Thus they brought him back to consciousness of  
the world. But in the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures. _He  
undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the  
will of God. "_   
MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of  
that holy man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The  
kavirajs prepare   
makaradhvaja in a bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the  
fire. The gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other  
ingredients, and the medicine is made. Then the physicians break the bottle  
carefully and take out the medicine. _When the medicine is made, what  
difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or broken? So people  
think that the holy man was killed. But perhaps his inner stuff had been made.  
After the realization of God, what difference does it make whether the body

**Different kinds of samadhi**   
"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My  
own spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of  
Hrishikesh. Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as  
though it were the creeping of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of  
a monkey jumping from one branch to another. Again, sometimes it feels like a  
fish swimming in water. Only he who experiences it knows what it is like. _In  
samadhi one forgets the world. When the mind comes down a little, I say to the  
Divine Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I want to talk to people._'   
"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness  
after attaining samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual  
discipline; but they do not come back. But when God Himself is born as a man,  
as an Incarnation, holding in His hand the key to others' liberation, then for  
the welfare of humanity the Incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness  
of the world."   
M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's  
liberation?"   
HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an  
Incarnation of God exists or not?"   
It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness  
enveloped the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the  
temple garden. The black sky was reflected in the waters of the Ganges.

Quote: However great a   
man may be, how much can he know of Brahman? Sukadeva and sages like him may  
have   
been big ants; but even they could carry at the utmost eight or ten grains of  
sugar   
"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. (All laugh.) It  
wanted to tell   
others how deep the water was. But this it could never do, for no sooner did  
it get into the   
water than it melted. Now who was there to report the ocean's depth?"   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
And salt doll was dissolved in the ocean and only ocean is there now, and no  
one is left to tell the story of its dissolution and the measurement of the  
depth of the ocean.   
Sri Bhagwan Ramana has taught that a Jnani, an Enlightened One, is God Himself  
whereas even an Incarnation is only an Aspect of God. The great Vedanta  
teaches, ââAham Brahmasmâ, and âKnower of Brahman is Brahman  
Himself.ââ   
Therefore, as I have understood, an Enlightened One doesnât carry one, two,  
or even ten particles of sugar, but He is the sugar hill Himself. Moreover, He  
is forever the Silent One. His Sahaja State makes it possible for Him to live  
in the world among the people and devotees and behave like a normal human  
beingâengaging in activities, teaching, et al. Although he appears thus  
engaged in activities, a Jnani in Sahaja State is always established in Brahma  
Nishtha, in Jnana.   
Dear Sri Ravi, after reading your post, a little doubt crept in and nudged,  
and so, I wish you to kindly clarify regarding the above.   
Thanks very much, sir.

 Anil

Anil,   
The words of Sri Ramakrishna are born from the Depths of Truth and as such  
cannot but be true.Any doubt that we may have should be only to do with _our  
understanding_ of what is said.   
1.What he says is that one may know the Essence but not the Extent of Truth,as  
it is infinite.Satyam jnAnam **anatham** Brahma.One may only **express**  
certain aspects and not the Totality of it.This is what is meant by 'Carrying  
eight or ten Grains'.   
2.It is not true that an avatar need not be Jnani-Both Sri Rama as well as Sri  
Krishna were Brahma Jnanis as well as avatars.Sri Ramakrishna is also  
considered as an avatar(He himself has confirmed this to Narendra-'He who was  
Rama,he who was Krishna is now Sri Ramakrishna,and not in your advaitic  
sense'!This was at a time when Sri Ramakrishna was on his death bed,down with  
cancer and Narendra doubted whether Sri Ramakrishna could say so emphatically  
at that critical juncture!As the though crossed his mind,the Master turned to  
him and uttered these words!).   
I do believe that Jesus, The Christ was also an incarnation of God and he was  
a Brahma JnAni as well,as can be understood from his wonderful and inspiring  
and rousing words -The Sermon on the Mount is full of such inspired  
utterances.   
Both Jesus and Sri Ramakrishna never spoke in abstract terms but had the gift  
of expressing deep truths through homely parables.Actually towards the end of  
Gospel,there is a very interesting conversation about the Master visiting two  
sisters and where the conversation and happening is exactly like the way  
Martha and Mary had with Lord Jesus!   
We will see it later.   
Namaskar.

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Yes. Thanks very much, sir, for your response. I didnât mean to say that  
Brahman or the Self can be expressed by a Great One in Its Totality. That is  
simply unthinkable. What I meant to say is that a Jnaniâs Mind is Itself  
Brahman or Knower of Brahman is Himself Brahman. Sri Bhagwan says: âThat is why it is said that the Jnaniâs mind is Brahmakara or Akhanakara.  
But in reality his mind is itself Brahman.â   
âWhen once the mind is lost in the Brahman, to call the mind Brahmakara is  
like saying that a river is like the ocean; when once all the river get lost  
in the ocean, it is all one vast sheet of water. Can you then distinguish in  
that vast sheet of water, âThis is the Ganges, this is Goutami, This river  
is so long, that river is so wideâ, and so on? It is the same with regard to  
the mind also.â   
Dear Sri Ravi, for me there is no distinction between two Jnanis on the one  
hand and between a Jnani and an Avatara on the other. Sri Bhagwan has taught  
that only One exists for ever without a second. And I didnât mean to say  
that Lord Sri Rama and Lord Sri Krishna were not enlightened. Lord Sri Krishna  
delivered the divine Verses of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita which is the Scripture  
of the mankind. What I meant is this that Sri Bhawan has said that an Avatara  
is an aspect of God whereas a Jnani is God Himself.   
On page 309, in âDay by day with Bhagwanâ, Sri Devaraja Mudaliar mentions  
that Sri Bhagwan was pleased to tell him that, according to books, the Jnani  
was higher than the avatar. However in Talkâ471, when a devotee observes  
that distinction between Avatars and Jnanis is absurd, for otherwise âKnower  
of Brahman becomes Brahman only is contradicted.   
Yes, Sri Bhagwanâs as well as Sri Param Hamsaâs Utterances can never be  
arbitrary, for they rises from deep within spontaneously.   
Regards,   
 Anil

'When a devotee observes that distinction between Avatars and Jnanis is

**Rishis of ancient India**   
"The rishis of old attained the Knowledge of Brahman. One cannot have this so  
long as   
there is the slightest trace of worldliness. How hard the rishis laboured!  
Early in the   
morning they would go away from the hermitage, and would spend the whole day  
in   
solitude, meditating on Brahman. At night they would return to the hermitage  
and eat a   
little fruit or roots. They kept their minds aloof from the objects of sight,  
hearing, touch,   
and other things of a worldly nature. Only thus did they realize Brahman as  
their own inner   
consciousness.   
"But in the Kaliyuga, man, being totally dependent on food for life, cannot  
altogether shake   
off the idea that he is the body. In this state of mind it is not proper for  
him to say, 'I am   
He.' When a man does all sorts of worldly things, he should not say, 'I am  
Brahman.' Those   
who cannot give up attachment to worldly things, and who find no means to  
shake off the   
feeling of 'I', should rather cherish the idea 'I am God's servant; I am His  
devotee.' One can   
also realize God by following the path of devotion.   
 **Jnani and Vijnani**   
"The jnani gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating,  
'Not this, not   
this'. Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching the roof of a  
house by leaving   
the steps behind, one by one. But the vijnani, who is more intimately  
acquainted with   
Brahman, realizes something more. He realizes that the steps are made of the  
same   
materials as the roof: bricks, lime, and brick-dust. That which is realized  
intuitively as   
Brahman, through the eliminating process of 'Not this, not this', is then  
found to have   
become the universe and all its living beings. The vijnani sees that the  
Reality which is   
nirguna, without attributes, is also saguna, with attributes.   
"A man cannot live on the roof a long time. He comes down again. Those who  
realize   
Brahman in samadhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become  
the   
universe and its living beings. In the musical scale there are the notes sa,  
re ga, ma, pa, dha,   
and ni; but one cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a long time. The ego does not  
vanish   
altogether. The man coming down from samadhi perceives that it is Brahman that  
has   
become the ego, the universe, and all living beings. This is known as vijnana.

avatar.The Difference is not in essence but in the manifestation.We will see  
later on in The Gospel,how the Master talks about this.â   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
Yes. Certainly. From what we have learnt about Jnanis and Avataras, and about  
their lives while they walked on this Terra Firma, we can safely assume that  
there may be differences in their manifestation, depending perhaps on the  
purpose for which they come. For instance, I believe that an Avatara brings  
about change in a forceful way, even resorting to violence if such need  
arises. The Great Avataras, such as Lord Sri Rama and Lord Sri Krishna, are  
examples. On the other hand, a Gnani ushers in change with Love and Knowledge  
as their only weapons, radiating Grace. I do not a Gnani who ever resorted to  
a violent means to change the peopleâs hearts. Bhagwan Sri Raman, Lord  
Budha, and Bhagwan Sri Ramakrishna Param Hamsa, are quintessential examples.   
 Thanks very much, sir, for your response. I wish to add that I read your  
posts from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna regularly and derive immense benefit.   
Regards,   
 Anil

Dear Ravi, Anil,   
Sri Bhagavan has said in some conversation that a Jnani is born with some  
prarabdha, and he removes it along with Agami   
and Sanchita with his self inquiry. Whereas Avatars are born without any  
stock of prarabdha and other two karmas. Their   
'so called suffering if any' is only a part of their leela. For example,  
Rama losing Sita and wailing and going for her search,   
is all a divine drama. This was only to lead him to Ravana and kill him and  
his brothers and sons.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian/Anil,   
Yes, here is an excerpt from The Letters from Sriramanasramam:  **17th May, 1947 (116) PRARABDHA**   
This morning at 9 oâclock one devotee addressed   
Bhagavan as follows: âSwami, you said yesterday that a Jnani   
will perform such actions as are ordained according to his   
prarabdha. But it is said that Jnanis have no prarabdha at all!â   
Bhagavan said, in a leisurely way, âHow did they get this   
body if they have no prarabdha? How do they perform the various   
actions? The actions of Jnanis are themselves called prarabdhas. It   
is stated that there is prarabdha from Brahma right up to Sadasiva   
and the Avatars of Rama and Krishna and others also.   
 **paritrAnAya sAdhunAm vinAsAyacha DushkritAm   
Dharma samsthapanArthAya sambhavAmi yuge yuge.**   
For the protection of the good, for the destruction of   
evildoers, for the sake of firmly establishing dharma   
(righteousness), I am born from age to age.   
Bhagavad Gita, IV: 8   
 _âAs stated in this sloka, Ishwara assumes a shape when   
the virtues of good people and the sins of bad people mingle   
and become prarabdha and he has to establish dharma. That   
is called parechcha prarabdha (the acts of other people)._ The   
body itself is prarabdha. The purpose for which that body   
has come into existence will get done of its own accord.â   
We will see in The Gospel, a little later, that Sri Ramakrishna also mentions  
exactly the same point.   
Namaskar.

Ramana,   
I would certainly consider Lord Jesus,Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Bhagavan as  
avataras only.Lord Jesus and Sri Ramakrishna had categorically stated that  
they were avataras.   
Sri Bhagavan had avoided deferring to all such distinctions as he had  
manifested to emphasize the Nondual nature of Truth.   
The Word 'avatara' means one who 'Descends'.   
Here is an excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna:  **Monday, December 24, 1883**   
At eight o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking together  
in the pinegrove   
at the northern end of the temple garden. This was the eleventh day of M.'s  
stay with   
the Master.   
It was winter. The sun had just risen. The river was flowing north with the  
tide. Not far   
off could be seen the bel-tree where the Master had practised great spiritual  
austerities. Sri   
Ramakrishna faced the east as he talked to his disciple and told him about the  
Knowledge   
of Brahman.   
MASTER: "The formless God is real, and _equally real is God with form_. Nangta  
used to   
instruct me about the nature of Satchidananda Brahman. He would say that It is  
like an   
infinite ocean- water everywhere, to the right, left, above, and below. Water  
enveloped in   
water. It is the Water of the Great Cause, motionless. Waves spring up when It  
becomes   
active. Its activities are creation, preservation and destruction.   
"Again, he used to say that Brahman is where reason comes to stop. There is  
the instance of   
camphor. Nothing remains after it is burnt-not even a trace of ash.   
"Brahman is beyond mind and speech. A salt doll entered the ocean to measure  
its depth;   
but it did not return to tell others how deep the ocean was. It melted in the  
ocean itself.   
"The rishis once said to Rama: 'O Rama, sages like Bharadvaja may very well  
call you an   
Incarnation of God, but we cannot do that. We adore the Word-Brahman. We do  
not want   
the human form of God.' Rama smiled and went away, pleased with their  
adoration.   
 **Different manifestations of the Absolute**   
" _ **But the Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the same Reality**. As  
I have said before, it   
is like the roof and the steps leading to it_. The Absolute plays in many  
ways: as Isvara, as   
the gods, as man, and as the universe. _The Incarnation is the play of the  
Absolute as man.   
Do you know how the Absolute plays as man? It is like the rushing down of  
water from a   
big roof through a pipe; the power of Satchidananda-nay, Satchidananda Itself-  
descends   
through the conduit of a human form as water descends through the pipe. Only  
twelve   
sages, Bharadvaja and the others, recognized Rama as an Incarnation of God.  
Not everyone   
can recognize an Incarnation_.   
" _It is God alone who incarnates Himself as man to teach people the ways of  
love and   
knowledge_. **Well, what do you think of me**?   
"Once my father went to Gaya. There Raghuvir said to him in a dream, 'I shall  
be born as   
your son.' Thereupon my father said to Him: 'O Lord, I am a poor brahmin. How  
shall I be   
able to serve You?' 'Don't worry about it', Raghuvir replied. 'It will be  
taken care of.'   
"My sister, Hriday's mother, used to worship my feet with flowers and sandal-  
paste. One   
day I placed my foot on her head and said to her, 'You will die in Benares.'   
"Once Mathur Babu said to me: 'Father, there is nothing inside you but God.  
Your body is   
like an empty shell. It may look from outside like a pumpkin, but inside there  
is nothing neither   
flesh nor seed. Once I saw you as someone moving with a veil on.'   
There are many such instances in the Gospel where the Master has categorically  
revealed himself as an avatara.   
Namaskar.

**Path of love is easy**   
"The path of knowledge leads to Truth, as does the path that combines  
knowledge and love.   
The path of love, too, leads to this goal. The way of love is as true as the  
way of   
knowledge. All paths ultimately lead to the same Truth. But as long as God  
keeps the   
feeling of ego in us, it is easier to follow the path of love.   
"The vijnani sees that Brahman is immovable and actionless, like Mount Sumeru.  
This   
universe consists of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas. They are in  
Brahman. But   
Brahman is unattached.   
 **God 's supernatural powers**   
"The vijnani further sees that what is Brahman is the Bhagavan, the Personal  
God. He who   
is beyond the three gunas is the Bhagavan, with His six supernatural powers.  
Living beings,   
the universe, mind, intelligence, love, renunciation, knowledge - all these  
are the   
manifestations of His power. (With a laugh) If an aristocrat has neither house  
nor property,   
or if he has been forced to sell them, one doesn't call him an aristocrat any  
more. (All   
laugh.) God is endowed with the six supernatural powers. If He were not who  
would obey   
Him? (All laugh.)   
 **Different manifestations of God 's power**   
"Just see how picturesque this universe is! How many things there are! The  
sun, moon, and   
stars; and how many varieties of living beings! - big and small, good and bad,  
strong and   
weak - some endowed with more power some with less."   
VIDYASAGAR: "Has He endowed some with more power and others with less?"   
MASTER: "As the All-pervading Spirit He exists in all beings, even in the ant.  
But the   
manifestations of His Power are different in different beings; otherwise, how  
can one   
person put ten to flight, while another can't face even one? And why do all  
people respect   
you? Have you grown a pair horns? (Laughter.) You have more compassion and  
learning.   
Therefore people honour you and come to pay you their respects. Don't you  
agree with   
me?"   
Vidyasagar smiled.

The Master continued: "There is nothing in mere scholarship. The object of  
study is to find   
means of knowing God and realizing Him. A holy man had a book. When asked what  
it   
contained, he opened it and showed that on all the pages were written the  
words 'Om   
Rama', and nothing else.   
"What is the significance of the Gita? It is what you find by repeating the  
word ten times. It   
is then reversed into 'tagi', which means a person who has renounced  
everything for God.   
And the lesson of. the Gita is: 'O man, renounce everything and seek God  
alone.' Whether a   
man is a monk or a householder, he has to shake off all attachment from his  
mind.   
"Chaitanyadeva set out on a pilgrimage to southern India. One day he saw a man  
reading   
the Gita. Another man, seated at a distance, was listening and weeping. His  
eyes were   
swimming in tears. Chaitanyadeva asked him, 'Do you understand all this?' The  
man said,   
'No, revered sir, I don't understand a word of the text.' 'Then why are you  
crying?' asked   
Chaitanya. The devotee said: 'I see Arjuna's chariot before me. I see Lord  
Krishna and   
Arjuna seated in front of it, talking. I see this and I weep.'   
"Why does a vijnani keep an attitude of love toward God? The answer is that  
'Iconsciousness'   
persists. It disappears in the state of samadhi, no doubt, but it comes back.  
In   
the case of ordinary people the 'I' never disappears. You may cut down the  
aswattha tree,   
but the next day sprouts shoot up. (All laugh.)   
 **Ego causes our sufferings**   
"Even after the attainment of Knowledge this 'I-consciousness' comes up,  
nobody knows   
from where. You dream of a tiger. Then you awake; but your heart keeps on  
palpitating!   
All our suffering is due to this 'I'. The cow cries, 'Hamba!', which means  
'I'. That is why it   
suffers so much. It is yoked to the plough and made to work in rain and sun.  
Then it may be   
killed by the butcher. From its hide shoes are made, and also drums, which are  
mercilessly,   
beaten. (Laughter.) Still it does not escape suffering. At last strings are  
made out of its   
entrails for the bows used in carding cotton. Then it no longer says, 'Hamba!  
Hamba!', 'I! I!'   
but 'Tuhu! Tuhu!', 'Thou! Thou!' Only then are its troubles over. O Lord, I am  
the servant;   
Thou art the Master. I am the child; Thou art the Mother.   
"Once Rama asked Hanuman, 'How do you look on Me?' And Hanuman replied: 'O  
Rama,   
as long as I have the feeling of "I", I see that Thou art the whole and I am a  
part; Thou art   
the Master and I am Thy servant. But when, O Rama, I have the knowledge of  
Truth, then I   
realize that Thou art I and I am Thou.'   
"The relationship of master and servant is the proper one. Since this 'I' must  
remain, let the   
rascal be God's servant.

This reminds me about three statements of Lord Jesus' which confuse many  
christians many times: 1\. "My Father is greater than I", "No one knows about that day or hour, not  
even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father", "My God, My God,  
why have Thy forsaken Me"   
2\. "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me"   
3\. "I and the Father are One", "I am the Light of the world", "I am the Vine,  
you are the branches"; Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be  
enough for us." Jesus answered: "Donât you know Me, Philip, even after I  
have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the  
Father. How can you say, "Show us the Father"?"  
Many use His first statements to prove He is not God. Christians use His third  
sayings to prove He is God. But how can you describe Jesus (God)? Is there  
anything which He is not? Ant, dog, mouse, stone, wood, human, mountain or the  
Ocean - everything is His manifestation. Jesus is All in All.

Ramana,   
Yes,there are many sayings of Sri Ramakrishna that are exactly the same as  
what lord Jesus said.As you have said -'Jesus is God'.The word 'Jesus' is a  
deivation from 'yesu' which has the sanskrit root of 'Isa' or Iswara,God.   
Muruganar calls Sri Bhagavan as 'ramanesan'(Ramana +isan).   
There is an interesting incident that comes later on in the Gospel where Sri  
Ramakrishna visits the House of two sisters;this is very much like Jesus  
visiting Martha and Mary.If we read this,we get to visualize what it must have  
been to come face to Face with Jesus,the Christ.I will post this in the Rough  
Note Book thread.   
Namaskar.

Dear Soham,   
There is no universal rating of spiritual persons. It varies from person to  
person.   
For a child, his father is a hero and gets the highest rating. For a disciple,  
his Guru is the best and gets the highest rating. However rating does not help  
one to progress spiritually. On the other hand, one should try to squeeze the  
maximum juice of bhakti from whichever form of God appeals to one. Sri  
Ramakrishna said: We have come to eat mangoes and not count the leaves and  
branches of the mango tree.   
Anyway, thanks for your journalism. Its interesting. It also shows the reach  
of mathematics beyond the emperical world.

Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said that He is not seeing anyone   
as Ajnani. For Him, all are Jnanis only. He further added that there is no  
Jnani at all, there is only Jnanam.   
Even when Kaivalya Navaneetam's verse was quoted, [where it is said that there  
are four types of Brahma Jnanis], Bhagavan had   
said that these are all theoretical.   
Annamalai Swami however, made a distinction. He said that there are two types  
of Brahma Jnanis. One is like a lamp. He gives light only to the people  
nearby. They do not attract very many people. Like Akka Mahadevi, Chengottai  
Avudai Akka and Sadasiva Brahmendra. However, the other type is like a  
conflagration, a forest fire. It gives light to many many people. Like Sri  
Bhagavan and Sri Ramakrishna.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Mr. N.R. Krishnmoorty Iyer was in T'malai during his young years   
and had even met Bhagavan in Virupaksha Cave several times.   
Later for about a decade and a half, he went away for studies,   
became postgraduate and was also filling his brain with a lot of   
Western philosophy. With freedom movement all over the country,   
he developed an aversion for 'simply sitting' Jnanis like Sri Bhagavan. Once  
he had to come to T'malai and he spoke to   
T.K. Sundaresa Iyer, [a devotee of Sri Bhagavan and also friend   
of NRK]. He found that since it was some festival time, the house where he  
was placed was rather crowded and noisy. TKS told   
NRK: Both of us can go to Asramam and stay there. It is a better place. NRK  
agreed, but told TKS: I shall not, if I come there,   
prostrate to Sri Bhagavan. I shall even ask Him some inconvenient questions  
and your vanity should not be affected. TKS said: You   
can still come with me. There is no need to prostrate to Sri Bhagavan. You  
may even ask many questions if you want. Both   
went inside the Asramam. Sri Bhagavan was sitting on a wooden chair under the  
Iluppai Tree, which you can see even today, inside the Asramam before you  
take steps towards the temples. There   
NRK saw Bhagavan and immediately prostrated! TKS was laughing   
within. Then NRK somehow adjusted his state and then asked   
Sri Bhagavan: "Swami what is your Stithi?" Stithi means State.   
NRK's brain was ready with all answers and counter questions. If   
He says I am liberated, then he can ask what is liberation? If he   
says that I shall die. Then he can ask what is death? What is   
rebirth? etc., etc.,   
Sri Bhagavan gazed at NRK for full ten minutes. The gaze that would pierce  
one's Heart. Then, as if a bomb had exploded underneath NRK, came the counter  
question: What is your Stithi?   
Now, if he says, he will die, then Sri Bhagavan would ask What is death? If  
he says that he will go to heavens, then Sri Bhagavan   
would ask What is heavens? Where is it?   
NRK's out-turned mind now went inside. What is my stithi? What will happen to  
me after death? Who am I? Slowly the mind went and touched the Self and then  
the pulsating I,I danced merrily   
and reveals Itself. Aham Sphurana.   
For some people, such "rating exercise" sends the mind inward for   
their own good. Is it not?   
Sri Bhagavan says in Verse 28 of Sri AAMM: To feed on You I came. O Arunachala! But I have become Your   
food and am now at peace, effectively consumed by You.   
Arunachala Siva.**

If a raindrop touches ocean it is finished automatically. The rates are  
because one sees itself as a raindrop.

Dear amiatall,   
Absolutely correct. In fact Bhagavan Ramana always used the method of begging  
the question/doubt of the questioner, to drive home the point.   
Once Paul Brunton asked: "Bhagavan! To attain the Self, should   
I leave all my possessions?" Bhagavan Ramana replied: "Leave   
the possessor too." If possesor is forsaken and the Self within is   
held on, there is no discussions on Jnanis, their grades etc.,   
On another occasion, a Vaishnavite came to Sri Bhagavan and asked Him as to  
how to control the mind. Sri Bhagavan asked   
him: In Your Vaishnava Siddhanta, what is mind? The gentleman   
replied: In our Sampradaya, [practice], Vishnu is antaryami, the indweller in  
the Heart and Mind is Thaayar, mother, Sri Lakshmi.   
Then Bhagavan asked him: If mind is Sri Lakshmi, why should you control her?  
Just pray to her to give way to attain the Antaryami.   
Why should trouble yourself to control Sri Lakshmi, who is the Mother?"   
On another occasion, one gentleman came and asked Bhagavan   
Sri Ramana: "What is the Sampradaya [daily rituals and practices]   
here. Because I do not see anything. The bell rings and breakfast is served.  
The bell again rings, lunch is served. Again the bell rings, supper is  
served." Sri Bhagavan did not reply. Then after sometime, He asked him,  
'What is your sampradaya?" The gentleman asnwered: "In the mornings we do  
pujas and after   
dinner, we do so many fixed counts of Japa mantras. And before going to bed,  
we submit everything to our Guru." Sri Bhagavan   
replied: "Oh, yet is good. It is like keeping the principal and giving  
interest to the guru." The gentleman did not understand it.   
Just then Muruganar arrived. Sri Bhagavan told Muruganar the entire  
conversation. Muruganar replied: "Oh, Bhagavan! Their   
guru is much better. He collects only the interest [the merits of   
japa mantras], but allows them to retain the Principal. Here,   
our Guru swallows the Principal itself. Everyone laughed. The   
gentleman became more confounded.   
We always keep the Principal [ego] and give only whatever we do   
as submission to our Guru. But Sri Ramana Guru does not even allow that. He  
takes way the ego, the Principal too. Without ego,   
without principal, what we can do, what we can submit to our guru? We submit  
'ourselves' totally to Him to ensure liberation.   
Muruganar has once said: Where is the time for japa etc., There is no ego  
here. Bhagavan is Uyir UNNi. i.e. one who eats the individual soul, or the  
ego!   
Arunachala Siva.

Adi Da treated his own disciples in the worst way.   
You should probably read up on that.   
He did unbelievably nasty things to them that I wouldn't even write down in a

He was very intelligent, but his spirituality is a counterfeit.

Dear Om Hridayam, simple knowledge about spiritual ideas and   
spiritual goals can make one only a teacher. But a teacher is not   
a Guru. Guru is one who has realized the Truth and can also through his grace  
take the disciples towards the Truth. Of course, self effort is a must and  
guru's grace is equally important. Such Guru's life itself is a teaching.   
However, the teachers whom I mentioned first fumbled in their lives   
and ultimately proved that it is all prattle without practice. Even   
J.K. fumbled at the dusk of his life, when he slept with disciple   
Rajagopal's wife Ms. Rosalind. Ms. Rosalind became pregnant and   
JK took her to a doctor for abortion. What a great fall.

Ah but it is one thing to have a fall and learn from it and quite another to  
carry on with evil, selfish behavior all the way through their lives.   
This is just one of many examples of what Adi Da did to his "disciples": He  
made two married heterosexual men have sex with each other in front of their  
wives.   
Simply for his own amusement.   
This kind of behavior is WAY beyond the norm for what could be considered a  
"slip-up" Most non-spiritual people would never treat people so badly   
much less someone proclaiming themselves the most spiritual person in history  
(Above Buddha and Ramana) The level to which he stretched   
human decency is genuinely hard to understand. I have no respect for him or  
Rajneesh/Osho and I can only consider them to be spiritual counterfeits.   
Having said that please understand that criticising a teacher is something I  
hesitate very strongly to do. It takes quite a bit to make my opinion so  
strongly
