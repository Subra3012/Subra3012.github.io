**Letter 145**   
Four or five days ago, some devotees who were going for Giripradakshina, asked  
me to accompany them and so I went with them after obtaining Bhagavans  
permission. By the time we reached Adi Annamalai, it began to rain and so we  
took shelter in a small mutt by the side of the road. I asked a sadhu who was  
there, Whose is this mutt? It is Manivachakars he said. When I enquired  
about the circumstances under which the mutt happened to be built, he narrated  
all sorts of stories. I could not understand what exactly he said; even then I  
listened to him patiently, without further questioning, in the hope of getting  
the required information from Bhagavan himself later.   
Yesterday I waited for an opportunity to enquire about this but Bhagavan was  
busy reading the story about Sundaramurti in the Kaleswara Mahatmyam. This  
Kaleswara Mahatmyam is a part of Brahmavaivartha Puranam. He read out to us  
the portion relating to Sundaramurti going to the Kaleswara Temple but before  
entering it, Sundaramurti went for a bath to the Gaja Pushkarini Tank which  
was opposite.   
When he came out of the tank after his bath, he found that the temple had  
vanished. So Sundaramurti sang a few songs, expressing his regret at going to  
the tank for a bath and not to the temple first for the Lords darshan.  
Thereafter the temple reappeared. After reading some more portions of the  
story Bhagavan remarked, Everything appeared to him first as a large expanse  
of water and nothing else and later as Jyothi (divine light).   
**A devotee enquired, It is said that Arunachalam is also a form of Jyoti.   
Yes. It is so. For the human eye it is only a form of earth and stone but its  
real form is Jyoti, said Bhagavan.** Taking advantage of this opportunity I  
asked, There is a mutt in Adi Annamalai in the name of Manikkavachakar. What  
could be the reason for its being named like that? Oh! That one. It seems he  
came to Tiruvannamalai also in his pilgrimage. He then stood at that  
particular place and addressing Arunagiri, sang the songs Tiruvempavai and  
Ammanai. Hence the mutt got established there, in commemoration. You must  
have heard of the Tiruvempavai songs; they are twenty in number.   
Andal sang thirty songs in praise of Lord Krishna and in the same strain  
Muruganar also has sung songs in praise of me, said Bhagavan.   
**DEVOTEE: How did this Mountain get the name Annamalai?   
BHAGAVAN: That which is not reachable by Brahma or Vishnu is Annamalai. That  
means it is the embodiment of the Jyoti which is beyond word or mind. Anna  
means unreachable. That is the cause of the name.**   
 _DEVOTEE: But the mountain has a form and a shape.   
BHAGAVAN: When Brahma and Vishnu saw it, it appeared as a pillar of Light  
enveloping the whole universe.   
It was only later that it appeared like a mountain. This is Ishwaras sthula  
sariram (gross body). Jyothi itself is the sukshma sariram (subtle body). That  
which is beyond all these bodies is the Reality. Subtle means the Tejas  
(illumination which fills the whole universe)._   
DEVOTEE: Was it the same thing even to Sundaramurti?   
BHAGAVAN: Yes. At first it appeared as Jalamayam (expanse of water),  
subsequently as Tejas (Lustre all round) and finally to the human eye it  
appeared as a temple.   
**Mahatmas always look with divine eyes. Hence everything appears to them as  
Pure Light or Brahman.**   
NAGAMMA: Bhagavan has, I believe, written a padyam (verse) about the birth or  
appearance of the Arunachala Linga, is it true?   
BHAGAVAN: Yes. I wrote it on a Sivarathri day in the year Vikrama, when  
somebody asked for it. Perhaps I have written it in Telugu also.   
NAGAMMA: Yes. It is stated in that Telugu padyam that the linga appeared in  
dhanurmasam on the day of the Arudra star; that Vishnu and the devas  
worshipped Siva who gave divine vision to them; that was in the month of  
Kumbha.   
What is the original story? And what was the occasion for the festivities  
connected with the Krithika star?   
BHAGAVAN: Oh! That! Brahma and Vishnu were quarrelling as to who was greater.  
In the month of Kartika, on the day of the Krithika star, a luminous pillar  
appeared between them. To mark that event, a festival of lights is celebrated  
on that day every year. You see, both Brahma and Vishnu got tired of their  
fruitless search for the beginning and the end of the pillar. Depressed by  
defeat they met at a common place and prayed to God Almighty when Lord Siva  
appeared before them in the pillar and graciously blessed them. At their  
request, He agreed to be within their reach for worship in the shape of the  
mountain and the Linga (in the temple). He also told them that if they  
worshipped Him thus, He would after a time, come out in the shape of Rudra and  
would help them in all possible ways. Then He disappeared. From then onwards,  
in the month of Dhanus, on the day of the Arudra star, Brahma and Vishnu began  
to worship the Linga that had manifested itself according to the promise of  
Ishwara. As they continued the worship from year to year in the second half of  
the month of Kumbha on the thirteenth/fourteenth day at midnight, Siva  
manifested Himself from that Linga and was then worshipped by Hari and the  
devas. Hence that day is called Sivarathri as stated in the Linga Puranam, and  
Siva Puranam. It seems it is only from then onwards the worship of the Linga  
commenced. It is emphatically stated in Skanda Purana that it is only in  
Arunachala that the first Linga manifested itself.

Anna means in Tamil 'that which cannot be comprehended or seen.' Initially   
when Siva showed Himself as a huge column of light, Brahma and Vishnu   
could never see the effulgence that was so bright nor could they see Its   
top and bottom. Then in Masi Sivaratri Day, It appeared as a mountain.   
Thus got the name Annamalai. Aruna also means Sun or Effulgence in Sanskrit.   
Arunachala Siva.
