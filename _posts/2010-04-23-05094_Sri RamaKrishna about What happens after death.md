A devotee: Revered Sir, what happens after death?   
Ramakrishna: Keshab Sen asked me the same question. **So long as a man remains  
in ignorance, in other words,so long as he has not realized God, he will be  
subject to rebirth;** but after Divine realization one does not come back to  
this earth, nor is he born in any other world.   
Potters after making earthen pots dry them in the sun. Have you not seen that  
there are pots which are baked in fire and others that are unbaked? When a pot  
of unbaked clay is broken, the potter uses the same clay to make a new pot;  
but if a baked pot is broken, the pieces are of no further use and he throws  
them away.   
 **Similarly, when the ego is not baked in the fire of wisdom, after death it  
will appear in another form and be born again and again.** If a fried grain is  
planted. it will not germinate; in the same manner, he whose inner nature is  
fried in the fire of wisdom is no longer subject to evolution, but attains to  
absolute freedom from rebirth. [p. 278]

Precisely Bhagavan Ramana has said the same thing. All Brahma   
Jnanis speak the same truth. Bhagavan Ramana used to ask: "Find out for whom this question of death and after death arises.   
It is for the mind. Find out what the mind (ego) is."   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Some Incidents In The Life Of Sri Ramakrishna (As Told By Himself)  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 22, 2010, 09:28:01 AM

**Days of struggle**   
 **I practised austerities for a long time. I cared very little for the body.  
My longing for the Divine Mother was so great that I would not eat or sleep. I  
would lie on the bare ground, placing my head on a lump of earth, and cry out  
loudly: "Mother, Mother, why dost Thou not come to me?" I did not know how the  
days and nights passed away.** I used to have ecstasy all the time. I saw my  
disciples as my own people, like children and relations, long before they came  
to me. I used to cry before my Mother, saying: "O Mother! I am dying for my  
beloved ones (Bhaktas); do Thou bring them to me as quickly as possible." [p.  
208]   
**All desires fulfilled**   
 _At that time whatever I desired came to pass. Once I desired to build a  
small hut in the Panchavati for meditation and to put a fence around  
it.Immediately after I saw a huge bundle of bamboo sticks, rope, strings and  
even a knife, all brought by the tide in front of the Panchavati. A servant of  
the Temple, seeing these things, ran to me with great delight and told me of  
them. There was the exact quantity of material necessary for the hut and the  
fence._   
When they were built, nothing remained over. Everyone was amazed to see this  
wonderful sight. When I reached the state of continuous ecstasy, I gave up all  
external forms of worship; I could no longer perform them. Then I prayed to my  
Divine Mother: "Mother, who will now take care of me? I have no power to take  
care of myself. I like to hear Thy name and feed Thy Bhaktas and help the  
poor. Who will make it possible for me to do these things? Send me someone who  
will be able to do these for me." As the answer to this prayer came Mathura  
Babu, [*+] who served me so long and with such intense devotion and faith!  
Again at another time I said to the Mother: "I shall have no child of my own,  
but I wish to have as my child a pitre Bhakta, who will stay with me all the  
time. Send me such an one." Then came Rakhal (Brahmananda). Those who are my  
own are parts of my very Self. [p. 209]   
 **Distaste for Worldly conversation**   
 **Nothing but discourses on God appealed to me at this period. If I heard  
worldly conversation, I would sit in a corner and weep bitterly.** When I went  
with Mathura Babu to Benares, I was sitting with him in the drawing-room when  
some friends came in to see him and began to discuss worldly affairs. "So much  
we have gained, so much we have lost." Hearing this I was in tears and cried  
aloud: "Mother, why hast Thou brought me here? I was much better off in the  
Temple.   
I have come to the Holy City to hear only of lust and gold; but there in the  
Temple I did not have to listen to such conversation." I was at this time like  
a young boy and so Mathura Babu fulfilled all the desires that arose in my  
mind. My heart and soul, however, were constantly longing to hear about the  
Supreme Being. [p. 216]   
 **Longing to hear about the Supreme**   
I searched for the places where the Holy Scriptures were expounded. There was  
a Brahmin in the neighborhood who was a great pandit and who had true faith. I  
used to go to hear him very often. A saint lived near by on the bank of the  
Ganges and I wished to go with this Brahmin to see him; but a priest who  
looked upon the world as a dream discouraged me by saying: "The body of a  
saint is an earthly cage; what good can one obtain by visiting such a cage?" I  
spoke of this to the Brahmin and he replied: "He who thinks of God, he who  
repeats His Holy Name and has renounced everything for the sake of the Lord,  
must not be regarded as an earthly cage. The priest does not know that the  
form of a devotee is a spiritual form full of Divine intelligence." **This  
Brahmin once asked me why I had thrown away my Brahminical thread. I replied: "When the storm of Divine ecstasy overtook my heart and soul, it blew away all  
signs of caste and creed.  
**Absolute frankness**   
 **During this period I was absolutely outspoken. I observed no formality or  
etiquette; I was fearless. Once I met a rich Zemindar and asked him: "What is  
our highest duty? Is not the attainment of God our highest duty?" He replied: "We are men of the world; salvation is not for us. When even Yudhisthira, the  
purest and most perfect of mortals, had to see purgatory in a vision because  
he had once wavered for half a second from absolute Truth, what can we expect  
for ourselves?" I could not bear his words and rebuked him sharply, saying: "What kind of man are you that you think of the momentary vision of purgatory?   
You must not think of that, but of Yudhisthira's truthfulness, forgiveness,  
patience, right discrimination, renunciation, devotion and love for God."  
At another time I went to see a Zemindar who had the title of Raja, and I told  
him plainly that I could not call him Raja because he was not really one. One  
day I saw a pious Brahmin who was counting his beads on the bank of the  
Ganges. I stood near him and knew that his mind was not fixed on God but on  
earthly things. Immediately I roused him by striking him on the shoulder. At  
another time Rashmoni, the founder of the Temple, was praying in the Temple  
while I was singing the holy song of the Divine Mother. I perceived that her  
mind was on worldly objects and instantly I roused her in the same manner. In  
amazement she folded her hands and remained motionless before me. vii [p. 218  
& 219]
