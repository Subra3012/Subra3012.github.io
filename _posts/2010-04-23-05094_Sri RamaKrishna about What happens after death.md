A devotee: Revered Sir, what happens after death?   
Ramakrishna: Keshab Sen asked me the same question. **So long as a man remains  
in ignorance, in other words,so long as he has not realized God, he will be  
subject to rebirth;** but after Divine realization one does not come back to  
this earth, nor is he born in any other world.   
Potters after making earthen pots dry them in the sun. Have you not seen that  
there are pots which are baked in fire and others that are unbaked? When a pot  
of unbaked clay is broken, the potter uses the same clay to make a new pot;  
but if a baked pot is broken, the pieces are of no further use and he throws  
them away.   
 **Similarly, when the ego is not baked in the fire of wisdom, after death it  
will appear in another form and be born again and again.** If a fried grain is  
planted. it will not germinate; in the same manner, he whose inner nature is  
fried in the fire of wisdom is no longer subject to evolution, but attains to  
absolute freedom from rebirth. [p. 278]

Precisely Bhagavan Ramana has said the same thing. All Brahma   
Jnanis speak the same truth. Bhagavan Ramana used to ask: "Find out for whom this question of death and after death arises.   
It is for the mind. Find out what the mind (ego) is."   
Arunachala Siva.
