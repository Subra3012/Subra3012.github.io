Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi   
Wh _en Shankara, the Guru of the world, was travelling in the western parts of  
India and overcoming in debate the expounders of the various schools of  
thought, he once came to a village known as Srivali. When a brahmin inhabitant  
of the village named Prabhakara heard about his arrival he went to him with  
his thirteen year old son. He prostrated before Sankara and made his son also  
prostrate. He then explained that the boy had been dumb from his childhood,  
that he had no likes and dislikes, nor a sense of honour and dishonour, and  
that he was completely inactive. The Guru then raised the boy up and asked him  
as follows in a cheerful tone:_   
 **Text**   
1\. `Who are you? Whose child are you? Whither are you bound? What is your  
name? Whence have you come? Oh Child! I should like to hear your reply to  
these questions.' Thus spoke Sri Shankaracharya to the boy, and Hastamalaka  
replied as follows.   
2\. I am neither man, God, yaksha, brahmin, kshatriya,vaisya, sudra,  
brahmachari, householder, forest-dweller, nor sannyasi; but I am pure  
awareness alone.   
3\. Just as the sun causes all worldly movements, so do I -- the ever-present,  
conscious Self -- cause the mind to be active and the senses to function.  
Again, just as the ether is all-pervading, yet devoid of any specific  
qualities, so am I free from all qualities.   
4\. I am the conscious Self, ever-present and associated with everything in  
the same manner as heat is always associated with fire. I am that eternal,  
undifferentiated, unshaken Consciousness, on account of which the insentient  
mind and senses function, each in its own manner.   
 **5\. I am that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent as the  
image in a mirror is not independent of the object reflected.**   
6\. I am the unqualified, conscious Self, existing even after the extinction  
of buddhi, just as the object remains ever the same even after the removal of  
the reflecting mirror.   
7\. I am eternal Consciousness, dissociated from the mind and senses. I am the  
mind of the mind, the eye of the eye, ear of the ear and so on. I am not  
cognizable by the mind and senses.   
 **8\. I am the eternal, single, conscious Self, reflected in various  
intellects, just as the sun is reflected on the surface of various sheets of  
water.**   
9\. I am the single, conscious Self, illumining all intellects, just as the  
sun simultaneously illumines all eyes so that they perceive objects.   
10\. Only those eyes that are helped by the sun are capable of seeing objects,  
not others. The source from which the sun derives its power is myself.   
 **11\. Just as the reflection of the sun on agitated waters seems to break  
up, but remains perfect on a calm surface, so also am I, the conscious Self,  
unrecognizable in agitated intellects though I clearly shine in those which  
are calm.**   
12\. Just as a fool thinks that the sun is entirely lost when it is hidden by  
dense clouds, so do people think that the ever-free Self is bound.   
13\. Just as the ether is all-pervading and unaffected by contact, so also  
does the ever-conscious Self pervade everything without being affected in  
anyway. I am that Self.   
14\. Just as a transparent crystal takes on the lines of its background, but  
is in no way changed thereby, and just as the unchanging moon on being  
reflected on undulating surfaces appears agitated, so is it with you, the all-  
pervading God.   
15\. As this stotra reveals the Self as clearly as the amalaka fruit placed on  
the palm of the hand (hasta), it received the name Hastamalaka Strotra.  
Moreover, the boy, eminent in jnana, came to be praised by all people of this  
world as Hastamalaka.   
The father of the boy was speechless with wonder at those words. But the  
Acharya said to him: `He has become your son because of his incomplete  
austerities. This is your good fortune. He will not be of any use to you in  
this world. Let him stay with me.' He bade him go back and, taking the boy  
with him, proceeded on his way. The disciples then asked him: `How did this  
boy attain the state of Brahman without hearing, etc.?' The Guru replied: `His  
mother left her two year old child in the care of a great and highly  
accomplished yogi who was practising austerities on the bank of the Yamuna  
while she went to bathe in the river with some women. The child toddled  
towards the water and was drowned. Out of his compassion for the disconsolate  
mother the sadhu forsook his body and entered that of the child. That is why  
this boy has attained this high state.'

## Final Part - Ellam Ondre - 'All is One' Recommened by Ramana Maharshi  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: April 20, 2010, 12:41:27 PM

Chapter III - GOD   
1\. **Who is God?** God is He who has transcended all that is seen by us. If  
transcending this world, is there no relation between Him and this world? Not  
a particle here is unrelated to Him. Then what is meant by transcending the  
world? The world comprises us and the objects seen by us. In other words, the  
animate and inanimate together form the world. What shall we say of Him who  
created the beings and things? Of these two, we say the conscious beings to be  
superior. **All that we can apprehend is that He belongs to the highest order  
of beings known to us. Our intellect cannot proceed further. Thus, our Creator  
is superior to us; He cannot be apprehended by our intellect;** therefore His  
Name, Transcended Being, "Kadawul," means that He surpasses our intellect.  
Hence His Name is "Kadawul" \- Transcended Being.   
2\. Can God then not be made known to us? Not quite so. In a way, He is known  
to us. This much of His Grace is enough for us. We have no need for all His  
Greatness. He has made known so much of His Greatness as will suffice to  
eradicate our misery. There is no reason for Him to reveal a jot more of His  
Power than is necessary to remedy our defects in the present state. Thus He is  
known according to our needs. Nay, He is in our grasp. However limitless, He  
is within reach of our knowledge to some extent.   
3\. What is it which brings Him within reach of our knowledge? That He is  
known as Being-Consciousness-Bliss.   
Being denotes that which is imperishable, that which exists forever. Should He  
become nonexistent at any time, who is His Destroyer? Who created Him? Since  
the perishable nature of all leads to the inference that they are lorded over  
by One who is imperishable, this immortal Overlord is God. His imperishable  
nature is Being (Sat).   
 **Now, what is Consciousness (Chit)? By Consciousness we mean knowledge.**  
This is absolute Knowledge, and not like our erring intellectual knowledge.  
Irregularity or mistake cannot stain its actions. It is Knowledge, pure and  
simple. Frequently He teaches us saying, "Your knowledge is irregular and  
erring." How orderly are even the insentient objects of His creation! It is  
known to many how an atheist was taught a good lesson when he derided the  
scheme of things saying, "Why did He make the seed so small for the banyan  
tree which is so big?" That an insentient thing is found in good order and  
later becomes useful, implies a conscious agency at work. Can a simple,  
insentient thing do something which is possible for unfailing knowledge only?  
Or, can't it be done by our inadequate knowledge? No, it can never be.  
Therefore God is said to be Consciousness (Chit) also.   
 **Now, what is Bliss? It is the state of being free from desire for anything.  
It is Peace which is ever full.** Were He to desire anything, how could He be  
better than ourselves? How could we gain Bliss from Him? He Himself would  
require another being to fulfil His desires. But who would think Him to be so?  
The state of self-contentment is that of Bliss also. Therefore He is called  
Bliss (Ananda).   
The three-Being, Consciousness and Bliss-are inseparable; otherwise, they  
would become naught individually. Hence, He is known as Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss (Satchitananda). Thus God remains not only transcendent but also falls  
within the reach of our knowledge as Being-Consciousness-Bliss.   
4\. He who has gained the fourth state and sees all as one, only he knows God  
truly as Being-Consciousness-Bliss. Words cannot express nor the ears hear how  
such a one is united with God; it is a matter of realization. But there are  
ways and means for such realization. They can be spoken of, learned and acted  
upon.   
5\. He who can be realized thus, is God. He has no name; we give Him a name.  
He has no form; we give Him a form. Where is the harm in doing so? What name  
is not His, or what form is not His? Where is the sound or form in which He is  
not? Therefore, in the absence of true knowledge of Him you can name Him as  
you please or imagine Him as of any form so to remember Him. Your hope for His  
Grace without any effort on your part is utterly fruitless. Should it be  
possible to have His Grace without any effort on your side, all would be  
alike; there would be no reason for any difference. He has shown us the ways  
and means. Make effort, reach the goal, be happy. Your idleness and  
selfishness make you expect His Grace without your effort. The rule for all is  
for you too. Do not relax your efforts. God can be realized by your effort  
only.   
6\. There is an effort which excels all others. This may, however, appear to  
be less effective than devotion to God with name and form. Nevertheless, this  
is the more efficient. It is simply the love which you extend to all beings,  
whether good or bad. In the absence of such love to all, your devotion to God  
amounts to a mere parody. Of what use are you to God? That you seek fulfilment  
of your desires from God without doing your duty towards the needy in the  
world must be attributed to your selfishness. In God's presence, there is no  
use for such. The workings that take place in His presence are all unselfish.  
Therefore, think that all the Centers are His and He is in all the Centers and  
thus be devoted to Him. God is truly bound by such high devotion.   
7\. As you go on ascribing names and forms to God and showing love to all  
because you have understood all names and forms to be His, your mind will  
gradually mature. Just as the taste improves with the ripening of a fruit, so  
also you will recognize the waxing of good and the waning of evil in you. As  
your mind matures, there will come a time when you should meet your Master.  
This is not to say that you go in search of him or he comes in search of you.  
At the right time the meeting will happen. All are moving in their own ways.  
Your fitness brings you together, makes you trust him, makes him teach you the  
right way, also makes you follow the his instructions. That is the straight  
way to reach God, which is to gain the fourth state. You will follow the way  
and reach your goal which is Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is God.   
8\. The way shown by the Master is final, straight and making for unity. It is  
well-tried, natural, and free from pain. When you are following the way shown  
by the master, doubts will not arise; there will be no fear. Are not fear and  
doubt the characteristics of the ways of darkness? How can they meet you in  
the way of Truth shown by the Master? In this manner, the way will itself  
speak to you and say that it is the right one. In that way, there will be  
nothing more for you to do but to meet your Master and learn from him. That  
way will be familiar to you, as the Master and God have made it so. Before  
you, he had treaded the way. He has shown you the way and you are following  
him. To how many will you show the same way? And how many more will follow the  
same way later? Obviously fear and doubt have no place in the way of truth.  
When once you have taken a step forward you will step back. The master's help  
is only for the first step forward. You need not do anything for your master  
in order to have the way shown to you. Know him to be the messenger of God  
sent down to disclose the way to the fit who have become ripe by their own  
efforts in either or both the directions mentioned earlier. It is God who  
sends this godly messenger just when you are ripe.   
9\. Practice with faith in the period of ignorance is called Bhakti; the same,  
with knowledge, is called Jnana. Of the two divisions of Bhakti, the one is  
devotion to God with name and form, and the other is karma which is love for  
all. Of the two divisions of Jnana, the practice of the true way shown by the  
Master is called yoga and the resulting state is called Jnana. It is natural  
for all to believe in something which is not seen and then to find it. Those  
who do not believe can never find. Therefore, the believers will gain  
something sometime or other and the unbelievers never gain anything. You can  
believe even for the simple reason that faith in God is not harmful. Thereby  
you can share the good effects. **This world is meant only for creating faith  
in you. This is the purpose of creation. Have faith and you can reach God.**   
10\. Though you may not believe all that is said of God, believe at least  
"There is God." This seed is very potent in its growth. It is so mighty as to  
negate all else and fill all by itself. It is so almighty that you will not  
see anything besides God, not even yourself. Truly, God is all.   
 **Chapter IV - Peace**   
1\. **What is peace? Although the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,  
does he have any cares concerning it? His mind is tranquil and refreshed.**  
Should his mind be in the same degree calm and refreshed even when he is face  
to face with the world and is active therein, then there is peace.   
2\. Can the mind remain so even when the world confronts us? It depends upon  
our estimate of the world. The mind is more excited when one's own property is  
plundered than when another's property is similarly plundered. Of one's own  
things, the loss of one thing causes greater concern than those of another.  
Why? Because our estimate of the things is the cause of the degree of the  
delight or anxiety concerning them. Therefore, should one learn to regard all  
equally, the mind will be extremely peaceful. Or should all things be  
considered as our own and highly prized, then too there is no cause for pain.  
Why? What will a man regret? **The mind which knows that universal concern is  
beyond its capacity, must needs become tranquil. Also when one feels that one  
has no claim on anything or that everything is perishable, the mind will  
remain cool.** Thus there will be lasting peace if one looks on all as of the  
same value. Peace is dependent upon one's intellectual appraisals.   
 _3\. I shall now illustrate this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is  
happy or troubled according to his opinion of the things seen in the dream.  
But on waking, his mind remains unaffected by all the happenings in the dream;  
it remains the same. Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to value all  
the matters of the dream equally. He is not sorry for the cessation of the  
dream. Why? He is convinced that the dream is not everlasting and must end on  
waking. In the same manner, should a man be convinced that he cannot but wake  
up sometime from the long dream of the world, his mind will be unchanging. It  
is the state of freshness. This is the state of Peace._   
4\. This is not to say that his relation with the world will cease. Now only  
peace and freshness of the mind are his. His actions cannot but vary according  
to circumstances. **The only change in him after the mind has become peaceful  
is this: his mind has known the truth and become unattached; therefore, it  
rests in peace. His actions though changeful will always be impartial.** But  
the actions of others are changing and cannot be impartial. Thus, the coolness  
of the mind produces enormous good not only to himself but also to the world  
at large. Peace shows the way to right conduct.   
5\. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his hand. Can there be any hostility  
between the light and the ups and downs on the way? There cannot be. But light  
and darkness cannot be together. The light chases away darkness, it discloses  
the ups and downs on the way and makes the man walk carefully, whether he  
moves up, down, or sideways. It removes the cause of vain complaints, such as,  
"That snag hurt my foot" or "This hollow made me slip." Similarly, after peace  
is gained, the state of peace makes the man neither hate nor antagonize the  
world. Rather it dispels the darkness which conceals from our view the true  
nature of the world and its snags. In the absence of the light of Peace which  
enables people to adjust themselves to varying circumstances, they condemn the  
world as full of misery, as they would complain of the snags on the road.  
**Therefore a man who has gained the utmost peace after knowing the whole  
world as a complicated dream, should not be considered either unrelated to the  
world or unconcerned with its activities; he alone stands in effective concord  
with it; only he is competent to be a man of action. Thus Peace is that which  
regulates one 's duties.**   
6\. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world lies in  
rectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of  
reformation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to  
possess it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To  
guide the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one's eyesight  
must itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has  
already discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the world  
and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can anyone be  
so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls? So also for  
the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world and help the  
people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the mind and body the  
sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the world, just as the  
life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass over the corpse it  
has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from work or trouble. Only  
truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolness.   
7\. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But in effect, it  
beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After all, success  
depends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple over, the  
incident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or it will  
leave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spiritual  
matters. **True happiness in the world is his, and that happiness comes out of  
release from bondage. Peace means doing good to any one in any manner.**   
8\. The obstacles to peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When  
they confront us we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of the  
mind distant from even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushed, it  
will lose its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be useful to  
you, nor can it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that your  
mind is more delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful mind, all  
your duties to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Let it  
release the same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are  
contained in Peace.   
9\. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the flower of your mind.  
Let the children of the mental modes watch this worship. Gradually they will  
learn to cast away their childish pranks and desire to delight like yourself.  
As they watch your Peace, they will themselves recoil from their vagaries.  
Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away by the vagaries of the mind.  
On the contrary, they should become peaceful by your peace. All must get  
peace.   
10\. I shall finish in one word: **The essence of all the Vedas is "Peace."**

Subramanian Garu,   
You had done a great service reproducing Sankara Vijayam.   
May guru ramana blessings be with you always.   
I had a doubt regarding when did sankara wrote Govindashtakam ?   
One place it was said that   
Quote  
Sankara proceeded to the Dakshina Ujjaini Temple, singing Govindashtakam.  
Then later it was mentioned   
Quote  
Sri Sankara also composed the famous Govindashtakam in Sri Nagar.  
So please do let us know the exact place he omposed the famous Govindashtakam.   
Also Subramanian Garu in the complete biography **it was not mentioned  
anywhere about 'Atma Bodha'?**   
Once again thanks a lot for your great service in reproducing the life stories  
of great saints.

Dear prasanth,   
In the absence of recorded history those days, there are no   
clear cut dates and places about various works of Sri Sankara.   
For example, there is only a clear message in Sankara Vijayam   
biography that Sankara composed Dasa Sloki when he was with   
Govinda Bhagavad Pada in Narmada valley cave. But regarding   
Atma Bodha, Govindashtakam and other works there are no   
clear cut information.   
Again I wrote Sankara Vijayam story based on Brahmasri Nochur   
Venkataraman's Sat sangh which lasted for about 7 days spread   
over 20 hours. He has said the same thing. He has referred about   
5 biographies of Sankara and has conducted the Sat sangh. He   
is silent about Kanchi Math, since Sankara Vijayam does not say   
anything about Kanchi Math. Even his ascent to Sarvajana Peetam   
was in Sarada Temple, Sri Nagar. (Not today's Sri Nagar).   
Again, there is no mention about the writing of Viveka Choodmani   
at all! So, some scholars say that these works were NOT written   
by Sankara, which Nochur Venkataraman denies.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian R for this information.   
I feel there might be lot of interpolations in Sankara Vijayam work.   
But anyhow there is nothing we gain in these kind of discussions and better to  
concentrate on those great works like atma bodha,vivekachudamani etc and not  
to bother who is the author of those works.   
Its like when we want join the college we care only about the way lectures  
teach the lessons rather than who is the director of the college and his  
background.

was in Sarada Temple, Sri Nagar. (Not today's Sri Nagar).   
Again, there is no mention about the writing of Viveka Choodmani   
at all! So, some scholars say that these works were NOT written   
by Sankara, which Nochur Venkataraman denies.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian R for this information.   
I feel there might be lot of interpolations in Sankara Vijayam work.   
But anyhow there is nothing we gain in these kind of discussions and better to  
concentrate on those great works like atma bodha,vivekachudamani etc and not  
to bother who is the author of those works.   
Its like when we want join the college we care only about the way lectures  
teach the lessons rather than who is the director of the college and his  
background.
