Subramanian Garu,   
You had done a great service reproducing Sankara Vijayam.   
May guru ramana blessings be with you always.   
I had a doubt regarding when did sankara wrote Govindashtakam ?   
One place it was said that   
Quote  
Sankara proceeded to the Dakshina Ujjaini Temple, singing Govindashtakam.  
Then later it was mentioned   
Quote  
Sri Sankara also composed the famous Govindashtakam in Sri Nagar.  
So please do let us know the exact place he omposed the famous Govindashtakam.   
Also Subramanian Garu in the complete biography **it was not mentioned  
anywhere about 'Atma Bodha'?**   
Once again thanks a lot for your great service in reproducing the life stories  
of great saints.

Dear prasanth,   
In the absence of recorded history those days, there are no   
clear cut dates and places about various works of Sri Sankara.   
For example, there is only a clear message in Sankara Vijayam   
biography that Sankara composed Dasa Sloki when he was with   
Govinda Bhagavad Pada in Narmada valley cave. But regarding   
Atma Bodha, Govindashtakam and other works there are no   
clear cut information.   
Again I wrote Sankara Vijayam story based on Brahmasri Nochur   
Venkataraman's Sat sangh which lasted for about 7 days spread   
over 20 hours. He has said the same thing. He has referred about   
5 biographies of Sankara and has conducted the Sat sangh. He   
is silent about Kanchi Math, since Sankara Vijayam does not say   
anything about Kanchi Math. Even his ascent to Sarvajana Peetam   
was in Sarada Temple, Sri Nagar. (Not today's Sri Nagar).   
Again, there is no mention about the writing of Viveka Choodmani   
at all! So, some scholars say that these works were NOT written   
by Sankara, which Nochur Venkataraman denies.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian R for this information.   
I feel there might be lot of interpolations in Sankara Vijayam work.   
But anyhow there is nothing we gain in these kind of discussions and better to  
concentrate on those great works like atma bodha,vivekachudamani etc and not  
to bother who is the author of those works.   
Its like when we want join the college we care only about the way lectures  
teach the lessons rather than who is the director of the college and his  
background.
