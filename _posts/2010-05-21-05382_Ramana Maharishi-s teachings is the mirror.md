## Ramana Maharishi's teachings is the mirror

Day by day reading His teachings is like looking into mirror. Everyday it  
requires cleaning because lots of dirt is accumulated.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. If one could read everyday, some works of Bhagavan Ramana   
or various biographies and notings of His devotees, that shall surely   
clean up our mind with all dirt accumulating every day.   
Arunachala Siva.
