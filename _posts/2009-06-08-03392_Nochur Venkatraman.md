Has anyone here heard his talks? It is simply sublime. He is a great devotee  
of Ramana and explains his teachings in such a lucid manner that it is a treat  
to listen. Seems he had a great personal experience as a child (kind of  
realisation) and came to accept Ramana as his guru. I came to really  
understand Ramana's teachings through him only. He is very young and gives  
talks in Tamil & Malayalam in many cities including Bangalore on many topics  
such as Ramana's works, Gita, Bhagavatha etc. His followers has created a  
website nochurlisteners.com to share his knowledge.

Dear mmohan,   
I am absolutely happy to know more about Nochur Venkatraman. I heard him for  
a few days in Sri Sankara TV, where he was talking on the topic Acharya  
Sankara Vaibhavam.   
In that talk, he many instances about Bhagavan Ramana's   
teachings and devotees' experiences. In fact, I wrote a post   
about him in Forum. He started his talks with the famous   
dhyana sloka on Bhagavan: Aparasatchit sukavarirashe...   
As ill-luck would have it, after about 5 or 6 days, his talks   
were no longer telecast in Sri Sankara TV. I told my wife   
about this loss of ours, many times. Your news   
about his own talks in various cities and the web address   
is really a happy news. Thank you,   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, Nochur is great Discourser and has the ability to attract spiritual  
aspirants. I have arranged to get all his Pravachanams collections from one of  
my cousin who has all of them. I have listened to his discourse on Ramana  
Maharshi in English, its very nice and one on the topic of Atma Vicharam,   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj,   
I am happy you have collected the pravachanam collections   
of Nochur Venkatraman. Please share his 'talks' with us   
through the Forum. I opened his web nochurlisteners.com   
and there is some limited information there about his programmes. He is  
visiting Bangalore and giving talks   
in Malleswaram in Sep 2009.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have collection of most of his talks on Ramana (various works like  
Aksharamana Malai etc), Bhagavatham & Gita. Whatever be the topic, he will  
revert back to Ramana and his teaching and personal life incidents every few  
minutes, so much is his devotion to his Guru. As he says, Ramana has opened  
the greatest secret for salvation - the "Who am I" enquiry method which is the  
shortest and only method to finally reach the goal. Just listening to his  
voice is so soothing and his words come from his heart.   
I had the good fortune of meeting him at his residence for clearing certain  
personal doubts. He is most simple, humble & honest like a child with no airs  
and easily approachable unlike some other guru's and jnani's. He is a living  
embodiment of Ramana's teaching. He does not believe in creating organizations  
and gathering followers, only in transferring the great knowledge to sincere  
seekers. Seems in his childhood he has seen many deaths in his family and  
started to enquire at a very young age and visited many saints and sages  
before finally arriving at Ramana Samadhi in Ramanashramam and that was the  
end of his search. I had once listened to his talks on Ramayana at  
Ramanashramam itself and found it very hard to withstand the high vibration  
and energy. He spends a few weeks every now and then in total silence in  
Ramanashramam, otherwise does not travel much. He is a PhD in Sanskrit from  
Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University, Kalady, the birth place of Sankara.

Dear mmohan,   
I am profoundly thankful to you for giving us, many more   
details about Sri Nochur Venkatraman. You are quite   
fortunate to have listened to him also and that too in   
Sri Ramanasramam. We have in this 21st century, such   
great rubies and saffires who are less known to most of   
us. Perhaps Nochur Venkatraman may be another Ramana   
for the sake of present day people. His talks in Sri Sankara   
TV, for about 5 or 6 days were wonderful. He spoke in   
Malayalam mixed Tamil of Palakkad, with many quotations   
in Sanskrit and many anecdotes from Bhagavan Ramana.   
I was telling my wife that I was reminded of Sri Sankara's   
verse in Sri Sivananda Lahari: "O Siva, you are like a grain   
amidst the chaff which are other gods." Nochur Venkatraman proved within that  
short duration that he is a Ruby amongst glass-stones!   
Thank you. Please share further information about Nochur   
if you have.   
Arunachala Siva.

When I heard about the Sankra Tv from Subramaniyan ji, I felt very sorry for  
not having that particular channel in my Desh. I got lots of useless   
channels except Sankara Tv. At the same time I wanted to know more about the  
him. I think it is Bhagavan's grace I read more about Nochur from these posts.   
Thanks to mmohan for writing about Nochur.   
Ramanaduli
