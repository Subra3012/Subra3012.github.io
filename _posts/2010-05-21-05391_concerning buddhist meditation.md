## concerning buddhist meditation

I would like share a teaching that I recieved concerning meditation.   
first dont be surprised in buddhist terminology conciousness is not the same  
like in vedanta. here it is part of hte skandhas, and as such part of the  
experience of samsara.   
awereness holds the place of witnessing conciousness...I think you could say  
this.   
conciousness is the ever moving part of the mind, you know it quiet good, you  
write something in the forum, suddenly you hear a noise, your conciousness  
follows it, and after some time comes back, then you get disturbed by thirst,  
you get up and get a glass of water etc...its always moving...   
so conciocusness is the skandha wich interacts with the world of hte senses,  
thoughts, feelings etc (the other skandhas), it is said htat the phenomena of  
samsara have a kind of shimmering quality, a clarity, the conicousness sees  
that and graps it. So it moves about between following a thought, feeling a  
sensation in the body etc. this is the naural movement of the mind, its a  
given thing...   
in vipassana meditation for example you start with following your breath, when  
youre attention wanders oyu bring it back...when the attention is fixed, then  
you move up to the fontanel of the head and start to scan your body, from head  
to toes, very slowly, and from toes again to the head....   
you recognize all sensations, maybe name it very briefly and move on like: "ears are stitching" etc.   
besides this you try to catch conciousness in hte prosess of creating a sense  
of self, of personality out of the sensations...   
so there is the experience (wich is direct, always fresh) and then there is  
conciousness saying "thats my experience". in vipassana you try to recognize  
this process between, direct experience and "that is my experience"   
that would be to see the natural movement of conciousness, and at the same  
time triing to focus on the creating of a fixed or solid persona, wich owns  
and is created out of a chain of "experiences"..   
\   
in dzogchen meditation it is about resting as awereness.   
awereness is always fresh, has infinit potential to manifest, is patient with  
all that arises, is in peace with all that arises, it is not increased from a  
possitive experience and it does not decline in a negative experience..   
when you sit down to rest as awereness then conciousness will play its tricks,  
its natural.   
if you now set out to stop conciousness doing its work, then who does this?  
awereness is non-active...   
so thoughts arise, conciousess clings to them because they are very  
shiny...and you follow this thoughts you expereince yourself not as awereness  
but as conciousness, beeing one with the thoughts, beeing made of them, beeing  
in constatnt movement and thinking this to be real and that there is a fixed  
persona in the process...   
what to do?   
if you do something against it, then you would work with conciousness.   
you have to recollect yourself, feeling and touching the immidiacy of hte  
experience again, seeing clearly "Iam following thoughts, Iam wandering and  
Iam lost in samsara" and this recognition brings you back to awereness, wich  
is the witness of conciousness...   
conciousness in a way happens in awereness...awereness is the space that  
contains all skandhas   
may it be virtous

Dear matthias,   
Excellent description of Buddhist meditation. Even some writers   
on Bhagavan Ramana's direct path, have said that the word Awareness, is the  
more appropriate word, than consciousness.   
Consciousness is normally equated to being "conscious or aware of   
the external happenings." Awareness, these writers say, would   
mean the Self-Consciousness or Being.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you for the simple explanation.   
The practice must be difficult, i guess.   
The benefit of control of the mind is immense.   
Swami Vivekanda stated that 'when the mind is concentrated and turned back on  
itself, all within us will be our servants and not masters'.   
to do this we need to go beyond the sense world.   
Can you let us know what tips are offered in this process.   
Nama Sivayya

dear Hariharaputra   
Iam not in the possition to give you instructions concerning meditation...all  
I wrote is what I kept in my mind from the last dharma teachings I  
recieved..so it didnt originated from my realisation or meditational practice.   
anyway it inspired myself, so I thought it might be inspiring to others as  
well..   
having said this I will try to answer from what I know(conceptually): to go beyond the senseworld you have to go through the sense world, (the  
skandhas in buddhism, one of them is conicousness).   
so the skandhas are natural, they are given, you cannot avoid them, if oyu try  
to avoid them you work with conciousness not with awereness...awereness does  
not and cannot avoid anything...it is always close to what is happening, but  
it is at the same time not touched by what is happening.   
maybe this helped?   
may it be virtous   
matthias

a better word for consciousness in this might be "attention", because what  
you are describing is attention of the mind. consciousness and awareness  
would be the same here, the unchanging true nature of the self. its not  
really about going beyond or anywhere, but realizing what is always here.   
yes, all things come and go IN awareness. this is why no thing can touch or  
change awareness, because no thing is separate from it.   
 i too hope this helps.

dear beloved abstract   
conciousness is the term the translators choosed for vijnana...so I did not  
choose it, and I also dont think that attention is a better word for  
it..they'll know what to do   
and as I said in the buddhist context it is translated in this way, in the  
translation of vedanta it is translated int he way you present it "awereness"  
nad "conciousness" beeing words for the same unchanging reality....I wrote it  
right before I started my summary....   
please dont bring me in a position where I have to change the whole english  
buddhist kanon, it would be a terrible work   
the rest of your reply is the truth indeed   
I found this problem was allready present in some translations and graham  
posted something about this here: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4205.0
