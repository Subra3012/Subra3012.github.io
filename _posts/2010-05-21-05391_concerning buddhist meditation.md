## Shankaracharya's Drik Drisya Vivekam  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: May 21, 2010, 08:45:42 AM

**Readers Note** : Drik Drisya Vivekam Commentary By sri Sundara Chaitanya  
Swami Garu videos in telugu are available in the below link   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=DhrugDhrushyaVivekam+Volume&search_type=&aq=f   
This composition of Shankaracharya was translated into Tamil by Sri Bhagavan.  
Bhagavan also composed the following introductory verse and introduction.   
 _Oh thou divine Shankara,   
Thou art the Subject   
That has knowledge   
Of subject and object.   
Let the subject in me be destroyed   
As subject and object.   
For thus in my mind arises   
The light as the single Siva._   
 **Introduction**   
âBrahman is only one and non-dualâ declare the Srutis. **Since Brahman is  
the sole reality, according to advaita, how is it that Brahman is not apparent  
to us**, whereas the prapancha (world, i.e., non-Brahman) is so vivid? Thus  
questions the advanced sadhaka.   
 **In oneâs own Self, which is no other than Brahman, there is a mysterious  
power known as avidya (ignorance) which is beginningless and not separate from  
the Self. Its characteristics are veiling and presentation of diversity.   
Just as the pictures in a cinema, though not visible either in sunlight or in  
darkness,become visible in a spot of light in the midst of darkness, so in the  
darkness of ignorance there appears the reflected light of the Self, illusory  
and scattered, taking the form of thought.   
This is the primal thought known as the ego, jiva or karta (doer), having the  
mind as the medium of its perceptions.The mind has a store of latent  
tendencies which it projects as the object of a shadow-show in the waking and  
dream states.This show, however, is mistaken for real by the jiva. The veiling  
aspect of the mind first hides the real nature of the Self and then presents  
the objective world to view.**   
Just as the waters of the ocean do not seem different from the waves, so also  
for the duration of objective phenomena, the Self, though itself the sole  
being, is made to appear not different from them. Turn away from the delusion  
caused by latent tendencies and false notions of interior and exterior. _By  
such constant practice of sahaja samadhi, the veiling power vanishes and the  
non-dual Self is left over to shine forth as Brahman itself._   
This is the whole secret of the advaita doctrine as taught by the master to  
the advanced sadhaka. Here the same teaching is contained, which Sri  
Shankaracharya has expounded concisely without any elaboration, in the  
following text.   
 **The Text**   
All our perception pertains to the non-Self. The immutable Seer is indeed the  
Self. All the countless scriptures proclaim only discrimination between Self  
and non-Self.   
 **The world we see, being seen by the eye, is drisya (object);the eye which  
sees it is drik (subject). But the eye, being perceived by the mind is drisya  
(object) and the mind which sees it is drik (subject). The mind, with its  
thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (object) and the Self is drik  
(subject).The Self cannot be drisya (object), not being perceived by anything  
else. The forms perceived are various, blue and yellow, gross and subtle, tall  
and short, and so on; but the eye that sees them remains one and the same.  
Similarly, the varying qualities of the eye, such as blindness, dullness and  
keenness and of the ears and other organs, are perceived by the mind singly.  
So, too, the various characteristics of the mind, such as desire,  
determination, doubt, faith, want of faith, courage,want of courage, fear,  
shyness, discrimination, good and bad,are all perceived by the Self singly.  
This Self neither rises nor sets, neither increases nor decays. It shines of  
its own luminosity. It illumines everything else without the need for aid from  
other sources.**   
 **Note:** Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says   
**We are self(witness) because we are witnessing various thoughts perceived by  
the mind and hence we are not mind also but only witness.**   
Buddhi, as the sum total of the inner organs, in contact with the reflected  
consciousness has two aspects. One is called egoity and the other mind. This  
contact of the buddhi with the reflected consciousness is like the identity of  
a red-hot iron ball with fire. Hence the gross body passes for a conscious  
entity. The contact establishing identity between the ego and the reflected  
Consciousness, is of three kinds.   
1\. The identification of the ego with the reflected Consciousness is natural  
or innate.   
2\. The identification of the ego with the body is due to past karma.   
3\. The identification of the ego with the witness is due to ignorance.   
The natural or innate contact continues as long as the buddhi, but on  
realization of the Self it proves to be false.The second mentioned  
contact,that born of past karma, ceases to exist on the destruction of innate  
tendencies (vasanas).The third mentioned contact is broken when it is  
discovered by experience that there is no sort of contact of anything at all  
with the Self, which is Being.   
 **In the deep sleep state, when the body is inert, the ego is fully merged  
(in the causal ignorance).The ego is half manifest in the dream state, and its  
being fully manifest is the waking state. It is the mode or modification of  
thought (with its latent tendencies) that creates the inner world of dreams in  
the dream state and the outer world in the waking state. The subtle body,  
which is the material cause of mind and ego, experiences the three states and  
also birth and death.**   
 **Note** : _Acc to Sundara Chaitanya Swami Garu Here half ego in dreams means  
there is no kartha(doer) but only bhoktha(enjoyer).Reason is will a person who  
has lends money to person B asks the same amount in dreams and accepts the  
dream money? No because the dream body is different and there is no kartha in  
dreams._   
Maya of the causal body has its powers of projecting (rajas) and veiling  
(tamas). It is the projecting power that creates everything from the subtle  
body to the gross universe of names and forms. These are produced in the Sat-  
Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss) like foam in the ocean. The veiling  
power operates in such a way that internally the distinction between subject  
and object cannot be perceived,and externally that between Brahman and the  
phenomenal world. This indeed is the cause of samsara. The individual with his  
reflected light of Consciousness is the subtle body existing in close  
proximity with the Self that is the vyavaharika (the empirical Self). **This  
individual character of the empirical Self appears in the witness or sakshi  
also through false superimposition.** But on the extinction of the veiling  
power (tamas), the distinction between witness and the empirical Self becomes  
clear; and the superimposition also drops away.   
_**Note** : Acc to Sundara Chaitanya Swami Garu superimposition is like rope  
and snake.So our ignorance(miseries) are like super imposition like we think i  
am thin,i am not good..etc though indeed we are only witness. _   
_Maya has 2 charcteristics.One is avarana(veling power) is like covering the  
truth. Second is vikhepana(projection) means though there is no snake and only  
rope but we feel there is snake.   
Aham Vritti is not there in deep sleep.   
Avarana is like deep sleep where we are not aware of the world,body..._   
Similarly, Brahman shines as the phenomenal world of names and forms only  
through the effect of the veiling power which conceals the distinction between  
them. When the veiling ends,the distinction between the two is perceived, for  
none of the activities of the phenomenal world exist in Brahman.   
Of the five characteristics, Being, Consciousness, Bliss,name and form, the  
first three pertain to Brahman and name and form to the world. The three  
aspects of Being,Consciousness and Bliss exist equally in the five elements of  
ether, air, fire, water and earth and in devas (gods), animals,men, etc.,  
whereas the names and forms are different.   
 **Therefore, be indifferent to names and forms, concentrate on Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss and constantly practise samadhi (identity with Brahman)  
within the Heart or outside.**   
 **Note** : _Acc to Sundara Chaitanya Swami Garu we cannot accept  
ignorance,miseries anytime.   
We will try to iradicate it immediately.For example before sleep husband tells  
wife that he will tell some secret in next morning.Naturally wife wants to  
iradicate he ignorance so she keeps asking some clues or atleast some idea  
etc.So it means our nature is to iradicate ignorance as soon as possible._   
This practice of samadhi (identity with Brahman) is of two kinds: savikalpa  
(in which the distinction between knower,knowledge and known is not lost) and  
nirvikalpa (in which the above distinction is lost).   
Savikalpa samadhi again is of two kinds: that which is associated with words  
(sound), and meditation on oneâs own consciousness as the witness of thought  
forms such as desire, which is savikalpa samadhi (internal), associated with  
(cognizable) objects.   
First kind is of Savikalpa samadhi is related to words(sound).   
Other kind is of Savikalpa samadhi is related to Drusyam.   
In Savikalpa samadhi Drik And Drusya are still existing.   
Realizing oneâs Self as âI am Being-Consciousness-Bliss(witness) without  
duality,unattached, self-effulgentâ, is savikalpa samadhi (internal)  
associated with words (sound).   
Coming to nirvikalpa samadhi from Savikalpa samadhi is like a river merged in  
a ocean   
Giving up both objects and sound forms of the aforesaid two modes of samadhi  
and being completely absorbed in the Bliss experienced by the realization of  
the Self is nirvikalpa samadhi (internal).   
In this state steady abidance is obtained, like the unflickering flame of a  
light kept in a place free from wind. So also, in the Heart, becoming  
indifferent to external objects of name and form and perceiving only Being of  
(or as) Sat, is savikalpa samadhi (external) associated with objects; and  
being aware continually of that Sat (true existence) as the unbroken single  
essence of Brahman is savikalpa samadhi (external) associated with words  
(sound).   
After these two experiences, Being, which is uninterrupted like the waveless  
ocean, is nirvikalpa samadhi (external).One who meditates should spend his  
time perpetually in these six kinds of samadhi. By these, the attachment to  
the body is destroyed and the mind that perpetually abides in the Supreme Self  
(paramatman) wherever it may wander, is everywhere spontaneously in samadhi.   
By this constant practice of samadhi, the supreme Self, who is both highest  
and lowliest,who encompasses Paramatman as well as jivatman is directly  
experienced, and then the knot of the Heart is loosened; all doubts are  
destroyed and all karmas (activities) cease too.   
Of the three modes of individual being, the limited self (as in deep sleep),  
the empirical self (as in the waking state) and the dreaming self, **only the  
individual limited by the deep sleep state is the true Self (paramarthika)**.  
Even he is but an idea. The Absolute alone is the true Self.   
In reality and by nature he is Brahman itself, only superimposition creates  
the limitations of individuality in the Absolute. It is to the paramarthika  
jiva that the identity of Tat-tvam-asi (That thou art) and other great texts  
of the Upanishads applies, and not to any other. The great maya (the  
superimposition without beginning) with her veiling and projecting power  
(tamas and rajas) veils the single indivisible Brahman and, in that Brahman,  
creates the world and individuals. The individual (jiva), a concept of the  
empirical self in the buddhi, is indeed the actor and enjoyer and the entire  
phenomenal world is its object of enjoyment.   
From time without beginning, till the attainment of liberation, individual and  
world have an empirical existence. They are both empirical. The empirical  
individual appears to have the power of sleep in the shape of the veiling and  
projecting powers. It is associated with Consciousness. The power covers first  
the individual empirical self and the cognized universe, and then these are  
imagined in dream.   
**These dream perceptions and the individual who perceives them are illusory,  
because they exist only during the period of dream experience.We affirm their  
illusory nature,because on waking up from dream no one sees the dream,no one  
sees the dream objects. The dreaming self experiences the dream world as real,  
while the empirical self experiences the empirical world as real but, when the  
paramarthika jiva is realized, knows it to be unreal.   
The paramarthika jiva, as distinguished from those of the waking and dream  
experiences,is identical with Brahman.** He has no âotherâ. If he does see  
any âotherâ, he knows it to be illusory.   
The sweetness, liquidity, and coldness of water are characteristics present  
equally in waves and foam. So, too,the Being-Consciousness-Bliss character of  
the Self (the paramarthika) is present in the empirical self and through him  
in the dream self also, because of their being only illusory creations in the  
Self. The foam with its qualities, such as coldness, subsides in the waves,  
the waves with their characteristics, such as liquidity, subside in the water,  
and the ocean alone exists as at first. Similarly, the dream self and its  
objects are absorbed in the empirical self; then the empirical world with its  
characteristics is absorbed in the paramarthika and, as at first, Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss which is Brahman shines alone.

## concerning buddhist meditation  
Author: matthias            Date: May 21, 2010, 11:08:09 AM

I would like share a teaching that I recieved concerning meditation.   
first dont be surprised in buddhist terminology conciousness is not the same  
like in vedanta. here it is part of hte skandhas, and as such part of the  
experience of samsara.   
awereness holds the place of witnessing conciousness...I think you could say  
this.   
conciousness is the ever moving part of the mind, you know it quiet good, you  
write something in the forum, suddenly you hear a noise, your conciousness  
follows it, and after some time comes back, then you get disturbed by thirst,  
you get up and get a glass of water etc...its always moving...   
so conciocusness is the skandha wich interacts with the world of hte senses,  
thoughts, feelings etc (the other skandhas), it is said htat the phenomena of  
samsara have a kind of shimmering quality, a clarity, the conicousness sees  
that and graps it. So it moves about between following a thought, feeling a  
sensation in the body etc. this is the naural movement of the mind, its a  
given thing...   
in vipassana meditation for example you start with following your breath, when  
youre attention wanders oyu bring it back...when the attention is fixed, then  
you move up to the fontanel of the head and start to scan your body, from head  
to toes, very slowly, and from toes again to the head....   
you recognize all sensations, maybe name it very briefly and move on like: "ears are stitching" etc.   
besides this you try to catch conciousness in hte prosess of creating a sense  
of self, of personality out of the sensations...   
so there is the experience (wich is direct, always fresh) and then there is  
conciousness saying "thats my experience". in vipassana you try to recognize  
this process between, direct experience and "that is my experience"   
that would be to see the natural movement of conciousness, and at the same  
time triing to focus on the creating of a fixed or solid persona, wich owns  
and is created out of a chain of "experiences"..   
\   
in dzogchen meditation it is about resting as awereness.   
awereness is always fresh, has infinit potential to manifest, is patient with  
all that arises, is in peace with all that arises, it is not increased from a  
possitive experience and it does not decline in a negative experience..   
when you sit down to rest as awereness then conciousness will play its tricks,  
its natural.   
if you now set out to stop conciousness doing its work, then who does this?  
awereness is non-active...   
so thoughts arise, conciousess clings to them because they are very  
shiny...and you follow this thoughts you expereince yourself not as awereness  
but as conciousness, beeing one with the thoughts, beeing made of them, beeing  
in constatnt movement and thinking this to be real and that there is a fixed  
persona in the process...   
what to do?   
if you do something against it, then you would work with conciousness.   
you have to recollect yourself, feeling and touching the immidiacy of hte  
experience again, seeing clearly "Iam following thoughts, Iam wandering and  
Iam lost in samsara" and this recognition brings you back to awereness, wich  
is the witness of conciousness...   
conciousness in a way happens in awereness...awereness is the space that  
contains all skandhas   
may it be virtous

Dear matthias,   
Excellent description of Buddhist meditation. Even some writers   
on Bhagavan Ramana's direct path, have said that the word Awareness, is the  
more appropriate word, than consciousness.   
Consciousness is normally equated to being "conscious or aware of   
the external happenings." Awareness, these writers say, would   
mean the Self-Consciousness or Being.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[2] concerning buddhist meditation  
Author: Hariharaputra       Date: May 21, 2010, 12:12:52 PM

Thank you for the simple explanation.   
The practice must be difficult, i guess.   
The benefit of control of the mind is immense.   
Swami Vivekanda stated that 'when the mind is concentrated and turned back on  
itself, all within us will be our servants and not masters'.   
to do this we need to go beyond the sense world.   
Can you let us know what tips are offered in this process.   
Nama Sivayya

dear Hariharaputra   
Iam not in the possition to give you instructions concerning meditation...all  
I wrote is what I kept in my mind from the last dharma teachings I  
recieved..so it didnt originated from my realisation or meditational practice.   
anyway it inspired myself, so I thought it might be inspiring to others as  
well..   
having said this I will try to answer from what I know(conceptually): to go beyond the senseworld you have to go through the sense world, (the  
skandhas in buddhism, one of them is conicousness).   
so the skandhas are natural, they are given, you cannot avoid them, if oyu try  
to avoid them you work with conciousness not with awereness...awereness does  
not and cannot avoid anything...it is always close to what is happening, but  
it is at the same time not touched by what is happening.   
maybe this helped?   
may it be virtous

a better word for consciousness in this might be "attention", because what  
you are describing is attention of the mind. consciousness and awareness  
would be the same here, the unchanging true nature of the self. its not  
really about going beyond or anywhere, but realizing what is always here.   
yes, all things come and go IN awareness. this is why no thing can touch or  
change awareness, because no thing is separate from it.   
 i too hope this helps.

dear beloved abstract   
conciousness is the term the translators choosed for vijnana...so I did not  
choose it, and I also dont think that attention is a better word for  
it..they'll know what to do   
and as I said in the buddhist context it is translated in this way, in the  
translation of vedanta it is translated int he way you present it "awereness"  
nad "conciousness" beeing words for the same unchanging reality....I wrote it  
right before I started my summary....   
please dont bring me in a position where I have to change the whole english  
buddhist kanon, it would be a terrible work   
the rest of your reply is the truth indeed   
I found this problem was allready present in some translations and graham  
posted something about this here: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4205.0

Dear matthias,   
Excellent description of Buddhist meditation. Even some writers   
on Bhagavan Ramana's direct path, have said that the word Awareness, is the  
more appropriate word, than consciousness.   
Consciousness is normally equated to being "conscious or aware of   
the external happenings." Awareness, these writers say, would   
mean the Self-Consciousness or Being.

Thank you for the simple explanation.   
The practice must be difficult, i guess.   
The benefit of control of the mind is immense.   
Swami Vivekanda stated that 'when the mind is concentrated and turned back on  
itself, all within us will be our servants and not masters'.   
to do this we need to go beyond the sense world.   
Can you let us know what tips are offered in this process.

dear Hariharaputra   
Iam not in the possition to give you instructions concerning meditation...all  
I wrote is what I kept in my mind from the last dharma teachings I  
recieved..so it didnt originated from my realisation or meditational practice.   
anyway it inspired myself, so I thought it might be inspiring to others as  
well..   
having said this I will try to answer from what I know(conceptually): to go beyond the senseworld you have to go through the sense world, (the  
skandhas in buddhism, one of them is conicousness).   
so the skandhas are natural, they are given, you cannot avoid them, if oyu try  
to avoid them you work with conciousness not with awereness...awereness does  
not and cannot avoid anything...it is always close to what is happening, but  
it is at the same time not touched by what is happening.   
maybe this helped?   
may it be virtous

a better word for consciousness in this might be "attention", because what  
you are describing is attention of the mind. consciousness and awareness  
would be the same here, the unchanging true nature of the self. its not  
really about going beyond or anywhere, but realizing what is always here.   
yes, all things come and go IN awareness. this is why no thing can touch or  
change awareness, because no thing is separate from it.   
 i too hope this helps.

conciousness is the term the translators choosed for vijnana...so I did not  
choose it, and I also dont think that attention is a better word for  
it..they'll know what to do   
and as I said in the buddhist context it is translated in this way, in the  
translation of vedanta it is translated int he way you present it "awereness"  
nad "conciousness" beeing words for the same unchanging reality....I wrote it  
right before I started my summary....

## concerning buddhist meditation  
Author: matthias            Date: May 21, 2010, 11:08:09 AM

I would like share a teaching that I recieved concerning meditation.   
first dont be surprised in buddhist terminology conciousness is not the same  
like in vedanta. here it is part of hte skandhas, and as such part of the  
experience of samsara.   
awereness holds the place of witnessing conciousness...I think you could say  
this.   
conciousness is the ever moving part of the mind, you know it quiet good, you  
write something in the forum, suddenly you hear a noise, your conciousness  
follows it, and after some time comes back, then you get disturbed by thirst,  
you get up and get a glass of water etc...its always moving...   
so conciocusness is the skandha wich interacts with the world of hte senses,  
thoughts, feelings etc (the other skandhas), it is said htat the phenomena of  
samsara have a kind of shimmering quality, a clarity, the conicousness sees  
that and graps it. So it moves about between following a thought, feeling a  
sensation in the body etc. this is the naural movement of the mind, its a  
given thing...   
in vipassana meditation for example you start with following your breath, when  
youre attention wanders oyu bring it back...when the attention is fixed, then  
you move up to the fontanel of the head and start to scan your body, from head  
to toes, very slowly, and from toes again to the head....   
you recognize all sensations, maybe name it very briefly and move on like: "ears are stitching" etc.   
besides this you try to catch conciousness in hte prosess of creating a sense  
of self, of personality out of the sensations...   
so there is the experience (wich is direct, always fresh) and then there is  
conciousness saying "thats my experience". in vipassana you try to recognize  
this process between, direct experience and "that is my experience"   
that would be to see the natural movement of conciousness, and at the same  
time triing to focus on the creating of a fixed or solid persona, wich owns  
and is created out of a chain of "experiences"..   
\   
in dzogchen meditation it is about resting as awereness.   
awereness is always fresh, has infinit potential to manifest, is patient with  
all that arises, is in peace with all that arises, it is not increased from a  
possitive experience and it does not decline in a negative experience..   
when you sit down to rest as awereness then conciousness will play its tricks,  
its natural.   
if you now set out to stop conciousness doing its work, then who does this?  
awereness is non-active...   
so thoughts arise, conciousess clings to them because they are very  
shiny...and you follow this thoughts you expereince yourself not as awereness  
but as conciousness, beeing one with the thoughts, beeing made of them, beeing  
in constatnt movement and thinking this to be real and that there is a fixed  
persona in the process...   
what to do?   
if you do something against it, then you would work with conciousness.   
you have to recollect yourself, feeling and touching the immidiacy of hte  
experience again, seeing clearly "Iam following thoughts, Iam wandering and  
Iam lost in samsara" and this recognition brings you back to awereness, wich  
is the witness of conciousness...   
conciousness in a way happens in awereness...awereness is the space that  
contains all skandhas   
may it be virtous
