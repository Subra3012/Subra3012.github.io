Achutahananda's book of songs is aptly titled Advaita Kirtana Ananda Lahari  
(The Blissful Wave of   
Advaitic Songs). His songs are well known even today among Tamizh bhaktas.   
He spent several years traveling and giving lectures until 1902. In that  
year, the year called Subhakrithu,   
from the Tamizh month of Aavani until the month of Aippasi, he visited his  
disciples and advised them,   
'Oh, the most loved sons! Don't waste precious time. Seek Atamanubhava  
(direct experience of the Self)   
and attain eternal bliss.' He also added, 'This is my final visit.'   
In the second day, of Karthika month, he came to the house of his disciple Sri  
Arangasami Mudaliar,   
in Vallam village in Vellore district and started writing a book on Jnana  
Sastra titled Sanmarga   
Darpanam (The Mirror Revealing the Direct Methods of Attaining the Eternal  
Self.)   
(It was at Bhagavan's explicit command that the book was published with a  
commentary by Swamigal's   
disciple, Sadhanapani Ramachandra Guruswamigal. The book was published in  
1926. A copy was kept   
in Bhagavan's revolving book case in the Old Hall.. Now it is in Asramam  
archives.

Arunachala Siva.
