## Five Mothers for each person  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 22, 2009, 02:12:20 PM  
---  
An old Tamil (or Sanskrit?) poem has stated that each person has   
got five mothers. Who are they?   
* One's own biological mother.   
**One's wife's mother [Skanda and Indrani]   
 One's Guru's wife [ I am not able to find a puranic example]   
 One's King's wife [Jnana Sambandha and Queen Mangayarkarasi]   
 One's elder brother's wife [ Lakshman and Sita]   
Arunachala Siva.

What is Tamil Sangam ? who were the poets, were they Buddhists or Jains or  
Hindus?   
Acccording the Thiruvanaikaval history Kocengannan existed earlier in 1st  
millennium BC, one of earlier Cholas kings and at the same time great temples  
were already existed that time. The question is did hindusim was in decline  
period with the rise of buddhist and jains. Were Pallavas in fact earlier  
hindu and later jains then to back to hindus.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
1\. There were three Tamil Sanghams. The first one was supposed   
to be existing around 2nd Century BC. The place was the then   
capital of Pandya Kings, which is called South Madurai. This is not   
today's Madurai. This was somewhere very much down below in the   
south, which portion was called Lemuria in Greek stories. There   
was a tsunami and much of the deep southern Tamil Nadu was   
engulfed by seas. In this first Tamil Sangam, Siva and Muruga   
themselves were supposed to be the leading poets in human forms.   
There is an old Tamil poem which says: "The God with matted locks   
who burnt Tripura with his third eye, and Kumara, the god who pierced the  
mountain (Krouncha) with his spear, were the first Tamil   
poets.   
2\. The second and third Tamil Sanghams were in Kapadapuram, which is again  
extinct and today's Madurai. This was between 2nd   
Century AD and 5th Century AD.   
3\. Tamil Nadu witnessed the rise of Buddhism and Jainism around   
4th Century AD. Whenever kings were supporting these faiths,   
Siva temples were in disrepair. No proper poojas were held. When   
Tiru Jnana Sambandhar took birth (he is again Skanda), he vanquished these  
faiths and restored Saivism to its pristine glory.   
This was around 6th century.   
4\. The later kings including Pallavas, who ruled the northern Tamil   
Nadu from Cuddalore to Madras, were also frequently switching   
over their faiths and they were brought back to Saivism by some   
miracles. Saivism had no quarrel with Advaita, in fact it is Siva-   
Sakti qualified non dualism. Hence Sankara's avatara in 7th century   
did not make much difference even though Advaita took roots slowly   
due to its pre-eminent approach. Vaishnavism and Saivism both thrived in  
Tamil Nadu. There were quarreling over philosophy, and   
supremacy of Siva over Narayana and vice versa, but the temples were not  
affected.   
5\. Saivism spread to Sri Lanka during Saint Manikkavachagar's   
time. But this Saint's period is a historical mystery. Many hold   
a view that he lived around 9th century. But I believe that he   
lived before the great three, that is around 3rd Century AD. He   
told pure Jnana Marga in his works, whereas the other three spoke   
of bhakti marga even though they admitted Jnana Marga as the final  
destination.   
For further details, if you want you may read "The rise of Tamil   
literature" by Vaiyapuri Pillai. The name in Tamil is Ilakkiya   
Udhayam. It is available in Saiva Siddhanta Book Publishing House,   
Raja Annamalai Puram, Chennai.   
Arunachala Siva.
