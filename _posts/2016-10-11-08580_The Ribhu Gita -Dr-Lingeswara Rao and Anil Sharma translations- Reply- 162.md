8\. Getting rid of all, leaving the Guru, forsaking everything, ever,  
established in Brahman in silence.   
Bliss alone is.   
9. Ever rejoice by renouncing all. The renunciation of all is great joy. Renunciation of all is transcendental   
bliss. The renunciation of all is supreme happiness.   
10. Renouncing all is renouncing the mind. Renouncing all is renouncing the ego. Renouncing all is great   
oblation. Total renunciation is supreme happiness.   
11\. Total renouncing is great liberation. So is the sacrifice of the mind.  
Mind alone is the world ever. Mind   
alone is transmigration.   
12. Mind alone is great delusion. Mind alone is the generator of the body. Mind alone is the bodily fear.   
Mind alone is full of thought.   
13. Mind alone is what is called the world. Mind alone is the blemish. Mind alone is all insentience.   
Mind alone is the senses etc.,   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
