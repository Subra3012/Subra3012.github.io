## Who Am I ? Enquiry questions

I believe my questions must have been discussed extensively in this forum. But  
I still appreciate if someone could me some quick pointers.   
From **Who Am I ? Enquiry** : For all thoughts the source is the 'I' thought. The mind will merge only by  
Self-enquiry 'Who am I?' The thought 'Who am l?' will destroy all other  
thoughts and finally kill itself also. If other thoughts arise, without trying  
to complete them, one must enquire to whom did this thought arise. What does  
it matter how many thoughts arise? As each thought arises one must be watchful  
and ask to whom is this thought occurring. **The answer will be 'to me'.** If  
you enquire 'Who am I?' **the mind will return to its source** (or where it  
issued from). The thought which arose will also submerge. As you practise like  
this more and more, the power of the mind to remain as its source is  
increased.   
My questions: 1\. The answer will be 'to me': Me here refers to the ego/false I or the  
Self/real I.   
2\. the mind will return to its source: I can't see why after enquiring 'Who  
am I?', the mind will return to its source. It seems there is a big jump/gap  
between these two points(from enquiring to returning to its source).

Dear icameet,   
The first question: Thoughts occur for you i.e. your mind. And not   
for the Self within you. Hence the answer "to me" refers to your   
mind or ego or individual soul.   
Then, who am I?: The question who am I? is directed to your false   
I or ego. If you are not a mature practicer, the answer will come as,   
to me, to my mind. Are you the mind? No., Are you the individual Jiva -  
no...., when Who am I? will once again come. If your practice is quite  
mature, then the mind/ego shall go to its source, ie. the Self within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Let me attempt to fill the gap here.   
To whom did this thought arise?   
=> To me/the ego/the mind/the false I.   
=> That is the false I's thought. That is the false I's story.   
Who am I?   
=> I, the real I, am not that false I.   
=> That is the false I's thought/story and has nothing to do with Me.   
=> Don't identify with that thought. Don't be carried away by that thought.   
=> Turn attention away from that thought.   
=> Turn attention toward the Source.

Dear icameet,   
Nice.   
Turn inward to the Source - is the correct expression. Turn towards   
the Source, you have said. Since the Source is within, turn inwards   
or turn within will be a better expression.   
Nice.   
Arunachala Siva.
