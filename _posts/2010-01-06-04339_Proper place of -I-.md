## Thief

How is the ego to be destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks  
this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree to kill itself? This  
question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the  
ego you will find it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   
In this connection I am often reminded of a funny incident which took place  
when I was living in the West Chitrai Street in Madura. A neighbour in an  
adjoining house anticipated the visit of a thief to his house. He took  
precautions to catch him. He posted policemen in mufti to guard the two ends  
of the lane, the entrance and the back-door to his own house. The thief came  
as expected and the men rushed to catch him. He took in the situation at a  
glance and shouted "Hold him, hold him. There-he runs-there-there.'' Saying so  
he made good his escape.   
So it is with the ego. Look for it and it will not be found. That is the way  
to get rid of it.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 5

Verse 89 of Sri Sivananda Lahari is again a beauty.   
Nathibhir nuthbhis thavmeecha bhuja-   
Vithibhir dhyana samadhibhir na thushta   
Dhanusha musalena chachmabhir vaa   
vadha the preetikaram dhatha karomi.   
O the Ruler of the Worlds! By bow and arrows, pounding logs,   
and stones, you become very happy. You do not even become   
so happy, even with namaskarams, stotrams and pujas and dhyana   
samadhis. Kindly tell me by which you shall have maximum   
satisfaction. And I shall do accordingly.   
Siva became happy when Arjuna hit Him with his arrows and He   
gave him Pasupatastra. In the story of Sakkya Nayanar, who did puja to Siva  
Lingam, by throwing stones at it, He became pleased and conferred him  
liberation. Sri Sankara adds here the pounding   
log also, as Nindastuti.   
Tayumanavar sings: By throwing stones, and hitting you with   
arrows, and throwing some green leaves, your devotees reached   
the shore. I am lowly without any devotion, what can I do to   
get your grace, O the Guru, who supported the non-injury to others as the  
first qualification to reach you!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Proper place of "I"  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 06, 2010, 02:37:59 PM

The proper place of "I" is the lotus feet of God.   
In all other places it will dance to its own tune.   
In the lotus feet of God it will dance to the divine tune.   
Hari Om.

Dear I,   
What you have said is exactly what Sri Vaishnavites call "Prapatti". Complete  
surrender, Sharanagati, being aware of the I's limitedness. Humbleness is  
effortless. a Sense of giving up.   
Krishna Says in Gita - 18 Chapter, 66 verse: Sarva Dharman Parityajya Maaekam Sharanam Vraja   
Sham Tvaaam Sarva Paapebhyo Mokshayisyaami Ma Sukah   
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver  
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
