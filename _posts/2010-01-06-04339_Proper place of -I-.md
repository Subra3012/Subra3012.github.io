## superset and subset

A student was asked to give an example of superset-subset relationship: He wrote: Superset A = {}   
Subset B = {mind, ego, thought}   
The teacher was angry. He asked: Why did you make the superset null?   
How will you get things from a null superset in a subset?   
The student scratched his head and replied: That is what I am learning.   
The teaching gave him 0, a rejection of null.   
A holy man saw it and gave him 0, a blessing of null.   
(A set is an unordered collection of elements)

## Thief

How is the ego to be destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks  
this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree to kill itself? This  
question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the  
ego you will find it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   
In this connection I am often reminded of a funny incident which took place  
when I was living in the West Chitrai Street in Madura. A neighbour in an  
adjoining house anticipated the visit of a thief to his house. He took  
precautions to catch him. He posted policemen in mufti to guard the two ends  
of the lane, the entrance and the back-door to his own house. The thief came  
as expected and the men rushed to catch him. He took in the situation at a  
glance and shouted "Hold him, hold him. There-he runs-there-there.'' Saying so  
he made good his escape.   
So it is with the ego. Look for it and it will not be found. That is the way  
to get rid of it.

## Proper place of "I"

The proper place of "I" is the lotus feet of God.   
In all other places it will dance to its own tune.   
In the lotus feet of God it will dance to the divine tune.   
Hari Om.

Dear I,   
What you have said is exactly what Sri Vaishnavites call "Prapatti". Complete  
surrender, Sharanagati, being aware of the I's limitedness. Humbleness is  
effortless. a Sense of giving up.   
Krishna Says in Gita - 18 Chapter, 66 verse: Sarva Dharman Parityajya Maaekam Sharanam Vraja   
Sham Tvaaam Sarva Paapebhyo Mokshayisyaami Ma Sukah   
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver  
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
