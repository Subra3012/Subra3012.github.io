Verse 13: நான்தனக் கன்பின்மை   
 நானும்தா னும்அறிவோம்   
தானென்னை ஆட்கொண்ட   
 தெல்லாருந் தாமறிவார்   
ஆன கருணையும்   
 அங்குற்றே தானவனே   
கோனென்னைக் கூடக்   
 குளிர்ந்தூதாய் கோத்தும்பீ.   
That I have no love for Him is known to me and also to Him.   
Others do not know.   
However all are aware of His enslaving and ruling me.   
The redemptive mercy springs from Him only.   
He indeed is the God.   
O King-Thumpi,   
fare forth to Him and hum Him ? the Sovereign -,   
to unite with me.   
Arunachala Siva.
