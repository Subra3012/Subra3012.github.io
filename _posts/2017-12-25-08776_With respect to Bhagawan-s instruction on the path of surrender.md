Dear friends,   
I will like to solicit feedback from various members like Subramanian Sir,Anil  
Sir(vide his post on self enquiry),Udai Sir,RAvi Sir,Krishnan to name a few  
,and all others in this esteemed forum. Everybody's feedback is vital and  
requested, since each all of you, being intrinsically divine, have much to  
offer in terms of some facets of how the divine operates in this.   
I take reference to Bhagavan's instruction to Ms.M.A.Piggott wherein Bhagavan  
asks every thought to be killed at the root through self enquiry(pl refer the  
ashram's publication - Fragrant petals). In the same conversation he asks one  
to live in the present,throwing all worries to the divine.I take reference to  
numerous other conversations of Bhagavan on surrender.   
Of course as Bhagavan has said that all surrender is like removing a piece of  
jaggery from an idol made of jiggery and offering as Naivadya to the God, that  
that idol represents i.e what can we surrender when everything is actually his  
.But of course,Bhagavan meant the bhava of surrender without any reservations.   
All our lives whether related to work or home, we have to(or think we have to  
) plan a lot of things related to say our job,home front like timely  
commencement of tasks,reflections on payments to be made, children affairs to  
name a few,all of which apparently involve a lot of conscious thinking.If this  
conscious thinking is not done, we think that our world is crumble,we will be  
categorized as insane,a person who has renounced the world with no foot on  
practical living.   
Bhagavan seems to say that we can surrender without reservations and live in  
the moment joyously.It then seems that the Supreme will take our activities  
and implant the right thoughts at the right time, so that we need not  
apparently,try to conjure up thoughts to initiate critical action,(critical at  
that juncture as we perceive it ).Our life will be on autopilot governed by  
the supreme and we need not incessantly worry about anything.THings will be  
done in the best possible way and at the right time,and without any criticism  
from stakeholders dependent on us.   
I would like members to confirm above understanding and share their own view  
points on the above and perhaps experiences if they have practiced the same,  
in their own lives.Though talking about it is very difficult, it is solicited  
as a request for other sadhaks who would like to tread the same path.I know  
that that there is a thing called partial surrender but when Bhagavan has said  
that we have to surrender totally and reap the benefits,partial surrender  
seems to be just an excuse to postpone what is best for us. Hence, I am  
requesting members' viewpoints on this total surrender.   
regards,   
anand.

Beloved Abstract, stop harrassing forum members with your perverted and  
immature interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.

Confusing body with Self, one finds stories objectionable.   
When all is Self what relevance do stories have?   
To year after year repeatedly take offense with forum members' posts (stories)  
is to confuse body with Self.   
Apologies Anand.
