There are, in addition, two long anthologies of Tamizh poetry that contain  
more of Tattuvaraya's   
verses: Peruntirattu (The Great Anthlogy), and Kurunthirattu, (The Short  
Anthology). Though   
these anthologiists mostly contain works by other authors, Tattuvaraya  
contributed some verses   
to both collections, and he is also acknowledged as the compiler of both  
books.   
Muruganar, at Bhagavan's behest, composed Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai, modeling  
on Manikkavachagar's   
Tiruvavchakam. In another interesting parallel Tattuvaraya composed  
Paduturai, a 1140 verse collection   
of verses that are derived from contemporary folk songs. This work is also  
loosely based on Tiruvachakam.   
'The Lady Telling her Maid' poem that appeared earlier in this article comes  
from this collection of verss.   
A selection of verses from Paduturai will appear in one of next year's issues  
of Mountain Path.   
Though Tattuvaraya clearly played a Muruganar-like role in the life of  
Sorupananda, it is interesting and   
a little intriguing to note that Satyamangalam Venkatarama Iyer, the author of  
Sri Ramana Stuti Panchakam,   
addresses Bhagavan himself as 'Tattuvaraya' in the second line of verse 9 of  
Kalaip Pattu. This poem is chanted every Saturday evening in Bhagavan's  
Samadhi Hall.
