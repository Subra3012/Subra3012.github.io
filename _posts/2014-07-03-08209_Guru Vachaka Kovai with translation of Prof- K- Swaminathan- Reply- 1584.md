Verse 768 of Guru Vachaka Kovai of Muruganar: Those who with egos utterly destroyed   
Behold the truth, experience all the world   
As mere appearance, for they themselves   
Shine as the infinite space. They stand   
Convinced that all is but the Self,   
All made up only of Awareness.   
(Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
