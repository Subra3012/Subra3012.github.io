## An aid to self-enquiry

**An aid to self-enquiry**   
Practice of self-enquiry becomes more and more natural with regular practice.   
However if there be a day when the mind is a bit restless,   
or otherwise we want to try: Look at the eyes of Bhagavan and enquire within (by self-attention) : Where do Bhagavan's eyes point to?

Dear silentgreen,   
Welcome to Forum.   
Bhagavan's ardent devotees have said many things to focus the   
attention for quelling the mind from other thoughts. I would   
suggest the following: 1. Bhagavan Ramana's photograph, particularly the one taken in   
Virupaksha Cave at the age of 21. Look at His eyes. Whereever   
you stand in front of Him, His eyes will look at you! This is the   
wonder.   
2\. Any holy names prescribed by Bhagavan with full contemplation   
on Him. Siva, Siva or Arunachala Siva...   
3\. Reading WHO AM I? a few times, contemplating on Him. Reading   
every sentence slowly.   
4\. Thinking of Arunachala Hill.   
5\. Thinking of Arunachaleswara, the Siva Linga, short and majestic. My wife  
used to call him The Little Father!   
Arunachala Siva.

Very true.   
The rays of the Self are reflected through the eyes of the sages.

Dear munagala,   
There are mantras in Hindu system to get the lost item. But I do not know. I  
only use Arunachala Siva, which is the cure-all. Some   
members may laugh at the occasions on which I use this.   
1\. When there is an unscheduled power cut and when I am eager   
to see the Forum web and seek restoration of power.   
2\. When there is voltage fluctuation and the typed message does not get past.   
3\. When I misplace something.   
4\. When my wife misplaces her spectacles just before proceeding to bhajan  
classes.   
5\. When I get back ache and wants cure without applying Tiger balm.   
Kindly use this Maha mantra, and make intensive search in house,   
you are sure to get it.   
About 15 years back, I wrote a Tamil poem, which was published   
in a literary magazine. It reads somewhat,   
When I get tooth ache and suffer in pain,   
When I don't get my bus for office,   
When my young daugher runs a fever of 103 deg.F   
And I wait at the doctor where the queue is long,   
When I buy a ticket and await for results in lottery,   
And search for the number in the newspaper,   
Sri Rama Jayam, Sri Rama Jayam, Sri Rama Jayam,   
On all other occasions,   
I am the Victor, I am the Victor, I am the Victor!   
Arunachala Siva.

I will narrate one recent incident. It was on 1st Jan 2010, Bhagavan's  
Jayanti Day and Kanakammal's Liberation Day.   
The morning breakfast was served in the Asramam, around 7.00   
A.M. The crowd was already heavy. There were batches in the   
Dining Hall and also on the pandal erected between Old Hall   
and Cow's Samadhi. The crowds were swelling every hour. The   
lunch time was preponed to 11.00 AM because of the heavy crowds.   
Dr. Srinivasamurthy and his assistants were managing the crowds   
very efficiently without giving room for even the slightest anger   
or sulking. It was decided to permit people, first the womenfolk   
and children. My wife was permitted around 12 Noon in the second   
batch. But men were asked to wait. The Samadhi Hall shutters   
were put and there were already about 1000 people inside and another 800  
people outside. I was outside the shutters. I did not know what to do. To  
take food after 5 hours gap usually gives   
me some giddiness. I was feeling giddy. Nevertheless I wanted to stay inside  
the Asramam, and take food, because I had to leave   
by 3 PM on that day, and I did not want to miss the Jayanti prasadam. I  
started chanting Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... The group outside was  
allowed into the Hall, around 1 PM. I sat inside before Bhagavan Ramana  
chanting Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... I knew I was getting more and  
more giddy and I was just taking some water from the water bag in small  
quantities. I and others were permitted to the Pandal around 1.30 PM. The  
food was served very quickly and I had the prasadam of Bhagavan Ramana, to my  
heart's content. My wife came in between and asked: How are you? How are  
you? I said, I am not okay but I can manage.   
I did manage with Bhagavan Ramana's grace and with chanting   
of Maha Mantra.   
Arunachala Siva.

an even more recent incident   
I had sleepproblems for 5 days now...you see since one month I began to have  
sleeping problems 2 or 3 days a week, I had this before but it  
stopped...anyway it came again...   
this night was the 5th night without good sleep, I wasnt agnry or feeling to  
bad because of my sadhana...but anyway this night I felt very angry about the  
situation...not hatred but anger...   
and hten I remmebered this post, and your story dear subrmanian, (how you  
started with the maha mantra)   
and I prayed for sleep to bhagawan, and I started to chant the mantra...   
the sleep was not perfect but I felt very good in the morning...   
I know that mantras for sleep are somesort of last refuge because they may  
change hte unconcious processes that prevent from sleeping..and delay the  
solving of hte real problem...anyway I wanted sleep and with the grace of  
bhagawan I got it

Dear matthias,   
I am very happy to see your post. The idea, is whether it is hunger,   
or sleeplessness or pain or some dhukkam, sorrow, the mind flies   
in its full throttle with thoughts..thoughts...thoughts... This thought  
process over a hundred things can be curtailed only when one sticks to one  
thought. I use this Arunachala Siva, for many purposes.   
It has worked for me. It should work for you also. What is needed   
is faith and conviction in God or Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
I had serious problem, in finance and health, due to my "rather   
prematured" voluntary retirement of job. The savings I had   
lasted only for 2 years and my only son's higher education was   
not over. I had to rely on credit card borrowings, for another 2   
years and finally my son got an overseas appointment. Between   
2004-2006, I had suffered mental anguish and anxiety due to   
my pressing problems. I was slowly taking more more of sedatives   
even during day time. I was althrough reading Bhagavan Ramana,   
though not in great detail. Oneday I prayed to Him intently to   
tell me the way out. He told me in a dream, the Mahamantra   
and also said to me: If you trust me, I shall totally take control   
of you. But you should not take medicines more than prescribedd   
by the doctor! Use this Mahamantra for ALL your problems.   
I decided to go with Him. The medicines came down. I had peace.   
My son started sending money and cleared the credit card liabilities   
of about Rs 7 lacs and an interest of Rs 3 lacs in one year. Things   
became normal. I came into Bhagavan's fold permanently. The   
annual visits to T' malai became more frequent. I made 3 trips   
in 2008, 4 in 2009 and 1 in 2010 already. He is the Medicine of   
medicines.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Your post. Bhagavan Ramana's help is sure to come. It is our   
prarabdha that we suffer a little less or a little more. But one   
should never lose perseverence. You said you are reading Tiruppugazh songs.  
It is good. Bhagavan Himself has prescribed   
some Tiruppugazh songs to devotees. Is He not Skanda's avatara?   
Apart from Mahamantra, you may read the Seerpada Vaguppu,   
Devendra Sanga Vaguppu and Vel Vaguppu, which are called   
Mani-mantra-oushadam. The gem, mantra and medicine. Vallimalai   
Swamigal, the devotee of Bhagavan Ramana has prescribed this   
for devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.

There are six Skanda Sashti Kavacham, each for one Abode of   
Murugan. What is popularly read today is the one on Tiruchendur.   
What is said in that poem itself is as follows:-   
1\. Acharathutan angam thulakki.... One should read it after purification of  
body and applying Vibhuti etc.,   
2\. Nesamudan ore ninaivathu aagi... One should chant that with   
a lot of love for Murugan, without distraction, as a single thought.   
That is all. Do not worry about the inbuilt mantra elements. So long as your  
heart is pure and body is clean, there is no need to worry about other things.  
Total devotion alone would do. It will   
deliver results. The medicine for head ache, even you take it,   
without knowing its pharmaceutical ingredients will cure you, is it not?   
Incidentally there are certain other Tirupugazh songs: 1\. Neelankol megathin mayil meethe..... for unwed girls to get married to a  
good groom. This has been told by Bhagavan Himself.   
2\. Eluppu thol narai naadi kuzhamidai.... Chidambaram Tiruppugazh.   
This is for curing various illnesses.   
3\. Skandar Anubhuti - 51 songs for non attachment and liberation.   
4\. TiruveLaikaran Vaguppu - to overcome the fear of enemies,   
general disenchantment in life with a lot of boredom.   
Arunachala Siva.

There are six Skanda Sashti Kavacham, each for one Abode of   
Murugan. What is popularly read today is the one on Tiruchendur.   
What is said in that poem itself is as follows:-   
1\. Acharathutan angam thulakki.... One should read it after purification of  
body and applying Vibhuti etc.,   
2\. Nesamudan ore ninaivathu aagi... One should chant that with   
a lot of love for Murugan, without distraction, as a single thought.   
That is all. Do not worry about the inbuilt mantra elements. So long as your  
heart is pure and body is clean, there is no need to worry about other things.  
Total devotion alone would do. It will   
deliver results. The medicine for head ache, even you take it,   
without knowing its pharmaceutical ingredients will cure you, is it not?   
Incidentally there are certain other Tirupugazh songs: 1\. Neelankol megathin mayil meethe..... for unwed girls to get married to a  
good groom. This has been told by Bhagavan Himself.   
2\. Eluppu thol narai naadi kuzhamidai.... Chidambaram Tiruppugazh.   
This is for curing various illnesses.   
3\. Skandar Anubhuti - 51 songs for non attachment and liberation.   
4\. TiruveLaikaran Vaguppu - to overcome the fear of enemies,   
general disenchantment in life with a lot of boredom.   
Arunachala Siva.
