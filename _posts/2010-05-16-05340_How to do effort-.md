## How to do effort?

Ramana Maharshi said that His method can be summed: "Be Still" and as He said  
"To be still is not to think". Bhagavan also said that this takes tremendous  
effort. But to me it seems that to think takes effort and one doesn't need to  
do anything to be still or remain without thoughts. So how can we make effort  
to be still?

Dear Joey,   
All efforts are to be taken only to quell the thoughts. The state   
of Being Still is not achieved so easily. Bhagavan Ramana says: "Let any lots of thoughts occur. Keep on asking for whom was this   
thought. Then the mind will get back to its source. After some   
time, thoughts will no longer be there. It is like soldiers coming   
out of the fort. Keep on swording them. At one time, there will   
be no more soldiers. The fort will be yours." (Who am I?)   
Once when someone mentioned about J.Krishnamurty telling: Effortless Awareness, Bhagavan Ramana said that it was   
true at the end, but all efforts have to be taken to quell the   
thoughts and become Awareness, which is a Thoughtless or   
Effortless Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

to be still means to rest as awereness, wich is unborn, unchanging always  
fresh etc.   
this takes effort, the effort is an effort that differentiates between "seer"  
and "seen".   
thoughts are content of awereness, bodily sensations are content of  
awereness....object and subject are created and cease, something else arises  
and ceases...to remain as awereness is to see everything, see it clearly and  
at the same time dont get carried away by the content, or better dont "be" hte  
content...be the observer the seer of the content...   
for example: you think...a thought arises, this is happening, you are the  
watcher...you simply observe..this needs effort at the beginning, when the  
mind is used to it is spontanious...   
I think this is what ramana means..

In a sense you're right. Summa Iru (being still / being quiet) is techanically  
speaking very simple (or even beyond simplicity). Because to be still, you  
don't have to **do** anything. As you quoted Bhagavan saying "being still  
means to not think". But try to be a day without saying word and then a day  
without stirring a thought. The latter is for most of us impossible, because  
we have quite a few _vasanas_ and it takes enormous effort to constantly go  
against the stream of mental tendencies.

One can be without food. Many sadhus do this even today. One   
can be without words i.e., talking. This is also done by many.   
But to be thoughtless is the most difficult job. To be thoughtless   
alone needs efforts (indirectly, i.e. to quell the thoughts), and is   
very tough since mind is most villainous, more villainous than   
stomach and tongue.   
Arunachala Siva.
