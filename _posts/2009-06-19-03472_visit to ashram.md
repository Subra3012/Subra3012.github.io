I intend to visit the ashram in July 09 for few days. Whom should I contact  
for registering as I want to stay within the ashram premises. Thanks.

Dear ajayanand,   
First give an email to the Asramam, www.sriramanamarshi.org   
and seek permission to stay {maximum three days}. The   
Asramam authorities will give permission through e mail reply.   
You should give them 3 weeks notice. At this stage, you   
can seek permission only for end July. Then, take their   
confirmation copy printed and go to the Asramam. They will   
allot you a room, which is normally outside the Asramam but   
within say 200 to 300 metres. You should also inform them   
beforehand, how many are going to be with you. Do not exceeed   
two or three in number. The allotment of room, which room,   
you will know only after going there. They do not inform the   
room number or name of the guesthouse before hand. There   
are no charges for the room or breakfast/lunch/dinner. You   
can pay some contribution to the Asramam on the last day,   
before leaving.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Siva,   
Many thanks for your guidance. I shall send the email and request permission.  
I would be coming by railway and would like to know which station I should  
alight and how do I proceed from there. Thanks and regards, Ajayananda.

Dear Ajayananda,   
For your kind information, there is not train connection NOW   
for Tiruvannamalai. There was a metre gauge connection   
right from Bhagavan Ramana's times, but this has been withdrawn recently, in  
order to make the way broad guage.   
The work may take some more time, say another six months. You can at best go  
upto Vellore, Katpadi, or Tindivanam by train.   
The rest of the way, you have to cover by bus or taxi. If you   
tell me where you are now, I can guide you in full.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Siva,   
I am also interested to visit the Ashram soon with some friends. I am in  
Puttaparti at present, and I am trying to get information on transport to  
Arunachala from here - has anyone travelled that road? What kinds of transport  
are available and approximately how long it will take/how much it will cost?   
Grateful for any information,   
kaleido

Dear kaleido,   
From Puttaparti, you have to first come to Chennai, by train.   
From Chennai, if you can afford, you can engage a taxi and   
come to Tiruvannamalai, say in about 5 hours. In case,   
you propose to stay in Tiruvannamalai, for more than 1 day,   
then engage the taxi from Chennai for only one way. Otherwise   
you can engage it for, both onward and return journey. The   
Asramam and the Temple visits will, minimum take two full days   
if you want to do justice to the visit. In case, you engage the   
taxi only for one way, then you can get a taxi back to Chennai   
in Tiruvannamalai. You can check up with Asramam authorities   
for a taxi for your return journey.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Siva,   
Thank you for the advice.   
We have decided to get a car and drive directly to Tiruvannamalai, and get  
back with the same driver after 3 days.   
Kind regards,   
kaleido

Dear kaleido,   
Fine. That should work out nicely, with Bhagavan's grace.
