**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 173 - 177**   
Pandavas, along with their mother start walking towards Panchala, to obtain  
Draupadi as their wife. At nightfall they reach the banks of river Ganga. A  
gandharva king by name Angaraparna (Blazing chariot), was bathing in that  
river along with his wives and retinue.   
Arjuna approaches water to quench thirst, and the gandharva challenges Arjuna  
for a fight, saying that during nightfall, men are not supposed to enter  
Ganga.   
Arjuna asks Gandharva, why he fought with them, chastised them for entering  
Ganga, as they are not at fault. Angaraparna replies "Even though you are not  
at fault, and I know that you are from Kuru race, I also know the knowledge  
and power of your preceptor Drona, I also know that you five brothers are  
noble and well learned, and good fighters, yet I censured you.   
The reason is, you have completed your studies, yet you have not taken a wife  
and you have not taken up any mode of life and wandering in forest. Lastly,  
being of nobility, you dont have a priest who can guide you on the path of  
virtue, you have not appointed one."   
Gandharava addresses Arjuna as 'Tapatya'. Arjuna was curious to know why he is  
called as Tapatya, as he is son of Kunti and should be called as Kaunteya.   
Gandharva king Angaraparna then tells him the story of Tapati, daughter of  
Surya the sun god.   
There was a king named Samvarana, was a just ruler of earth. Once when he was  
on a hunting expedition, he saw the daughter of Sun god, Tapati, in a dazzling  
golden light. He immediately falls in love with that damsel and requests her  
hand. She says, only her father, Surya can determine who has to be her  
husband. Samvarna then, prays to his chief priest Sage Vashishta, who ascends  
to the world of light, illuminated by Surya and requests his daughter's hand  
for Samvarna. Sun god agrees to that and marries off his daughter tapati to  
Samvarana. They have a illustrious son by name Kuru, on whose name the entire  
race is known as Kauravas.   
 **On Hearing this story Arjuna wanted to know about Sage Vashishta.**   
Gandharva then tells about Sage Vashishta, "Vashishta is the foremost among  
sages. he is the manasa putra (mind-born son) of the creator Brahmaji. His  
wife is Arundhati. He has fully conquered all the 6 enemies of any person, viz  
kama (unreasonable desires), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment  
and delusion), madha (pride) and matsarya (jealousy).   
He is conversant in all Vedas. King Vishwamitra, to spite Vashishta has killed  
all his sons. Even then Vashishta did not retaliate, and exterminate the race  
of Kusikas, to which Vishwamitra belongs. Instead he forgave him. He could  
have brought back his children from the world of death, through his ascetic  
power. Even that he did not do, as he does not want to interfere in natural  
order of things. He has helped many Kings, by being their priest, in putting  
them on the path of virtue. So, O Tapatya, you should also appoint a good  
priest for you."

**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 171-172**   
Hearing the narrative of the Brahmana about birth of Draupadi, and also  
listening of the Draupadi's swayamvara, Pandavas with their mother set out  
towards Panchala kingdom. While they were living in Ekachakra town, Vyasa  
visited them once more to tell them about their future wife.   
There lived a certain maiden in a rishis hermitage. Due to her past karma, she  
couldn't get married in that life. So she did great penance pleasing Lord  
Shankara. Shiva being Bhaktavatsala appeared before her and told her to ask  
any boon she wants. She asked him for a husband with various qualities,  
repeatedly. **Lord Shankara then granted that boon and said, she will have  
five husbands from Bharata clan. She said, "Lord, I want only one husband", to  
this the Lord said, "You asked for a husband, five times, hence you will have  
five husbands in your next life".**   
Having narrated the above story, Vyasa then said to Pandavas "Sons, that  
damsel is reborn as Draupadi to Panchala king, Drupada. She is set aside as  
the Queen for all five of you. Go to Panchala and obtain her as your wife".   
 **Reflections From the Story:**   
 **When people pray, they have to make a sankalpa (statement of intention)  
properly and their objective should be clear in their mind.** One has to be  
careful what one utters, and also what one thinks apart from being careful  
about actions. **So we need to be careful even in your thoughts, not only in  
your actions.Budhdha also said, One has to be clear about the objective of  
their prayers.**

Most of the times we do not know what to ask, how to ask and when to ask. We  
are child in front of God (of course we are the children of Him) So it is  
better to ask such way, to grant NIRMALA BHAKTHI and achanchala Bhakthi. If we  
have bhakthi it will lead to accept the life which way it comes.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Once Akhilandamma asked Bhagavan Ramana for some Upadesam.   
What Bhagavan Ramana could give? He told Akhilandamma: "Unnaiye unakku kodu". You give your Self to you! Akhilandamma   
did not understand this at all. However, she pursued with a   
prayer to Arunachala: Ennaiye enakku kodu. Give me my Self to me!   
She led her entire life serving Bhagavan and Mother Azhagamma without any  
sankalpa for her and merely seeking the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
