Last time when I was doing Girivalam very early in the morning I saw many  
foreigners doing the Girivalam. I happened to see 2 foreign ladies chanting  
the Ganesha Atharvasheersham without any book in their hand and with  
incantations. I was SURPRISED. My god! I myself cant chant it all without a  
book in my hand. These 2 ladies from a different continent and totally  
different culture and totally alien to the Vedas and sanskrit are able to  
learn the Atharvasheersham. I felt so humbled! being born and also eligible to  
learn Vedas. I felt ashamed! I am far less in determination and devotion than  
the people who have far difficulties than me!

I have watched Tamil Parayanam at 6.00 PM, in the New Hall, where   
Bhagavan Ramana's works are chanted. There were foreigners chanting in good  
Tamil and in good music.   
Arunachala Siva.

In one of the talks swami vivekananda says   
Quote  
 **What do we want in India?** If foreigners want these things, we want them  
twenty times more. Because, in spite of the greatness of the Upanishads, in  
spite of our boasted ancestry of sages, compared to many other races, I must  
tell you that we are weak, very weak. First of all is our physical weakness.  
That physical weakness is the cause of at least one-third of our miseries. We  
are lazy, we cannot work; we cannot combine, we do not love each other; we are  
intensely selfish, not three of us can come together without hating each  
other, without being jealous of each other.   
**We have lost faith. Would you believe me, we have less faith than the  
Englishman and woman  a thousand times less faith! These are plain words; but  
I say these, I cannot help it. Don 't you see how Englishmen and women, when  
they catch our ideals, become mad as it were; and although they are the ruling  
class, they come to India to preach our own religion not withstanding the  
jeers and ridicule of their own countrymen? How many of you could do that? And  
why cannot you do that? Do you not know it? You know more than they do; you  
are more wise than is good for you, that is your difficulty! Simply because  
your blood is only like water, your brain is sloughing, your body is weak! You  
must change the body.**   
**And the first step in getting strength is to uphold the Upanishads, and  
believe  "I am the Soul"**, "Me the sword cannot cut; nor weapons pierce; me  
the fire cannot burn; me the air cannot dry; I am the Omnipotent, I am the  
Omniscient."
