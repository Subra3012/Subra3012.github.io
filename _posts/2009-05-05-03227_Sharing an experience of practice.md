## Narasimha Jayanti - 2009  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 07, 2009, 08:07:06 AM  
---  
Narasimha Jayanti, is celebrated today, the Vaishaka, Sukla Paksha   
Chaturdasi. Narasimha is said to help the suffering devotees instanteously,  
as he appeared as man-lion from the pillar for Prahlada. Narasimha is imaged  
as Siva Vishnu Swarupa, the upper part being Siva, the Fire and the lower part  
being Vishnu, the all-pervading. In Andhara there are many Narasimha temples,  
like Ahobilam, Simhachalam etc., He is said to be ugra-swarupa, a fiery form  
and giver of boons. He is prayed usually with Lakshmi as Lakshmi Narasimha in  
a more convenient shanta-swarupa. There is a sloka called Mantra Raja Stavam,  
which is usually chanted for Narasimha worship. It also contains moola mantra  
of Narasimha,   
which starts as Ugram Veeram Mahavishnum......   
The story goes that Narasimha could not subside his anger for long and he was  
roaming everywhere in an angry posture. Siva came as   
Sarabha, a mythological bird, with large feathers, and a queer animal face,  
with protruding teeth, and embraced Narasimha to quell his anger. This Saraba  
is called Sarabeswara and in Tiruvidaimaruthur Siva temple, near Kumbakonam,  
one can see Sarabeswara image.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Gnana, Bhakti and Yoga  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: May 05, 2009, 08:14:31 PM

I heard partly a discourse being telecast in TV yesterday. The discourser  
said, one who prays to Vishnu becomes a great Bhakta, one who prays to Shiva  
becomes a great Gnani and one who prays to Shakti becomes a Yogi (Kundalini)   
Thoughts then flashed in my mind that Sri Shankara was a Great Bhakta, a Great  
Gnani and a Great Yogi too!   
It was nice bit of information and I thought, I would share it here!

Dear Nagaraj,   
Ultimately, Jnana is the royal path. The bhakti marga and yoga marga are  
ancillary routes to the royal path of Jnana. But such compartmentalization  
cannot be understood by most of us. Bhagavan   
Ramana therefore said: 1\. Bhakti is Jnana-matha. Through bhakti one loves god as also other living  
beings. This takes us to the Jnana marga or self enquiry.   
2\. As regards Yoga marga, Bhagavan Ramana said the difficult methods of  
breath-control is only to build the body fit enough to   
proceed with self enquiry as also to make the mind concentrating on   
the breath control exercises. Bhagavan Ramana said, such an elaborate breath  
control technqiues are not necessary. For protecting body, one should eat  
sattvic food with moderate quantities and this is adequate. For concentrating  
the mind, it is enough to watch the breath, and chant a simple mantra to ward  
off other thoughts.   
3\. Karma marga is approved by all the three schools. Only the karma should  
be done with out any ambition, looking for some fruits. etc.,   
and submitting all karma to god.   
Arunachala Siva.

You are correct Dear Subramanian, All paths finally lead one to the path of  
Gnana.   
Sankara says in Vivekachoodamani about action and knowledge   
Chittasya shudhaye karma na tu vasthoopalabdhaye   
Vasthu siddhir vicharena na kinchit karma kotibhih   
Actions are for purification of the mind alone and not for realization or  
knowledge of an existing entity. Vasthu or knowledge about an existing entity  
(realization of the only existing entity which is Brahman) is achieved through  
ENQUIRY alone and not through thousands of karma.   
Ramana Maharshi says in Upadesa Saaram   
Kaaya vaan manah kaaryam uttamam   
Poojanam japah chintanam kramaat   
Work done by body, words and mind is greater to one another in order. The  
action performed through body is Pooja or offering. The actions performed  
through words are JAPA or Chanting. The action performed through mind is  
contemplation or meditation

Dear Nagaraj,   
Some more thoughts on this: 1\. Bhagavan Ramana used to say that Narayana is a great Siva Jnani and Siva  
is a great Mukunda priya (as said by Sankara himself.)   
2. Unless one loves God, he cannot love other beings. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say that even plucking flowers and bhilva and   
tulsi leaves are themselves sins. Are not the plants and trees   
by exhibiting such flowers and leaves, pray to God?   
3\. In Arunachala Mahatmyam, it is said that trees and plants in   
the Hill are praying to Arunachala with their leaves, flowers, and   
fruits. The fireflys humming at nights are showing arti! The   
rain clouds drop rains to bathe Arunachala.   
4\. Bhagavan Ramana used to pick the fallen muster seeds from   
the kitchen floor, one by one, and put them into the tinbox. He   
has said every bit of grain and seed is Arunachala's gift to people.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Non objective consciousness means only   
object-less consciousness. Bhagavan says, in Who am I?,   
'vichara' means where there is no object. Sri Sadhu Om,   
also says the same thing in the Path of Sri Ramana, a 4 volume   
book. However, for Jnani, who has realized the Self, the appearance   
disappearance of world and objects does not make any difference.   
It is he for whom, there is immateriality of the world and objects.   
When a photograph which was seen by Bhagavan and also the   
others in the Old Hall, was later misplaced and when everyone   
was searching for it, someone asked Bhagavan whether he has   
seen the photograph and has also seen its misplacement, Bhagavan   
said, that he does not know both!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, yes. Experience alone is there and there   
is no experiencer and experienced, the duality. Non objective   
experience is the experience of the Self and here the Experience   
is the Existence. To say, objects come and go is not correct, because,   
there is no object, "the drisyam" but only "the drik", the subject.

Dear Sankar and Raju, The selfrealized Jnanis can confer self   
realization to the advanced 'seekers' provided they are ready.   
The readiness implies,   
a. to understand that the world, the individual soul and personal   
god are imaginations.   
b. to abhor worldly pleasures and put up with worldly miseries.   
c. to totally trust in Guru's way and to lead a life as per Guru's words.   
d. to develop viveka and vairagya, discrimination and detachment.   
(Who am I? (1902))   
Arunachala Siva.

yes, i agree with sri Subramanian ji,   
But think one need not agree that personal god is imagination   
One can see the personal as a manifestation of the impersonal.   
My Zen story in the thread "BluePrints of awakening" also discusses the same

Dear Subramanianji,   
 ultimately its "Just Be". Sri Ramana's essential teaching is Just Be. For someone who cannot do this, he suggested inquiry or sharanagathi both eventually lead to just be.   
As such, Bakthi leads to just be state as narada says by getting such  
love, one becomes stabdah, stilled! infact, one does not become stilled ; one  
recognizes that one is stillness itself. Coz if it is said that one is  
stilled, people will think that their mind has to be stilled. One has to just  
recognize that one is Stillness itself.

Dear Sankar,   
 Sir, Grace is already there, Always. We need to just understand this fact and without waiting practise.   
Also sir, i seldom use this idea that there should be no other coz if this  
is said people will start to think that unless all this we see is removed, we  
cannot have a glimpse of Self. If we go about eliminating everything it  
will take a long long time!

Dear Sankar,   
Quote  
we should not worry about what people will think about if we say this   
 When you are trying to convey a message, you should use the right words, and think twice before presenting. We need to make sure that the other person understands the message as it is. This is the reason why i am very careful to express. People have too many preconditioned ideas. The moment i use the word "God" \ people have already imagined Jesus,Rama or what ever. So to convey the vision i see, i have to use the right words, and use the right pointers. Anyone who sees the pointed object clearly sees the object and shares my vision.   
Yes sir, let us write abt some saints.

Dear Sankar, What srkudai wrote is correct. You are using   
many words without conveying direct meaning. You say   
that the self surrender in the dream will not last. I do not   
understand this. Then, you ask about stories on saints. Why   
don't you read books on Saints, yourself? There is Bhatka   
Vijayam, stories about devotees of Vittala. There is Periya   
Puranam, which speaks about 63 saints of Siva. You may   
read these books. Only books on advaita philosophy need   
explanation. Storeis can be read by anyone if he buys some   
of these books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, as Bhagavan has said: "Grace is always flowing."   
Grace only requires unflinching devotion to him, without let up.   
Devotion is the mother of jnana. But one caveat: To get Grace,   
in abundance, one should carry to Him a big vessel, like Ramanatha   
Brahmachari, Mastan, Echammal, Palaniswamy, Keerai Patti,   
Mudaliar Patti and Kunju Swami.

Friends, i cannot say what it is

something happening in the mind, its born and it dies   
no experience is special. any mental experience can be got by hypnotic

To establish in a state of nonobjective self-consciouness is commonly called

Experiencer is nothing but a collection of all past dead experiences in the  
form of memories.Experiencing is a living thing,when it is converted   
as an experience by the mind it is a dead thing which can be stored in the  
memory cells of the brain.When there is pure perception without   
the contamination of thought there is no experiencer.

its very enlightening to discuss lives of these saints and see the Scriptures  
revealed through them.   
I think we can discuss. They express scriptures through their lives. ill start  
a small discussion thread on Sri Ramakrishna paramahamsa shortly and if all of  
you are ready to participate, will show how such a discussion can be fruitful   
Love!

Dear Sankar and non duel, What I meant was that the life stories   
of saints can be read from books. After reading such books, the   
purport of the happenings in their lives can be discussed.   
Yesterday, srkuadi, wrote about Sri RK. Now, unless one   
knows about Sri RK and Saradhamani, Sri RK and Mathur Babu,   
or Sri RK and Bhairavi Brahamani, one cannot appreciate the   
the incidents and the purport of such incidents. Hence I   
suggested about reading the books containing the life histories   
of such books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs   
When I was going through this old mails, I came to know some meber want to  
write about saints life. Our India is punya boomi. It is the heart for the  
whole world to give jnana and spiritualism. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and  
from east to west we got plenty of saints who took avatar whenever it was  
needed.like samuvami uge uge. Among the saints, some spread bhakti margam like  
meera, some are pure advaitans, They roamed from village to village and they  
sang lots of folk songs, in their respectful languages. Some were sanskrit  
scholars their deciples recorded all in songs form.From south there are so  
many saints. as Subrahmaniyan ji told 63 nayanmar from saivam and 12 Alwars  
from vaishnavam. So we can discuss state by state. There are muslim babas, and  
sufis are also there. We are so fortunate to take birth in India.The tamil  
literature is called Deiva Thamizh. The literature itself contains lots of  
poems about the creator.There are so many siddas who wrote poems and did  
miracles lot still they live around Thruannamalai. Bhagavan also mentioned and  
saw them in His period. If you start this topic. This thread wil be  
everlasting flower in the spiritual garden. We get more chance to know many  
things

Dear Ramanaduli, Thanks for the post. The thread was started   
by Sankar asking for the life stories of saints. I told him that these   
stories can be read from suitable books. We can only discuss   
certain aspects of such stories. The srkudai, started about Sri   
Ramakrishna. I have no problem in narrating the strories. But   
these, as you have said, will be a long serial. Let us see what Bhagavan   
wills.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[15] Sharing an experience of practice  
Author: silentgreen         Date: May 16, 2009, 03:59:02 AM

Dear Matthias,   
What I feel is this: You are correct that the ego-cloud is part of the same awareness.   
(being born earns us the unborn state - a very nice saying)   
By saying that there is ego-cloud is simply a statement of facts which does  
not refute the non-duality of awareness.   
The ego-cloud is simply finely "mixed" thought coating.   
Even with it the awareness remains non-dual.   
It is like clean air and polluted air.   
A mountain person when coming to city feels that the air is heavy.   
If he tells the city person that he is breathing heavy air,   
the city person (if he has never gone outside), may not understand it,   
for he is also breathing air from the non-dual space involuntarily.   
However the fact remains that the air is polluted.   
It partially covers the Pure Consciousness.   
How to sense it?   
Everyone can sense thoughts in the consciousness so there is no need of proof.   
However there is a another good indication.   
The Self is said to be of the nature of Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss)   
Everyone experiences being and consciousness at all times and may not feel  
anything missing with respect to these attributes.   
I feel ananda is the crucial factor.   
Everyone wants peace and happiness.   
If peace and bliss is not manifesting spontaneously from within, it is because  
Pure Consciousness has been "mixed" with thought coating.   
(Ideally Pure Consciousness is always free but we are talking from the  
relative plane)   
Coming back to the city person.   
If the city person goes to a nearby hill and feels the difference;   
coming back to the city, what can he do?   
Will he always put an oxygen mask on the face?   
or, carry a light-weight oxygen cylinder on the back?   
or, go to oxygen booths and breathe fresh oxygen now and then?   
(which can happen anytime in near future)   
or, plant trees and make the city green and the air fresh? (a good step)   
The plight of the city person seems to be helpless.   
Here is where the novelty of self-enquiry comes in.   
If self-enquiry is broken down into two logical divisions: 1\. All thoughts come from the root "I" thought   
2\. With "Who am I?", enquiry, the root "I" merges in the Heart (and becomes  
one with Self).   
(And the entire process should ideally happen seamlessly with non-dual  
awareness.)   
Then we find that self-enquiry as explained by Bhagavan is indeed very novel  
(even intellectually).   
It bridges the gap between the scattered thoughts, the ego-I and the Pure  
Consciousness.   
It also shows the path to follow (heart route) to seekers who are identified  
with body-consciousness.   
This is novel since previously lot of confusions prevailed as to where to fit  
the ego in the scheme of things.   
The first division gives great hope to a meditator, since he need not go on  
detecting thoughts one by one and try to erase it with an imaginary eraser;  
since when ego-I is got hold off, the scattered mind should become gathered  
(ideally vanish from the conscious mind) immediately.   
Neither does the meditator need attempt to fly off from thoughts.   
The second division gives an even greater hope, since "behind" the root "I"  
itself lies the Infinite Being,   
and the entire ego self can be merged in the Heart.   
(The second division I feel is also the bridge between Jnana and Bhakti.   
Jnani's merging is equivalent to Bhakta's surrender though with some  
differences in specifics)   
Upon maturity, the entire process should ideally happen seamlessly, with non-  
dual awareness, without any ego conflict, as a single step and without any  
time delay.   
Sri Sadhu Om used the term Self Attention which is very appropriate to  
summarize the entire phenomenon.   
(To a Yogi, who always abides in the Self, the enquiry is not required  
anymore.)   
However in spite of the best intentions of the enquirer, ego conflict can take  
place if the enquiry is not properly done and gets stuck in the mental level.   
Now what is the relation between Self-Enquiry and purity of mind?   
Ideally Self-Enquiry is a direct process and does not require any other aid.   
(With repeated practice Self-Enquiry itself acts as a purificatory process)   
However with purity of mind, self-enquiry becomes easier.   
The bliss and expansion of the deeper self that is felt with purity of mind  
naturally draws the mind inwards and keeps it in the inner stillness.   
That is why in Patanjali Yoga Sutras Yama and Niyama has been placed before  
Dharana and Dhyana.   
Also we find in the life of Sri Ramakrishna that he used to master different  
sadhanas in days which could have taken years and lifetimes by others. This  
can only happen due to the purity of the mind. When the mind is pure, the  
specifics of the external forms of sadhana does not matter any more.   
Om Shanti. ..

what you say comes froma very clear mind and understading of the path   
I would not add anything to it and it can stay there as it is   
I just htink for myself, that the "view" of atma vichara is important...that  
there is just self, self searchign self   
therefor if we pin down special attainments or a special state...we are on the  
wrong track...because we search for something that is totally beyond our  
reach....jet we try to reach it...   
and that effort is on one side a big problem and on the other side it is  
selfrealised activity...the only activity we should do....   
so our effort should be to reach what is allready there but never  
reachable..and htis is the only effort we should do.....(and it is crucial for  
me, even if I meditate, sometimes 3 or 4 hours a day, even if I meditate Iam  
that....even if I struggle to reach it, Iam that...allready the self  
allways...when the paradox of meditaiton arises and vanishes Iam totally  
it...)   
as in the case of ramana maharshi and other fully realized beeings..we should  
aspire nothing less but this final attainment: to be allways in bliss of the  
self....you see but this is a very high state of realization and very very  
seldom   
and we should keep in mind that we have our karma and no matter what happens  
we are allways the self, so nothing can harm us   
like the famous buddhist saying (I have to translate from german into english  
so it may come out a little wrong): if it is the best for me to die, let me die   
if it is the best to life, let me life   
so if I reach total realisation tomorrow: ok, if I struggle the rest for my  
life: ok...both is just a mind trick   
as what we are is totally beyond illusion and reality....moksha or maya,  
samsara and nirvana it is the root of it...   
and jet not reachabel by our limited efforts, but this kind of effort is the  
only effort we should do...but we should not forget that we will never reach  
it with effort, maybe we reach it through grace...but even this has to be  
proven to me...as I believe that it is always the case...I believe that the  
"grace" is the very fact that it is allways the case....that we cannot attain  
it, because we are allready there and that is the grace...not some miraculous  
happening that will make this miserable matthias into a jnana,that is not  
grace for me....grace is the very fact that Iam allways the Self and that I  
cannot do a thing to earn it or to avoid it...I may feel bliss or I may feel  
like a dog...iam allways allready selfrealized activity...I may acknowledge it  
(nirvana) or be ignorant of it (samsara)....   
and I think that this view is as important as the actual atma vichara or  
meditational praxis....
