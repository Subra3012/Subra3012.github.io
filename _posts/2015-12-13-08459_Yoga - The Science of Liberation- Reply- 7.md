Actually, this is a state leading to the stoppage of flow of time, having  
nothing to do with the   
thought, the mind alternating between the arrested state of no-mind and the  
object of meditation,   
the distinction between concentration and distraction having been overcome by  
the background   
of emptiness of the no-mind, this being termed as 'choiceless awarenss', or  
'attention, by the great   
religious teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti. Actually,in the highest state of  
attention, there are no thoughts.   
Neither the thinker, nor even the thinking process, all actions relating to  
the empirical world being   
tinged with the truth-bearing consciousness, the observer being lost in the  
blaze of silence of the   
no-mind.   
The abidance in this luminous natural state of emptiness takes the Yogi to the  
natural awareness   
of that which is behind the phenomenal existence. This is not a thought, but  
the gateway to the   
discriminating knowledge, which gets dissolved for want of any prop objective  
or subjective,   
the Yogi remaining in the Solitary Grandeur of the Transcendental Aloneness  
named as Kaivalya.   
The function of nature has become, 'functus offico', that is, having  
performed its function,   
the Purusha is released from tentacles of matter. This is termed as Maha  
Videha by Patanjali,   
meaning the great, grand, disembodiment. Here there is no time and space  
interval between   
buddhi sattva (thinking mind), and that which is behind the phenomenal word.

Arunachala Siva.
