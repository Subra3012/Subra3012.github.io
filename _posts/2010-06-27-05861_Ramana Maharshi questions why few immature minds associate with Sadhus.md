## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Final Part - Few Teachings Of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:31:57 AM

**To say that one is apart   
from the Primal Source   
is itself a pretension;   
to add that one divested of the ego   
becomes pure and yet retains individuality   
only to enjoy or serve the Supreme,   
is a deceitful stratagem.**   
What duplicity is this --   
first to appropriate what is really His,   
and then pretend to experience or serve Him!   
Is not all this already known to Him?   
It is enough that one surrenders oneself.   
Surrender is to give oneself up   
to the original cause of one's being.   
Do not delude yourself   
by imagining such a source   
to be some God outside you.   
One's source is within oneself.   
Give yourself up to it.   
That means that you should   
seek the source and merge in it.   
The Swami continued, In actual practice,sadhakas, even sincere ones,  
sometimes become dejected and lose faith in God. How to restore their faith?  
What should we do for them?   
Bhagavan: If one cannot believe in God, it does not matter. I suppose he believes in  
himself, in his own existence. Let him find out the source from which he came.   
Swami: Such a man will only say the source from which he comes are his parents.   
Bhagavan: He cannot be such an ignoramus, as you started by saying he was a sadhaka in  
this line already"   
 **Deep sleep is only the state of nonduality.   
Can the difference between individuals   
and Universal souls persist there?   
Sleep implies forgetfulness   
of all differences.  
This alone constitutes happiness.   
 **All efforts are meant only to end ignorance.   
They have no use after realization.**   
It is enough that one surrender oneself.   
Surrender is to give yourself up   
to the original cause of one's being.   
The gods and sages   
experience the Infinite   
continuously and eternally,   
without their vision being obscured   
at any moment.   
Their minds are surmised by the spectators   
to function, but in fact they do not.   
Such surmising is due to the sense of individuality   
in those who draw inferences.   
There is no mental function   
in the absence of individuality.   
Individuality and mind functions   
are co-existent.   
The one cannot remain without the other.   
The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss   
Some kind of knowledge has to be admitted,   
even in the realization of Supreme Bliss.   
it may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The pure mind is itself Brahman;   
therefore it follows that Brahman   
is not other than   
the mind of the sage.   
 **We are happy in deep sleep.   
We remain then as the pure Self.   
We are the same even now.   
In such sleep there was neither the wife   
nor others nor even "I."   
Now they become apparent   
and give rise to pleasure or pain.   
Why should not the Self,   
which was blissful in deep sleep,   
continue its blissful nature even now?   
The sole obstruction to such continuity   
is the wrong identification   
of the Self with the body.**   
 **" I am Brahman," is only a thought.   
Who says it?   
Brahman itself does not say so.   
What need is there for it to say it?   
Nor can the real "I" say so.   
For "I" always abides as Brahman.   
To be saying it is only a thought.   
Whose thought is it?   
All thoughts are from the unreal "I,"   
i.e., the "I"-thought.   
Remain without thinking.   
So long as there is thought   
there will be fear.**   
There is no use discussing transcendental experiences   
by those whose limitations are not removed.   
Learn what surrender is.   
It is to merge in the source of the ego.   
The ego is surrendered to the Self.   
Everything is dear to us   
because of love of the Self.   
 **The Self is that   
to which we surrender our ego   
and let the Supreme Power,   
I. e., the Self, do what it pleases.   
The ego is already of the Self.   
We have no rights over the ego, even as it is.**   
However, supposing we had,   
we must surrender them.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi questions why few immature minds associate with Sadhus  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:33:54 AM

**Why do these people of immature mind, who are melting and weeping with the  
longing to obtain easily the five sense-pleasures, come and associate with  
Sadhus, who always live the aim of conquering and completely destroying the  
five sense-pleasures?**   
 **Sadhu Om and Michael James** : Do not people who, even though they may hold  
degrees or high and powerful positions in society,are immature, approach  
Sadhus with worldly offerings and wait in their holy presence for the  
fulfilment of their desires? This is not only foolish, but also improper.  
Since such worldly people are mad after the five sense-pleasures, whereas  
Sadhus are totally destroying the desire for the five sense-pleasures by the  
power of their tapas, they have no business with Sadhus. The following  
incident will throw more light on this point:  _One evening at 4 pm during Sri Bhagavans stay at Virupaksha Cave, an old  
brahmin came there with his daughter and offered a big plateful of costly  
sweets. Sri Bhagavan accepted a little of it, and the rest was distributed to  
all the devotees present,who were immensely happy since in those days they  
were not getting even enough ordinary food to satisfy their needs. The  
devotees were very happy, but Sri Bhagavan did not seem to be so pleased. On  
the third day when she came with her usual plate,though all the devotees were  
very happy, Sri Bhagavan told her with a look of displeasure, What is this?  
Why do you bring today also? I did not mind when you brought it once or twice,  
but why do you daily bring such costly things? If there is any expectation  
behind these offerings, it is wrong. This is not the place for the ful-filment  
of worldly desires. If you have any such desire, do not bring these offerings  
from tomorrow onwards._   
 **Next day, to the great disappointment of many of the devotees,she did not  
come. One of the devotees afterwards enquired from her father and came to know  
that, in spite of having passed the normal age, the girl had not yet attained  
maturity for her marriage,and that someone had advised her father that if such  
offerings were made to Sri Bhagavan, their desire would be fulfilled.**

OF GURUS SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By Sadhu Om and Michael James   
Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collection of Bhagavans spoken teachings  
that was thoroughly checked and revised by him during his lifetime. As such it  
has a unique place in the Ramana literature.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar says in this context, in his Padamalai: Verse 416: Padam, the peaceful refuge, possesses the great reknown that all  
that happens occurs only through the Power of His Presence.   
David Godman adds here: Many people had wonderful experiences in Bhagavan's Presence. Others found  
that if they appeared to Bhagavan for help with their   
problems, satisfactory solutions, some of them seemingly miraculous, would  
follow. Bhagavan never claimed responsibility   
for any of these phenomena. Instead, He said that there was a   
Sannidhi, a Presence in the vicinity of enlightened beings that took care of  
all the problems that were brought to their attention. Bhagavan Himself was  
quite adamant that He did nothing in these circumstances. Narayana Iyer  
elicited the following explanation from   
Bhagavan on this point. The word 'sankalpa' that appears several times in the  
exchange means 'will' or 'intention'. It is the desire to follow a particular  
course of action.   
One day when I was sitting by the side of Bhagavan, I felt so miserable that I  
put the following question to Him: "Is the   
Sankalpa of the Jnani not capable of warding off the destinies of the  
devotees?"   
Bhagavan smiled and said: "Does the Jnani have a sankalpa at all? The  
Jivanmukta [liberated being] can have no sankalpas whatsoever. It is just  
impossible."   
I continued: "Then what is the fate of all of us who pray to you   
to have grace on us and save us? Will we not be benefited or saved by sitting  
in front of you, or by coming to you?...."   
Bhagavan turned graciously to me and said: "... a person's bad   
karma will be considerably reduced while he is in the Presence   
of a Jnani. A Jnani has not sankalpas but His sannidhi [Presence] is the most  
powerful force. He need not have sankalpa, but His presiding Presence, the  
most powerful force, can do wonders: save souls. give peace of mind, even  
give liberation to ripe souls. Your prayers are not answered by him and  
absorbed by His Presence. His Presence saves you, wards off the karma and  
gives you the boons as the case may be, [but] involuntarily. The Jnani does  
save devotees, but not by sankalpa, which is non existent in Him, only through  
His presiding Presence, His Sannidhi.   
 (From Mountain Path, 1968.)   
Verse 1287: The effulgent Padam purifies the mind with splendour   
of grace such that its defilement is removed, infusing it with a consciousness  
that is the rarest ambrosia.   
Verse 1354: Padam, the truth, shines in the Heart, stunning the attitude of  
mind that conducts itself by faith alone.   
Arunachala Siva.
