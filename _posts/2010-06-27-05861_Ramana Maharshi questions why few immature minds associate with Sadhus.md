**Why do these people of immature mind, who are melting and weeping with the  
longing to obtain easily the five sense-pleasures, come and associate with  
Sadhus, who always live the aim of conquering and completely destroying the  
five sense-pleasures?**   
 **Sadhu Om and Michael James** : Do not people who, even though they may hold  
degrees or high and powerful positions in society,are immature, approach  
Sadhus with worldly offerings and wait in their holy presence for the  
fulfilment of their desires? This is not only foolish, but also improper.  
Since such worldly people are mad after the five sense-pleasures, whereas  
Sadhus are totally destroying the desire for the five sense-pleasures by the  
power of their tapas, they have no business with Sadhus. The following  
incident will throw more light on this point:  _One evening at 4 pm during Sri Bhagavans stay at Virupaksha Cave, an old  
brahmin came there with his daughter and offered a big plateful of costly  
sweets. Sri Bhagavan accepted a little of it, and the rest was distributed to  
all the devotees present,who were immensely happy since in those days they  
were not getting even enough ordinary food to satisfy their needs. The  
devotees were very happy, but Sri Bhagavan did not seem to be so pleased. On  
the third day when she came with her usual plate,though all the devotees were  
very happy, Sri Bhagavan told her with a look of displeasure, What is this?  
Why do you bring today also? I did not mind when you brought it once or twice,  
but why do you daily bring such costly things? If there is any expectation  
behind these offerings, it is wrong. This is not the place for the ful-filment  
of worldly desires. If you have any such desire, do not bring these offerings  
from tomorrow onwards._   
 **Next day, to the great disappointment of many of the devotees,she did not  
come. One of the devotees afterwards enquired from her father and came to know  
that, in spite of having passed the normal age, the girl had not yet attained  
maturity for her marriage,and that someone had advised her father that if such  
offerings were made to Sri Bhagavan, their desire would be fulfilled.**

OF GURUS SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By Sadhu Om and Michael James   
Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collection of Bhagavans spoken teachings  
that was thoroughly checked and revised by him during his lifetime. As such it  
has a unique place in the Ramana literature.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar says in this context, in his Padamalai: Verse 416: Padam, the peaceful refuge, possesses the great reknown that all  
that happens occurs only through the Power of His Presence.   
David Godman adds here: Many people had wonderful experiences in Bhagavan's Presence. Others found  
that if they appeared to Bhagavan for help with their   
problems, satisfactory solutions, some of them seemingly miraculous, would  
follow. Bhagavan never claimed responsibility   
for any of these phenomena. Instead, He said that there was a   
Sannidhi, a Presence in the vicinity of enlightened beings that took care of  
all the problems that were brought to their attention. Bhagavan Himself was  
quite adamant that He did nothing in these circumstances. Narayana Iyer  
elicited the following explanation from   
Bhagavan on this point. The word 'sankalpa' that appears several times in the  
exchange means 'will' or 'intention'. It is the desire to follow a particular  
course of action.   
One day when I was sitting by the side of Bhagavan, I felt so miserable that I  
put the following question to Him: "Is the   
Sankalpa of the Jnani not capable of warding off the destinies of the  
devotees?"   
Bhagavan smiled and said: "Does the Jnani have a sankalpa at all? The  
Jivanmukta [liberated being] can have no sankalpas whatsoever. It is just  
impossible."   
I continued: "Then what is the fate of all of us who pray to you   
to have grace on us and save us? Will we not be benefited or saved by sitting  
in front of you, or by coming to you?...."   
Bhagavan turned graciously to me and said: "... a person's bad   
karma will be considerably reduced while he is in the Presence   
of a Jnani. A Jnani has not sankalpas but His sannidhi [Presence] is the most  
powerful force. He need not have sankalpa, but His presiding Presence, the  
most powerful force, can do wonders: save souls. give peace of mind, even  
give liberation to ripe souls. Your prayers are not answered by him and  
absorbed by His Presence. His Presence saves you, wards off the karma and  
gives you the boons as the case may be, [but] involuntarily. The Jnani does  
save devotees, but not by sankalpa, which is non existent in Him, only through  
His presiding Presence, His Sannidhi.   
 (From Mountain Path, 1968.)   
Verse 1287: The effulgent Padam purifies the mind with splendour   
of grace such that its defilement is removed, infusing it with a consciousness  
that is the rarest ambrosia.   
Verse 1354: Padam, the truth, shines in the Heart, stunning the attitude of  
mind that conducts itself by faith alone.   
Arunachala Siva.
