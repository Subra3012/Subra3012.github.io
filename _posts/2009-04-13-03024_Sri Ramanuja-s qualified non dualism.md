Today I read in Bangalore newspaper, that Mr. Vatal Nagaraj,   
the leader of one party called Kannada Chauluvalikar has announced   
that he will do 'pada poojas' for donkeys and then proceed for   
his campaigning. He has also assured that, if elected, he will   
work for estabishing a Donkey Development Authority and he   
will also declare a weekly holiday from work for donkeys. Any   
such declarations from any other States?   
Arunachala Siva.

## Why, Mother Uma, you have not given anything to me?

There was one small village called PoRkalanthai, near Rameswaram.   
There was only poet by name Thambiran, there. As usual, he was   
suffering from acute poverty, without even food and clothes. He   
went to Rameswaram and prayed to Paravtavalli and Ramanatha.   
He with tears sang before Parvatavalli, Uma: O Mother, you gave VEL (Spear) to Muruga in Tiruchendur to kill   
 the demons!   
You then gave KAL (leg) at the time of wedding*, to your bridegroom   
 Ramanatha!   
You then gave PAL (breast milk) to your foster son Jnana Sambandha   
 in Seerkazhi!   
You also gave KOL (sugarcane bow) to Manmatha**, who is also   
 your son!   
What have you given, O my Mother, don't you see my poverty?   
(* The bride, usually in Hindu marriages, extends her leg for the   
bridegroom on the rolling stone, for washing, as a ritual before Saptapati.   
Manamtha is also Uma's son vide Sri Soundarya Lahari.)

## O Father! Why don't you stop begging?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 15, 2009, 11:24:38 AM

Sivaprakasa Swamigal was a Saiva Siddhanti, who has written   
many conceptual texts on Saiva Siddhanta. He was also an author   
of various stray verses. In one such verse, says Muruga is asking   
his father Siva, as follows: O Father, why don't you stop begging?   
You have got the entire land given by my uncle Vishnu*   
You friend Kubera will give you the necessary seeds of grains**   
You will be given a plough by Balarama, who is also your brother in   
 law   
You have got one bull already with you.   
A jet black ox, Yama will give without hesitation.   
You have got the trident which can be fixed on the plough.   
The Adisesha will be the fit coir for tying the bull and ox.   
We shall go and start rice-growing!   
My mother is angry, do not go for begging!   
(* Vishnu has measured the entire earth with his leg, he is   
 therefore owner of all the lands.   
Kubera is the custodian of all wealth, hence he can give seeds.   
 Balarama's weapon is plough. He is Krishna's brother.)

What is Ramanuja's mistake on qualified non dualism?   
What is Brahman?   
What is aeon?   
What is Jeevanmuktas?   
What is non-dualism?   
What is qualified?   
I admit i cannot understand, please make me clear   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
1. Qualified Nondualism is Brahman is non dual, formless, but one   
has to remain, after liberation, with a formful god, Ramanuja   
called it Narayana and the liberated souls should remain in   
Vaikunta for the aeon to close.   
2. This is the mistake committed by Ramanuja. He made a 'qualification' for Brahman, called it Narayana and said about   
'waiting period'. Thus he gave rise to religion which is not   
philosophy. Religion took the upperhand and it created problems   
with other religions. Advaita has no quarrel with any other religion,   
as Gaudapada said in his Karika.   
3\. Non dualism is formless Brahman. He is ever present within you,   
and not outside in any deities or images or icons. As a concession   
for beginners, Sankara approved forms and he even wrote hymns   
on these deities also.   
4\. Aeon or eaon is a long period, what we call Yuga in Sanskrit.   
5\. A Jeevanmukta is one who is liberated even when he is still alive   
in the body. Like Sankara and Bhagavan Ramana. Since there is a   
long waiting period in Vaikunta, as per qualifed non dualism, the   
concept of Jeeven Mukta cannot be there in that philosophy.   
6. Liberation is moksha, without any rebirth. Vaikunta, Swarga,   
Kailasa, Hell are all temporary waiting sheds. From each of these,   
one has to come back to earth to work it out. Only liberated souls merge with  
Brahman after this waiting period.   
Arunachala Siva.

Coming to understand that   
1) Narayana is everywhere, he present in everything, i.e what we call the  
Universe and everything is Narayana   
2) If a person gets moksha even if he is living such as Sankara, Ramana does  
they go the Kailasa for only for time being and return to earth after some  
time or they stay there forever.   
3) If a person gets liberated after death, if he is good does he reaches  
Vaikunta, Kailasa and stays they forever or after something he comes back to  
earth as human.   
4) Coming to the mistake part: What wrong has to do with 'waiting period'   
Does it means it takes time to receive the blessing or darshan of the Lord   
After that period of time one goes to vaikunta.   
(I doubt I'm still not clear)

1\. Brama Jnanis like Sankara and Ramana got liberated while in   
life in a body. This means that they have merged with Brahman.   
For them, there is no going or coming i.e going to Vaikunta or   
Kailasa or Swarga or Naraka. They have merged once and for all   
with Brahman. They have no individual identity any longer. It is   
like water mixing with milk.   
2\. People who are liberated at the time of death, they also merge   
in Brahman. For them also there is no going or coming. Many   
Saiva Siddhanta saints like Tiru Navukkarasar come under this category.   
3. By waiting period, I mean, they wait near the Vaikunta or   
Kailasa, seeing Narayana or Siva and then at the end of the aeon,   
yuga, they merge with Brahman, the One without a second.   
4\. For ordinary people who are meritorious or demeritorius they   
go to Heaven or Hell and after their 'bank balance' of credit or   
debit balance is over, they return to earth to start the game again.   
They are not liberated in either way, till they understand and   
merge with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
