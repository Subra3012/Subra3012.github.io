Can anyone tell me what differences are made by Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva  
respectively.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Sankara said that Brahman and the individual soul, which comprises   
of mind, ego, intellect and mind-stuff, (Chittam) are having no   
differences and they are one and the same without second. What   
is obstructing the seeker to 'see' the differences is his ego, which   
creates all sorts of variety, like I and mine. When the mind is   
destroyed (Mano Nasa) along with its siblings of ego, intellect and   
the mind stuff, the individual knows no difference and he is Brahman.   
The merger is Moksha or liberation. The individual, the world and   
the personal gods are not imaginations. Jeeva, Jagat and Iswara   
are only mind's fabrications. This is Non dualism of Sankara,   
called Advaita, No Two.   
Ramanuja said that the difference is there but is qualified. The seeker   
should pray and meditate on Brahman, [he called it Narayana] and   
go to Vaikunta, Narayana's abode, and be there enjoying Narayana's august  
presence there. At the end of aeon, the individual merges with Brahman  
[Narayana]. After leaving the body on the earth, such an   
individual gets a celestial body, for staying happily in Vaikunta. The body  
goes off only at the end of aeon, for final merger. This is qualified Non  
dualism or Visishtadvaita. Two remains for some time and then becomes one.   
Madhva said that the individual and the godhead, Brahman, Narayana have to  
remain only as dual, as two, for all the time. At best, a blessed seeker goes  
to Vaikunta and serve Naryana, for all the time enjoying his company. This is  
Always Two. Dualism, or Dvaita.   
Arunachala Siva.

Comprehending your reply,   
**Sankara:** All are one, there is no second, but again why did Sankara choose  
6 deities (Vishnu, Siva, Devi, Surya, Ganesha and later Skanda) and everything  
is Maya   
 **Ramanuja:** Every thing is Narayana and there is only one and he is  
Narayana   
 **Madhva:** Narayana, i.e Krishna and Brahman are different and they exist  
together, i.e two   
On the second note: Ramanuja put foreword his doctrine only after objecting to  
Sankara's doctrine, did Madva put foreworth his doctrine objecting to both  
Ramanuja and Sankara   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Sankara said that only Brahman is Real and everything is Maya.   
Bhagavan Ramana also said this. He has categorically said that   
the jiva, the individual soul, the world, jagat and Iswara, personal   
gods are all imaginary. (Who am I?). However Sankara felt that   
it is very difficult to practice or meditate upon the nameless and   
formless Brahman, for most of the people. Hence he came down   
from his level and sang songs on Lalita, Siva, Rama, Krishna,   
Ganesa and Subrahmanya and Surya. He thus established Shanmatha, that is six  
ancillary ways of worship. These are   
Saivam, Saktam, Ganapathyam, Koumaram, Vaishnavam and Souram.   
Bhagavan Ramana also recommended worships of any god to begin   
with and also to chant the mantras of any god, as one may choose.   
Why Ramanuja formed Vishishtadvaita? In his times, there was only   
Sankara's advaita in vogue. But he said that god (Narayana) should be  
worshipped to reach his Abode, (Vaikunta) and then merge with him later.   
Madhva did not object to Narayana or Krishna's worship. But he   
preferred Krishna since he was attracted by Krishna in Udupi temple.   
Philosophically, he felt that the individual at all times, should remain   
outside Narayana and serve Him and he cannot ever merge with Him.   
Therefore he said it is always dualism.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Further, Ramanuja said that there is no caste or creed or asrama and   
Narayana can be prayed by any human being. This is the greatest   
contribution of Ramanuja. He thrashed casteism in his times. In   
Sankara's time, the caste system was no doubt in vogue, but he   
was more interested in quashing other religions, like Buddhism,   
and internal subways like, Poorva Mimasaka (which said karma   
alone shall confer liberation, no need for self enquiry. See also   
the first verse of Upadesa Saram of Bhagavan Ramana.), Jaimini   
and Vaishesika ( logic), Kapila and Patanjali (pure yoga marga) etc.,

Is Brahman, a God?   
Does Ramanuja establish that only Narayana is absolute and he is the  
everything (God)(unlike Sankara)   
Does Madhva establish one cannot merge with Krishna or serve him

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I think Subramanian has been explaining very lucidly your doubts. I felt a  
pictorial explanation of the theories of Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva would  
make it much easier -   
The small circle in Visishtadvaita and Dvaita is "I" or "you" and the Big  
circle is any of Vishnu swarupam. Whereas in Advaita, there is only one  
circle, there is no small circle and big circle, there is only one. the "I" or  
"you", Narayana, Shiva, Shakti, or for that matter anything or anyone Christ,  
Allah, Buddha is one and the same and this is the eternal "I" as stated by  
Ramana, The Pure I.   
Ramanuja and Madhva predominantly saw/focussed on the smaller circle whereas  
Shankara saw only the One whole circle!   
My personal belief and understanding is that even a Visishtadvaitin and  
Dvaitin will ultimately get merged (Not to be taken Literally, Merging into  
whole is KNOWLEDGE or Gnana or 'to-know' or 'being') into the Whole - the One  
- Advaita Tatvam. I have come to understand that one begins his spiritual  
journey as a Dvaitin, then becomes a Visishtadvaitin and finally realises that  
He alone IS - Advaita Tatvam. That Sat-Chit-Ananda Tatvam is Advaita Tatvam.  
And when this happens He will Not Bother about Advaita or Dvaita or  
Visishtadvaita or any other theory.   
You may right click and open in new window to view a bigger picture given  
above!   
Hope it Helps!

Dear karthikeyan. M, and Nagaraj,   
What Nagaraj explained in his diagram is quite lucid. Brahman is   
non-form and non-name. But when one comes to God, then all   
names and forms start. There will be Siva with trident and snakes,   
there will be Narayana, with conchshell and discus and mace. All   
these are concessions to a person who cannot pray to a formless   
and nameless godhead. Sankara said that Brahman is one without   
a second. Hence, you are also not different from Brahman. I and   
Brahman are the one and the only substance without a second. This   
is Non dual. Then, what is making us believe that we are different?   
It is the ego/mind/body complex. Once a person overcomes this   
he is also Brahman.   
Ramanuja and Madhva said, (presumably since what Sankara said   
is difficult to contemplate), there is Narayana. The people should   
pray to Him, with love and devotion, desireless action and then reach Him.  
After reaching him, i.e. after leaving body such a devotee goes to Vaikunta,  
and be there with Narayana in a celestial body and serve him.   
Then, the difference between Ramanuja and Madhwa comes up.   
Ramanuja said that at the end of the aeon, such great devotees would merge  
with Him. Madhwa said: Nothing doing, we are always different from Narayana.  
Our job is to pray to him and serve time,   
for all the times.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[8]The Seven objections to Shankara's Advaita  
Author: karthikeyan M       Date: May 07, 2009, 03:34:27 PM  
---  
Thanks for the post,   
Yes I did understand what these great people have said.   
And more, going by your replies, Brahman is God or further deeper is there no  
god at all, its all maya and nothing is real ?   
\   
I came across this website which says;   
The Seven objections to Shankara's Advaita   
Ramanuja picks out what he sees as seven fundamental flaws in the Advaita  
philosophy to revise them. He argues: I. The nature of Avidya. Avidya must be either real or unreal; there is no  
other possibility. But neither of these is possible. If Avidya is real, non-  
dualism collapses into dualism. If it is unreal, we are driven to self-  
contradiction or infinite regress.   
II. The incomprehensibility of Avidya. Advaitins claim that Avidya is neither  
real nor unreal but incomprehensible, {anirvachaniya.} All cognition is either  
of the real or the unreal: the Advaitin claim flies in the face of experience,  
and accepting it would call into question all cognition and render it unsafe.   
III. The grounds of knowledge of Avidya. No pramana can establish Avidya in  
the sense the Advaitin requires. Advaita philosophy presents Avidya not as a  
mere lack of knowledge, as something purely negative, but as an obscuring  
layer which covers Brahman and is removed by true Brahma-vidya. Avidya is  
positive nescience not mere ignorance. Ramanuja argues that positive nescience  
is established neither by perception, nor by inference, nor by scriptural  
testimony. On the contrary, Ramanuja argues, all cognition is of the real.   
IV. The locus of Avidya. Where is the Avidya that gives rise to the (false)  
impression of the reality of the perceived world? There are two possibilities;  
it could be Brahman's Avidya or the individual soul's {jiva.} Neither is  
possible. Brahman is knowledge; Avidya cannot co-exist as an attribute with a  
nature utterly incompatible with it. Nor can the individual soul be the locus  
of Avidya: the existence of the individual soul is due to Avidya; this would  
lead to a vicious circle.   
V. Avidya's obscuration of the nature of Brahman. Sankara would have us  
believe that the true nature of Brahman is somehow covered-over or obscured by  
Avidya. Ramanuja regards this as an absurdity: given that Advaita claims that  
Brahman is pure self-luminous consciousness, obscuration must mean either  
preventing the origination of this (impossible since Brahman is eternal) or  
the destruction of it - equally absurd.   
VI. The removal of Avidya by Brahma-vidya. Advaita claims that Avidya has no  
beginning, but it is terminated and removed by Brahma-vidya, the intuition of  
the reality of Brahman as pure, undifferentiated consciousness. But Ramanuja  
denies the existence of undifferentiated {nirguna} Brahman, arguing that  
whatever exists has attributes: Brahman has infinite auspicious attributes.  
Liberation is a matter of Divine Grace: no amount of learning or wisdom will  
deliver us.   
VII. The removal of Avidya. For the Advaitin, the bondage in which we dwell  
before the attainment of Moksa is caused by Maya and Avidya; knowledge of  
reality (Brahma-vidya) releases us. Ramanuja, however, asserts that bondage is  
real. No kind of knowledge can remove what is real. On the contrary, knowledge  
discloses the real; it does not destroy it. And what exactly is the saving  
knowledge that delivers us from bondage to Maya? If it is real then non-  
duality collapses into duality; if it is unreal, then we face an utter  
absurdity.   
Bhagavad Ramanuja taught his followers to highly respect all Sri Vaishnavas  
irrespective of caste.   
Cited from Sri Ramanuja, His Life, Religion, and Philosophy, published by Sri  
Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, India.   
\   
Ofcourse we(in the forum) people now cannot say Ramanuja got the points wrong  
we are not great people, as this being Bhagavan Ramana forum, as Bhagavan  
followed Sankara teachings, one can possible support the Sankara's points as  
against Ramanuja, which i don't want this information, but again going by your  
replies, Brahman is God or further deeper is there no god at all, its all maya  
and nothing is real ?

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 07, 2009, 04:28:21 PM

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
I can reply to these seven objections by referring to Sankara's   
books and Sureswara's various vaartikas. But these will be   
only pedantics. Meantime, please consider the following: 1\. Your dream, is it real or unreal? If it is real, a friend's death   
in the dream state, should be known to you when you wake up.   
If you dream of your dead grandfather, visiting your house, if   
this dream is real, you should see him, as you wake up. That   
is, dream is real in dream state and unreal in real state.   
2. Your dream is unreal. Then you should not have the same   
dream again and again. I have seen such dreams. I have dreamt   
that I was failing in Standard X, a number of times, even after   
passing M.Sc.! On top of all, the dreams should not take place   
at all! That is, after passing Std. X, I should not have the dream   
of my failing in Std. X at all. Why is it happening again and again   
even after the completion of M.Sc successfully? It is because,   
dream is unreal and real both.   
3\. The dream is neither real nor unreal. There is no pramana for   
the negative, it should be inferred. The rope on the dark road   
is neither real nor unreal. When you think it is serpent, it is   
serpent. When you get 'enlightened' by a torch light, then it is   
only a rope and not a snake. Hence the snake is mithya, neither   
real nor unreal.   
4\. In the dream, if you are hungry, only your dream food should   
satisfy your hunger. If you get up and take two bananas, you   
may even dream again that you are hungry. Dream state and   
waking state are two different perceptions. One cannot satisfy   
the need of the other. That is why, Sankara called it mithya,   
anirvachanyeam, in describable. However much a girl reads   
about sexual intercourse, she may not be able to 'experience'   
it unless she sleeps with her husband, on the nuptial night.   
Mithya is translated as seemingly real or seemingly unreal in   
English for want of better words. Mithya is described by   
Sankara by some examples, like rope/serpent, silver/oyster shell,   
water/water mirage.   
5\. Sankara is without match. His is experiential. Due to extraordinary  
logical abilties, people can argue either in favour or against. But Sankara  
is an experiencer and not a logician. If Madhwa has brought about dualism,  
later, does it mean, that both Sankara and Ramanuja were wrong? Saint  
Raghavendra during his times, defeated both advaitins and qualified advaitins.  
Does it mean that only Raghavendra is correct and not everyone else? Everyone  
is correct   
as per logic and view point. But I repeat, that Sankara's was experiental.  
Do not ask whether others were not experiential.   
Everyone was seeing a part of the elephant, and saying it was like   
a tree, it was like a mountain, it was like a large fan, etc., But   
only a few could see the full elephant. Sankara, Saint Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha and Bhagavan Ramana saw the elephant in entirety.   
6. Even as per logic, one cannot prove the 'negative'. If you know   
good mathematics, I shall ask you a few questions: Can you explain   
what is minus two? Why minus two divided by minus two is one?   
Why minus two multipled by minus two is plus four? Why zero   
divided by two is infinity? If zero divided by two is infinity, then   
how minus two divided by minus two is one?   
7\. Can you prove whether I am not a man?   
8\. Can you prove that Golda Meir was not woman?   
9\. A cow is not a cat?   
10. Fortunately, unlike Ramanuja and Madhwa, we are today in   
virutal world of computers. What is virtual reality? Is it unreality?   
Is it reality? Is it neither? Is it either? If Bhagavan Ramana   
were to living in body today, He would have given the computer example, like  
He gave cinema-screen example and camera example.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
Let alone Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva and others who propounded theories be!  
Why don't you find out the truth yourself? Why to follow or believe or accept  
any theories? may be its none of these - Advaita, Dvaita or Visishtadvaita!  
could be! who knows? the best course is to find out yourself!   
Really, find out who is the Ramanuja Shankara or Madhva? I found out that They  
are all not different from me. They are all verily me. There is a Shankara,  
Ramanuja and Madhva in me - I and not in the books or past or history or  
mythology.   
The first lesson in Vedanta spirituality (as said by Vyasa) is that one should  
not simply believe anything written here but one has to understand, feel and  
only when one is convinced and becomes That should one accept what is being  
taught. Therefore find out for yourself what is THERE actually.   
In your post, you have listed the set of points of Ramanuja against Advaita  
written by somebody on the Internet world according to his own understanding.  
Similarly why don't you list set of your own points on what you have  
understood? Validate your own self and not Shankara or Ramanuja or Madhva.  
Infact they are not going to offer any help to you! thats the reality!   
The Reality is that there are no answers or confirmations or validations of  
what is Right or Wrong or what is Correct or False from anybody. Ultimately  
you will have to validate all of them by your own self. So why not investigate  
yourself?   
Infact, There are no theories for the TRUTH. in some ways, Shankara, Ramanuja  
and Madhva have only caused damage by propounding their theories including  
Buddha.   
Investigating on these theories is only waste of time!   
In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says -   
 _uddhared atmanatmanam   
natmanam avasadayet   
atmaiva hy atmano bandhur   
atmaiva ripur atmanah   
_   
A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is  
the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well. Ramana has said  
ones own Self is ones Guru. That Self is the GURU you see whoever it may be!   
Therefore, It rests only on you alone and not on Shankara or Ramanuja or  
Madhva or Buddha or anybody else.   
We only read commentaries of Bhagavad Gita and various other Vedantic texts  
written by some one. Why not read it yourself and validate the real essence of  
Vetantic verses by yourself and not try to validate the commentator's  
interpretations! why to read the interpretations of others? By doing this one  
will progress faster whereas if one gets stuck with the theories of Shankara  
or Ramanuja or Madhva or Buddha, it will only halt ones progress spiritually!   
Instead, just take the word by word meaning of the Sanskrit words in the  
Verses and try and comprehend the essence of the Verse by your own  
understanding. Sometimes the commentary is just pollution! you may compare  
your own understanding with the commentary and validate the commentator  
yourself rather accepting what the commentator says. Most times I find the  
commentaries Too much waste information. Its simply Dust!   
Ramana Maharshi never knew Advaita or Dvaita or Visishtadvaita! Actually he  
did not set any theories. He only happened to discover at later years that his  
own understanding matched with NOT Shankara's but the Scriptures - The  
Upanishads and Vedas!   
So why not find out yourself!   
It would be great for you as well as all of us if you put forward your own  
questions through your own analysis rather put forth somebody else's analysis  
and points

Dear karthikeyan. M & Nagaraj,   
The reply of Nagaraj has two important points.   
The first is, one should be convinced about what he studies, if at all he  
studies. Bhagavan Ramana never studied anything, it was from His own  
experience, (Swanuubhava) He gave His teachings. During His   
studies of books for the sake of others, He found that His experience   
was same as of Sankara. The conviction is an important point.   
Ribhu Gita says that "I am Brahman, I am convinced I am Brahman!"   
It is not merely mouthing of words. It is the conviction that is more   
important.   
I can explain this through another example. Four people were suffering from  
acute head ache one night. There was no power   
supply too and it was pitch dark. The first was given a   
saridon, he took it and he got cured of head ache. He is Sankara.   
The second one was given a vitamin tablet (stating that it is saridon),   
he also got cured of head ache. He is Ramanuja. The third was given   
a tamarind seed, he took it and he also got cured. He is Madhva.   
In other words the conviction got them cured and not tablets per se.   
All the four got liberated in their paths due to their conviction. Many   
drug addicts got cured by administering vitamin B-12 in de addiction camps,  
stating that it was LSD. Some got the kicks (!) and in due course they were  
all cured. Buddha was also liberated. But for his headache, he was given a  
"mint with a hole" (because he said that   
Brahman is Sunya, hole!) and he got cured.   
Philosophy is showing the way. In that way, Sankara showed the correct way.  
Others differed from him with their logics and ratiocinations and discovered  
new ways. All got liberated because   
they were convinced about it. This is where surrender and bhakti   
comes into play a major role.   
Hunter Kannappa got liberated in six days in Kalahasti temple. His bhakti and  
surrender was of Himalayan heights. And that is why he could pierce out his  
eye and fix it on Siva Linga. When he tried to pierce his other eye, Siva  
himself appeared, held him by His hand and said: Stop Kannappa, Stop Kannappa,  
Stop Kannappa! three times.   
Kannappa merged with the effulgence. Here Kannappa did not advocate any of  
the three paths. But he had matchless bhakti and surrender, i.e. conviction.  
And this took him to Siva's abode. Siva   
Kosari, a brahmin priest who was hiding behind Siva Linga, and   
who was doing puja for years, could not get this. Because, he had philosophy  
but less bhakti/surrender.   
The second is one should, if it is confusing, throw away all books   
and find out the Truth himself. If he is sincere, Truth will reveal   
Itself to him. I can quote Swami Vivekananda for this. He was   
already well read. But his reading did not help him. It was SRK's   
utter simplicity and extraordinary devotion and surrender to Kali   
that made Vivekananda to take him as his Master. Vivekananda   
tried to go through books. SRK had already arrived without books!   
Let us not bargain Truth for books. It is like losing cricket for   
the lewd dances of cheerleaders in South Africa.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
One more simile comes to mind. Three people wanted to cross   
the river on a rainy night. It was pitch dark. One person got   
into a boat (which had no boatman), and crossed the river.   
The second got on to the back of a crocodile and he also crossed   
the river! The third one got on the back of a floating corpse and   
he also crossed the river. All the three got liberated! How?   
So long as they were convinced that they were travelling on a boat.   
If the second and third would have looked down and seen the   
crocodile or the corpse, they would have jumped out and got   
drowned. Even if the first one, if he mistakes the boat for a   
crocodile or a corpse, he would also have jumped out and got   
drowned. Conviction is the key word. Ribhu Gita stresses only   
this. Once a lady devotee said to Bhagavan Ramana: "You want   
me to read Ribhu Gita, but I do not understand even a bit." Bhagavan Ramana  
said: "It does not matter. Mere reading would confer you   
liberation. There is no need to understand. Please have faith and read."  
This sums up the whole position. It is like taking tamarind seed as saridon  
and taking it for headache and getting cured.   
Advaita, Visishtadvaita, Dwaita all convey the Truth. But from the point  
of view of objective reasoning (it does not matter for Truth seekers) as a  
codified philosophy, Advaita stands supreme. And that is why, Gaudapada says  
in his famous Karika: "We have no quarrel with anyone. Everything is  
acceptable to us." Sometime back, I wrote: "When everyone wanted to go to  
Antarctica and the moon, Gaudapada went to Jupiter in a jiffy."   
T.S. Eliot wrote: What are the roots that clutch   
What branches grow out of this stony rubbish?   
Son of man, for you know only a heap of broken images,   
When the sun beats, dead trees give no shelter,   
And cricket no relief.   
Arunachala Siva,
