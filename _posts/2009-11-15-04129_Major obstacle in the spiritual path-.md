## Major obstacle in the spiritual path.

Carelessness in restraining the vasanas (latent tendencies) is a major  
obstacle in the spiritual path. Though meditation keeps the vasanas under  
check, we have to be very careful in our activities to guard against them.  
Senses always try to drag us down. Quite often we yield to temptations and try  
to come with excuses. We must be honest to ourselves and acknowledge our  
weakness. This doesnÂ’t mean we should think we are weak but we should  
recognize that we are weak. The whole purpose of spiritual enquiry is not to  
attain the truth but to give up the false.

Dear S. Subramanian,   
Absolutely correct. The whole purpose is to remove the unwanted   
falsity and the Truth shall reveal itself. This process is called   
Chidda Suddhi. Again, as you said, the latent tendencies may   
rise at anytime and ruin us. I am given to anger very easily in   
life. But in normal times, there is no sense of anger in me. But   
it rises its hood in no time and harm others and harm me too.   
A slight provaction is all that is wanted to push your hypertension   
by twenty points! Bhagavan Ramana says: It is like the serpent   
inside the ant hill. It does not come out. But you have to catch   
it when it just comes out, before harming the children playing   
around the ant hill. That is the exact moment, when one should   
ask: For whom this anger is?   
Once a devotee was asking Bhagavan Ramana, as to how to control   
the anger. Bhagavan Ramana explained this. But they could not   
understand. Soon both went into the kitchen to prepare some   
evening dinner. There was a small fight. One said: Do you   
know who I am? Another retorted: Do you know who I am?   
Bhagavan Ramana entered the kitchen just then! Both became   
very ashamed. Bhagavan said: See, see, this is the moment in   
which you should catch this anger and crush its neck. In the   
Old Hall, when you were asking this question, there was no anger   
in you. So you did not understand. Now you realize.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nice points.   
Checking the desires can also result in love for God if the devotee thinks: "Oh! God, for you I have checked the vasanas...and because of you I have  
checked the vasanas.".   
If grace of God dawns, vasanas will start fading away.

Dear Subramanian R.,   
 Anger is a great impediment. We are easily hurt when someone wrongs us. A  
few years ago I happened to be furious with my builder. My mind was so  
perturbed I could not meditate for months. Now I realize that no one can  
cheat me unless I allow myself to be cheated. My own ignorance or  
carelessness is to be blamed. Acceptance is an essential characteristic of a  
spiritual seeker.   
S.Subramanian.
