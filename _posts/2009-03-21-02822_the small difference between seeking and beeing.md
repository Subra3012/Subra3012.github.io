I would like to dedicate this post to both the readers and myself   
it is about a simple insihgt I made several weeks ago, not just an insight but  
a small shift   
I sit in meditation, now I make a breathing practice....letting the energy  
flow down at the front of my body into the hara (while I breath in) and  
letting the energy flow up through my spine when I breath out(in breating out  
I also try to surrender my body to the universe....or melting into everyting  
that surrounds me, letting go)   
this is I think a tantric practice...and it is very good to ease the body and  
mind...and give you some extra energy for the day (I have a rather physical  
job at the moment)   
when I finished with it...I slowly let it sink more in the background and just  
focus on the silence that penetrates me, surrounds me in the inside and  
outside... hte silence that Iam..sometimes I directly ask to "speak" to the  
silence that Iam...or speak as "silence" (sounds crazy but that helps me make  
the shift)   
this shift I talk about is mentioned in the headline.....it is dropping hte  
seeking, the wish for beeing something of a higher order for example, or to be  
somebody else(more healthy more wise, more compassionate etc....)   
to name it more directly: the seeking or wish that there is more towards  
reality then this arising body/mind and moment..   
and when I drop this seeking, then there is peace...the body and mind are not  
longer enemies on the spiritual path, they are just what they are body and  
mind...not at all so interessting....and I can rest as beeingness, the simply  
presence (in the body and arround the body and not located at all)...I feel  
that effort is more or less for nothing (still I feel my ego making efforts to  
hold the spine straight, to be focused etc...I feel this as tensions...and I  
do beliefe that you can become effortless in meditation....)   
now it will be my work to preserve this....deepen it and take it with me...and  
this is the hardest part I guess...to surrender to it...still when I work I  
can feel that my body is stressed....the energies of the body are collecting  
in my head and neck....my thought start to run wild...this is not neccessary  
and if I would stay present and breathing correctly it would not  
happen...maybe some guidelines or thoughts from someone regarding htis?

It might help to combine devotion in the "letting go" phase, when the seeking  
is dropped.   
Devotion in any form one likes, even clapping one's hands and getting absorbed  
in whatever form of God one likes.   
Then the peace and love of devotion gets carried to the workplace.   
However one should adopt anything only if it suits.   
Om Shanti. .

the pease and devotion gets carreid with me for arround 2-3 hours (when I have  
a break I sit again for 20 minutes and restore my mental peace) sometimes Iam  
exstatic during the work: when I remember who Iam, bliss arises  
naturally...but as I said after some time I seem to get overwhelmed by the  
apearing happenings...and suddenly the moment is not longer enough, reality is  
not longer enough...   
I make also a gestalttherapy, a modern western type of psychotherapy (it is a  
important part of my sadhana, beliefe it or not) and I talked just today about  
this.....we talked about my personality "matthias" and how it is fighting with  
life or the natural flow of life.....(the therapy form is very close to  
meditational practices..., and my therapist is also a practising buddhist)..   
it is a paradox that a therapy that is concerned with the ego//mind can help  
to transcend the ego//mind......   
I think it is clear that giving light to hidden aspects, will help to disolve  
them, it is a direct work with the vasanas if you like to speak in advaita  
terms, it is about self awereness on a mental//psychological level (almost  
like mindfullness of buddhists)..you work with energies of the psyche that are  
more or less a hindrance for life to manifest like it wants....so a very  
spiritual thing in the end   
I was working afterwards and the symptoms where nearly gone...   
so psychotherapy is a great aid to create a positive and effective  
sadhana...or to help the asana to bear more fruits in the daily life...
