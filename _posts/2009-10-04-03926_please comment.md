## The Valve Radio Example  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 04, 2009, 10:50:59 AM  
---  
Prior to discovery of transistors and music players, there were   
only Valve Radios in India. I had one at my home, when I   
was a young boy. Such radios were also not manufactured   
with technical excellence, in as much as, after a year or so,   
the tuning became difficult. When we tuned Chenai, we   
will get Hyderabad or Delhi! Sometimes, we get the sound   
of neighbour's pounding stone! There were not mixers and   
grinders too those days!   
Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says that for most of us, mind   
is like this Valve Radio. When we tune one station we get   
two or three other stations too. There are many layers and   
backgrounds in our minds, through which we hear many things.   
When the mind is brought to some discipline through chanting   
of mantras or names, then it will become a well-tuned radio.   
We get only that thought, a name or a form. After sometime,   
we can switch of this too and be in perfect silence.   
(From Brahmasri Nochur Venkatarman's satsangh, Day 5, Sunday)   
Arunachala Siva.

Understanding it in a simple way, the meaning appears to be simple.   
 _If you don 't bring forth what is inside you, what you don't bring forth  
will destroy you._   
If you don't bring forth the divine nature inside you, (which requires effort  
of introversion / devotion / self enquiry), what you don't bring forth, which  
is the outward tendencies of the mind towards the lower plane (which  
effortlessly seem to take control of our lives), will destroy you.   
The warning is of the same nature which Adi Shankaracharya has given long ago: The man who, having by some means obtained a human birth, with a male body and  
mastery of the Vedas to boot, is foolish enough not to exert himself for self-  
liberation, verily commits suicide, for he kills himself by clinging to things  
unreal.   
A great message from a great teacher.   
Victory to Jesus Christ.   
(This is my understanding and there can be other interpretations also)

Dear amiatall,   
What silentgreen has written is fine. "The substance within"   
is Atma or God or Christ or Arunachala. If this is not realized,   
the mind which is also with Atma, will come out and do its   
million mischieves. The mind should be made quiescent and this   
is possible only if you bring forth the Light within. The Light,   
which is the Light of the Sun is there, the little lamp called   
Mind, even if it is there, will look pale and is practically not there.   
Arunachala Siva.

The quote comes from the "Gospel of Thomas", the 70th saying --I googled to  
make sure of that and ran across a sermon from 2003 given in a Vermont  
Congregational Church where the point was that this saying is true on a  
practical, daily life level (which I would expect, since if it is true on a  
spiritual level, in someways at least it should be true on a "wordly" level.   
"...a person needs to master [six tasks] in order to age well. The first is to  
know yourselfÂ—to discover your true identity apart from who your parents and  
society suggest you should be. The last task is to come to see the truth of  
life beyond yourself, and to come to peace with the way the universe works,  
including the course of your own life and death."

The inside thing which will destroy you is not/can not be Self or God ;  
because it is not the nature of   
Self or God to be destructive. There are vices like lust, anger, greed and  
strong desires called vasanas   
which are inside and clouding the Self.These things must be expelled from your  
inside by meditation and prayer.   
Eradication of vasanas, which is essential for spiritual progress is  
underscored in this statement of Jesus.
