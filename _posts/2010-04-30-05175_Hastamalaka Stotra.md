Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi   
Wh _en Shankara, the Guru of the world, was travelling in the western parts of  
India and overcoming in debate the expounders of the various schools of  
thought, he once came to a village known as Srivali. When a brahmin inhabitant  
of the village named Prabhakara heard about his arrival he went to him with  
his thirteen year old son. He prostrated before Sankara and made his son also  
prostrate. He then explained that the boy had been dumb from his childhood,  
that he had no likes and dislikes, nor a sense of honour and dishonour, and  
that he was completely inactive. The Guru then raised the boy up and asked him  
as follows in a cheerful tone:_   
 **Text**   
1\. `Who are you? Whose child are you? Whither are you bound? What is your  
name? Whence have you come? Oh Child! I should like to hear your reply to  
these questions.' Thus spoke Sri Shankaracharya to the boy, and Hastamalaka  
replied as follows.   
2\. I am neither man, God, yaksha, brahmin, kshatriya,vaisya, sudra,  
brahmachari, householder, forest-dweller, nor sannyasi; but I am pure  
awareness alone.   
3\. Just as the sun causes all worldly movements, so do I -- the ever-present,  
conscious Self -- cause the mind to be active and the senses to function.  
Again, just as the ether is all-pervading, yet devoid of any specific  
qualities, so am I free from all qualities.   
4\. I am the conscious Self, ever-present and associated with everything in  
the same manner as heat is always associated with fire. I am that eternal,  
undifferentiated, unshaken Consciousness, on account of which the insentient  
mind and senses function, each in its own manner.   
 **5\. I am that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent as the  
image in a mirror is not independent of the object reflected.**   
6\. I am the unqualified, conscious Self, existing even after the extinction  
of buddhi, just as the object remains ever the same even after the removal of  
the reflecting mirror.   
7\. I am eternal Consciousness, dissociated from the mind and senses. I am the  
mind of the mind, the eye of the eye, ear of the ear and so on. I am not  
cognizable by the mind and senses.   
 **8\. I am the eternal, single, conscious Self, reflected in various  
intellects, just as the sun is reflected on the surface of various sheets of  
water.**   
9\. I am the single, conscious Self, illumining all intellects, just as the  
sun simultaneously illumines all eyes so that they perceive objects.   
10\. Only those eyes that are helped by the sun are capable of seeing objects,  
not others. The source from which the sun derives its power is myself.   
 **11\. Just as the reflection of the sun on agitated waters seems to break  
up, but remains perfect on a calm surface, so also am I, the conscious Self,  
unrecognizable in agitated intellects though I clearly shine in those which  
are calm.**   
12\. Just as a fool thinks that the sun is entirely lost when it is hidden by  
dense clouds, so do people think that the ever-free Self is bound.   
13\. Just as the ether is all-pervading and unaffected by contact, so also  
does the ever-conscious Self pervade everything without being affected in  
anyway. I am that Self.   
14\. Just as a transparent crystal takes on the lines of its background, but  
is in no way changed thereby, and just as the unchanging moon on being  
reflected on undulating surfaces appears agitated, so is it with you, the all-  
pervading God.   
15\. As this stotra reveals the Self as clearly as the amalaka fruit placed on  
the palm of the hand (hasta), it received the name Hastamalaka Strotra.  
Moreover, the boy, eminent in jnana, came to be praised by all people of this  
world as Hastamalaka.   
The father of the boy was speechless with wonder at those words. But the  
Acharya said to him: `He has become your son because of his incomplete  
austerities. This is your good fortune. He will not be of any use to you in  
this world. Let him stay with me.' He bade him go back and, taking the boy  
with him, proceeded on his way. The disciples then asked him: `How did this  
boy attain the state of Brahman without hearing, etc.?' The Guru replied: `His  
mother left her two year old child in the care of a great and highly  
accomplished yogi who was practising austerities on the bank of the Yamuna  
while she went to bathe in the river with some women. The child toddled  
towards the water and was drowned. Out of his compassion for the disconsolate  
mother the sadhu forsook his body and entered that of the child. That is why  
this boy has attained this high state.'

Dear prasanth,   
Sri Bhagavan's famous question Who am I? was asked by Sri   
Sankara to Hastamalaka as Who are you? The boy answered,   
what Sri Sankara himself answered to Govinda Bhagavadpada on   
the Narmada valley cave, when the latter asked him, Who are you?   
This is Sri Sankara's famous Nirvana Shatkam.   
The Hastamalaka Stotram, Tamizh versification of Sri Bhagavan,   
is chanted in weekly parayana on Friday evernings.   
Arunachala Siva.
