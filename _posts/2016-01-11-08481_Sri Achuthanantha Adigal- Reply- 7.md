Achuthananda took his leave from Nijanandar with a heavy heart and returned to  
Sampathgiri. It is   
said that he remained in the state of Nirvikalpa Nishta for six months. Then  
he went to Kasthambadi and   
stayed in a beautiful garden where for six months he continued to be in this  
nishta (state). Nijanandar,   
the Sadguru would join him at times and clear his doubts. He declared to  
Achuthanandar, 'Oh, gem of a   
student! You have crossed the ocean of samsara. You now shine as a Jivan  
Mukta having nothing more to   
attain.' Saying this Nijanandar returned to Kailasagiri.   
Having attained the substratum, namely the Akhandakara Siva Swaroopam (the  
infinite form of Lord Siva),   
Adigalar stayed in a forest in the vicinity of Padaiveedu for some time. (It  
was at Padaiveedu that Ganapati   
Muni performed penance in the vicinity of the Renuka Devi Temple). Then he  
traveled through North Arcot   
and South Arcot, Salem, Chittoor and Chengalpet, expounding the incomparable  
Advaitic truth to seekers.   
During this period he offered spiritual knowledge to more than two thousand  
students.
