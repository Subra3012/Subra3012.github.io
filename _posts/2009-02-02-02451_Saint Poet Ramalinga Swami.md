Sri Ramalingam was born in Tiruvottiyur in early 19th century.   
He was a Siva bhakta in the early years. He used to sing   
about Siva of Tiruvottiyur temple and Sri Rama of Tiruvallur.   
He developed devotion to Muruga of Tiruttani and in his younger   
days, he used to walk to Tiruttani from Tiruvottiiyur (about 70 kms)   
and pray to Muruga there. Even though he never wore ochre robe,   
he was a celibate and ascetic through out his life. In later years,   
he moved to Chidambaram and was praying to Nataraja of Thillai.   
Later it graduated into worship of Effuglence as Siva. He left   
Chidambram, and was staying in a village called Karunguzhi and   
was praying to the Effulgence, the light that was lit in his place which was  
never put out! He wrote thousands of verses under the title Tiru Arutpa. He  
had great regard for Manikkachagar and other 63 Saints. He has said in one  
poem: "O Manikkavachaga ! Who has merged in the Space, when I sing your  
songs, it is like a mixture of   
sugar juice, honey, milk and sweet fruits. I drink it everyday, without  
getting satiated. He wrote about 63 Saints: " I am not able to feed you with  
my child cut by a sword!* I am not able to lose my youth and become old with  
conjugal happiness, just because a woman doubted my fidelity!* How can I get  
the Feet that were praised by you?"   
(* Saint Siruthonda Nayanar.  
Tiru Neelakanta Nayanar)   
Saint Ramalinga Swami, told one day to his disciples, to shut him off in a  
room, where he would meditate for 48 days. The disciples did so and on the  
morning of 49th day, when they opened the room, they found nothing, not even  
his body! This was on Makara month,   
Pushya star day, on which even today, the devotees celebrate his Maha Nirvana,  
by lighting a big lamp and chanting. Thousands are fed on this day.   
Arunachala Siva.

Pranam,   
Ramalinga Swami used to say that giving Satwic wholesome food to people is the  
greatest Punya. Also in hindu religion and other religions Annadanam is  
considered a great Punya.   
I was wondering why this is so? There are so many other charities like  
building a house or a temple, building a well etc. Also spreading the  
awareness of the spiritual paths also seems to be a great task. But still  
everywhere I find that Annadanam is extolled to be the best charity.   
Can anybody throw more light on this matter.   
Om shri Ramana

Dear Disciple,   
One can live without clothes, roaming over naked. One can live   
without shelter, sleeping on the temple precincts and roads. But   
one cannot live without food, for many days. Even Bhagavan Ramana started  
taking some food, from His days in the Hills.   
This is one reason why Annadhanam is considered foremost.   
To enable the poor live in body and soul together.   
Secondly, Annadhanam gives satiation to the eater. One cannot   
eat for two sessions at a time. However, this is not the case with   
clothes and shelter. One can desire more and more without end.   
Twenty shirts and twenty trousers. Since a man may want more,   
as if he is going to wear them, all at a time! Women are fond of   
any number of saris! Give him or her one house, he or she will   
want another house. One TV, he will want another one in the bedroom. One  
cell phone, he will want another one with camera!   
Annadhanam stands unique in this respect.   
Old Tamil literature extols a man who gives food, as the Doctor   
of the disease of hunger.   
Arunachala Siva.
