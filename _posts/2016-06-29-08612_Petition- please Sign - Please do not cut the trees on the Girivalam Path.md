Dear Dr Sundaram, Sadhak and friends,   
Thank you, It is our duty I felt to do as much as little as we can! In place  
of the trees had it been our children or kith and kin, how would we run and do  
what not?   
I wonder...., we, 'Homo sapiens' are the worst among the living species, if  
some of the good lot can take at least minimal steps as this by just  
participating in such instances, would be the minimum expected!   
No wonder, Self Realisation is only for Homo Sapiens!   
The other species are far ahead, living in harmony with nature!   
All a divine play! Sometimes such plays are bewildering!   
The Supreme will prevails!
