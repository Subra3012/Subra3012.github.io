Dear prasanth,   
I have seen only pictures of Kumbha Mela crowds in newspapers   
and television. I consider that this festival is more religious than   
philosophic. There is one Maha Magam festival celebrated in   
Kumbakonam. Unlike in river, here they take bath in a huge tank,   
which swells with water during that day, i.e. when Jupiter comes to   
the Maga Star in the zodiac of Leo. It is also celebrated once in   
12 years. The crowds are in lakhs and it is more difficult for the   
authorities to manage since everyone has to take bath in a tank   
and not in a large flowing river.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
False teachers are created by followers which is why there are so many of  
them. After an expose, they may wander around for a while but many will find a  
replacment guru who they think is not false. Even now many who are not  
followers of this particular swami may think how their own guru is genuine.  
The urge to follow something external is one of the most difficult urges to  
deal with.

Dear friends,   
N's case is shocking because he has amassed crores of rupees as wealth and had   
about 2 million followers! In case his fakeness is proved, how many misguided   
persons would be there, left in lurch. What is more intriguing, is : Why  
should   
he run away? He should have sought police protection for his life and then   
explained the facts with computer and graphic experts at his side? He must  
have   
faced the suffering instead of running away. Sri Sankara says in  
Vivekachoodamani,   
wealth, wife or lover, and son are the three attachments, a true Jnani should  
abhor.   
He had the first two, the third one might have also been there? One  
Premananda   
caught about 10 years back, said that he had a dozen children, illegitimate!   
The Tamil channel has identified the woman too. Her name is one R... a cine   
actress!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear All, I think all that is happening because of many things.Like,people  
want to follow someone,they start doing that blindly,making him a  
hero,idol.Then starts fanatism.They dont worship ideal but person.Also,many  
spiritual people want realisation.And they get some glimpses of it.But ego is  
still there,making tricks.Spirituality can be very dangerous if we are not  
cautious enuf.I read teaching of many men who really believed they are  
realised.Sri Ramana Maharshi didnt follow anyone,just God,and become  
realised.Coz,we shud adore God in guru,not individuality of some person. I  
believe it is very thin line.
