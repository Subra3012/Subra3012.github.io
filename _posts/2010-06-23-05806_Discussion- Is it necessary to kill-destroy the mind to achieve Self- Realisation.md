## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 1 - Thus Spake Ramana

**Turn your vision inward   
and then the whole world   
will be full of Supreme Spirit.**   
The world is said to be illusion.   
Illusion is really truth.   
Even science traces the origin   
of the universe to one primordial matter;   
Subtle, exceedingly subtle.   
God is the same to those who say   
the world is real and their opponents.   
Their outlook is different.   
You need not entangle yourself   
in such disputations.   
The goal is one and the same for all.   
Look to it.   
 **There is only one consciousness.   
Without consciousness,   
time and space do not exist.   
They appear in consciousness.   
It is like a screen on which these are cast as pictures,   
and move as in a cinema show.   
The absolute consciousness is our real nature.**   
Bliss is concurrent with   
Being-Consciousness.   
All the arguments relating   
to the eternal being of that Bliss   
apply to Bliss, also.   
 **Your nature is Bliss.   
Ignorance is now hiding that Bliss.   
Remove the ignorance,   
for Bliss to be freed.**   
The perception of an "I"   
is associated with a form,   
maybe the body.   
There should be nothing associate   
with the pure Self.   
 **The Self is the unassociated,   
pure Reality   
in whose light the body,   
the ego, etc, shine.   
On stilling all thoughts,   
the pure consciousness remains.**   
Even though the world is seen,   
the Seer remains unaffected.   
Because you are accustomed to identify with the body   
and sight with the eyes, you say you do not see anything.   
What is there to be seen? Who is to see? How to see?   
 **There is only one consciousness which,   
manifesting itself as "I"-thought, identifies itself with the body,   
projects itself through the eyes and sees the objects around.   
The individual is limited in the waking state   
and expects to see something different.**   
The evidence of his senses will be the seal of authority.   
But he will not admit, that the seer--the seen,   
are all manifestations of the same consciousness.   
Namely, "I-I"   
Contemplation helps one overcome the illusion   
that the Self must be visual. In truth nothing visual exists.   
How do you feel the "I" now?   
Do you hold a feeling in front of yourself to know your being?   
The awareness is the "I". Realize it and that is the truth.   
 **The mind is only a bundle of thoughts.   
The thoughts arise because there is the thinker.   
The thinker is the ego.   
The ego, if sought, will vanish automatically.   
The ego and the mind are the same.   
The ego is the root-thought   
from which all other thoughts arise.   
Dive within.**   
You are now aware that the mind rise up from within.   
So sink within and seek.   
Seek the mind   
on being sought   
it will disappear.   
Everyone wants only happiness.   
Happiness, too as found   
in the enjoyment of the senses.   
This question was asked of a Guru,   
and the latter answered, "Quite so,   
That happiness which is a result of the   
enjoyment of the senses   
is the same as that of liberation.   
That desire of such liberation is one   
of the four requirements for Liberation   
This is common to all.   
So all are eligible for this knowledge;   
Self- knowledge."   
Pursuit of Self-knowledge   
should not be abandoned.   
Bhagavan replied, "Happiness is possible only if the mind is right. If the  
mind is not right, whatever else may be, there is no peace. The mind becomes  
ripe according to each person's fitness. A nastik (an agnostic) becomes an  
astik (a believer), an astik becomes a bhakta, a bhakta becomes a jignasu (one  
desirous of Knowledge) and a jignasu becomes a Jnani. This refers to the mind  
only.What is the use of saying it refers to the body? If the mind is happy,  
not only the body but the whole world will be happy.So one must find out the  
way of becoming happy oneself. One cannot do this except by finding out about  
oneself by Self-enquiry.   
 **To think of reforming the world without doing that is like thinking of  
covering the whole world with leather to avoid the pain caused by walking on  
stones and thorns when the much simpler method of wearing leather shoes is  
available. When by holding an umbrella over your head you can avoid the sun,  
will it be possible to cover the face of the whole earth by tying a cloth over  
it to avoid the sun? If a person realises his position and stays in his own  
self, things that are to happen will happen.** Things that are not to happen  
will not happen.The shakti that is in the world, is only one. All these  
troubles arise if we think that we are separate from that shakti."   
Nagamma: Letters, 17.05.1947   
In the beginning one has to be told   
that he is not the body, because   
he thinks that he is the body only.   
Whereas he is the body and all else.   
The body is only a part.   
Let him know it, finally.   
He must first discern consciousness   
from insentience   
and be the consciousness only.   
Later, let him realize that insentience   
is not apart from consciousness.   
This is discrimination [viveka]   
The initial discrimination   
must persist to the end.   
It's fruit is Liberation.   
D.: Is not dhyana one of the efficient processes for Realisation?   
M.: Dhyana is concentration on an object. It fulfils the purpose of keeping  
away diverse thoughts and fixing the mind on a single thought, which must also  
disappear before Realisation. But Realisation is nothing new to be acquired.  
It is already there, but obstructed by a screen of thoughts. All our attempts  
are directed for lifting this screen and then Realisation is revealed. If a  
true seeker is advised to meditate, many may go away satisfied with the  
advice. But someone among them may turn round and ask, "Who am I to meditate  
on an object?" Such a one must be told to find the Self. That is the finality.  
That is Vichara.   
D.: Will vichara alone do in the absence of meditation?   
 **M.: Vichara is the process and the goal also. 'I AM' is the goal and the  
final Reality.** To hold to it with effort is vichara. When spontaneous and  
natural it is Realisation.   
 **Effortless and choiceless awareness is our Real State.** If we can attain  
It or be in It, it is all right. But one cannot reach It without effort, the  
effort of deliberate meditation. **All the agelong vasanas (latent tendencies)  
carry the mind outwards and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts  
have to be given up and the mind turned inward.** For most people effort is  
necessary. Of course, everybody, every book says summa iru (be quiet or  
still). But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessary. Even if  
you find one who has effortlessly achieved the mouna (silence) or Supreme  
State you may take it that the effort necessary has already been completed in  
a previous life. **Such effortless and choiceless awareness is reached only  
after deliberate meditation.**

Dear prasanth,   
The ULLadu Narpadu ends as Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti.   
Liberation is where the ego is totally annihilated. This sums   
up the whole of ULLadu Narpadu.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
That shows how much humble and simple person you are sir.   
Humility is very much required in our sadhana and we all are part of  
bhagavan's family and one and the same.   
Indeed main purpose of this forum i feel is to help us to iradicate ignorance  
in us by helping each other.

Its called Sangha. In Buddhism.   
A Community where people help each other.   
So in such a community if there are two people who are both in the path,   
if one of them is making a mistake, the other can point it out to him and  
correct.   
since both are trying to learn, the other person quickly picks it up and  
corrects himself.   
so when someone shows ego, the other quickly corrects and vice versa.   
And thus, following the Path, both get liberated.   
Physically they help each other. Intellectually they help each other and most  
importantly they help each other purify their minds.   
Sangam Sharanam gachami. .. They sing.   
We call it sat sangh.... I consider Ramana also as a part of this group.   
He sits silent, but perhaps responds through others at places.   
Love!   
Silence

Kannappa offered one eye to Shiva. Shiva's 2nd eye also started bleeding.Is it  
a test for Kannappa whether he offers his 2nd eye to Him. It means God wants  
complete deattachment from body and mind.   
He gives everything to man and takes back one by one slowly. When man becomes  
old, first his heir becomes white then eye, teeth, ears at last his taste.  
Still man's mind does not to surrender.   
Those are so lucky who gets this awakening.

Saint Kannappar was called Thinnan by his parents. He came from   
the forest hunters' family. Thinnan means one who is strong. He   
was also called Kannan, because he had beautiful eyes. The eyes   
were giving him self pride and it was the ego. So Siva wanted to   
test his ego. So, through that drama in Sri Kalahasti, He wanted   
Thinnan's eyes. This is god's play to eradicate the ego. The egoless state  
is liberation.   
In one more story of Periya Puranam, Siva wanted the long lushy   
black hairs of a devotee's daugther. Mind you, this girl was to be   
married next day! The daughter and the father agreed. Her head   
was tonsured and the long hairs were given to Siva who came as a bhairva  
sannyasi, who wanted to make his sacred thread out of this hairs! As soon as  
the daughter gave the hair, with the consent of her would be bridegroom (he  
was also a Siva devotee), Siva appeared before them. The hairs grew in no  
time and she got married.   
The conquest of the devotee's most desired possession is the sport of Siva.  
This is snapping of the ego. In Arunachala Puranam,   
again a bhairava sannyasi wanted a harlot for the night, as he used to have  
sex only once in a year. The king sent word for the harlots   
but none were available for the evening. The king was in a state of fix. The  
queen offered herself to go to bed with the sannyasi!   
When the sannyasi entered the room and sat on the bed, and when   
the queen approached him, Siva became a child. The childless   
royal couple got a child for them. Even today Annamalaiyar does   
annual death ceremonies for this couple and there is a function for this.   
{My wife read this story first, she exclaimed: Siva is the most   
horrendous rascal....}   
Incidentally, what prasanth wrote about the ego nature of Kannappa   
from Muruganar's song is correct. The first paragraph is that story.   
Arunachala Siva.
