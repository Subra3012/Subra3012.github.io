## TAT TVAM ASI You are consciousness / Awareness

Hi Friends,   
 A friend asked me about thoughts and consciousness and who am i, i explained to him what the scriptures state as follows: [Please see if it is useful]   
1) Thoughts are not bad. Mind is a beautiful instrument with out which this  
discussion would be totally futile. Now, problem is only when a thought  
happens and we unconsciously follow them without choice. Here, the problem is  
not the thought but our being unaware !   
2) So if we proceed down from body mind consciousness, these are all  
present. We can see these. The body is there when dead, brain is there : so  
hardware of the body is there but consciousness is not there in the body  
and brain. Since there is no consciousness in the body, it is a dead body.  
Since there is no consciousness in brain, there are no thoughts and hence no  
mind.   
So consciousness or life is the "alive" entity in this body.   
3) You are the consciousness. How ? let us see.   
awake, dream and deep sleep are three states of mind. you are living through  
all these three states. For example when in deep sleep, there is very little  
consciousness expressing through mind: but consciousness is still there. when  
awake and when in dream consciousness is obviously there.   
So in all three states the only live entity that exists is "consciousness"   
not only this, it is also the ultimate subject of all experiences coz a  
dead entity cannot experience ! The body, the brain are jada padartha jada  
means unmoving, unintelligent, lifeless entities.   
3a) Why can i not be body-mind-consciousness complex ?   
No. Coz body and brain are present even when dead. In the absence of   
consciousness, they become just jada lifeless entities, like a piece of  
log.   
3b) But i am unconscious in deep sleep.   
That means brain is not expressing consciousness. But consciousness is   
there. otherwise, when someone calls out, you would not respond.   
3c) May be consciousness is only a function of brain   
Not so, as consciousness is not "local" to brain. When an insect bites me on   
my hand, consciousness should be present there to carry the message to   
brain.   
3d) So, Consciousness is just the electric signals in the body.   
No. Coz an electric signal is also "jada", "life-less".   
3e) If the brain is hit with a rod, where is your consciousness?   
When brain is hit with a rod, the brain becomes in-capable of expressing   
consciousness just as when the filament of a bulb is disconnected, it is the  
bulb   
that becoems in capable of functioning -- electricity is unchanged.   
3f) So is not consciousness local to the body ?   
No. Suppose i ask a question "Is time local to body", its a wrong question coz   
time is a separate dimention independent of space. so we cannot say, here   
time is there and here it is not there. So too, consciousness being life, a   
separate entity when compared to body which is dead, is independent of the   
dead entities and hence is independent of space.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, Thoughts are not bad, when these come   
from Pure Mind. It is the Pure Mind with which jnanis   
work. Again, Brain is a part of consciousness and not   
vice versa.   
Arunachala Siva.

When self-consciousness is mixed with adjuncts a compound consciousness is  
formed which imagines itself to be the self-consciousness and body at the same  
time and it is conscious of itself as a set of adjuncts and it is basically an  
object knowing consciousness.   
Till we disidentify ourselves from the adjuncts existentially we have no  
direct experience that we are unadulterated pure conscious beings.   
Mere theoretical understanding that we are pure conscious beings takes us no  
where.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, I agree that theoretical understanding   
and imagining of the Self, will not help. But when I mentioned   
Pure Mind or Suddha Manas, which Jnanis have, is a different   
thing. It does not adulternate the consciousness of the Self.   
Brahma Jnanis, who are in Sahaja Nishta, like Bhagavan Sri   
Ramana Maharshi, used this for all their 'activity' when they   
were in the body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 My post is a response to the post of srkudai but not on your observations about suddha manas.I totally agree with your view point   
on suddha manas.

Thank you Sankar. We are thinking about the Hill from afar and it is   
the Power beyond words. Arunachala Mahatmiyam says that the   
Hill will confer liberation even to those, who think of It from afar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hello Subramanian.R, what a simple fact. Think of Arunachala from afar and the  
Hill will confer liberation.   
It goes hand in hand with the Arunachala webcam page for those of us afar.   
For a while I began to wonder what had happened to you when you stopped  
posting. Then I saw the message about the trouble with your P.C..   
I'm pleased you got it fixed.   
Your posts do bring life to the Forum.   
Regards.   
Paul.

My dear Paul, thank you for your observation that I bring life   
to the Forum. Only Bhagavan has give us this life for all of us,   
so that we are fortunate to meditate, write and exchange views   
on Him in the common Forum. I am also one of the persons who   
view the Arunahcala Hill through the webcam, at least twice a   
day. This is the way to contemplate on the Hill from afar and it   
is by His grace, we can merge in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

If we experience the self every day looks like a Guru Poornima.   
By installing web cam so that we can have a darshan of Arunachala at any time,  
arunachala-ramana.org is doing a great service to humanity.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Do you know the story of Abhirami Bhattar,   
who lived in Southern Tamil Nadu, in the temple of Abhirami,   
called Tirukkadaiyur? He was always in the bliss of the Mother   
and people thought he is a madcap. Sarfoji Mahraraja, who   
was the king of that area visited the temple, saw this madcap,   
and in order to tease him, asked, What day is today? The   
Bhattar answered: Today is the Full moon day. All including   
the King laughed, because that day was a New Moon day!   
The King said, "If you do not show me the moon this evening,   
I shall kill you." He arranged for a big trap made and placed   
the Bhattar on the trap. If the trap is severed, he would fall   
on the huge fire beneath. The Bhattar did not hesitate, sat on   
the trap and started singing 100 glorious songs on the Mother.   
When he came to the 81st song, the full moon appeared on   
the sky!   
Yest you are correct. It is a bliss of full moon for those   
who could dwell in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Thank you. The descendents of Sri   
Abhirami Bhattar are still living in Tiruchirappalli, a bigger   
town about 150 kms from Tirukkadaiyur. The Brahman is   
always praised as One brighter than 1000 Suns. And the   
Bliss is praised as One with brighter than 1000 Moons. This   
is seen in Tamil poetry of various saint-poets. Bhagavad Gita   
also says the same thing about Krishna, in Viswaroopa Darsana   
Yogam. When the first atom bomb was dropped on Nagasaki   
in Japan, Einstein said that light and heat was brighter than   
thousand suns. Incidentally, Einstein had a writing behind his   
table which said, " (After discovering the theory of relatiivity),   
I now know that God is there, but He is very subtle." He is   
also reported to have said once: " I only want to know God's   
thoughts, the rest in this universe are all mere details!"   
Arunachala Siva.
