A small question to those who have knowledge on Sanskrit.   
What is the difference between 'citta' and 'manas' ?   
Which word does Bhagavan use when he refers to 'mind' in general?

Swami Vivekananda discusses this elaborately while explaining the following  
yoga sutra of Patanjali:  **य ोगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥२॥**   
yogashcittavrttinirodhah 2   
Yoga is restraining the **mind-stuff (Chitta)** from taking various **forms  
(Vrittis)**.   
A good deal of explanation is necessary here. We have to understand what  
**Chitta** is, and what the **Vrittis** are.   
I have eyes. Eyes do not see. Take away the brain centre which is in the head,  
the eyes will still be there, the retinae complete, as also the pictures of  
objects on them and yet the eyes will not see. So the eyes are only a  
secondary instrument, not the organ of vision. The organ of vision is in a  
nerve centre of the brain. The two eyes will not be sufficient. Sometimes a  
man is asleep with his eyes open. The light is there and the picture is there,  
but a third thing is necessary  **the mind must be joined to the organ**. The  
eye is the external instrument; we need also the brain centre and the agency  
of the mind.   
Carriages roll down a street, and you do not hear them. Why? Because your mind  
has not attached itself to the organ of hearing. **First, there is the  
instrument, then there is the organ, and third, the mind attached to these  
two**. The mind takes the impression farther in, and presents it to the  
**determinative faculty  Buddhi**  which reacts. Along with this reaction  
flashes the idea of **egoism**. Then this mixture of action and reaction is  
presented to the **Purusha**, the real Soul, who perceives an object in this  
mixture.   
The **organs (Indriyas)**, together with the **mind (Manas)**, the  
**determinative faculty (Buddhi)**, and **egoism (Ahamkara)**, form the  
group called the **Antahkarana (the internal instrument)**. They are but  
various processes in the **mind-stuff, called Chitta**.   
The waves of thought in the Chitta are called **Vrittis** (literally  
"whirlpool"). What is thought? **Thought is a force**, as is gravitation or  
repulsion. From the infinite storehouse of force in nature, the instrument  
called Chitta takes hold of some, absorbs it and sends it out as thought.  
Force is supplied to us through food, and out of that food the body obtains  
the power of motion etc. Others, the finer forces, it throws out in what we  
call thought. So we see that the mind is not intelligent; yet it appears to be  
intelligent. Why? Because the intelligent soul is behind it. You are the only  
sentient being; mind is only the instrument through which you catch the  
external world.   
Take this book; as a book it does not exist outside, what exists outside is  
unknown and unknowable. The unknowable furnishes the suggestion that gives a  
blow to the mind, and the mind gives out the **reaction** in the form of a  
book, in the same manner as when a stone is thrown into the water, the water  
is thrown against it in the form of waves. The real universe is the occasion  
of the reaction of the mind. A book form, or an elephant form, or a man form,  
is not outside; all that we know is our mental reaction from the outer  
suggestion. "Matter is the permanent possibility of sensations," said John  
Stuart Mill. It is only the suggestion that is outside.   
Take an oyster for example. You know how pearls are made. A parasite gets  
inside the shell and causes irritation, and the oyster throws a sort of  
enamelling round it, and this makes the pearl. The universe of experience is  
our own enamel, so to say, and the real universe is the parasite serving as  
nucleus. _The ordinary man will never understand it, because when he tries to  
do so, he throws out an enamel, and sees only his own enamel_. Now we  
understand what is meant by these Vrittis. The real man is behind the mind;  
the mind is the instrument in his hands; it is his intelligence that is  
percolating through the mind. It is only when you stand behind the mind that  
it becomes intelligent. When man gives it up, it falls to pieces and is  
nothing. Thus you understand what is meant by Chitta. It is the mind-stuff,  
and Vrittis are the waves and ripples rising in it when external causes  
impinge on it. **These Vrittis are our universe**.   
The bottom of a lake we cannot see, because its surface is covered with  
ripples. It is only possible for us to catch a glimpse of the bottom, when the  
ripples have subsided, and the water is calm. If the water is muddy or is  
agitated all the time, the bottom will not be seen. If it is clear, and there  
are no waves, we shall see the bottom. _The bottom of the lake is our own true  
Self; the lake is the Chitta and the waves the Vrittis_. Again, the mind is in  
three states, one of which is darkness, called Tamas, found in brutes and  
idiots; it only acts to injure. No other idea comes into that state of mind.  
Then there is the active state of mind, Rajas, whose chief motives are power  
and enjoyment. "I will be powerful and rule others." Then there is the state  
called Sattva, serenity, calmness, in which the waves cease, and the water of  
the mind-lake becomes clear. It is not inactive, but rather intensely active.  
It is the greatest manifestation of power to be calm. It is easy to be active.  
Let the reins go, and the horses will run away with you. Anyone can do that,  
but he who can stop the plunging horses is the strong man. Which requires the  
greater strength, letting go or restraining? The calm man is not the man who  
is dull. You must not mistake Sattva for dullness or laziness. The calm man is  
the one who has control over the mind waves. Activity is the manifestation of  
inferior strength, calmness, of the superior.   
The Chitta is always trying to get back to its natural pure state, but the  
organs draw it out. To restrain it, to check this outward tendency, and to  
start it on the return journey to the essence of intelligence is the first  
step in Yoga, because only in this way can the Chitta get into its proper  
course.   
Although the Chitta is in every animal, from the lowest to the highest, it is  
only in the human form that we find it as the intellect. Until the mind-stuff  
can take the form of intellect it is not possible for it to return through all  
these steps, and liberate the soul. Immediate salvation is impossible for the  
cow or the dog, although they have mind, because their Chitta cannot as yet  
take that form which we call intellect.   
 **The Chitta manifests itself in the following forms  scattering, darkening,  
gathering, one-pointed, and concentrated**. The scattering form is activity.  
Its tendency is to manifest in the form of pleasure or of pain. The darkening  
form is dullness which tends to injury. The commentator says, the third form  
is natural to the Devas, the angels, and the first and second to the demons.  
The gathering form is when it struggles to centre itself. The one-pointed form  
is when it tries to concentrate, and the concentrated form is what brings us  
to **Samadhi**.

Bhagavan Ramana uses the word Manam or Manas only, which He says indicates   
intellect and ego - both.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you for the quote.   
Here Manas is explained as one of various processes of Chitta.   
I find it a little difficult to understand, especially the following part.   
>> So we see that the mind is not intelligent; yet it appears to be  
intelligent.   
Why? Because the intelligent soul is behind it. <<   
I thought intelligence was a part of the working of mind.   
But here it is explained differently.   
What is intelligent soul?   
\   
On the second thought, I think the word Chitta which Swami Vivekananda  
explains here   
is the same as the word 'Manas', or 'Manam' which Bhagavan Ramana says,   
and 'intelligent soul' is included in the working of mind in Bhagavan Ramana's  
explanation,   
if I understand it correctly.

Regarding chitta and manas, I have a another doubt. When two students are  
learning one subject from the teacher, one is giving the better answer,   
Both have eyes, For an example, they are sitting in a class room and teacher  
is explaining the subject. Both are seeing the board, both chittas are   
working and bhudhi also. When the teacher is asking "A" he cannot give the  
full answer whereas "B" is giving full correct meaning. Both are very  
attentive.   
While giving the answer "A" feels he could have given better answer and when  
he hears "B" answer he feels 'yes this is the way I should have told.   
How it happens for "A". Who tells his budhi that his answer is not that much  
good. is it his consiousness? So first organs (indriyas) then chitta next  
budhi   
above all consiousness? which is ever shines?

The explanation of Manas (mind), Buddhi (determinitive faculty), Ahamkara  
(egoism) and Chitta (mind-stuff) given by Swami Vivekananda is as per the  
Upanishad and Yoga Sutras.   
Like a telescope which is an external instrument for seeing, the Antahkarana  
is the inner instrument to perceive. Like a telescope which has several parts  
like lens, knob for adjustment etc, the mind is a "part" of Antahkarana.   
When a person sees through a telescope, we do not say that the telescope is  
seeing but that the person is seeing, the telescope being only an instrument  
and the person is the intelligent being. Now the whole of person is not  
intelligent, for example we cannot say that the body is intelligent. So which  
part of the person is intelligent, and how does perception take place?   
The great yogis and sages analysed a person further (using discrimination and  
meditative insight) to get answers to such questions. They found that  
perception takes place through Antahkarana, the inner instrument which is not  
intelligent by itself. "Behind" that Antahkarana, the Atman is the intelligent  
being.   
Swami Vivekananda says in Raja Yoga:  _The theory of creation is that matter is subject to five conditions: ether,  
luminous ether, gaseous, liquid, and solid. They are all evoked out of one  
primal element, which is very finest ether.   
The name of the energy in the universe is Prana, which is the force residing  
in these elements. Mind is the great instrument for using the Prana. Mind is  
material. Behind the mind is Atman which takes hold of the Prana. Prana is the  
driving power of the world, and can be seen in every manifestation of life.  
The body is mortal and the mind is mortal; both, being compounds, must die.  
Behind all is the Atman which never dies. The Atman is pure intelligence  
controlling and directing Prana._   
Adi Shankaracharya wrote in Atma Shatakam:  _Mano Buddhi Ahankara Chitta Ninaham,   
Nacha Shrotra Jihve Na Cha Ghrana Netre,   
Nacha Vyoma Bhoomir Na Tejo Na Vayu,   
Chidananda Rupa Shivoham Shivoham._   
I am not mind, nor intellect, nor ego, nor the reflections of inner self.   
I am not the five senses. I am beyond that.   
I am not the ether, nor the earth, nor the fire, nor the wind.   
I am indeed, That eternal knowing and bliss, Shiva, love and pure  
consciousness.   
Regarding why certain person shows more intelligence than others can be  
answered from the practical point of view. Assuming both have the same  
retentive ability, the person who holds more associations in the brain will  
appear to be more intelligent and answer the questions correctly. Today "B"  
listens carefully to "A" and learns the correct answer, understands the  
pattern and that will be stored as an association in his brain. Tomorrow when  
"C" listens to "B", "C" will think. I should have answered like "B". Most of  
the worldly knowledge can be traced to associations and patterns. However  
spiritual knowledge is not association but insight.
