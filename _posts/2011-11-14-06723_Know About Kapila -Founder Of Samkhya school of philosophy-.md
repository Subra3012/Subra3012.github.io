Kapila (Founder Of Samkhya school of philosophy)   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapila   
 **Theory**   
Kapila was a Vedic sage credited as one of the **founders of the Samkhya  
school of philosophy.**   
He is prominent in the Bhagavata Purana, which features a theistic version of  
his Samkhya philosophy.   
Traditional Hindu sources describe him as a descendant of Manu, a grandson of  
Brahma.   
 **The Bhagavad Gita depicts Kapila as a yogi hermit with highly developed  
siddhis, or spiritual powers.**   
Kapila's descendants can still be found in Punjab in North India, and in the  
Fenlands, UK. They have their surnames as Kapil/Kapila.   
Many of the details about sage Kapila's life are described in Book 3 of the  
Bhagavata Purana, where it is mentioned that his parents were Kardama Muni and  
Devahuti. After his father left home, Kapila instructed his mother, Devahuti  
in the philosophy of yoga and devotional worship of Lord Vishnu, enabling her  
to achieve liberation (moksha). Kapila's Sankhya is also given by Krishna to  
Uddhava in Book 11 of the Bhagavata Purana, a passage also known as the  
"Uddhava Gita".   
Kapila is also mentioned by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita:  **Of all trees I am the banyan tree, and of the sages among the demigods I am  
Narada. Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the  
sage Kapila.(10.26)**   
Kapila is a major figure in the story associated with the descent of the Ganga  
(Ganges) river from heaven. King Sagar, an ancestor of Rama, had performed the  
Aswamedha yagna ninety-nine times. On the hundredth time the horse was sent  
around the earth Indra, the King of Heaven, grew jealous and kidnapped the  
horse, hiding it in the hermitage of Kapila.   
The 60,000 sons of Sagara found the horse, and believing Kapila to be the  
abductor assaulted him. Kapila turned his assailants to ashes. Anshuman, a  
grandson of King Sagara, came to Kapila begging him to redeem the souls of  
Sagara's 60,000 sons.   
Kapila replied that only if the Ganges descended from heaven and touched the  
ashes of the 60,000 would they be redeemed.   
The Ganges was eventually brought to earth, redeeming the sons of Sagara,  
through the tapasya of King Bhagiratha.

Dear Prasanth,   
Yes. Srimad Bhagavatam says Narayana Himself took avatara as Kapila.   
Bhagavatam speaks about 16 to 18 avataras of Narayana, of which Kapila   
is one.   
Arunachala Siva.
