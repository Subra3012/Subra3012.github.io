## Holi home

How to change the modern house to holi place? In every house people have lots  
of holi sign from door to the altar. In most houses some holi names are   
played continueously. Still there is no inner happiness. Some say people now a  
days have lots of electronic gadgets which spoil the atmosphire.   
People do pujas, japas, have lots of their guru's pictures. Still all are  
very much confused. They have lots of tension. What is lacking and why?   
Why we do not feel like Ramanashram at home? Where is problem?   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
I also have got at least 7 to 8 pictures on the wall and a   
whole lot of idols in the home altar. I do not play any   
round-the-clock electronic music but only Arunachala   
Stuti Panchakam. I think, the holiness comes from our   
genuine pujas and deep contemplation on God or Guru.   
Sanskrit mantras are said to invoke god because of the   
dwani, the sound. Here again, one needs a lot of sraddha   
and contemplation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
I think this is a common with most of us here too! I need to keep doing the  
who am I enquiry repeatedly and keep affirming myself the real essence. It has  
to be **Established** \- my real nature untill that time, when "I" does not  
get affected by any thing at all. I have noticed this - when I sincerely do  
the who am I enquiry and really began seeing the real nature, the surroundings  
also began to change, even the so called people around you also change - you  
begin to generate positivity around you.   
This is the eternal Fact - external world is a pure reflection of your  
internal Self. if the state of internal Self is mixed with emotions, so will  
be the external world around us. if the internal Self is pure and calm and  
happy, so will be the external world around us.   
So to master this internal Self is all that is needed. what could be more  
better than the "Who am I" enquiry. Satsangh is another great thing, it maked  
your internal Self calm and poised. constant satsangh with like minded people,  
and Guru will make your internal Self calmer and so would be the external  
world!   
Nagaraj

Very true. External is just a reflection of our internal state and that is the  
reason why each of us see the same world differently. Once our mind becomes  
transparent through sadhana, only then can we have the true vision of the  
external world also as nothing but a reflection of God. Then not only our home  
but the entire world is holy.   
Regards

By not watching worldly programs in the TV,   
By not keeping newspapers in prominent places,   
By keeping pictures of Gods and Goddesses, Sages and Saints in prominent  
places,   
By keeping a separate altar for God,   
By daily offering puja,   
By playing Sanskrit mantras early in the morning and evening,   
By playing devotional videos,   
By meditating regularly with a devotional attitude within the house,   
By rising early,   
By reading devotional books,   
By sprinkling Ganga water,   
By keeping houseplants,   
By traveling to pilgrimages,   
By remaining detached and devoted,   
By practicing silence...   
etc...   
will generate holy vibrations within the house.   
Om Shanti....

Well my words go like this   
As Saint Sundara said 'God is with us and God is within us' we shall fear for  
nothing.   
Keeping our body, soul and mind attention to them every time, we are in fact  
removed from the attachments.   
I'm trying to remove the attachments, It is not a time for me to become a  
jogi.

Dear ramanaduli and karthikeyan. M and others,   
It was just a test case for me yesterday. In Bangalore,   
power failed in my area from 10 am to 10 pm, the longest   
in recent times. I grew restless. I asked the security   
guard of our apartments, around 2 pm, as to what was   
happening. He said that a major repair was going on   
and the power would be restored only by 5 pm. We are   
so much used to external apparances, like seeing Arunachala   
in the Forum and typing a few posts etc., etc., Now how to   
go about? I started reading Vivekachoodamani in Tamil   
with Bhagavan's prose rendering. Even then, the concentration   
was only 50%. Then my wife said, "Let us hear the Pampan   
Gurudasa Swamigal's songs, in battery-opeated transistor.   
We were listening for about 1 hour. Being a new audio,   
I could concentrate more. It was 5 pm. The power never   
came and it became soon 8 pm, my dinner time. Then   
I was telling Bhagavan: Okay, everything is different today.   
Please restore power at least by 10 pm for me to sleep.   
The power came only at 10 pm.   
At the end of the day, I felt that a different life can also   
be led by anyone. But it needs some time to change oneself   
to the new environs. Any puja or activity, unless you are   
totally committed, is not going to become successful. There   
are two enemies. External, power cuts, or any outside   
disturbance. Internal, lack of concentration etc., Both   
have to be overcome.   
Arunachala Siva.
