Question: "Sir, can one realize God while leading the life of a householder?"   
Sri Ramakrishna: (with a smile): "Why not? Live in the world like a mudfish.  
The mudfish lives in the mud but itself remains unstained. **Or live in the  
world like a loose woman. She attends to her household duties, but her mind is  
always on her sweetheart.** Do your duties in the world, fixing your mind on  
God. But this is extremely difficult."   
 **Source** : P. 246 The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

Sri Ramakrishna has said: Living should be done with God's   
name in your lips always. Then living will never be hazardous.   
It is like rubbing oil on your palm and then cutting and taking   
out the fruits inside the jack fruit.   
Arunachala Siva.
