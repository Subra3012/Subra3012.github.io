## Regarding permission for translation

Ragarding permission for translation from Bhagavan and Ramanashram   
1\. Is it necessary to get permission from Ramanashram   
to upload your own translation of Ramanashram books,   
\- only books which is free to download \-   
on your own websites or blogs?   
I have been thinking of translating some of them into Japanese and Chinese.   
But I am not familiar with copyright rules.   
2\. One more thing I am concerned is   
Bhagavan sometimes did not allow devotees to publish English translations.   
Is it bad to translate materials without Bhagavan's permission?   
Strictly speaking, I think it is bad. Then what to do?

Dear Akira,   
Yes, there is a copyright rule for all books of Sri Ramanasramam and it  
requires prior   
permission to translate them and publish them in Japanese etc., The works  
cannot   
be given in full form in this Forum too. One can go only for a few excerpts  
here   
and there to make a point.   
Arunachala Siva.
