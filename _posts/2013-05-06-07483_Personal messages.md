Why do I have a limit to 2 personal messages an hour? Since when this  
limitation?

Dear Hari,   
I dont think there is limitation like this. I never saw this option. Maybe is  
something wrong with your settings.

I haven't touched my settings. When I try to post another message, this error  
appears "You have exceeded the limit of 2 personal messages per hour."

Yes,you are right. I tried to send messages and same message appeared. I guess  
it is some new rule.

I hope it is just system breakdown.
