Vichara is only Sraddha, attention constantly. It does not require  
concentration.   
"Koorntha madhiyal agandhai ezum idaithai aazhnthariya vendum...." says   
Bhagavan in Ulladu Narpadu. Keep the attention constantly, towards the place   
where from the ego sprouts. It does not need concentration. Concentration, I   
understand means 'attention' and not in the usual sense of mind-focussing.   
srkudai may please clarify further.

I know him, he is a very interessting man, I read about him in an enlighten-  
next magazin.....crazy life story   
Jun Po Denis Kelly told us some of his stories. Some of the stories made me  
think of Ram Dass - An American who took a lot of LSD in the 60's, went to  
India, introduced an Indian sage to LSD who found it interesting but reported  
that it didn't increase his awareness of God as he already sees God etc.   
 Jun Po told me that he used to go and listen to Ram Dass speak and found him  
enthralling. I'm perhaps a but unfair on spiritual teachers as I compare them  
all to Bhagavan and there aren't many that even come close to him. The  
humility and wisdom in Bhagavan's eyes are incomparable for me.   
 I've been thinking of Bhagavan and Eckhart Tolle's awakenings (I think  
Eckhart Tolle has wisdom and humility in the face of great temptation). Both  
men had a sudden awakening through fear essentially. Eckhart could no longer  
bear his depression and something cracked open within him. I am hoping to find  
examples of awakened people that have reached awareness through a path other  
than great pain. Bhagavan obviously woke very early as there was only a thin  
veil there but what fate awaits the rest of us? Where are the available  
masters who became constantly aware through gradual effort? Perhaps  
Nisargadatta is an example but I don't see the same peace, humility and wisdom  
in his eyes. Am I being unfair? While at Tiruvannamalai I greatly enjoyed  
listening to Mooji speak. Perhaps he is a good example? He found awareness  
through Papaji in the same way Gangaji did. I'm not sure of Papaji's full  
story however I know that he found awareness through Bhagavan.

Dear I,   
The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word 'Guru' is that which is heavy or that  
which is of profound impact. Etymologically Guru means remover of darkness.  
Infact gurutatva belongs to the profoundest of the five divine functions  
(pancakrityas) vis.Srishti (creation), Stithi (sustenance), Samhara  
(destruction or devolution), Tirodhana (veiling) and Anugraha (grace).  
Gurutatva belongs to the anugraha mandala. What does anugraha mean? It is the  
power which makes a mature soul to come in contact with an illumined master.  
Its operation is infallible and it confers the greatest blessing on the jiva  
by kindling the inherent jnana (self knowledge). Thus through bestowal of  
Brahmavidya it releases the jiva from the hypnosis of maya. In most of the  
cases this power of grace manifests through the personality of an external  
teacher. This contact is similar to the phenomenon of lighting a lamp. As we  
light a lamp only from an already burning one, so too the disciple gets  
illumined from the enlightened master. Usually the guru is compared with the  
legendary Chintamani which can convert any metal into gold. But Adi Sankara  
says in his Satasloki that Chintamani is an inferior simile. Chintamani can  
only convert the metal into gold. It cannot convert the metal into Chintamani  
itself. But guru does that alchemy. He transfigures the disciple into his own  
likeness through Atmajnana. The experience of the self deals a death blow to  
the disciple's ignorance and makes him transcend all dualistic perceptions;  
even the guru ceases to be an external phenomenon. "The infinite self alone  
shines forth, neither the guru nor the sishya, neither the teaching nor the  
scripture, neither you nor me, neither this world. Only that ever auspicious  
self remains! The one without a second! That alone am I!" (Dasasloki), roared  
Sankara that too right in front of Govinda Bhagavatpada.

I know that it might be damaging once samaya or spritual progress if one speak  
negative about another teacher, or spiritual aspirant who is pure in heart and  
deeds...   
but I never heard about a rule on this forum where you are not allowed to talk  
about teachers, or compare them or whatever...its all a mind game, nothing  
substantial, so nobody can get burned or?   
oh and my guru is the best (for me),,   
its about karma or not? I can feel a strong bond to a special teaching and  
teacher and really believe he is the buddha incarnate....and through this, Iam  
open for blessings from this teacher.   
but then I can feel nothing about another teaching and a teacher and others  
are full of devotion and gratitute for this teacher//teaching...   
is not so?   
this would technically mean that I can judge for myself but not for others or  
not? and when we talk in htis frame there cannot be much danger or?
