Verse 18: நல்ல மலரின்மேல் நான்முக னார்தலை   
ஒல்லை யரிந்ததென் றுந்தீபற   
உகிரால் அரிந்ததென் றுந்தீபற.   
A head of the four-faced whose seat is the goodly flower,*   
Was in a trice severed.   
Fly Unti !   
Say,   
it was clipped by a finger-nail and fly Unti !   
(*Brahma - seated on lotus)   
Arunachala Siva.
