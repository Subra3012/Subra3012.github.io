## Vedanta-sara and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 30, 2008, 08:26:24 AM  
---  
Vedanta-sara is again a small advatic treatise by Sadananda, disciple of   
Sankara. Just any other advaitic book, it analyses step by step, the   
nature of gross body, subtle body, mind, nescience and the states of   
waking, dreaming and deep sleep states and finally talks about Self-   
realization with the help of a Guru. The characteristics of a Jivan-   
Mukta is given at the end. The book is 227 verses, said to be written   
in 15th century. It cross refers Upadesa-Sahasri of Sankara and   
Naishkarmya Siddhi of Sureswara, another disciple of Sankara. Verses   
221-225 state: " He who does not, see anything in the waking state as   
in sound sleep; who,though seeing duality does not really see it as he sees  
only the Absolute; who though engaged in work, is really inactive; he   
and none other is the knower of the Self. In his case, only good desires   
persist, as do his habits of eating, moving etc., which existed before the  
dawn of knowledge. Or, he may become indifferent to all good and evil. After  
realization, humiliy and other attributes, which are steps to knowledge, as  
also such virtues as non-injury etc., persist like so many   
ornaments. Such qualities like non violence etc., come spontaneously to a man  
who has acquired Self-Knowledge."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Upadesa Saahasri and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 01, 2008, 08:36:17 AM  
---  
'Upadesa Saahasri' is again a work by Sankara, which is partly   
in prose and partly in poetry. It starts with various steps that the   
teacher would prescribe to the disciple, then speaks about negation   
of all attributes, merging of the mind with the Witness, nature of   
the Witness and the nature of dream and memory and concludes with   
the description of the Maha Vakya: Thou art That. One sample: "Even powerful beings like Brahma and Indra are objects of pity   
to that knower of the Self, who has no fear about the world not is   
afraid of death. He is a Knower of the Self, to whom the ideas of   
'me' and 'mine' have become quite meaningless." Bhagavan has   
described the states of wakeful, dream and sleep states in the same   
vein as Sankara, but there is no direct mention about this treatise,   
in 'Talks' or 'Day by Day'. Arunachala Siva.

## Laghu Vaasudeva Mananam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2008, 07:48:34 AM  
---  
As the name implies, Laghu Vaasudeva Mananam, is the condensation   
of a larger treatise Vaasudeva Mananam, attributed to one Vedanta Yati,   
who is said to have lived some three centuries back on the banks of   
Narmada, in Western India. The bigger version is not now available.   
This is a prose work, which talks about the four requisites of a book,  
discrimination between eternal and temporal, dispassion, the thirst for  
liberation and attaining the Guru. Then it speaks about nature of Atman and  
anatman, distinct from three bodies, five sheaths, five pranas, its apparent  
attribute as Witness and its essential nature as Existence-Knowledge-Bliss.  
Then about the theories of gradual and simultaneous creation. In between, it  
discusses about the literal and indicative purports of Tatvam Asi, 'Thou art  
That.'   
The prose is direct. There is no mellifluous and alluring poetry. The   
book has been published by Sri Ramakrishana Math, Chennai.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Vaakya Vritti and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 03, 2008, 08:49:30 AM  
---  
"Vaakya Vritti" is again a small treatise of 53 slokas by Sankara.   
The book is an illuminating work of Sankara, explaining the   
import of the axiom of identity - Tat vam Asi. This is the corner   
stone of Advaita Vedanta and this Maha Vakya is seen in Chandogya   
Upanisad (6.8.7). A sample. Verses 49 & 50:- "One should go on   
studying the srutis and thinking over their meanings as well as practising the  
control of internal organs and other virtues, until the right understanding of  
the meaning of the sentence, I am Brahman, becomes quite firm. When this  
Knowledge becomes firm by the grace of the Sruti,   
and the Guru, one has the cause of the whole of this transmigratory   
existence absolutely negated for ever." Bhagavan has mentioned about   
I am Brahman, in Talks No. 92 (7.11.1935) and again about Thou art   
That, in Talkss No. 511 (9.9.1938). In the latter conversation, He has   
said that Panchapada Mahavakyani (mahavakyas with five words) e.g.,   
Tattvmasi Atinijam (You are That is the great truth) signifies the only   
Truth and so many efforts and so much discipline are said to be necessary for  
eradicating the non-existing 'avidya'! Arunachala Siva.

## Laghu Vaakya Vritti and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 04, 2008, 08:31:56 AM  
---  
Laghu Vaakya Vritti, as the name implies, is a condensation of   
Vaakya Vritti. While the bigger book has got 53 verses, this one   
comprises of only 18 verses. Of the two Maha Vakyas, Tat vam Asi   
and Aham Brahmasmi which have been explained in the bigger book,   
this book takes only Aham Brahmasmi and explains its purport. The book   
deals with an examination of our consciousness, in waking dream   
and deep sleep states. In our waking and dream states, the consciousness is  
always associated with an idea (buddhi vritti). As such, it appears to be   
objective and continuously changing. This is called Bodha Bhasa - a   
reflection of Pure Consciousness - Suddha Bodha. These two correspond to 'I'  
and 'the Self, Jiva-Brahman. A sample,   
Verse 6 says: "Water heated on fire acquires heat and so becomes capable of  
heating the body. In the like manner, the intellect illumined by Pure   
Consciousness acqires its lustre and thereby illumines all other external  
objects."   
Verse 10 says: " The thread covered by he pearls in a string can be seen  
between two pearls. Similarly, the Pure Consciousness also, though hidden by  
the modifications of the intellect, can be clearly perceived in between any  
two modifications."   
Verse 12 says: "Persons aspiring to the experience of Brahman should,   
therefore, practise by slow degrees this restraint of modifications starting  
with one moment and then extending to two, three and so on."   
Verse 18 says:- " Consummation of this practice lies in the firm conviction of  
one's identity with Brahman, like what conviction is normally there in the  
sense of identity of the self with the body. One, who has realized this is  
liberated, indeed without a doubt. His body may then drop off, any time, any  
where."   
Bhagavan's teachings are also focussed towards the elimination of the   
world, self and the god to merge in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non-duel, Thank you. The mudpot (or golden pot) simile   
is only to stress that we are all reflecting the Wisdom of our Guru,   
the Sun, Son of God, in our different capacities. On the day, when all these  
pots break away, there will only be 'AKASA', the all pervasive, limitless  
ether, the Brahman, our Guru.
