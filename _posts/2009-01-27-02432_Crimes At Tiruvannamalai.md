Surya Prakash was from a family with spiritual leanings. He was   
a Sindhi, brought up under the influence of Hindu avaitic teachings,   
Sikhu Gurus and Muslim Sufi cult of complete identity with the   
Divine. In 1940, he read A Search in Secret India of Paul Brunton and  
developed a desire to meet Bhagavan Ramana. In 1948, when he was living in  
Bombay, he had an urge to go to Tiruvannamalai during his business trip to  
Bangalore. At first his friends who were with him, dissuaded him to go to  
Tiruvannamalai but with in two days, they all agreed to go to Tiruvannamalai  
with him, on a condition that they would not stay for more than one day. But  
when they came, they stayed for ten days.   
While sitting in front of Bhagavan Ramana, on the first morning, he was  
completely unaffected. In the afternoon, something that he had   
never known before happened to him! The sense of utter blessedness suffused  
his innermost being. He was later told that Bhagavan Ramana was gazing at him!  
He did not speak to Bhagavan   
Ramana anything and the books in the Asramam, he felt that he did not  
understand anything. But he had a feeling that he had touched the Divinity.  
In 1949, he went again. He went again in April 1950, before Bhagavan's Maha  
Nirvana. He went again and again, even afterwards.   
With the passage of time, he slowly understood the teachings of Bhagavan  
Ramana and side by side, he was practising Nama Japa also. By the infinite  
grace of Bhagavan Ramana, he says he has known that the deeps of peace and  
tranquillity with in him and He was indeed That. He feels like one's  
homecoming each time, he visits Tiruvannamalai.

V. Kameswara Rao was a Telugu gentleman who did not know Tamil. One day he had  
a dream, where an old man with a short white beard   
blessed him with His benign and radiant smile. He had read earlier B.V.  
Narasimha Swami's book Self Realization, on Bhagavan Ramana. He decided that  
only Bhagavan Ramana had come in his dream. He went to Tiruvannamalai that  
very day. He saw Bhagavan and also had lunch in the Asramam. Rao was a  
government servant   
and he had to learn a second language. He decided to take the exam in Tamil.  
He told before leaving that he needed Bhagavan Ramana's blessings for the  
success in the exam. Bhagavan said in Tamil,   
"Do not worry." He advised him to take Who am I? in Tamil, English and Telugu  
and read it with the help of a Tamil tutor.   
Back home, he started reading Tamil with the help of a tutor. He passed the  
exam. In February 1949, his eldest son had a severe attack of small pox and  
doctors had lost hope. The idea came to him to ask for Bhagavan's blessings  
and he immediately wrote a letter and sent it to the Asramam. A few days  
later, his friend brought prasad from Asramam. His son got quite well sooner.  
Even though he did not specifcally mention about his son's small pox attack,  
the reply came from Asramam where it was stated, "Bhagavan's blessings for  
your child laid with pox." (!)   
In 1950, he went to the Asramam, for Bhagavan's Mahasamadhi ceremonies. He  
strongly felt along with thousands of others, that Bhagavan could be  
physically no more, but He ever lived in their hearts. He liked very much  
Osborne's words: " I give people what they want in the hope that they will begin   
to want what I want to give them!"

Dear Munagala,   
Welcome to the Forum. We look forward to your active participation.   
Your name reminds me the great Mungala Venkatramaiah, the compiler of Talks  
that gives wealth of information on four years of   
Bhagavan's Life and Teachings in Arunachala. The compiler became   
later, Swami Ramananda Saraswati.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear soham 3,   
In this world of increasing crimes and terrorisms, all places   
inhabitated by humans are full of such activities. Tiruvannamalai   
is not exception.   
Arunachala Siva.
