**I will use this thread to share some of the Health and Fitness related  
articles that I found useful. For any queries regarding the articles here use  
the Rough Note Book thread for the same**   
How effective is walking for weight loss?   
https://in.lifestyle.yahoo.com/effective-walking-weight-loss-055609414.html   
There are so many ways to lose weight and walking is certainly one of them! It  
may not be as intense as, say weight training in a gym, but that does not mean  
it is not an effective weight loss method. All you need to do is be consistent  
with it and have patience, as it can take some time for you to see results.  
While its well worth the wait, walking can be monotonous to some, but you can  
keep the process interesting and yourself committed to the activity with a few  
tips: Track your progress ? These days you get various devices such as pedometers  
that allow you to see how close you are to your fitness goal.   
Make music your companion ? If walking is getting a bit monotonous, add music  
to liven up the process. You get music gadgets which can be attached to your  
fitness gear so that you don?t have to hold them in your hand while walking.   
Change your route ? Doing the same thing time and again can be boring. To  
spice things up, challenge yourself to a new route every once in a while. This  
will keep things interesting and will also require more effort from your end  
to fulfil the challenge.   
Benefits of walking   
If you still aren?t convinced about walking your way to a lighter you, here  
are some facts which will boggle your mind. According to fitness and diet  
expert Akansha Jhalani, ? _Weight loss does not only happen if you spend  
numerous hours in the gym on a weight training or cardio routine. Something as  
simple as brisk walking can also help you shrink your waistline.?_ Walking at  
6.5 km/h, a fairly standard pace can help a 65 kg man burn 362 calories per  
hour. She shares a few more benefits of walking.   
Walking helps tone your muscles as you work on your lower body including your  
thighs, glutes, hamstrings, calves.   
It increases bone strength. When you walk, you are essentially strengthening  
your bones by keeping them engaged and your chances of bone diseases such as  
osteoporosis, arthritis also decrease.   
Walking keeps you in good spirits as when you walk, your body releases  
endorphins which are responsible for keeping us a happy and joyful mood.   
Walking also keeps diseases at bay and even helps manage existing ones. People  
who have diabetes, high blood pressure can go for walks every day as it will  
help regulate their heart rate and also improve their blood sugar levels. The  
pace needs to be monitored by a doctor before you start.   
According to Global Health Authorities, walking 10,000 steps (6.4 km) every  
day is enough to help you lose weight and stay fit.   
Tips to keep in mind   
If you are planning to take up walking as a fitness regimen, you can start  
slow and then increase the intensity and duration as you progress.   
Engage in 30-45 minutes of walking every day to reap in its benefits.   
Walk wearing comfortable sports shoes which will support your heel and foot.  
If you are planning to go barefoot, there are special, thin shoes available  
for the same too.   
Morning is the best time to go for a brisk walk as there is more oxygen in the  
air and less pollution as well.   
**Note : In the above article I find everything correct except the use of  
Music while walking as it is quite dangerous on Indian roads when you do not  
know which Vehicle is coming behind you.**

This is the last verse of the treatise I am posting, additionally, which  
salutes the Lord Siva, who is consort of Ambika, Devi: Verse 44.52. of Ribhu Gita: தேசிகன் தெரிவித்த திறப் படி   
 தீரமாய் நிதித்தியாசம் புரிந்தால்   
ஈசன் நல் அருள் பெற்றவர் முத்தியை   
 எய்தலாம் என முன்பு விளம்பி மற்   
றேசிலா இந்த நூலின் மகத்துவம்   
 யாவும் ஓதி இதனை முடித்திடல்   
ஆசிலா ஆனந்த தாண்டவம் ஆடும் நம்   
 அம்பிகேசன் அகண்ட சொரூபமே.   
Arunachala Siva.
