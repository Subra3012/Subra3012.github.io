Friends,   
while viewing the tamil fonts in default size that is 10, "கின்ற சாலையிடை வே"  
in the space between words there is [] kind of rectangle mark, are others as  
well facing the same problem? But i noticed when I increase the font size to  
11, then it is fine. it would be nice if this can be sorted out. Thank you.

**I am a 7 letter word.**   
If i remove one letter from it, still it remains the same.   
If i remove ten more letter from it, still it remains the same.   
If i remove twenty more letter from it, still it remains the same.   
Strangely when i remove all letters from it, still it remains the same.   
Who am I ?
