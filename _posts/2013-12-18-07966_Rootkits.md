## Re:[3]Topic: Coffee - benefits  
Author: Hari                Date: August 29, 2013, 01:41:04 PM

**Coffee consumption**  
 **Benefits**   
All-cause mortality   
In women, coffee consumption significantly decreases all-cause mortality,  
apparently decreasing somewhat linearly to a relative risk of approximately  
0.85 for those drinking 3 cups per day compared to those who consume no  
coffee, but the relative risk then remains almost the same for up to 6 cups  
per day, according to a large prospective cohort study in 1993. In men, these  
beneficial effects were not as great, in fact with an increased risk for those  
drinking approximately one cup every other day compared to those drinking  
none, but yet having a significant trend towards less mortality for those who  
drink more than 2 cups per day compared to those who drink none. Results were  
similar for decaffeinated coffee. An inverse association between coffee  
consumption and total and cause-specific mortality was also found in a 2012  
analysis of data from the National Institutes of HealthâAARP Diet and Health  
Study.   
Reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia   
Several studies comparing moderate coffee drinkers (defined as 3â5 cups per  
day) with light coffee drinkers (defined as 0â2 cups per day) found that  
those who drank more coffee were significantly less likely to develop  
Alzheimer's disease later in life. A longitudinal study in 2009 found that  
moderate coffee drinkers had reduced risk of developing dementia in addition  
to Alzheimer's disease.   
Reduced risk of gallstone disease   
Drinking caffeinated coffee has been correlated with a lower incidence of  
gallstones and gallbladder disease in both men and women in two studies  
performed by the Harvard School of Public Health. A lessened risk was not seen  
in those who drank decaffeinated coffee.   
Reduced risk of Parkinson's disease   
A study comparing heavy coffee drinkers (3.5 cups a day) with non-drinkers  
found that the coffee drinkers were significantly less likely to develop  
Parkinson's disease later in life. Likewise, a second study found an inverse  
relationship between the amount of coffee regularly drunk and the likelihood  
of developing Parkinson's disease.   
Cognitive performance   
Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall.   
Likewise, in tests of simple reaction time, choice reaction time, incidental  
verbal memory, and visuospatial reasoning, participants who regularly drank  
coffee were found to perform better on all tests, with a positive relationship  
between test scores and the amount of coffee regularly drunk. Elderly  
participants were found to have the largest effect associated with regular  
coffee drinking. Another study found out that women over the age of 80  
performed significantly better on cognitive tests if they had regularly drunk  
coffee over their lifetime. A recent study showed that roast coffee protected  
primary neuronal cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death.   
Caffeine and analgesics   
Coffee contains caffeine, which may increase the effectiveness of  
gastrointestinal uptake of some pain killers, especially in patients with  
migraine and headache medications. For this reason, many over-the-counter  
headache drugs include caffeine in their formula. Caffeine itself does not  
have analgesic properties. In some patients with migraine, caffeine can  
alleviate pain by acting on the cerebral blood vessels. A 2012 study suggested  
caffeinated coffee reduced pain in an office environment.   
Antidiabetic   
Coffee intake may reduce one's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to 50  
percent. While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high  
amounts (7 cups a day), the relationship was later shown to be linear. This  
effect has been attributed to the compounds caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid,  
which are thought to suppress the formation of human islet amyloid polypeptide  
(hlAPP).   
Liver protection   
Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and has been  
linked to a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer  
that usually arises in patients with preexisting cirrhosis. The exact  
mechanism and the amount of coffee needed to achieve a beneficial effect have  
long been unclear. The cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF) beta has long  
been recognized for promoting fibrosis ability acting through the Smad family  
of transcription factors. In a report published in the Journal of Hepatology,  
Gressner and colleagues provide the first mechanistic context for the  
epidemiological studies on coffee drinkers by showing that caffeine may have a  
potent anti-fibrotic capabilities through its ability to antagonize the Smad  
pathway.   
Cancer   
Coffee consumption is also correlated in Africa to a reduced risk of oral,  
esophageal, and pharyngeal cancer. In ovarian cancer, no benefit was found. In  
the Nurses' Health Study and a 2011 Swedish study, a modest reduction in  
breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal women only, which was not  
confirmed in decaffeinated coffee, and a reduction in endometrial cancer was  
observed in people who drank either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. The  
Harvard Medical School reported in 2006 that researchers found that coffee  
drinkers were 50% less likely to get liver cancer than nondrinkers.[34]  
Another study found a correlation between coffee consumption (both regular and  
decaffeinated) and a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer.[35][36]   
Instant coffee contains a much higher level of acrylamide than brewed coffee.   
Cardioprotective   
Coffee moderately reduces the incidence of dying from cardiovascular disease,  
according to a large prospective cohort study published in 2008. A 2009  
prospective study in Japan following nearly 77,000 individuals aged 40 to 79  
found that coffee consumption, along with caffeine intake, was associated with  
a reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.   
A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of  
coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for  
those who drank more than four cups a day.   
Laxative / diuretic   
Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes  
considered to prevent constipation. However, coffee can also cause excessively  
loose bowel movements. The stimulative effect of coffee consumption on the  
colon is found in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.   
Contrary to popular belief, caffeine does not act as a diuretic when consumed  
in moderation (less than five cups a day or 500 to 600 milligrams), and does  
not lead to dehydration or to a water-electrolyte imbalance; current evidence  
suggests that caffeinated beverages contribute to the body's daily fluid  
requirements not differently from pure water.   
Antioxidant   
Coffee contains polyphenols such as flavan-3-ols (monomers and procyanidins),  
hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and anthocyanidins.These compounds have  
antioxidative effect and potentially reduce oxidative cell damage. One  
particular substance with putative anticarcinogenic effect is  
methylpyridinium. This compound is not present in significant amounts in other  
foods. Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed  
during the roasting process from trigonelline, which is common in raw coffee  
beans. It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, and even in  
instant coffee. Research funded by Kraft Foods shows that roast coffee  
contains more lipophilic antioxidants and chlorogenic acid lactones and is  
more protective against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in primary  
neuronal cells than green coffee. The espresso method of extraction yields  
higher antioxidant activity than other brewing methods.   
Prevention of dental cavities   
The tannins in coffee may reduce the cariogenic potential of foods. In vitro  
experiments have shown that these polyphenolic compounds may interfere with  
glucosyltransferase activity of mutans streptococci, which may reduce plaque  
formation.   
Gout   
Coffee consumption contributes to a decreased risk of gout in men over age 40.  
In a large study of over 45,000 men over a 12-year period, the risk for  
developing gout in men over 40 was inversely proportional with the amount of  
coffee consumed.   
Blood pressure   
A 2011 study showed that moderate (≤4 cups per day) coffee consumption was  
inversely associated with high blood pressure and high triglyceride level in  
Japanese men. However, the study showed no significant association between  
coffee consumption and prevalence of metabolic syndrome for Japanese women.**

## Re:[4]Topic:  Health tips - Common cold  
Author: Hari                Date: September 01, 2013, 04:21:37 PM

If you catch a cold, you can expect to be sick for one to two weeks. But that  
doesn't mean you have to be miserable. These remedies may help:  **Water and other fluids.** Water, juice, clear broth or warm lemon water with honey helps loosen congestion and prevents dehydration. Avoid alcohol, coffee and caffeinated sodas, which can make dehydration worse.   
 Salt water. A saltwater gargle â 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt dissolved in an 8-ounce glass of warm water â can temporarily relieve a sore or scratchy throat.   
 Saline nasal drops and sprays. **Over-the-counter saline nasal drops and  
 sprays combat stuffiness and congestion. In infants, experts recommend  
 instilling several saline drops into one nostril, then gently suctioning  
 that nostril with a bulb syringe. To do this, squeeze the bulb, gently  
 place the syringe tip in the nostril about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about 6 to 12  
 millimeters) and slowly release the bulb. Saline nasal sprays may be used  
 in older children.   
 Unlike nasal decongestants, saline drops and sprays don't lead to a rebound effect â a worsening of symptoms when the medication is discontinued â and most are safe and nonirritating, even for children.   
 **Chicken soup.** Chicken soup might help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils â immune system cells that participate in the body's inflammatory response. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus, possibly helping relieve congestion and limiting the amount of time viruses are in contact with the nose lining.   
 Over-the-counter cold and cough medications in older children and adults. Nonprescription decongestants and pain relievers offer some symptom relief, but they won't prevent a cold or shorten its duration, and most have some side effects. If used for more than a few days, they can actually make symptoms worse.   
 Experts agree that these medications are dangerous in children younger than age 2. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is evaluating the safety of over-the-counter cold and cough medications in older children.   
 Keep in mind that acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can cause serious liver damage or liver failure if taken in doses higher than recommended. It's common for people to take Tylenol in addition to flu medications that may also contain acetaminophen, which can lead to acetaminophen overdoses. Read the labels of any cold medication carefully to make sure you're not overdosing.   
 If a cough lasts after your other cold symptoms have resolved, see your doctor. In the meantime, try soothing your throat with warm lemon water and honey and humidifying the air in your house. Don't give honey to infants.   
 Antihistamines. First-generation (sedating) antihistamines may provide minor relief of several cold symptoms, including cough, sneezing, watery eyes and nasal discharge. However, results are conflicting and the benefits may not outweigh the side effects.   
 **Humidity.** Cold viruses thrive in dry conditions â another reason why colds are more common in winter. Dry air also dries the mucous membranes, causing a stuffy nose and scratchy throat. A humidifier can add moisture to your home, but it can also add mold, fungi and bacteria if not cleaned properly. Change the water in your humidifier daily, and clean the unit according to the manufacturer's instructions.   
 If your infant has a cold, sitting in a steamy bathroom for a few minutes before bedtime may also help.

## Re:[6]Topic: Teeth health tips  
Author: Hari                Date: December 11, 2013, 03:14:27 PM  
---  
You have so many good reasons to keep your familyâs teeth and gums healthy.  
Their sparkling smiles. Being able to chew for good nutrition. Avoiding  
toothaches and discomfort. And new research suggests that gum disease can lead  
to other problems in the body, including increased risk of heart disease.   
Fortunately, there are simple ways to keep teeth strong and healthy from  
childhood to old age. Hereâs how: 1\. Start children early. Despite great strides in decay prevention, one in  
four young children develops signs of tooth decay before they start school.  
Half of all children between the ages of 12 and 15 have cavities. âDental  
care should begin as soon as a childâs first tooth appears, usually around  
six months,â Caryn Solie, RDH, president of the American Dental  
Hygienistsâ Association, tells WebMD. âTeeth can be wiped with a clean,  
damp cloth or a very soft brush. At about age 2, you can let kids try brushing  
for themselves -- although itâs important to supervise.â   
2\. Seal off trouble. Permanent molars come in around age 6. Thin protective  
coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth can prevent decay  
in the pits and fissures. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention, sealants can significantly reduce caries. Yet only one in three  
U.S. kids receives dental sealants. Talk to your dental professional.   
3\. Use enough -- but not too much -- fluoride. The single biggest advance in  
oral health has been fluoride, which strengthens enamel, making it less likely  
to decay. Three out of four Americans drink water that is fluoridated. If your  
water isnât fluoridated, talk to your dental professional, who may suggest  
putting a fluoride application on your teeth. Many toothpastes and mouth  
rinses also contain fluoride. Fluoride should be used sparingly in young  
children -- no more than a pea-sized dab on the toothbrush. Too much can cause  
white spots on teeth.   
4\. Brush twice a day and floss daily. Gum disease and tooth decay remain big  
problems -- and not just for older people. Three-fourths of teenagers have  
gums that bleed, according to the ADHA. Along with the basic advice, remember: \- Toothbrushes should be changed 3 to 4 times a year.   
\- Teenagers with braces may need to use special toothbrushes and other oral  
hygiene tools to brush their teeth. Talk to your dentist or orthodontist.   
\- Older people with arthritis or other problems may have trouble holding a  
toothbrush or using floss. Some people find it easier to use an electric  
toothbrush. Others simply put a bicycle grip or foam tube over the handle of a  
regular toothbrush to make it easier to hold.   
5\. Rinse or chew gum after meals. In addition to brushing and flossing,  
rinsing your mouth with an antibacterial rinse can help prevent decay and gum  
problems. Chewing sugar-free gum after a meal can also protect by increasing  
saliva flow, which naturally washes bacteria away and neutralizes acid.   
 6\. Block blows to teeth. Sports and recreational activities build healthy  
bodies, but they can pose a threat to teeth. Most school teams now require  
children to wear mouth guards. But remember: unsupervised recreational  
activities like skate-boarding and roller-blading can also result in injuries.  
Your dentist can make a custom-fitted mouth guard. Another option: buy a mouth  
guard at a sporting goods store that can be softened using hot water to form  
fit your mouth.   
7\. Donât smoke or use smokeless tobacco. Tobacco stains teeth and  
significantly increases the risk of gum disease and oral cancer. If you smoke  
or use chewing tobacco, consider quitting. Counsel your kids not to start.   
8\. Eat smart. At every age, a healthy diet is essential to healthy teeth and  
gums. A well-balanced diet of whole foods -- including grains, nuts, fruits  
and vegetables, and dairy products -- will provide all the nutrients you need.  
Some researchers believe that omega-3 fats, the kind found in fish, may also  
reduce inflammation, thereby lowering risk of gum disease, says Anthony M.  
Iacopino, DMD, PhD, dean of the University of Manitoba Faculty of Dentistry.   
9\. Avoid sugary foods. When bacteria in the mouth break down simple sugars,  
they produce acids that can erode tooth enamel, opening the door to decay.  
âSugary drinks, including soft drinks and fruit drinks, pose a special  
threat because people tend to sip them, raising acid levels over a long period  
of time,â says Steven E. Schonfeld, DDS, PhD, a dentist in private practice  
and spokesperson for the American Dental Association. âCarbonated drinks may  
make matters worse, since carbonation also increases acidity.â Sticky  
candies are another culprit, because they linger on teeth surfaces.   
10\. Make an appointment. Most experts recommend a dental check-up every 6  
months -- more often if you have problems like gum disease. During a routine  
exam, your dentist or dental hygienist removes plaque build-up that you  
canât brush or floss away and look for signs of decay. A regular dental exam  
also spots: \- Early signs of oral cancer. Nine out of 10 cases of oral cancer can be  
treated if found early enough. Undetected, oral cancer can spread to other  
parts of the body and become harder to treat.   
\- Wear and tear from tooth grinding. Called bruxism, teeth grinding may be  
caused by stress or anxiety. Over time, it can wear down the biting surfaces  
of teeth, making them more susceptible to decay. If your teeth show signs of  
bruxism, your dentist may recommend a mouth guard worn at night to prevent  
grinding.   
\- Signs of gum disease. Gum disease, also called gingivitis or periodontitis,  
is the leading cause of tooth loss in older people. âUnfortunately, by the  
time most people notice any of the warning signs of periodontitis, itâs too  
late to reverse the damage,â says Sam Low, DDS, professor of periodontology  
at the University of Florida and president of the American Academy of  
Periodontology. Periodically, your dental professional should examine your  
gums for signs of trouble.   
\- Interactions with medications. Older patients, especially those on multiple  
medications, are at risk of dry mouth, or xerostomia. Reduced saliva flow  
increases the risk of decay and gum problems. As many as 800 different drugs  
cause dry mouth as a side effect, says Iacopino, dean of the University of  
Manitoba Faculty of Dentistry. âAlways tell your dental professional about  
any medications you take,â he says. A change in prescriptions may help  
alleviate the problem. Saliva-like oral mouthwashes are also available.   
âAlmost all tooth decay and most gum disease can be prevented with good oral  
hygiene,â says Solie. âWeâre talking about taking a few minutes each day  
to brush and floss. Thatâs not a lot in return for a lifetime of healthy  
teeth and gums.â

This recipe is from the bulgarian phytotherapist Petar Dimkov (Петър Димков).  
As I can see this recipes is for those who have not serious joint abnormality  
and disease like chronic deforming arthritis. The recipe is simple. Chop  
carrots fine like for salad. Apply this on the painful joint on all its sides.  
Envelop it with nylon tightly to not allow carrot juice to flow down. Then put  
lint above it. Keep this for 24-48 hours.

## Physical healing  
Author: mcozire             Date: December 18, 2013, 05:57:27 PM  
---  
Hi all!   
It surprised me at first that there was no post on physical healing here on  
this forum, but then I realised that it must be because of the great faith  
that everyone here has in the words and grace of Sri Ramana Maharshi. I would  
like to think myself as being part of that great faith, and I know that we are  
not the body etc. and to me this is perfectly fine. However I am struggling at  
the moment because my aunty is having trouble with cancer.   
You hear in many other spiritual circles about healing, and a lot of healing  
is involved with the life of Jesus Christ.   
How do the lovely people here in this forum approach sickness with their loved  
ones?   
Many many thanks,   
Mark.

Dear friend,   
At the highest level we are non existent and hence there is no one who is  
suffering and no one who is witnessing the suffering.   
Accepting understanding of the above to the core of being is very difficult.   
Next level as a concession is that the one Brahman divides into several beings  
one among you being you and one your aunt.It is like there is the supreme  
Brahman and all of us beings are like hands and feet of that Brahman acting by  
means of that one power.   
These beings including ourselves appear in waking state and in some distorted  
form during sleep.   
It is the one supreme Brahman which moves all of us deciding our actions  
.Hence we are within the ambit of God all the time.   
Hence there is no suffering at all.All the time we are within God and he  
oversees our entire activity.   
Even our sadhana is his grace.Hence there is no suffering.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear mcozire,   
I experienced some similar things,and the way i delt with it is exactly the  
faith You mentioned. I prayed a lot,and i trusted all will be well. What i  
have noticed is,it is very important that that person believes he/see will be  
healed. I think that nothing is impossible with faith and trust,and most  
important,with God. I truly believe that. Miracles are possible,absolutely  
everything. His power is something which we can hardly understand. I also  
believe,all is His will only! And only by His Grace!   
Prayer can help a lot,and deep and pure faith. I witnessed that in my family  
too,and on my own example,so many miracles. With God by our side,we can move  
mountains. Like Jesus Himself said. Such is His Glory!   
So,whenever You can,talk with Your aunt not to lose faith. She must trust she  
can live,that is very important. Not to give up,NEVER to give up! She must  
believe in that! Talk to her whenever You can,persuade her she will be good.  
Our true nature is the Self only,And what we believe is very much important.  
In the end,it will happen what is best for her,and everybody. That is the  
beautiful law of nature,beautiful and merciful nature of God. He knows best.   
Truly,Faith is so powerful. It never,never never turned Its back upon me. We  
are all Divine,and all power is in us and God only. We only need to trust.  
Truly,is there is anything impossible for God!!!   
Whatever is needed to happen will happen. We only must be aware that nothing  
is as it seems,and all is for our good. This life is just a stage,and what we  
truly are can never die. What we are is Eternity.   
I delt with losses in this way. I missed them,but deep in my heart i know,they  
live always and truly,and they are never far from me,but in my very heart.  
There is no distance whatsoever.   
May Bhagavan's Grace be upon Your aunt and Your family,May His Love and Grace  
give her strength and courage to win this battle!   
With Love and prayers,

Dear mczozire, I am sorry for your aunt. Let her spirit strong. Don't let her  
lose hope and faith. Many people die just because of the fear of the  
diagnosis. With God's help everything is possible. She can survive this!

Dear Lathaji,   
Thank You so much! I certainly have many questions regarding Indian  
cooking,that i dont know from where to start.   
Do You have some good recipe which involves preparing vegetables and rice  
together,like mix? Not even recipe,but i need some basic rules for dish like  
that. Which spices to put which are must,etc. I like improvising with food,but  
i dont know these basic rules,so to say,in Indian cusine.   
With love and prayers,

Dear Atma vichar,   
All these websites are lovely. Would you have something for fasting foods like  
for amavasya, mondays, shivaratri.... for those of us who are not able to do  
no food no water.   
Thanks

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thank You so much for sharing and explaining all this! It is truly a wonder  
what they can do,and how many ways they are using to jeopardize peoples  
privacy.   
I have noticed what You have said,about possibility to turn on our computer  
camera,and watch us. I am not sure is that is it,but once i have noticed sound  
like taking picture coming from my computer. From that moment,i put the  
sticker on my laptop camera.   
Thank You once more,Sir!   
With love and prayers,
