TEACHING THE SIMPLE MINDED   
When one group of villagers who had just been given Arunachala Stuti Panchakam  
[Bhagavan's five poems about Arunachala] to recite left the hall, a devotee  
asked,   
'How can such uneducated people understand the literary Tarnil in these poems?   
 **" They don't have to understand the meaning," replied Bhagavan, "they will  
get some benefit from merely repeating the verses."**   
I can think of another similar case. Whenever Echammal's   
granddaughter came to see Bhagavan, **he would ask her to read out loud  
Upadesa Undiyar** [a thirty-verse philosophical work by Bhagavan in Tamil]. If  
she made any mistakes Bhagavan would correct her pronunciation.   
Since she seemed to be a rather worldly girl I once asked   
Bhagavan, This girl does not look as if she has any desire for   
jnana. Why do you ask her to repeat Upadesa Undiyar each time she comes?'   
 **Bhagavan explained: 'In future, when troubles come to her.   
the remembrance of these verses will help her.'**   
This girl is now an old woman. When I saw her a few months ago?we had not seen  
each other for many years?I reminded her about these lessons that Bhagavan had  
given her.   
She told me. The verses have stayed in my memory all my life,   
hut it is only recently, by the grace of Bhagavan, that I have begun   
to understand their meaning.'

**Pointer-17   
SALUTATIONS - Real Meaning of Namaskara   
6th April, 1948   
At about 3 o?clock this afternoon a young boy, four or five years of age, came  
with his mother. She prostrated before Bhagavan and sat down. The boy  
prostrated likewise, but continued the salutations over and over again.  
Bhagavan laughed at that and told his attendants, ?Just see. He is prostrating  
to me over and over again. Perhaps he thinks that if he does so, he may  
afterwards do whatever he pleases.   
He is a young lad. What does he know? He is just imitating his elders. He must  
however be rewarded. All that he wants is a plantain. If he gets it he will  
stop. Give him one.? On being given one, the boy went and sat down.   
After some time, someone came and did sashtanga namaskara (reverential  
salutation by prostrating with all the eight limbs of the body touching the  
ground), but did not get up for a long time. People nearby finally made him  
get up. He somehow got up but began saluting again and again. He was  
ultimately prevailed upon to stop saluting and sit down.   
Bhagavan told the people near him: ?Namaskara means prostration a number of  
times according to some. What can be done? The real meaning of namaskara is  
the dissolving of the mind.?   
?What is the meaning of sashtanga namaskara, Bhagavan?? asked the devotee. ?It  
means that eight limbs of the body, namely, two hands, two legs, two arms,  
chest and forehead, touch the ground while saluting. The idea behind this type  
of obeisance is that the person doing it says, ?the body which touches the  
earth, will resolve itself into that earth ultimately, and the ?I? in me will  
continue to be ?I? alone?. That idea must be known to oneself by enquiry.  
Without knowing it, there is no use in doing these.   
With meaningless namaskaras people want to secure all the benefits: ?Swami  
must give them whatever they desire, be it a bag of clothes or money.?  
Whenever they do namaskara, I feel afraid. I must be beholden to them. I must  
act according to their wishes. I must fulfill all their desires. I must  
conduct myself carefully after knowing their minds. Not only that. Just by  
bowing to me, they get a sort of right over me.   
When people like us suffer like this, what about Ishwara himself? He must be  
beholden to ever so many; he must act according to the wishes of people; he  
must give boons to people. When swamitvam itself has so many troubles, what  
about Ishwaratvam? If anyone refrains from prostrating before me, I feel very  
happy because I need not be beholden to him. A Jnani need not prostrate before  
anybody nor need he give his blessings to anybody. That is because his mind  
remains always submerged. He is deemed to be doing namaskara at all times.  
Some people feel offended when they prostrate before a Jnani and he does not  
respond with another namaskara nor even raise his hand and bless them. But the  
fact is, before the others have prostrated, the Jnani will have already  
prostrated lower, his mind having been dissolved. Even blessing (asirvadam) is  
similar. The submerging of the mind itself is a blessing. The Jnani?s mind  
remains always submerged. That being so, who is the one to bless? What is it  
that is done?? said Bhagavan.

**Pointer-18   
BREATH CONTROL   
In the afternoon Krishna Jivrajani said to Bhagavan, ?During sadhana I feel  
that something in me is going up. Is that right or should it go down??   
Bhagavan: Never mind whether anything goes up or down. Does it exist without  
you? Never forget that. Whatever experience may come remember who has the  
experience and thus cling to ?I? or the Self.   
Jivrajani: Bhagavan has said one must dive deep into oneself like pearl divers  
with breath and speech controlled and discover the Self or attain the Self. So  
does Bhagavan advise me to practice breath-control?   
Bhagavan: Breath-control is a help in controlling the mind and is advised for  
such as find they cannot control the mind without some such aid. For those who  
can control their mind and concentrate, it is not necessary. It can be used at  
the beginning until one is able to control the mind, but then it should be  
given up. Since mind and prana rise from the same source, control of one gives  
control of the other also.   
Jivrajani: Is it good to strain to achieve breath-control?   
Bhagavan: No, straining is not good. Only a little pranayama should be done at  
the beginning ? as much as is possible without undue strain.

**Pointer-19   
Self-enquiry practice from 'BE AS YOU ARE'   
Question: I want to be further enlightened. Should I try to make no efforts at  
all?   
Sri Ramana Maharshi: Here it is impossible for you to be without effort. When  
you go deeper, it is impossible for you to make any effort. If the mind  
becomes introverted through enquiry into the source of Aham-Vritti (ego-  
sense), the Vasanas (mental tendencies) become extinct. The light of the Self  
falls on the Vasanas and produces the phenomenon of reflection we call the  
mind. Thus, when the Vasanas become extinct the mind also disappears, being  
absorbed into the light of the one reality, the Heart. This is the sum and  
substance of all that an aspirant needs to know. What is imperatively required  
of him is an earnest and one-pointed enquiry into the source of the Aham-  
Vritti.

asked Master what penalty should ba paid for his failure to defend him.

Bhagavan on Mind   
Talk 238   
In answer to some question Maharshi said : There is a state when words cease and silence prevails.   
D : How to communicate thought to each other?   
M : That is only when there is the notion of two.   
D : How to get peace?   
M : That is the natural state. The mind obstruct the innate peace. Our  
investigation is only in the mind. Investigate the mind; it will disappear.   
There is no entity by name mind. Because of the emergence of thoughts we  
surmise something from which they start. That we term mind. When we probe to  
see what it is, there is nothing like it. After it has vanished, Peace will be  
found to remain eternal.   
D : What is buddhi (intellect)?   
M : The thinking or discriminating faculty. These are mere names. Be it the ego,  
the mind or the intellect, it is all the same. Whose mind? Whose intellect?  
The ego's. Is the ego real? No. We confound the ego and call it intellect or  
mind.   
D : Emerson says, Soul answers soul by itself-not by description of words.   
M : Quite so. However much you learn, there will be no bounds to knowledge. You  
ignore the doubter but try to solve the doubts. On the other hand, hold on to  
the doubter and the doubts will disppear.   
D : Then the question resolves itself to knowing the Self.   
M : Quite so.**

How to check the Mind   
Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi   
D : How to check the mind?   
Maharshi : Will a thief betray himself? Will the mind find itself? The mind cannot seek  
the mind. You have ignored what is real and are holding on to the mind which  
is unreal and also trying to find what it is. Was there mind in your sleep? It  
was not. It is now here. It is therefore impermanent. Can the mind be found by  
you? The mind is not you. You think you are the mind and therefore ask me how  
it is checked. If it is there it can be checked. But it is not. Understand  
this truth by search. Search for unreality is fruitless. Therefore seek the  
reality, i.e., the self. That is the way to rule over the mind.**

Bhagavan on Speech v/s Silence   
Talks with Sri Ramana Maharahi   
D : Why does not Sri Bhagavan go about preach the Truth to the people at large?   
M : How do you know that I am not doing it? Does preaching consist in mounting a  
platform and haranguing to the people around? Preaching is simple comunication  
of knowledge. It may be done in Silence too.   
What do you think of a man listening to a harangue for an hour and going away  
without being impressed by it so as to change his life? Compare him with  
another who sits in a holy presence and leaves after some   
time with his outlook on life totally changed. Which is better : To preach loudly without effect or to sit silently sending forth intuitive  
forces to play on others?   
Again how does speech arise? There is abstract knowledge (unmanifest). From it  
there rises the ego which gives rise to thoughts and words successively. So  
then : Abstract Knowledge   
Ego   
Thoughts   
Words   
Words are therefore the great grandson of the original source. If words can  
produce an effect, how much more powerful should be preaching through silence  
be? Judge for yourself.**

Annamalai Swami on the dangers of giving reality to the mind   
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI   
Q: It is fairly easy to stop a thief from breaking into a house. You just lock  
the door. But in this particular case the thief is already inside! First we  
have to catch him and throw him out. Only then can we safely close the door.   
AS: To believe that this thief is something real, something that has to be  
fought and caught, is just like believing that your shadow is some kind of  
alien intruder who needs to be fought and expelled.   
If you try to raise your hand to hit your shadow, your shadow will also raise  
its hand to hit you. You cannot win a fight with your mind because all your  
fights will be like shadow-boxing.   
You cannot knock out your shadow by hitting it because there is nothing there  
to receive the blow. The shadow will keep dancing around for as long as you  
keep dancing around trying to hit it.   
There are no winners in a fight like this, only a lot of frustrated   
losers. If you start from the assumption that the mind is real and that you  
have to fight it and control it by manipulating your thoughts in some way, the  
ego mind will get stronger, not weaker. If a particular sadhana assumes that  
the mind is real, the practicing of that sadhana will perpetuate the mind  
rather than eliminate it.

CONSCIOUS IMMORTALITY   
Meditation on the guru's face or form is only for beginners, Advanced  
disciples should concentrate inwards on the Self. This is equal to meditating  
on the guru, for he is one with the Self.   
Q: Can the guru enable a disciple to realize the Self by transmitting his own

M: Yes. But the guru does not bring about realization; he merely removes the  
obstacles to it, for the Self is always realized.

NON-PARTIALITY   
A devotee while taking leave of Bhagavan said, ?Swami, I am going far away  
from you. The devotees who are staying in the Ashram are enjoying the bliss of  
your company every minute. Please accept me also in the same manner.?   
Bhagavan replied, _?Everyone thinks that special grace is bestowed on the  
devotees who stay here. If there is such a preference how can he be a jnani?  
is he so foolish as to be flattered by the people 's attendance on him and the  
service they do? The Lord is bound to protect a person who has surrendered to  
Him.   
In fact one who has surrendered need not even pray; the Lord always remains  
close extending His protection. The frog stays near the lotus but it is only

 **From: ~~~ Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, Talk 596.**   
 **Q.: Sri Bhagavan said last night that God is guiding us.   
Then why should we make an effort   
to do anything?**   
M.: Who asks you to do so?   
If there was that faith in the guidance of God   
this question would not have arisen.   
Q.: The fact is that God guides us.   
Then what is the use of these instructions to people?   
M.: They are for those who seek instructions.   
If you are firm in your belief   
in the guidance of God,   
stick to it,   
and do not concern yourself   
with what happens around you.   
Furthermore,   
there may be happiness or misery.   
Be equally indifferent to both   
and abide in the faith of God.   
That will be so   
only when one?s faith is strong   
that God looks after all of us.

SAYINGS OF ANNAMALAI SWAMI   
Don?t regard the abidance in the ?I am? as a part-time activity. You must have  
a life long commitment to get yourself established in it.   
At all times keep moving back to the ?I am?, your source, and do not let  
anything divert or distract you from this.   
The ?I am? in its absolute purity is the infinite and formless, so when you  
abide in it you discover the infinite eye of the Self.

**Pointer-30**   
 **EARNESTNESS OR FAITH (Sraddha)**   
(Faith is essential for knowledge)   
? B. Gita Ch. VI, Sl. 39.   
When the writer visited Sri Ramanasramam last July, he saw an annotation of  
Sri Ramana?s great work Ulladu Narpadu or Forty Verses on Reality, and desired  
to make a copy, but not having the leisure he left for home without doing so.   
So, when he came back to the ashram this time, the first thing he did was to  
obtain this copy from Sri Bhagavan and write out a copy for himself. Seeing  
him doing this writing with earnestness (sraddha), though with a certain  
amount of difficulty and strain (due obviously to his not having been  
accustomed to squatting and doing continuous writing work), Bhagavan told a  
story of a sannyasi and his disciples, to two of the long-standing residents  
of the ashram and a few of the visitors who were then before Him, to  
illustrate what is called sraddha, i.e., earnestness of purpose.   
There was once a Guru who had eight disciples. One day he desired them all to  
make a copy of his teachings from a notebook he had kept. One of them, who had  
lived an easy-going life before renouncing the world, could not make a copy  
for himself. He, therefore, paid a couple of rupees to a fellow disciple and  
requested him to make a copy for him also. The Guru examined the copy books  
one day and, noticing two books in the same handwriting, asked the disciples  
for an explanation. Both the writer and the one on whose behalf it was written  
told the truth about it.   
The Master commented that, though speaking the truth was an essential quality  
of a spiritual aspirant, yet that alone would not carry one to one?s goal but  
that sraddha (earnestness of purpose) was also necessary and since this had  
not been exhibited by the disciple who had entrusted his own labour to another  
he was disqualified from discipleship. Referring to his making payment for the  
work, the Guru sarcastically remarked that ?Salvation? costs more than that  
and he was at liberty to purchase it rather than undergo training under him.  
So saying he dismissed that disciple.   
The tediousness of the process of copying might have deflected the writer from  
completing the book, but this story gave him not a little impetus to copy it  
entirely by his own hand and to endeavour strenuously and ceaselessly towards  
the goal sketched out therein. The story is told here to encourage other  
aspirants.
