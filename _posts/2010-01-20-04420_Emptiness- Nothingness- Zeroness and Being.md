I would like a section where people discuss their perceptions of reality and  
experiences of self-enquiry.   
At the moment there are for instance a number of sections on the 'teachings'  
of Maharshi which I dont think are as important as seekers sharing their sense  
of I.   
I think it would be useful if seekers as they are seeking document what  
perception of reality they are having now. I think this would be useful.   
Often I make a post and the replies are just quotes from a book by Maharshi -  
I don't like this because it is not a sharing of your sense of I when you open  
a book and start copying it into Internet Explorer - how is this self-enquiry,  
you are just copying a book.   
Share your sense of I. I think this is good. Copying books is not good.

## Erich Segal  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 21, 2010, 02:12:02 PM

Erich Segal died last Sunday in his London home. He became famous   
after his book The Love Story, which was his first book and later   
a Hollywood movie. He was 33 then! It gave him tons of money   
for the rest of his life.   
Erich Segal was born to a Jewish parents in New York. His father   
was a Jewish rabbi who wanted his son also to become a Rabbi.   
But Segal showed interest in classical languages and poetry. He   
studied Hebrew, Latin and Greek and Shakespeare, at Princeton, Yale and later  
in Oxford. He was a good poet too, even though people know him only as great  
novelist. He got an award for his Latin erudition and writing poems in Latin  
( an award held previously only by T.S. Eliot). He taught in Oxford, married  
an English girl and settled down in England.   
His later years were full of tragedy. He took to Parkinson's   
disease which restricted his mobility and writing capability.   
He wrote a scholarly work titled The Death of Comedy in the   
year 2000, about the degradation of comedy in the world   
and its people, in the 20th century.   
He was 72 when he died.   
He is survived by his wife and two daughters.   
His famous quote in Love Story: "Loving is not saying sorry."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tinnitus - buzzing in the ears  
Author: snow                Date: January 20, 2010, 08:21:32 PM

My left ear is almost deaf and I suffer from tinnitus almost all the time.  
Well I only _suffer_ from it during the night but it is present always. I  
wonder if there is any mantras or other ways that it could be removed.

Dear snow,   
I do not know whether there are any specific mantras for specific   
problems. The Hindu Ayurveda and Mantra Sastra have some such   
prescriptions. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was an expert in that   
field. But I know only one mantra, which is, I believe, a cure-all.   
You may try this Arunachala Siva...Arunachala Siva. Total faith   
and unflinching conviction are required.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well I'll give it a try anyway. Just chanting Arunachala Siva makes me feel  
good.

Dear I,   
I don't know if it was Sri Ramana Maharshi or some other saint. A middle aged  
man who was blind and at the same time even spiritually oriented came to this  
saint and had some conversations over some spiritual query he had. After a  
long session of talk, this man felt so sorry and sad for Himself that he was  
not able to see the Saint from his eyes to his heart's content. He cried to  
the saint over his this disability.   
The saint patted his shoulders and said to him, "oye, why do you worry over  
this? just be thankful for God that one of your senses is conquered. The eyes  
sees only external things, after all is this not what various Sadhakas aspire  
for? controlling you senses. Naturally you are gifted in way that your eyes  
don't lead you outwards and it is that much more easier for you to control  
your senses now"   
The eyes sees only external things the ear hears only external sounds. these  
are all distractions. Do you need any ear to listed to your consciousness? The  
lesser you are hearing, the better, for much lesser you will be pondering over  
what you heard, just a little more easier to abide as Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Perhaps, they (Plenum, Self, Existence, Transcendental Reality, Pure  
Consciousness, Awareness, Absolute ) also want to know whether you and i are  
the same with them?   
You yourself have just created several objects. Why don't one to provide them  
with any qualities? Or deprive them of qualities. What is the use of it?

Quote  
May be these terminologies are for ego-satisfaction of english speaking  
buddhists & non-dualists.   
Of course they are. As well as any terminilogy.
