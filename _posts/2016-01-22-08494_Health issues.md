##  Guru Ramana Prasadam - Sri Muruganar - Tr.By Robert Butler: Reply: 8  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 22, 2016, 12:21:08 PM  
---  
Verse 28: As far as I am concerned, there is nothing apart from myself. As far as He is  
concerned, there is nothing   
apart from Himself. In the Oneness, the expanse of grace that possess such a  
nature, to think that these   
are two is an incorrect understanding that occurs at the level of limiting  
factors that are merely imagined.   
(Upadhi unarvu in Tamizh)   
Verse 409: To maintain self attention without a break, is how I show my deep gratitude  
towards Him, who brought   
about His victorious rule within my heart. Other than this, there is no  
other way. A benediction upon   
the glorious Self that shines alone within the heart through the non dual  
truth of its self nature!   
concluded.   
The full book Guru Ramana Prasadam of Muruganar is available in Tamizh. The  
translation of Robert   
Butler is also available.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Graham Sir,   
We hope slowly but steadily, the tumour will completely disappear, never to  
return by Bhagavan and Arunachala'a grace and you will be able to resume your  
earlier normal routine life soon.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Sri Bhagwan: The creature is powerless and the Creator is All-powerful. How to  
approach Him? To entrust oneself to His care is the only thing left for him;  
total surrender is the only way.   
Dear Sri Graham,   
To know that you are suffering from such painful disease is very disconcerting  
to all of us, to say the least. We all have kept praying here for your speedy  
recovery from this dreaded disease, and as Sri Bhagwan's Grace is always with  
you, I have no doubt that heart-felt prayers of so many of His devotees and  
His Grace will work miracle, and you will come out of this fatal disease  
unscathed to further inspire and guide Hid devotees. Therefore, all I wish to  
convey is that you should undergo whatever system of medicines His Grace takes  
you to, but nevertheless you must surrender inwardly and entrust yourself to  
His Care. I am certain, like so many others, that all will be well sooner than  
later.   
Pranam,   
 Anil   
Note: Dear Sri Graham, I wish to say that if wheat-plant has not yet been  
harvested in Tamil Nadu, and if those standing plants in the fields have  
wheat-grains which still contain milk, that milk is very beneficial for the  
cure form this disease which you have contracted. I feel that if you would  
have taken one glass of this milk daily, at least for some time, it will sure  
work wonders. I have been knowing about this unfailing panacea for a very long  
time now, but when I had been typing as above, this came to me unthought, and  
so it occurred to me that I should let you know about it. Pranam, Anil

Dear Graham,   
very sad to hear the latest update on your health. Your decision to fly to USA  
is good on this material health aspect.   
no other words to say. when we get pain to this body, how much pain it is? oh  
Arunachala....protect your devotees....in the nerves and veins let Love and  
Peace flow instead of pain......

Sir,   
Do any members have administrator permission at this forum?   
There should always be a few, in case the site is spammed, or subject to

My dear Graham,   
Regardless of the troubles and tribulations, you will succeed in removing the  
cancer growth.   
Please fly to U.S. to get treatment and you will get well with Sri Bhagavan's  
Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Bhagwan: The creature is powerless and the Creator is All-powerful. How to  
approach Him? To entrust oneself to His care is the only thing left for him;  
total surrender is the only way.   
Dear Sri Graham,   
To know that you are suffering from such painful disease is very disconcerting  
to all of us, to say the least. We all have kept praying here for your speedy  
recovery from this dreaded disease, and as Sri Bhagwan's Grace is always with  
you, I have no doubt that heart-felt prayers of so many of His devotees and  
His Grace will work miracle, and you will come out of this fatal disease  
unscathed to further inspire and guide Hid devotees. Therefore, all I wish to  
convey is that you should undergo whatever system of medicines His Grace takes  
you to, but nevertheless you must surrender inwardly and entrust yourself to  
His Care. I am certain, like so many others, that all will be well sooner than  
later.   
Pranam,   
 Anil   
Note: Dear Sri Graham, I wish to say that if wheat-plant has not yet been  
harvested in Tamil Nadu, and if those standing plants in the fields have  
wheat-grains which still contain milk, that milk is very beneficial for the  
cure form this disease which you have contracted. I feel that if you would  
have taken one glass of this milk daily, at least for some time, it will sure  
work wonders. I have been knowing about this unfailing panacea for a very long  
time now, but when I had been typing as above, this came to me unthought, and  
so it occurred to me that I should let you know about it. Pranam, Anil

Dear Graham,   
very sad to hear the latest update on your health. Your decision to fly to USA  
is good on this material health aspect.   
no other words to say. when we get pain to this body, how much pain it is? oh  
Arunachala....protect your devotees....in the nerves and veins let Love and  
Peace flow instead of pain......

Dear Graham,   
Only today i happened to check your update.   
adhyavocadadhivaktā prathamo daivyo bhiṣak,   
ahīgṁśca sarvā?jaṁbhayantsarvāśca yātudhānyaḥ.   
May that Divine Physician, First among gods, exalt (me) in His all-redeeming  
Transcendent Being, having cut off all evil, whether in the form of poisonous  
creatures and wild beasts, or the demoniacal natures in creation.   
(Rudram 1.6)   
We pray and wish all goes well for you!   
Best wishes,

Sir,   
Do any members have administrator permission at this forum?   
There should always be a few, in case the site is spammed, or subject to  
trolling etc.
