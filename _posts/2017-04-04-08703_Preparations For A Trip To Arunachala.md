Hi,   
I'm planning to come to Tiruvannamalai this June, and have made arrangements  
to stay with an orphanage in the town. I will be staying for three weeks, and  
hope to do much sadhana during this time. I will apply for an e-visa and  
purchase plane tickets soon. Are there any specific preparations that I should  
make before leaving for Arunachala? Some people have mentioned in other posts  
that one should contact Ramanasram before coming, is this still necessary even  
though I will not be staying there?   
Aside from specific things I should need to arrange/bring on my journey (such  
as vaccinations - which vaccinations are necessary for a westerner?), are  
there any practical tips or pieces of advice about being in India that I  
should know of? This will be my first time traveling to the country, so I can  
only guess what it would be like.   
Much thanks for the help!

Dear Orihh   
Nice to hear that you are going to Thiruvannamalai.   
Normally foreigners take Malaria vaccinations. (I heard it is not a must )   
During the month of June it is hot temperature, drink more water.   
Pl visit Ramanasramam, skandashramam, virupaksha guhai, Guhai Namasivayar  
temple, Big Arunachala temple, Adi Annamalai temple.   
Pl do Girivalam in the Morning between 4 to 8 am. You can have lunch at  
Ramanashramam once or twice for this you inform before to Dr Srinivasa  
Murthy or Mr Mani, Ramanashramam.

Thank you for your response Balaji. Today I read the travel page on this  
website and found a lot of valuable information.   
I'd like to know, how important would it be for a foreigner to have access to  
clean water? Would it be safe for me to drink the water(which I've read is  
scarce at the moment) that locals drink or should I always have bottled juice  
or water I've filtered myself instead?

Dear Orihh,   
Suggest that you have a word with one gentleman Mr.Srinivasa Murthy - who  
takes care of accomodation - in Ramanasramam (RAmansramam phone no+91- 4175-  
237200)or any other staff member in Sri Ramanasramam who can guide you, since  
Sri RAmanasramam has a lot of foreign visitors.   
Suggest that you keep the addresses and phone numbers of your country's  
embassy/consulate office handy.   
Keep your money in 2 or 3 places and be weary of unscrupulous auto  
rickshaws.At the Tiruvannamalai temple, there will be people asking for money  
to feed cows or something like that - stay clear from all of them, be  
fearless, your money is yours to be spent at your discretion and you are a  
guest of India. Be familiar with the conveyance fare, whether you are  
travelling in an auto or a call taxi don't pay more and feel short changed.   
If there is a facility in your ashram, to deposit your belongings safely  
,please use that while still keeping some money for daily use.Try to have 2 or  
3 Indian confidantes whom you can rely on in case of any difficulty.   
You probably will be coming from Chennai (5 hour journey to Tiruvannamalai )  
in which case there are cabs available. You can check with Sri Ramanasramam  
and see if you can club your journey with someone else both while going and  
while returning.   
If you a lady, then needless to say additional care has to be taken.   
The southern part of India is a safe place for women to travel but all the  
same try to go everywhere with some trustworthy company of both sexes.   
While going on Girivallam please see that you have company on above lines  
.Tiruvannamalai like the rest of South India is facing severe water shortage  
and you should be aware of this, while not being perturbed.   
In case of any difficulty, you can even write on this forum, bid your time  
and there will be surely someone who will be in a position to help you to get  
out of that difficulty . There may some forum member at Tiruvannamalai or  
there may be someone nearby from Chennai or Bangalore who can help.   
Having said all this, which are of the nature of elaborate precautions since  
you are visiting a foreign country (hope for the best but be prepared),place  
your faith in Bhagavan.While taking above precautions and other precautions  
suggested by others, still be free and be peaceful and trust Bhagavan to take  
care of you. He never fails us.   
Regards,   
Anand.
