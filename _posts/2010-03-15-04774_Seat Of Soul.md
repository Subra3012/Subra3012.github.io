## Self and the space

Dear sirs   
It is true that when we are in deep sleep nothing exists, when we wake up  
world exists. They say the self i.e. consiousness pervades everywhere.   
That means the consiousness exists in living things, non living things. Apart  
from things, we know everywhere space is there. So the self, consiousness and   
space all are same?   
There is one example every one is giving... i.e. Gata akasha. There is akasha  
inside the pot as well as outside also. When the pot is broken there is one   
akasha. In the same way when we leave this body, does the self merges with the  
space. I hope learned and experienced people do not mistake me. rather   
I request you to explain this.   
Thanking you.   
Ramanaduli

## Lessons from Life

**Divine Retribution**   
... some hunters chanced to be in the area after failing to find game. When  
they first laid eyes on Milarepa's pale green form, they fled in terror  
thinking he was not a man but some kind of evil spirit. But on assuring them  
he was indeed a human like themselves they lost their fear of him. They  
demanded that Milarepa share some of his provisions with them as they were out  
of food but Milarepa told them he had none to share. They did not believe him,  
so they searched the area and not finding any began to ill treat him. Three of  
them picked him up several times and dropped him causing him great pain but in  
his misery he only pitied them and shed tears thinking of the evil karma they  
were creating for themselves. The fourth hunter entreated the others to stop  
ill-treating him and leave him alone as he did indeed seem to be a real lama  
for showing such forbearance over his ill treatment. Before leaving, the  
fourth man requested Milarepa to remember him in his prayers since the man had  
done nothing to offend him, and then the group of them left, laughing  
boisterously. Later Milarepa learned that Divine retribution had overtaken  
them as they were arrested by the Governor of the province. The leader was  
killed and all but the fourth man, who had restrained the others from harming  
Milarepa, had their eyes put out.

## Dzogchen sky gazing meditation  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 15, 2010, 02:17:30 PM

Dzogchen sky gazing meditation: basic steps   
\- Look outward at the sky  observe it and inquire about it.   
\- Recognize it is vast beyond concept.   
\- As mind observes the sky, look inward at mind  observe and inquire about  
it.   
\- Realize it is vast beyond concept.   
\- With the understanding that both mind and universe are inconceivably  
boundless entities,   
allow their space to begin to merge. Be one with the experience.   
\- Rest in this natural, pristine awareness.

Looking at the space or sky, helps one to understand the formless Being.  
Looking at   
the earth, helps one to understand the formful Being. But whatever the means,   
the bird in the sky has no rest excepting at the ground.   
Arunachala Siva.

The Upanishad speaks of two birds, one representing jivatman and the other  
Paramatman: Two birds were sitting on the branch of a tree. One of them was busy eating  
the fruits - bitter fruits of life. The other bird was calm, eating nothing.  
Both of them were friends and looked alike. Both of them clasped the branch of  
the tree. Yet their nature was different. One of them, the jivatman was busy  
tasting the bitter and sometimes the sweet fruits of life. The Paramatman, the  
other bird, sitting higher is calm in its resplendent glorious Self. Swamiji  
says, gradually the busy bird started hopping towards the calm, serene,  
majestic bird. And one day it had disappeared into the other. That is, the  
jivatman gradually became nearer and nearer the Paramatman. They become one.   
This is brahmajnana about which Vedanta tells us again and again through  
various imageries. We must not forget that the jivatman is essentially the  
same as paramatman.   
\- _Swami Vivekananda_

Dear I,   
Bhagawan has said that the Self is th seat of the Ego/I/Thought/Mind. He has  
said that it is the centre of the Universe. It is neither here nor not here.  
Neither left nor right. Neither up nor down. It is everywhere and nowhere.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear soham3,   
For practisers, the Self is on the right side of the chest, two digits   
to the right of the midpoint. Many have asked whether it is Anahata.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "No. However, this could be as per   
kundalini yoga." Bhagavan Ramana also accepts the principle of   
dwadasantam, the space, twelve digits above the crown as the seat   
of final experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Far eastern thoughts place it at the intersection between the line from back-  
head to forehead & another line connecting tops of the 2 ears.   
I am from Far East, but have never heard of this.

Brahmandra is the concept of Raja yoga marga. Once when a devotee was  
sleeping   
in the Hall, and his head hung up, Bhagavan Ramana pointed out this to Nayana  
and   
said: See if Brahman is on the skull, how can it fall, when the body sleeps?   
Arunachala Siva.
