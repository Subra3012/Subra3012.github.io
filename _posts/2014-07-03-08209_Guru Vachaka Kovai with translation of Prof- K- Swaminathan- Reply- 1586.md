Verse 769 of Guru Vachaka Kovai of Muruganar: Firm, perfect, flawless, bright   
Abidance in the Self alone   
Snaps all bondage to the non self.   
Viveka, which sorts out the false   
From the Truth which is one's being,   
Aids freedom from desire.   
(Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
