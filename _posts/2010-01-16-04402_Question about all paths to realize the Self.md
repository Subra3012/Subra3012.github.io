## Question about all paths to realize the Self  
Author: m0j0                Date: January 16, 2010, 02:56:59 PM

I was wondering, only 'I' exists and everything is a creation of the  
mind...Why does my mind create a path to follow/reach its own annihilation?  
Why 'I-ego' is presented with these teachings, which are thoughts/mind, like a  
suicidal manual, and try to kill itself. But now I realize questioning all  
this is like getting into a labyrinth with no exit. I will stay quite.   
I am sorry if this question is somewhat very basic, I am what would be called  
a newbie?   
Thank you

Dear m0j0,   
The mind does not come about all of a sudden. "It comes from the previous  
birth, when mind carries prana and goes out to take up a new birth as per  
God's allotment. Mind is called Jiva and Sukshuma Sarira." (Who am I?).   
The mind in a newly born child, carries only the Vasanas of the   
previous births. It does not add any new thoughts. All new thoughts come  
about as and when the child grows. Look at a new   
born child. Its eyes are not even steady. It does not have a pointed look.  
It is the mother who teaches the child. The mother says: Who am I? I am your mother. Who are you? You are Hari... Like   
this, the new additions take place into the child. Then the mother   
asks "Who are you? You are Hari." Then a doll is shown. What is this? It  
is a doll. Whose doll is it? It is Hari's doll. Then some golden bangles are  
placed in its hands. Whose bangle are these? It is Hari's bangle. Thus the  
information is added to bring about thoughts, new thoughts...ad infinitum, ad  
nauseum.   
As the child grows, he starts seeing people. "Some are like me. Some are  
different." The different ones are called girls. He, as he grows to 13 to 14  
years, gets attracted to the girls. Then the sexual impulses start. Then  
eagerness to seek union with the opposite   
sex. Masturbation. Pre marital sexual attempts. Then marriage. Then a job.  
Then children. Thoughts about wife, children, job, promotion, constructing a  
house, buying a TV, fridge, washing machine, sudden fear of pink slips....  
Thoughts grow and multiply into a million thoughts.....   
Now, the thoughts are the villain of the piece. Mind is the villain of the  
piece. Thoughtless state, mindless state gives peace. This is evident from  
our sleep everyday. Thoughtless state is a peaceful state. But the sleep does  
not do away with the mind once for all.   
Next morning the mind, the "I" starts more vigorously. So, at least for some,  
innate in understanding the Self, which is covered by the thoughts, mind,  
there is an effort to bring about thoughtless state.... This is the  
"seeking". Thoughtless state is revealing the Self within. Once you get past  
thoughtless state, permanently, one abides in the Self.   
Thus, the whole processs, comes about starting from the vasanas of previous  
births. Once a person kills the thoughts and then the vasanas, he is  
liberated.   
It is not "a suicide manual." On the other hand, it is a manual for breaking  
the shackles of mind. Breaking the golden handcuffs that bind your hands from  
reaching the Self or God. Here, the Guru comes and tells about how to break  
the golden handcuffs. He does not break the handcuffs for you. He just shows  
the way, as to how to break the golden handcuffs. You have to break it with  
your own efforts and perseverence. Once you succeed in the process, you are  
the Self, you are the God. God and You are one without a second.   
Man is said to get fulfillment in a variety of ways. But all these ways are  
not permanent fulfillment; they do not prevent new births. They are all not  
full-proof methods to get the fulfillment which is real and complete. Sexual  
union, (Read Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita), murder (Read the Rebel by Albert  
Camus), suicide/alienation (Read The Arrangment by Elia Kazan). abducting  
someone and possessing (Read The Collector by John Fowls) the object. This is  
the mystery of Jiva (individual soul which is nothing but mind and prana).   
The solution lies in breaking the mind-body barrier that is between the  
individual soul and the Godhead.   
The river's source is Ocean. From the ocean's rain clouds, water pours down  
and rivers are formed. This river wants to seek the Source back. The river  
flows through thousands of kilometres and eventually merges in the ocean,  
which is the Source. It is not river's suicide. It is river's liberation to  
lose its identity and become one with the Source, the ocean. (Sri Arunachala  
Ashtakam, Verse.   
Arunachala Siva.

Now I hear someone telling that mind gives thoughts and thoughts   
give happiness, (forget about sorrows it gives, we shall talk only   
about happiness) and so, why should we try to kill the thoughts that   
gives happiness?   
Yes. This happiness comes from outside, and this is due to your   
thoughts. "But Bhagavan says that all thoughts from the objective   
world is only sorrow." How come?   
Let us analyse. My wife suffers from h1N1 virus. For 10 days   
she suffers. The doctors are non-plussed. By some miracle,   
she gets well. Fine, I am extremely happy about it. But supposing,   
her health continues to be good and she lives for 120 years and   
my health is good and I live for 125 years, still not kicking the bucket, are  
our lives happy? We become old, incapable of even daily routine like taking a  
bath, always remaining in bed, no appetite,   
no proper sleep, limbs weary and not able to perform. Is it happiness? Is  
the happiness, that I had derived when she had   
escaped H1N1 virus attack, a few decades back, permanent? NO.   
Adoor Gopalakrishnan says that his happiness lies in listening good   
music and watching Kathakali performance. Suppose I place him   
in a theatre, with all comforts, and make him to watch Kathakali   
non-stop for 365 days, or make him listen to music non stop for   
365 days, will he still be happy? Will not this happiness become   
a boredom soon and then transforms itself into a sorrow for him.   
Will he not like to run away from the theater? So all   
happiness from the world is temporary.   
It is "santosham" in Bhagavan's words. But Atma gives you "Sukam", bliss,  
which is permanent. There is no boredom. No eagerness to get away or switch  
over to something else.   
Bhagavan Ramana says that even when one attains the thing that   
he wants or when a thing that he hates undergoes suffering, the mind returns  
to Atma to enjoy the Sukam. This is impermanent. Mind resting with Atma  
alone is Sukam, permanently. When you get   
a promotion in the office, you are happy for a couple of days. Friends give  
you a party etc., Even if your compoetitor does not get promotion in the  
office, (the second example of Bhagavan) you   
get happiness. Both are impermanent.   
True happiness lies within. This is not mere happiness, this is   
Bliss. This is possible when the thoughts become quiscent or when   
the mind curls up into the Self. Then the world disappears. Only   
Atma remains. Atma is Existence Knowledge and Bliss.   
Vedanta philosphy says that happiness is the very core of our being.   
Though we also seem to derive happiness from external objects or   
experience, even after the object or experience is gained, we continue to  
search for further happiness. (This shows it is impermanent.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
the thoughts are the villain of the piece. Mind is the villain of the piece   
Suppose I know how to open locks without a key.   
This knowledge does not make me a theif. The knowledge is simple and dead. no  
life of its own.   
I become a theif when i use that knowledge to steal someone's property.   
The thought of an icecream or cake does not make me obese. but if i am not  
able to handle that thought, i become automatically involved in it and dump  
cups and cups of icecreams into my stomach, then its a problem.   
Thoughts are not the villan. Thoughts are just simple suggestions.   
If i do not know how to drive a car. .. should I blame the traffic?   
I should know how to drive the car.   
I should know how to handle thoughts.   
For that matter. .. our thoughts are uniquely ours. Nothing can change them.  
They are ours. all the time. Its my responsibility to learn to use my thoughts  
and not get used by them.   
I cannot kill the thoughts. Thoughts cannot be eliminated. the only way to do  
it is hit on the head with a nice log of wood! Its simply not possible. The  
whole brain is like a neural network... the moment there is an input, the  
network functions. there is no control. .. no one can control. That goes on.

Dear I,   
Jeevaatma has to merge with/into Paramaatma.   
Now what this "merging" actually is, is a debatable topic for the  
Jeevatma/Saadhaka. The only instruction Bhagawan has given is to enquire "Who  
am I to whom these thoughts are arising to"; "who am I"   
The rest what has to happen will happen, and let it happen, just stick to  
these teachings is our only duty or should be our only desire, why worry about  
what actually is "merging" is. Let it be what ever it is. Let us stick to our  
enquiry.   
Bhagawan has said "The ordainer controls the fate of souls according to their  
destiny, what ever is destined to happen will happen, do what you many to  
prevent it and whatever is destined not to happen will not happen, try as you  
may to prevent it. The best course, therefore, is to remain Silent."

Bhagavan answers the Question No. 15 to Sivaparakasam Pillai,   
in Who am I?, as under:-   
15\. How long should enquiry be practised?   
Bhagavan: As long as there are impressions of objects in the   
mind, so long the enquiry "Who am I?" is required. As thoughts   
arise they should be DESTROYED then and there, in the very   
place of their origin, through enquiry. If one resorts to contemplation of  
the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained,   
that one would do. As long as there are enemies within the fortress,   
they will continue to sally forth; if they are DESTROYED as they   
emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.   
Again for Question No. 13, Bhagavan Ramana says: 13\. The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear unending like the  
waves of an ocean. When will all of them get DESTROYED?   
Bhagavan: As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher,   
the thoughts will get DESTROYED.   
Now, there was no need for Bhagavan Ramana to use the word,   
"destroyed" \-- if the thoughts are mere suggestions not not   
villains who need to be destroyed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
He said Thoughts will get "DESTROYED". .. not "DESTROY THE THOUGHTS".   
Thoughts have to get destroyed as they arise.   
We "Continue" them. .. and build emotions, feelings etc around them.   
So this building up of a "thought structure", "thought form" is what Self  
Inquiry is supposed to end... not the thoughts.   
Coz thoughts come and of themselves they end. One cannot do anything about  
either their coming or ending. one only needs to stop "continuing them".   
Its like the buddhist story of two monks. .. they were going when they see a  
young girl finding it difficult to cross the river. the young monk lifts her  
and takes her to the other side and leaves her. She thanks him and leaves. At  
the monastry the older monk asks "We are monks. how can u carry a girl ?"   
and the reply is "I left her at the bank. .. are you still carrying her in  
your head?"   
The problem is with this continuation. If you observe carefully, Self inquiry  
only stops continuation. When a thought arises; & when the memory "who am i  
who has this thought" occured, the original thought is already gone. What is  
then this inquiry for ? It is there only to end the continuation.   
Thought need not be destroyed. it gets destroyed of itself. Infact its so  
short spanned that we cannot "Catch" it to kill it! It is mithya.   
Love!

Dear I,   
When Jeevaatma ceases, Paramaatma is. There are not two Selves in reality! But  
the Paramaatma would never have a need to say that it itself is Paramaatma,  
who is 'I' that says it is Paramaatma?"   
A visitor asked Bhagavan, What is the difference between the mind and the  
Self?   
Bhagavan: There is no difference. The mind turned inwards is the Self; turned  
outwards, it becomes the ego and all the world. The cotton made into various  
clothes, we call by various names. The gold made into various ornaments, we  
call by various names. But all the clothes are cotton and all the ornaments  
gold. The one is real, the many are mere names and forms. But the mind does  
not exist apart from the Self, i.e., it has no independent existence. The Self  
exists without the mind, never the mind without the Self.   
Kaivalya Navaneeta has asked and answered six questions about maya. They are  
instructive.   
The first question is: What is maya? And the answer is: It is anirvachaniya or  
indescribable.   
The second question is: To whom does it come? And the answer is: To the mind  
or ego who feels that he is a separate entity, who thinks: I do this or  
this is mine.   
The third question is: Where does it come from and how did it originate? And  
the answer is: Nobody can say.   
The fourth question is: How did it arise? And the answer is: Through non-  
vichara, through failure to ask: who am I?   
The fifth question is: If the Self and maya both exist does not this  
invalidate the theory of Advaita? The answer is: It need not, since maya is  
dependent on the Self as the picture is on the screen. The picture is not real  
in the sense that the screen is real.   
The sixth question is: If the Self and maya are one, could it not be argued  
that the Self is of the nature of maya, that is illusory? And the answer is: No; the Self can be capable of producing illusion without being illusory. A  
conjuror may create for our entertainment the illusion of people, animals and  
things, and we see all of them as clearly as we see him; but after the  
performance he alone remains and all the visions he had created have  
disappeared. He is not a part of the illusion but is real and solid.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Quote  
When Jeevaatma ceases, Paramaatma is   
Jeevaatma is already mithya.   
Paramathma Always IS!   
What ever "says", be it "I am Paramatma" or "I am not Paramatma" is mithya.   
Isha Jeevayor veshadi bidhah, sva svabhavatah vastu kevalam   
Between God and Jiva, the appearance is only the difference.   
In Essence there is only one.   
Notice he does not say "Jiva becomes Ishvara or Jiva ends and Ishvara comes  
and so on... Ishvara always IS and Jiva Never IS"   
Similarly Sankara also says   
Brahma satyam, jagan mithya   
jivo brahmaiva na parah   
[jiva is brahman]. Meaning there is only one.   
The appearance of change is mithya. not True. It need not be killed or  
created.   
both attempts to kill an object of mithya or enjoy the object of mithya are  
equally meaningless!   
Love!

Dear Nagaraj,   
Do you recognize that its mind which is creating this complex story that the  
mind has to be killed or destroyed ?   
Its prolonging it. .. just prolonging it ! Thats mind in action. Something has  
to be done. .. the body has to be tortured or the mind killed!   
It does not like it if questioned " when it is not alive, why and how to  
kill?" ! its just an illusion. like burrying a shadow.

Mind is not to be killed, it has to cease. there is no killing or destroying.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Quote  
Mind is not to be killed, it has to cease. there is no killing or destroying.   
Exactly. .. why cease it when its not moving at all ?   
that movement is mithya. non-existent!   
Its like saying   
"make the sky white!" or "The blueness has to cease" ! what is not there  
cannot cease !   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
How do you say -   
Quote  
 Exactly. .. why cease it when its not moving at all ? that movement is  
mithya. non-existent!   
Its like saying "make the sky white!" or "The blueness has to cease" ! what  
is not there cannot cease !  
is it not moving here? by giving out these thoughts? If it is not moving, how  
can you say it is non existent?   
Who are you? 'I' ?

Dear I,   
I am just putting focus on...   
Who is the one whom the sky is appearing, be it blue or white,   
Who is the one who is questioning   
Quote  
Therefore I should make the sky white!   
let me try!   
what happens??
