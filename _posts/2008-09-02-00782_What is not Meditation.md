Dear Friends,   
Meditation is not alter the state of mind. Hypnotism does it well.   
Meditation is to see the one who is meditating to see the Self. To see  
things as they are.   
1) Most people try to meditate to find a preconceived result. That is a total  
mistake.   
2) Japa is seen as a way to meditate Japa is really a statement of fact  
which is seen deeply in meditation... one has to first totally understand its  
meaning and purpose. For example OM namah sivaya is to see that na - mah, i am  
not, only Siva is.   
3) Meditation is not to keep the thought on a particular spot. Coz this holds  
the mind still for a few moments, but wont solve the problem... essential  
thinking that i am the body is untouched.   
4) Meditation is not breathing exercises a few breathing exercises can  
help calm the mind so that we can see things as they are... more than that  
breathing exercises have nothign to do with meditation.   
Ashtavakra says in Ashtavakra samhita: this alone is ur bondage that u try to  
make your mind still... please understand, one has to know oneself and not  
still the mind or put his body in a particular posture.   
Meditation is merely to see the Self Knowledge and allow the mind to  
understand it completely.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, Adding to whatever you have said, Meditation   
is not 'aniya bhava', it is 'ananiya bhava' that is to have   
a bhavana or conviction, that you are not different from the Self.   
This is the advice of Bhagavan Ramana in Upadesa Saram.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
 Deliberate meditation is a movement of thought.Spontaneous meditation is a movement of unadulterated consciousness.   
 Movement of thought in any form is not meditation.Contentless mind is always in a state of spontneous meditation.

Dear sir   
Guru''s grace is also very necessary for self realaisation. Is not it? I read  
in sri Ramana's books that His divine look made   
many people spellbound and made them in deep medition. Sometimes I feel  
physical form of guru is necessary for those who   
have not ripined, Your comments are highly appreciated

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 As long as we have strong identity with the body we require a guru with a body.He will existentially show you that your   
essential nature is not this psychosomatic organism.

Dear Ramanaduli, Adding to what has been said by Raju,   
the Guru is both the Self and the Grace. The grace is   
inseparable from Guru's nature, which is the Self. Guru   
initiates the disciple under three types. Thorugh, look,   
sakshu diksha, through his 'thought', mano diksha and   
through touch, sparsa diksha. This is explained in Arunachala   
Aksharamanamalai,   
Nokkiye karudhi mey thakkiye.......   
These methods are compared to the look of fish towards its   
eggs, to the thought of tortoise towards its eggs and the   
touch of the hen towards its eggs.   
I am for one who believes that there is no need for a Guru to   
be in living form. Guru is beyond the body and hence he need   
not be alive, to grace his devotees. David Godman came to   
Bhagavan only in 1976 and he is Self realized and is giving new   
insights into Bhagavan's teachings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 I want to add one more diksha i.e mouna diksha which is most potent of all dikshas.This is Bhagawan's favorite diksha.   
If subramanian allows me i want to coin a new word for this diksha i.e  
"Aparoksha Diksha" because this is direct transmission of energy   
from heart to heart without any intermediary like eye,skin,thought.Rest of the  
dikshas are paroksha so they are indirect.We get what   
we deserve.

Dear Friends,   
Someone can keep on being in silence, but not recognize that he is the  
Silence! Please see this. When someone keeps physical silence, he has to  
recognize that he is the Stillness, the Presence, Awareness, The being, The  
Self if he does not recognize he might keep silence for long time, but  
nothing happens, he continues to be as stupid as he was before the silence.   
so silence is an aid to clearly recognize oneself. But attachment to silence  
is one more hurdle someone can add.   
Same way. .. Guru's grace is always there. .. Ramana did not say: My grace is  
there for my mother and not for u people. .. if he said that then, he would  
not be ramana. The one who "seeks" Ramana's grace, gets it. So someone should  
seek Ramana's grace. I hope i am making it clear. One should have faith that  
he is the guru. .. and Read his scriptures and take them as guidance... then  
The Grace automatically follows. When someone does not seek, the grace is  
there, but he fails to take it!   
Love!

Dear Rajuji and Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the explaination.. So long I have been worrying not to have His  
darshan in physically I understood Guru and His grace is not different from  
your mail. Both are same..Now as you mentioned here, it is His grace which I  
got through His books. From the book I started learning slowly. It is His  
grace only showed me this site where I am geting answers for my doubts. He  
knows that in future many souls would be wandering without any guide therefore  
He called seekers to His feet to ask question and He answered to help people  
like me. As Raju ji told it depends on us how much we derserve.   
He explained the meaning of all vedas and upanishad by simple teaching.i.e. we  
have to go to the source.He made me to read Bharaneedharan's book from where I  
came to know Maharishi in 1980.It looks so easy but rather difficult to go to  
the source.

Dear Ramanaduli, Baraneedharan's Arunachala Mahimai, two volumes   
(?) is a good starting point. So also Suddhananda Bharati's Sri   
Ramana Vijayam, Tamil, which was published much earlier.   
These are the guidelines for Ramana Way. Ra. Ganapati has also   
written about Bhagavan Ramana. Sri Sadhu Om's books give   
an absolutely breathtaking new insights for Bhagavan. His   
Tamil book, Ramana Vazhi (4 volumes) is a little tough to understand,   
but on reading twice or thrice, one can understand Bhagavan's   
teachings. The third part of Ramana Vazhi is poems. You may   
keep it at the end.   
Arunachala Siva.

(?) is a good starting point. So also Suddhananda Bharati's Sri   
Ramana Vijayam, Tamil, which was published much earlier.   
These are the guidelines for Ramana Way. Ra. Ganapati has also   
written about Bhagavan Ramana. Sri Sadhu Om's books give   
an absolutely breathtaking new insights for Bhagavan. His   
Tamil book, Ramana Vazhi (4 volumes) is a little tough to understand,   
but on reading twice or thrice, one can understand Bhagavan's   
teachings. The third part of Ramana Vazhi is poems. You may   
keep it at the end.
