WHAT IS REAL FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.   
As a spiritual seeker when we get rid of this bodily consciousness is the  
freedom.   
The day we reach it and remainn is the independence.   
Am I right. This is my imagination.   
siva siva arunachalasiva.

Dear Kannan05, There is no freedom no bondage, no   
independence, no dependence, if one could shed   
all thoughts that bind people.   
Arunachala Siva.
