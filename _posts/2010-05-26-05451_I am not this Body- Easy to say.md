 **The body is a machine, like a motor car is a machine. I am within this body  
as the driver is within the motor car.   
Now the motor car has many needs. It needs gas, it needs oil, it needs to have  
its tires pumped up and so on. But if one forgets the driver in the car and  
simply concentrates on the machine and the needs of the machine the driver  
will not be satisfied.   
He will be sitting in the car starving. Because the food of the driver is  
different from the food of the car. You can not feed the driver gas. His food  
is different.**   
So we are the driver of this body. This body has so many needs, but these  
bodily needs are different from our needs, we are the driver of the body, the  
soul within the body, the ghost in the machine    
 **So our idea is to satisfy the bodily needs only as much as necessary to  
maintain the body in a healthy condition and spend the rest of our time and  
energy in spiritual activities which help us to reawaken our original  
spiritual consciousness, these are our real needs, the needs of the soul.**   
It is not that we do not eat, or sleep, or have sex or defend, but these  
things are done in a regulated way to maintain the body in a healthy  
condition. But as the motor car is simply a vehicle which is meant to  
transport the driver to his destination, we see this material body as a  
vehicle which can be used to transport the driverthe soulto his ultimate  
destination: back home, back to Godhead.   
If we spend all our time trying to satisfy the senses of our body we will  
waste all our time and energy in this way and become completely distracted  
from the real purpose of life which is to get out of this material world and  
get back home to the spiritual world where we will get an eternally youthful  
spiritual body full of knowledge and full of pleasure Then we will really be  
happy   
Chant Hare Krishna and be happy!

Bhagavan Ramana who is telling on many, many occasions, "I am not the Body,"  
has also stressed the need for maintaining the body in good care with moderate  
quantities of sattvic food. He has said   
in ULLadu Narpadu, 'how can one see the world without a body?'.   
So body and its maintenance is essential for any path, be it devotion   
or atma vichara. However, Bhagavan Ramana's practice after the   
self realization - on can observe - is quite different. He stayed in   
Patala Lingam for 27 days without food and with many insects   
biting and sucking the blood. Again in Virupaksha Cave, He stayed   
with one lunch alone around 11 am for 1 full year. One cannot do   
all these, because we are not Bhagavan. For seekers, He always   
advised to eat moderate quantities of sattvic food.   
I saw one ISKCON programme in TV some months back. For some   
festival, perhaps Sri Krishna Janmashtami, they were placing   
about 100 varieties of sweets and savouries, each of them in   
large quantities, to Krishna and Balarama, as offering. This was   
somewhat ludicrous. Even if they are feeding the poor, which poor man would  
like sweets and savouries? In Karnataka, a poor man   
would be satisfied more, with cooked rice or ragi balls, with some vegetables  
and buttermilk.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
that's excellent information about bhagavan ramana.   
27 days without food in patala lingam is amazing.   
Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami in all his pravachanams. ... etc always praise  
guru ramana maharshi atleast once.   
http://www.sundarachaitanyam.org/   
I used to feel so happy when someone praises our guru and my faith and  
devotion still increases.   
He is a follower of advaita vedanta + devotee of lord Sri krishna.   
Coming to ISCON though some criticism is there on their organisation and their  
activities on the whole i feel they are doing good to humanity.   
Atleast i know many of my friends who used to have many bad habits like  
drinking,smoking..... stopped everything and had a superb transformation when  
they joined ISCON.   
They also run many mid day rice schemes in various schools and does many other  
good actitivites.

Dear prasanth,   
I agree with what you say about ISKCON. They are doing other   
good work too. But to place 100 varieties of sweets and savouries   
for naivedya at 12 midnight when Krishna was born, appeared to me   
a little far fetched and pompous. Keeping Advaita and Krishna as   
the only Prime Principle is okay. What we are interested is in advaita and  
not in the Prime Principle. In fact Swami Vallabhacharya took to advaita but  
kept Krishna as the Prime Principle, His Principle is called Krishnadvaitam.  
Swami Tapsyanananda of SRK Math makes a mention about him in his   
Bhakti Schools of Vedanta.   
But ISKCON is not following advaita. They say that Krishna is supreme and all  
other gods are subservient to Him. If one says Krishna and many other gods,  
then it becomes dualistic. That is   
all my point.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
Having Advaita in Bhava is very much necessary.   
Yes prime principal can be any god's name and we should not really worry of  
name conflicts so long as he/she follows Advaita Vedanta.   
Ramana Maharshi - Advaita \+ Siva + (Jnana + Bhakthi)   
Vallabhacharya \- Advaita + krishna   
RamaKrishna - Bhakthi + Mother Devi   
Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami - Advaita + krishna   
[ He always used to say in english OK. when some one asked meaning of OK he  
said only krishna. ]   
ISCON i feel is mainly targeted for westerners and i have heard many drug  
addicts got superb transformation after joining ISCON.   
So compared to Seva Activities + Spiritual Transformation they have given to  
many aspirants sweets issue which you are mentioning is ok sir :-)   
I feel sometimes ISCON can help as the first step for few sincere aspirants  
and latter by the power and grace of guru ramana they automatically get  
attracted to our master.   
Infact this happened in my case :-)   
But i agree that they are little harsh to other philosphies like  
Advaita,Vishitadvaita and other gods... and i came to know this when i read  
sometime in year 2008 few books of Sri Srila Prabhapada Garu.   
Anyhow why should we worry about other school of thoughts/philosphies/leaders  
sir?   
There are N number of school of thoughts and list will be endless.When i and  
my wife are listening to Dakshina Murthy Sthotram pravachanam by Sri Sundara  
Chaitanya Swami garu in telugu we came to know there is yet another school of  
thought named "carvaka"   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvaka   
So,Let us all stick to our master teachings and continue our faith and  
devotion to him.

Dear prasanth,   
I agree with you. But Bhagavan Ramana has said that one should   
not keep Advaita as a sadhana and dvaita in practice. Dvaita   
is only with Guru till you become one with guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

This i agree with you Subramanian Garu.   
Advaita bhava should never be shown to guru.
