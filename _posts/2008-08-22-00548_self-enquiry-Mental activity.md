With self-enquiry we shall know the living Truth.An attempt to reach the Truth  
through thought(mental activity) is the very denial of Truth.   
All thoughts are welcome.

Dear Raju, Self enquiry is the thought. It is the one thought,   
that annihilates all the other thoughts. Again, Who am I?   
(1902)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
You tell us When you read from Bhagavan "Find out Who you are", the eyes  
read it, it entered into the mind and became a thought, has it not ?   
So, What you got from ramana is just a thought, isnt it ?   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai'   
 When we go through Bhagawan's literature thoughts definitely arise and they ar helpful also but they are nothing to do with self-enquiry.   
Self-enquiry is not something we do but something where we do not exist as  
ego.It is Bhagawan's presence which existentially helps us to do   
self-enquiry.Self-enquiry is nonobjective so it is a state in which awareness  
attends to itself.If thought enters doing starts but self-enquiry is a   
state of nondoing in which awareness transforms us by annihilating our  
identity with the body and mind."Who am i "thought helps us to withdraw   
our attention from the nonself and that when concentrated attention i diverted  
to find it's source it culminates in the collapse of thought process   
into it's source.This is what happened in Bhagawans death experience in which  
he used "who am i"thought with concentrated attention   
and enquired into what is death and who is dying and finally culminated in  
collapse thought process including"who am i"thought resulting   
in the experience awareness which is called self-realisation.This self-  
attentiveness leads to uninterrupted experience of clear self-consciousness.   
If we attend to thoughts during self-enquiry there is only object knowing  
consciousness which is not proper tool to do self-enquiry.   
To do self-enquiry we have to have nonobjective consciousness which is  
possible only when we are free of thoughts and when we posit   
our attention in the source of the mind.

Dear Raju, Self enquiry, is a thought, I repeat, Self enquiry   
is a thought. Do not be carried away be words of deluge.   
The Non Objective awareness is realized, only through the   
thought of self enquiry. Bhagavan warns us against reading   
books endlessly, but we are doing all the same. The reading   
to a necessary extent is good. That is why, He said 'endlessly'.   
Viveka Choodamani also warns us that we should abhor three   
vasanas, the loka vasana, the dheha vasana and finally the   
sastra vasana to realize the Self. Again Who am I? " The   
Self is within five sheaths, how can we find it in books which   
are outside?" Books are necessay, to some extent, to know the Self   
and that is all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 I wrote that books are not useful for self-enquiry and you are stamping me as suffering from sastra vasana and deluge of words.   
If you feel that my posts does not convey the essence of Bhagawan's message i  
offer that i will stop postings further because forum members   
may be affected because of my wrong understanding.

Dear Raju, I am sorry, I do not mean that. What I meant,   
was, that you always go by the purport of the teachings and   
not by the word-play that you may find in books. That way,   
Bhagavan's books are always direct, without word play. For   
example, in Who am I?, you cannot add or remove a single word!   
Even in Panchadasi, about which I am writing, there are a lots   
of word play, some of them written for poetry and some of them   
to show their erudition. We have to look into the purport and   
that is what I meant by "let us not be washed away be the deluge   
of words." You may continue to write since you are sending   
useful messages. We should only leave such things as,   
Spiritual and Human, etc., etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel, Yes. Books that lead you to the Self are necessary   
and cannot be dispensed with till Self is realized. In fact, I am   
reading Who am I? everyday as a prayer and also to turn me   
inwards. This book is ravishingly original, direct like an arrow   
on the target, simple, and no word can be removed or added to   
it! Bhagavan said it in 1902 when He was just 21. He said   
this to Sivprakasam Pillai, who came to take Bhagavan's advice   
for a wedding! How fortunate, He must have been to get such   
a pearl from Bhagavan! That is why, He is called Bhagavan the Self.   
and we are jivas, the female principle, going round and round   
Bhagavan, like Gopis were going round and round of Krishna.   
One day, the merger of the female principle with the Only Male,   
the Purusha, will take place. And if we have got His grace or if   
we become the fit vessels, to fill up the Grace, then salvation is   
ensured in this birth. Otherwise, we have to go through 8.40   
million vaginas, as scriptures say and Akka Mahadevi, sang in   
her "Speaking of Siva".   
Dear Raju, All you still upset? If so, once again sorry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 You are like a father who cares for the forum members.You are so loving towards me you have written"Raju,you are correct" for100times.   
Bhagawan gave me strength to withstand any situation.All these are trivia in  
life.An elderly and learned person like you should not say sorry to your sons.   
But i am trying by best to elaborate on practical aspect of self-enquiry and  
almost all my postings so far are dedicated to self-enquiry.Because   
this forum is dedicated to teachings of Bhagawan mainly i am trying my best to  
create interest in members through questions and answers   
about self-enquiry.I do not demand anybody to stick to my point of view but i  
expect them to go through what i have written for their own   
benefit.They are free to differ with me but it must be rational.They should  
not forget the essence of question or the answer while responding.   
As far as possible it better if they respond from their own experience instead  
of quoting from the books.

Dear Raju,   
 I agree, self enquiry is different and has to go beyond thought but ! Thoughts are helpful, coz without it u could not have got to the point that "self enquiry is required "

Dear Raju and non duel, You posts are very meaningful and   
helpful to everyone. Sometimes we may speak out 'experience'   
but most of the times, we only quote Bhagavan or advaitic   
scriptures, since that is the treasure, from which we can take   
the ideas, examples, advices etc., I was an hour back going   
through an old 1945 edition of Maharshi's Gospel, in Tamil,   
brought from my sister-in-law's house. The old Sanskritised   
Tamil of Bhagavan and his advices to the seekers are quite   
enthralling. He is mentioning about, mind, mindless state, thought,   
thoughtless state, the Self in a very nice language. It is His   
own tongue, and even a faithful translation in English cannot   
bring out the beauty. It is like seeing Mona Lisa's original   
painting and then a computer copy! Leonardo Da vinci, in his   
original. I shall try to give an English translation of that   
beauitful book, which is neither Tamil nor English, but only   
Indish or Tamilish.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Yes. Self enquiry is one thought, through which one

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
I donot think no one can enter the gates of thoughtless state, the Self even  
great sages like ramana are no exception.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
Sri Tyagaraja swami says in one of his songs,   
 _kalpana lenni kalavaadee maa raamudu   
sankalpam leni vaade maa raamudu._   
Which means So there is nothing wrong in having thoughts but it is important  
not to have sankalpas.   
Mind having good thoughts are fine but only ignorance thoughts are only to get  
vanished.   
If we want to know nature of pot there is no need to break the pot.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says there is no need to stop waves to understand  
about ocean.   
Waves are not independent of ocean but are only part of ocean.   
As there is no need to stop the waves similarly there is no need to kill the  
mind to know our nature i.e sat-chit-ananda.   
Problem is though we are satyam(truth) i.e ocean in the above example we think  
we are mithya(waves) and start thinking of all the problems of waves as we  
compare ourselves with waves and then we start trying to solve our problems  
related to waves.   
Here waves relate to mind and our nature is ocean on which  
everything(mind,indriyas..) is dependent.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is not know that we are not the mind and it mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.   
 **It is very important to know that Mind is Mithya but not truth.**
