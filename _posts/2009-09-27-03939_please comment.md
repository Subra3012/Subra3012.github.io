## The Bigger Story  
Author: silentgreen         Date: October 01, 2009, 07:11:56 AM

**The Bigger Story**   
Many of us try to find out ways to joy in life.   
Human beings have pursued the search for joy since a very long time and this  
search is continuing even today.   
However the Upanishads have already given an answer to this.   
The way shown is to explore the "bigger story" which is beyond our personal  
life stories.   
Individual life stories contain events related to that individual.   
The bigger story is the story about how the individual consciousness came into  
existence.   
It starts from as far back as the origin of creation itself.   
Now the question may arise: "What is the benefit of knowing the bigger story?"   
"How can the bigger story take away or even mitigate the sorrows of our  
personal lives?"   
"How can it generate joy?"   
The benefit of knowing the bigger story is that the root cause of sorrow is  
itself traced back to the ignorance of our "bigger" consciousness.   
The personal sorrows of our lives are mainly due to lack of some material  
things or relationship miseries like ego-hurt etc.   
It is found that adding material things to our lives does not give the lasting  
joy which we crave for.   
The lasting joy itself comes from our bigger consciousness which we are  
ignorant of.   
Also the bigger story makes the ego "melt" or be perceived as part of the  
bigger consciousness.   
So when the ego itself melts, individual sorrows also seem to melt.   
Then what about the joys which the individual egos bring about, however small  
it is?   
It is found that the individual egos do not have any joy of their own but  
brings the joy from the bigger consciousness.   
The bigger consciousness is like the ocean. The ocean gives rise to various  
waves which in turn has smaller waves and still smaller waves.   
The joy of the ego is like the joy of a tiny wavelet while the joy of the  
bigger consciousness can be as great as the ocean.   
Knowing the bigger story the tiny wavelet understands its true origin, its  
bigger existence.   
The ego existence of tiny wavelets interacting with other tiny wavelets makes  
up the personal story of individuals.   
It has its own joys and sorrows of its own interactions, its tiny ups and  
downs.   
The bigger story redefines the existence of the tiny wavelet from the starting  
point of the ocean.   
The tiny wavelet becomes aware that its tossing up and down was due to the  
waves of joy from the bigger ocean and it gets "released" into the ocean.   
The bigger story is common for all the tiny wavelets, and it does not involve  
any personal incidents of the tiny wavelets.   
So is it not a wonder that just by listening to a bigger story which does not  
directly address any of our life events, our miseries can be mitigated and joy  
generated in life?   
The Upanishads contain the bigger stories coming from the ocean.   
They are often told in terms of imageries which relate to bigger things.   
So they need to be understood intuitively rather than literally.   
Literal understanding is often confined to the mind, from which level our  
individual life story starts.   
Intuitive understanding starts from the Heart of which the mind-level is only  
a part.   
So just by reading the Upanishads with Self enquiry can awaken our interest in  
the bigger consciousness.   
May the Universal Being guide us appropriately.

## English translation of Tirukkuval in "The Path of Sri Ramana  
Author: Chuck Cliff         Date: September 27, 2009, 10:13:02 AM  
---  
Reading "The Path of Sri Ramana", I noticed the quotes from Tirukkuval --  
looking for more information and perhaps a complete text, I noted that the  
translations given in "The Path" are more concise and, hopefully, more  
precise than the translations I have found searching on the internet.   
The question is: were the citations in "The Path" translated for the English  
version or taken from another source?   
Being - Aware - Love

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I looked into Tamil original books of Sri Sadhu Om. These are   
in 4 volumes unlike the English version. As regards the English   
version, I do not have the second volume.   
Regarding Tirukuval, which literally means the Holy Cuckooing,   
the nice sounds produced by koel (Cuckoo). The imagery is   
that the /lady-love, devotee sends the Cuckoo as the messenger to the Lover or  
Guru. Saint Manikkavachagar has also used this imagery, in Tiruvachakam, Koel  
Pathu, Decad on Cuckoo.   
Now coming to the poem proper, I find in Tamil originals there   
is no Tirukuval but there is one titled Kuyilodu Kooral, which means   
Telling the Cuckoo, that is messaging through Koel, Cuckoo.   
This poem has got 10 verses and this finds place in 3rd volume   
in Tamil, which is full of Sri Sadhu Om's poems, not rendered in   
full in English so far.   
The first verse roughly translates as under: "O Young Cuckoo, for my sake, go to the Master and tell him: "I am withering with exreme desire for his Grace. O blemishless effulgence  
of Grace, O my eye, Sri Ramanesa, the rich medicine   
of Hill, please come" O Cuckoo, won't you cuckoo this to my   
Master?"   
If you could give me one sample translation from the English book, I shall be  
able to tell you further It could be the same poem.   
Sri Sadhu Om is a versatile Tamil poet, next only to Muruganar. His third  
volume in Tamil which is full of poems is simply untranslatable. We should  
request David Godman and Michael James and Robert Butler to help us!   
Arunachala Siva. .

Dear Subrimaniam, I seem again to have wasted your time -- actually, it  
struck me while I was in the kitchen that I had not been sufficiently precise,  
but before I got back to the laptop you had already posted your lengthy reply  
On top of everything else, I mis-spelled the title of the work, Tirukku **r**  
al (my only plea is that my eyes are old)   
An example (I assume it is Michael James' translation)   
 The right way of punishing the wrong-doer is to   
do good to him and to forget his wrong.   
Tirukkural, verse 314   
But still, thanks for the extra information.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. One letter can make a lot of difference. It does not matter.   
As for Tirukural, it is one of the oldest works in Tamil, written   
sometime in 3rd Century AD, by the saint poet Tiruvalluvar.   
It consists of 1300 couplets divided into 133 chapters of ten   
couplets each. It is a work of ethics, nothing is said about God   
or liberation in detail. No doubt it starts with 10 couplets on   
Godhead but here again it is giving interpretations to presume   
it is Siva, or Narayana etc., etc., This work is praised by all   
Tamil scholars for its ethical value, regardless of whether they   
believe in God or not. Muruganar and Sri Sadhu Om have mastered   
it. Bhagavan Ramana used to quote some couplets occasionally.   
A number of English translations are available, the oldest being   
that of G.U.Pope, written in 1900 and he was a Jesuit Father working in  
Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu for missionary work. He has   
also translated Tiruvachakam and he used to keep a copy of   
Tiruvachakam along with Bible in his bedside!   
Arunachala Siva.

Understanding it in a simple way, the meaning appears to be simple.   
 _If you don 't bring forth what is inside you, what you don't bring forth  
will destroy you._   
If you don't bring forth the divine nature inside you, (which requires effort  
of introversion / devotion / self enquiry), what you don't bring forth, which  
is the outward tendencies of the mind towards the lower plane (which  
effortlessly seem to take control of our lives), will destroy you.   
The warning is of the same nature which Adi Shankaracharya has given long ago: The man who, having by some means obtained a human birth, with a male body and  
mastery of the Vedas to boot, is foolish enough not to exert himself for self-  
liberation, verily commits suicide, for he kills himself by clinging to things  
unreal.   
A great message from a great teacher.   
Victory to Jesus Christ.   
(This is my understanding and there can be other interpretations also)

Dear amiatall,   
What silentgreen has written is fine. "The substance within"   
is Atma or God or Christ or Arunachala. If this is not realized,   
the mind which is also with Atma, will come out and do its   
million mischieves. The mind should be made quiescent and this   
is possible only if you bring forth the Light within. The Light,   
which is the Light of the Sun is there, the little lamp called   
Mind, even if it is there, will look pale and is practically not there.   
Arunachala Siva.

The quote comes from the "Gospel of Thomas", the 70th saying --I googled to  
make sure of that and ran across a sermon from 2003 given in a Vermont  
Congregational Church where the point was that this saying is true on a  
practical, daily life level (which I would expect, since if it is true on a  
spiritual level, in someways at least it should be true on a "wordly" level.   
"...a person needs to master [six tasks] in order to age well. The first is to  
know yourselfto discover your true identity apart from who your parents and  
society suggest you should be. The last task is to come to see the truth of  
life beyond yourself, and to come to peace with the way the universe works,  
including the course of your own life and death."

The inside thing which will destroy you is not/can not be Self or God ;  
because it is not the nature of   
Self or God to be destructive. There are vices like lust, anger, greed and  
strong desires called vasanas   
which are inside and clouding the Self.These things must be expelled from your  
inside by meditation and prayer.   
Eradication of vasanas, which is essential for spiritual progress is  
underscored in this statement of Jesus.
