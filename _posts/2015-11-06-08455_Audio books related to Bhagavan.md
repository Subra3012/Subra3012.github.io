## Bhagavan and the Goddess  
Author: Mattisyahoo         Date: November 06, 2015, 08:31:13 AM

Hello,   
I am currently writing a research paper about the relationship between Goddess  
and Bhagavan. I am interested in searching for any references, anecdotes,  
stories, ect., detailing Sri Ramana's take on Goddess worship and the divine  
femininel, or any other interesting topic of a related stream. If anyone also  
has any personal opinions on this matter, I would be also interested to hear  
those. Thank you for your time in advance.   
In Bhagavan,   
Matthew

Thank you for the reminder, my friend.   
My request has more to do with _biographical_ elements rather than the true  
meaning of his teachings. The Mother's temple was the nucleus around which the  
ashram arose and Navratri puja and celebration are conducted there. It has a  
very impressive Sri Yantra (the most important Tantric symbol) sculpture  
inside and Bhagavan supervised its creation. There is also a beautiful hand  
drawn color yantra floating around the internet that is supposedly drawn by  
Bhagavan (this image is very difficult to reproduce precisely), which I am  
still looking for confirmation. Bhagavan recommended Tantra scriptures like  
Tripura Rahasya, which personify the absolute as Goddess.   
Here is the drawing by Bhagavan I mentioned: https://s-media-cache-  
ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c3/35/1c/c3351ca1160b6668e48dfebcccf7e462.jpg   
These details suggest a strong Goddess element in Ramana's life, but I say  
that full well knowing the India has never abandoned its love for the Goddess  
the way the West sadly has done.   
I realize that gender is really not a relevant detail to achieve realization  
but my academic work at this point seeks to understand Ramana's life story  
through a Goddess worship lens simply for the reason of personal interest.

Dear Matthew,   
Here is an excerpt from one beautiful article from Mountain Path journal,about  
Great devotee of Bhagavan,Sri Ganapati Muni. It speaks about Divine  
Mother,Shakti,in very beautiful way.   
_When the composition of Intdrani Saptasati was going on in the Mango-tree  
cave, in Skandashrama, the mother of Bhagavan Maharshi shed her human body.  
The Maharshi was a svatah siddba - a spontaneously selfrealised soul from the  
beginning and he had to make no effort for any liberation. To live on  
normally, a man among men in the world,after liberation, jivan mukti, was the  
meaning and message of his life. He wanted to impart liberation even to a  
person unprepared for such a liberation. The Maharshi tried to liberate the  
soul of his attendant Palaniswami before he passed away. But Palaniswami could  
not co-operate in the endeavour. But in the case of his mother, the Maharshi  
had a sense of fulfilment. With his active assistance, the soul of his mother  
found its liberation. The individual consciousness became universalised. When  
the question of the disposal of the body of the departed one came up, it was  
Vasishtha Muni who decided the issue. He cited verses from Sri Ramana Gita to  
show that women had an equal right to sanyasa as men. Even in the case of an  
ordinary ochrerobed sanyasi, people bury the dead body and do not cremate it.  
Here the mother of the Maharshi had the good fortune of being actively  
assisted in her last journey by the Maharshi himself and she shed her mortal  
frame as a perfectly liberated being. Therefore it would be improper to  
cremate her, argued Vasishtha Muni, and saw to it that a Samadhi was erected  
over her mortal remains. At the foot of the hill, in the South east corner, a  
spot was chosen for the Samadhi. It was scorching summer and there was  
absolutely no sign of water in the vicinity. But when the Maharshi pointed out  
a place and the people dug, lo ! water gushed forth in a stream and that  
became the sacred tirtha for the Samadhi. To commemorate the event, the  
foremost disciple of the Maharshi, the great Vasishtha Ganapati Muni sang a  
few verses saying,   
" It was the vear Dundubbi, the sixth day   
of the month Taurus, the ninth day of the   
dark fortnight in the spring and a Friday.   
In the first quarter of that night when the   
sky was spangled with a hundred stars,   
Saundaryamba became the Effulgence.   
Hailing from the clan of Bharadwaja, she   
was wedded to Sundara who was born in   
the family of Parasaras. Spotless in character,   
she was the mother of Ramana Maharshi,   
an amsa of the God Guru Guha.   
Washing her sins by her devotion to the feet   
of Siva, abandoning her mental attachments,   
her Prana controlled by the force in the   
hand of Guha (Ramana), she cast away all   
distractions at that very moment and   
became liberated.   
" Saundaryamba became the Effulgence,   
proclaimed by the Vedas and Upanishads,   
the Effulgence that has pervaded all the   
worlds, the Effulgence that manifested   
through the gaze of the son, Guha   
(Ramana).   
" Here is the new Tirtha, remover of all   
blemish, at the Samadhi of Mother   
Saundaryamba, like the stream of pollen   
from the two lotus hands of Ramana   
Maharshi.   
" May the holy mother of the Maharshi   
shine forth ! May her Samadhi shine forth !   
May the Lingam installed on it by the   
Maharshi shine forth ! May the new Tirtha   
shine forth as the remover of all imperfection! "   
About six months after, in December 1922 Maharshi came and settled down at his  
Mother's samadhi and Sri Ramanasramam came into being. For the son of Sakti  
that was Maharshi, the constant vivifying presence of Sakti was needed to give  
a sense of fulfilment to his mission and this was supplied by his mother in  
her Samadhi. The Supreme became the mother, Matrubhuteswara.   
The importance of the concept of the Mother in the Maharshi's teachings is  
brought out clearly in the following letter of June 9, 1931 written by  
Vasishtha Muni to the Maharshi from Anandashrama, Sirsi : " Lord at play as man,   
From here, pray, accept our salutations on   
these days of Mahapuja of the Mother.   
Kausalya gave birth to Rama, the protector   
of the sages, Devaki to Sri Krishna the   
teacher of the yoga (attunement) ; Renuka   
gave birth to the Teacher Parasurama, a   
life-long celibate and Mayadevi produced   
Buddha, the sage of the Sakyas who gave   
refuge to all beings. Mother Mary gave birth   
to the Son of God who bears the burden of   
sin of all devotees. Likewise, for the welfare   
of the world, for removal of the darkness   
of ignorance, for the casting away of   
all ill-conceived notions, for the realisation   
of the Truth, thy mother gave birth to thee,   
endowed with all these excellent qualities.   
To her, to Saundaryamba, the beloved wife   
of Sundara, our salutations. Salutations to   
her Samadhi and to the Lord Matrubhuteswara,   
installed on it. Salutations to her   
worshippers and salutations to the devotees of Ramana."   
The Kundalini Sakti in Vasishtha Muni became awake ; it sped through the  
spinal channel to the top of the head, broke the skull and mingled with the  
universal Sakti. The mother of the Maharshi, liberated, became the Sakti and  
provided the Pitha for the Maharshi and his teachings. The yoga of both which  
began as the search for the essential unity in diversity found its fulfilment  
in seeing the unity manifested as diversity...

**_It is only because of the movement of   
Sakti that the worlds come into being, but   
the Reality on which the movement is based   
never moves.   
The seeming difference between Santi and   
Sakti arises from (dualistic) vision. If the   
vision is withdrawn into the Source, the   
two become One.   
Though the Supreme moves because of   
his own Suoreme Sakti, he is in reality   
unmoving. Only the Sage can understand   
this profound mystery.   
Without Sakti, Being (Swarupa) is not   
apprehended. Sakti has two names, Vyapara   
(activity) and Asraya (Ground).   
Creation, sustenance and dissolution of   
the universe is vyapara ? activity. The   
Ground is nothing other than Being   
(Swarupa).   
Because Being is itself everything, it   
depends on nothing else. He who understands   
Sakti as both activity and ground   
he alone knows.   
That sole, Supreme Reality is by some   
called Sakti, by others Being (Swarupa),   
by others Brahman and by still others Person (Purusha).   
Being (Swaritpa) is said to' be the ground   
and Activity its attribute. By understanding   
through activity the source of activity, one   
gets firmly established in the Ground.   
Being goes with attributes. And attributes   
go with Being. The relation between the two   
is one of identity.   
Activity is not other than Being (Swarupa)   
if you see indeed. All this knowledge of   
difference is but imaginary."

**_All merciful, all-powerful, omnipresent   
\- these are attributes of the Divine Mother.   
 She is the sum total of the energy in the Universe.   
Every manifestation of power in the universe is Mother.   
She is Life, She is Intelligence, She is Love.   
She is in the universe, yet separate from it.   
She is a person, and can be seen and known   
 \- as Sri Ramakrishna saw and knew Her.   
Established in the idea of Mother, we can do anything.   
She quickly answers prayers.   
She can show Herself to us in any form at any moment.   
The Divine Mother can have form (rupa) and name (nama),   
or name without form;   
and as we worship Her in these various aspects,   
we can rise to Pure Being, having neither form nor name.   
The sea calm is the Absolute;   
the same sea in waves is the Divine Mother.   
She is time, space and causation.   
Mother is the same as Brahman and has two natures;   
the conditioned and the unconditioned.   
As the former, She is God, nature and soul.   
As the latter, she is unknown and unknowable.   
Out of the Unconditioned came the trinity,   
God, nature and soul - the triangle of existence.   
A bit of Mother, a drop, was Krishna;   
 another was Buddha; another was Christ.   
The worship of even one spark of Mother in our earthly mother   
 leads to greatness. Worship Her if you want love and wisdom.
