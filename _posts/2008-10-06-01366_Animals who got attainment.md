We think human beings are having sixth sense and in this form we can easily  
get attaintment. After going through the forgetfulness page, I recollect the  
animals who lived during Bhagavan's time. which did not have sixth sense. With  
the touch of Bhavan the monkey, peacock, sparrow, squirrel and cow and more  
all they realised their forgetfullness and remembered their goal. So fortunate  
beings all got merged with their soul. Before Bhagavan's time there are many  
stories goes. In kalahasti, the spider and sanke got mukti. In Madurai Lord  
siva gave to stone elephant. And nobody can forget Gajendra Moksham. How this  
forgetfulness happened to mankind so deeply. Bahavan's kind words gives me  
strength   
without thinking like I am a great sinner, go to the source.... so soothing  
words

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Instead of lamenting how self forgetfulness happened to us better we do "who am i"enquiry and claim our "self".Life is very short,we   
should not deviate from the main purpose of life.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In Arunachala Sthala Mahtmaym, there is a story of a dry thorn   
bush, cactus, getting liberation, after Siva treaded on it! The   
spider and the elephant getting mukti is nararated in the Sthala   
Purana of Tiru Anaikka, a Siva temple, about 4 kms from   
Tiruchirappali.   
Arunachala Siva.
