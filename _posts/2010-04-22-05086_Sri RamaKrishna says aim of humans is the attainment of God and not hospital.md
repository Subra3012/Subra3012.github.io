## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says First acquire right discrimination and true dispassion

Would you keep a large water-jar and savory pickles in the same room in which  
a patient with typhoid fever was lying? If you wish to cure such a patient,  
you must have him removed from that room, in case it is impossible to send  
away the jar and the pickles.   
A man of the world is like unto such a thirsty patient;worldly attractions are  
like the jar of water; sense objects are like the savory pickles; desire to  
enjoy those things is the patient's thirst. The mouth waters at the mere  
thought of the pickles.   
We should not therefore remain near them all the time. **Hence solitude is the  
best remedy for worldliness.**   
**First acquire right discrimination and true dispassion and then live in the  
world. In the sea of the world there are crocodiles of passions and desires.  
Rub the body with turmeric-paste if you wish to bathe in the sea, for then  
crocodiles will do no harm to you. The turmeric is discrimination (of the Real  
from the unreal) and true dispassion. God is the only Reality, the phenomenal  
universe is unreal.** Along with this another thing is needed, that is intense  
devotion to God. [p. 163]

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Some Incidents In The Life Of Sri Ramakrishna (As Told By Himself)  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 22, 2010, 09:28:01 AM

**Days of struggle**   
 **I practised austerities for a long time. I cared very little for the body.  
My longing for the Divine Mother was so great that I would not eat or sleep. I  
would lie on the bare ground, placing my head on a lump of earth, and cry out  
loudly: "Mother, Mother, why dost Thou not come to me?" I did not know how the  
days and nights passed away.** I used to have ecstasy all the time. I saw my  
disciples as my own people, like children and relations, long before they came  
to me. I used to cry before my Mother, saying: "O Mother! I am dying for my  
beloved ones (Bhaktas); do Thou bring them to me as quickly as possible." [p.  
208]   
**All desires fulfilled**   
 _At that time whatever I desired came to pass. Once I desired to build a  
small hut in the Panchavati for meditation and to put a fence around  
it.Immediately after I saw a huge bundle of bamboo sticks, rope, strings and  
even a knife, all brought by the tide in front of the Panchavati. A servant of  
the Temple, seeing these things, ran to me with great delight and told me of  
them. There was the exact quantity of material necessary for the hut and the  
fence._   
When they were built, nothing remained over. Everyone was amazed to see this  
wonderful sight. When I reached the state of continuous ecstasy, I gave up all  
external forms of worship; I could no longer perform them. Then I prayed to my  
Divine Mother: "Mother, who will now take care of me? I have no power to take  
care of myself. I like to hear Thy name and feed Thy Bhaktas and help the  
poor. Who will make it possible for me to do these things? Send me someone who  
will be able to do these for me." As the answer to this prayer came Mathura  
Babu, [*+] who served me so long and with such intense devotion and faith!  
Again at another time I said to the Mother: "I shall have no child of my own,  
but I wish to have as my child a pitre Bhakta, who will stay with me all the  
time. Send me such an one." Then came Rakhal (Brahmananda). Those who are my  
own are parts of my very Self. [p. 209]   
 **Distaste for Worldly conversation**   
 **Nothing but discourses on God appealed to me at this period. If I heard  
worldly conversation, I would sit in a corner and weep bitterly.** When I went  
with Mathura Babu to Benares, I was sitting with him in the drawing-room when  
some friends came in to see him and began to discuss worldly affairs. "So much  
we have gained, so much we have lost." Hearing this I was in tears and cried  
aloud: "Mother, why hast Thou brought me here? I was much better off in the  
Temple.   
I have come to the Holy City to hear only of lust and gold; but there in the  
Temple I did not have to listen to such conversation." I was at this time like  
a young boy and so Mathura Babu fulfilled all the desires that arose in my  
mind. My heart and soul, however, were constantly longing to hear about the  
Supreme Being. [p. 216]   
 **Longing to hear about the Supreme**   
I searched for the places where the Holy Scriptures were expounded. There was  
a Brahmin in the neighborhood who was a great pandit and who had true faith. I  
used to go to hear him very often. A saint lived near by on the bank of the  
Ganges and I wished to go with this Brahmin to see him; but a priest who  
looked upon the world as a dream discouraged me by saying: "The body of a  
saint is an earthly cage; what good can one obtain by visiting such a cage?" I  
spoke of this to the Brahmin and he replied: "He who thinks of God, he who  
repeats His Holy Name and has renounced everything for the sake of the Lord,  
must not be regarded as an earthly cage. The priest does not know that the  
form of a devotee is a spiritual form full of Divine intelligence." **This  
Brahmin once asked me why I had thrown away my Brahminical thread. I replied: "When the storm of Divine ecstasy overtook my heart and soul, it blew away all  
signs of caste and creed.  
**Absolute frankness**   
 **During this period I was absolutely outspoken. I observed no formality or  
etiquette; I was fearless. Once I met a rich Zemindar and asked him: "What is  
our highest duty? Is not the attainment of God our highest duty?" He replied: "We are men of the world; salvation is not for us. When even Yudhisthira, the  
purest and most perfect of mortals, had to see purgatory in a vision because  
he had once wavered for half a second from absolute Truth, what can we expect  
for ourselves?" I could not bear his words and rebuked him sharply, saying: "What kind of man are you that you think of the momentary vision of purgatory?   
You must not think of that, but of Yudhisthira's truthfulness, forgiveness,  
patience, right discrimination, renunciation, devotion and love for God."  
At another time I went to see a Zemindar who had the title of Raja, and I told  
him plainly that I could not call him Raja because he was not really one. One  
day I saw a pious Brahmin who was counting his beads on the bank of the  
Ganges. I stood near him and knew that his mind was not fixed on God but on  
earthly things. Immediately I roused him by striking him on the shoulder. At  
another time Rashmoni, the founder of the Temple, was praying in the Temple  
while I was singing the holy song of the Divine Mother. I perceived that her  
mind was on worldly objects and instantly I roused her in the same manner. In  
amazement she folded her hands and remained motionless before me. vii [p. 218  
& 219]

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says All men look alike, but they differ in their nature

**All men look alike, but they differ in their nature. In some the Sattwa  
quality is predominant,in others Rajas, and in the rest Tamas.**   
Pooli (cakes) all look alike on the outside, but the contents vary; some may  
contain sweet thickened cream, others cocoanut sweetened with sugar, while  
others may have boiled Kalai (pulse) with no sweetening.   
 **Source** : THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA   
More Over in Bhagavad Gita it is written   
 **Ch3 Text33**   
Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows  
his nature. What can repression accomplish?

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says aim of humans is the attainment of God and not hospitals...  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 22, 2010, 09:30:29 AM

Ramakrishna: In this age (Kali-Yuga) the path of devotion and love (Bhakti-  
Yoga) is easy for all. The practice of Narada's Bhakti is better adapted to  
this Yuga. One should repeat the Holy Name of the Lord and chant His praises  
and with earnest and sincere heart, pray to Him, saying: "O Lord, grant me Thy  
divine Wisdom, Thy divine Love. Do Thou open my eyes and make me realize  
Thee."   
_When Karma Yoga is so difficult to practice, one should pray to the Lord in  
this manner: "O Lord! Do Thou reduce our Karma to a minimum, and the little  
work that we daily perform, may we do it with non-attachment by Thy grace. O  
Lord! Do not let our desire for work increase in number and bind us to  
worldliness." [Is work the aim of life?]_   
 **Devotee: People of the West (in England and America) always say, "Work,  
work, work." Is not work (Karma) then the end and aim of life?   
Ramakrishna: The end and aim of life is the attainment of God. Work (Karma) is  
nothing but the first chapter of life; how can it be its end and aim? But  
work,without seeking the result, is a means, not the end. No one, however, can  
avoid work (Karma).**   
Every mental action is a Karma. "I am thinking," "I meditate," "I feel," each  
of these is a Karma. The more one attains to true devotion the less becomes  
one's worldly work. The pleasures of the world do not satisfy such a soul.  
They lose their charm. How can one who has tasted the Sherbet made with pure  
crystallized sugar be pleased with the taste of a drink made with molasses or  
treacle?   
**On one occasion a Karma Yogi (Sambhu) said to me: "May Thy blessing be that  
my wealth be spent in building hospitals and dispensaries, in making roads, in  
sinking wells for travelers, in establishing schools, colleges, and in other  
good works." Whereupon I replied: "Sambhu, all these works are good when they  
are performed with non-attachment. But that is very difficult. In any case you  
should always keep in mind that the end and aim of your human existence is the  
attainment of God and not hospitals and dispensaries. [p. 241]**

Bhakti ends up in total surrender, saranagati, where there is only   
God and there is no 'you'.   
Karma cannot be avoided if there is destiny for you, towards that,   
but one can do nishkamya-karma, karma without seeking any fruits.   
All these are culminating in Atma Jnana Bodham.   
Arunachala Siva.
