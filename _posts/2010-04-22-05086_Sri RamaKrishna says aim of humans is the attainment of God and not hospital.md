Ramakrishna: In this age (Kali-Yuga) the path of devotion and love (Bhakti-  
Yoga) is easy for all. The practice of Narada's Bhakti is better adapted to  
this Yuga. One should repeat the Holy Name of the Lord and chant His praises  
and with earnest and sincere heart, pray to Him, saying: "O Lord, grant me Thy  
divine Wisdom, Thy divine Love. Do Thou open my eyes and make me realize  
Thee."   
_When Karma Yoga is so difficult to practice, one should pray to the Lord in  
this manner: "O Lord! Do Thou reduce our Karma to a minimum, and the little  
work that we daily perform, may we do it with non-attachment by Thy grace. O  
Lord! Do not let our desire for work increase in number and bind us to  
worldliness." [Is work the aim of life?]_   
 **Devotee: People of the West (in England and America) always say, "Work,  
work, work." Is not work (Karma) then the end and aim of life?   
Ramakrishna: The end and aim of life is the attainment of God. Work (Karma) is  
nothing but the first chapter of life; how can it be its end and aim? But  
work,without seeking the result, is a means, not the end. No one, however, can  
avoid work (Karma).**   
Every mental action is a Karma. "I am thinking," "I meditate," "I feel," each  
of these is a Karma. The more one attains to true devotion the less becomes  
one's worldly work. The pleasures of the world do not satisfy such a soul.  
They lose their charm. How can one who has tasted the Sherbet made with pure  
crystallized sugar be pleased with the taste of a drink made with molasses or  
treacle?   
**On one occasion a Karma Yogi (Sambhu) said to me: "May Thy blessing be that  
my wealth be spent in building hospitals and dispensaries, in making roads, in  
sinking wells for travelers, in establishing schools, colleges, and in other  
good works." Whereupon I replied: "Sambhu, all these works are good when they  
are performed with non-attachment. But that is very difficult. In any case you  
should always keep in mind that the end and aim of your human existence is the  
attainment of God and not hospitals and dispensaries. [p. 241]**

Bhakti ends up in total surrender, saranagati, where there is only   
God and there is no 'you'.   
Karma cannot be avoided if there is destiny for you, towards that,   
but one can do nishkamya-karma, karma without seeking any fruits.   
All these are culminating in Atma Jnana Bodham.   
Arunachala Siva.
