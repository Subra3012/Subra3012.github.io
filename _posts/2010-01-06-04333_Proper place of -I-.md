The proper place of "I" is the lotus feet of God.   
In all other places it will dance to its own tune.   
In the lotus feet of God it will dance to the divine tune.   
Hari Om.

Dear I,   
What you have said is exactly what Sri Vaishnavites call "Prapatti". Complete  
surrender, Sharanagati, being aware of the I's limitedness. Humbleness is  
effortless. a Sense of giving up.   
Krishna Says in Gita - 18 Chapter, 66 verse: Sarva Dharman Parityajya Maaekam Sharanam Vraja   
Sham Tvaaam Sarva Paapebhyo Mokshayisyaami Ma Sukah   
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver  
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
