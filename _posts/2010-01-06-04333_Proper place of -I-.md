## Tiruppavai - 22  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 06, 2010, 09:32:21 AM

The 22nd song of Tiruppavai, is sung on this day, the 22nd day   
of Margazhi (Dhanur month). This again is a simple narrative song,   
perhaps with a discreet reference to Duryodana and Arjuna going   
to Krishna while the latter was lying on the bed, for support for   
their war at Gurukshetra.   
We are all coming to you Krishna, leaving all our ego, like the   
great kings who came to you leaving all their self respect, and   
stood beside your bed. Will you not, please direct towards us your lotus like  
eyes full of grace and it will be like sun and moon rising   
together. If you could show your gaze once towards us, all our   
sins will vanish and we shall merge at your lotus feet!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 21  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 05, 2010, 01:20:59 PM

Today, the 21st day of Margazhi, Dhanur month, the 21st song   
of Tiruppavai by AndaL is sung.   
This is a simple direct song, speaking about the cows in Gokulam,   
the locality of cowherds.   
O son of Nandagopa, in whose sheds the cows give out milk in   
abundance, to fill the vessels and overflow. Please wake up.   
O the valorous, the Lord of our clan, full of brilliance, please wake   
up. Like your enemies come to your house falling on the ground   
(after accepting their defeat), we too are falling at your feet, singing   
Long Live Krishna, Long Live Krishna!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 23  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 07, 2010, 11:10:36 AM

The 23rd song of Tiruppavai, is sung today, the 23rd day of Dhanur,   
Margazhi, month. This is again a simple narrative song, continuing   
the them of waking up Narayana for the early morning bathing.   
The lion in the rainy season, comes out from its sleep, from out   
of the mountain-cave. It makes a roar and looks at the surroundings   
with its fire emitting eyes. O Narayana, the god with hue of blue   
lily, you too come out from your bed and ask us for what purpose,   
we have come to your doorstep, and then bless us.   
The Sri Vaishnava scholars say that the imagery to the lion is indicative of  
Narasimha avatara. Since AndaL has been referring   
to Vamana Avatara, Sri Ramaavatara and Sri Krishnavatara in the next song,  
they say that this song is a discreet reference to Narasimha Avatara.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Proper place of "I"  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 06, 2010, 02:37:59 PM

The proper place of "I" is the lotus feet of God.   
In all other places it will dance to its own tune.   
In the lotus feet of God it will dance to the divine tune.   
Hari Om.

Dear I,   
What you have said is exactly what Sri Vaishnavites call "Prapatti". Complete  
surrender, Sharanagati, being aware of the I's limitedness. Humbleness is  
effortless. a Sense of giving up.   
Krishna Says in Gita - 18 Chapter, 66 verse: Sarva Dharman Parityajya Maaekam Sharanam Vraja   
Sham Tvaaam Sarva Paapebhyo Mokshayisyaami Ma Sukah   
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver  
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
