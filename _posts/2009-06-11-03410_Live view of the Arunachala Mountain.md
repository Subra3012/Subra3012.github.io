Dear karthikeyan. M,   
I see our own Forum's web-photo which changes every   
30 seconds, many times during the day. At nights, Graham   
Boyd projects pictures upto 12 midnight on Full Moon Days   
if there are no cloulds. Other days, till sunset. Nowdays   
it is seen upto 6.36 PM.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
It is very easy. As you open the web, you click the words   
Arunachala Webcam, on the bottom line. Then, you will   
see Arunachala Hill, if you enlarge it. This picture will   
change every 30 seconds. Today, the last picture was   
at 5.22 PM. Because it is very cloudy in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Go to the Forum. You know the web address. You are   
writing posts. In that in the face page, there is Ramana's   
photograph and below that there are may files, like Arunachala   
Property, Arunachala Webcam etc., Go to Arunachala Webcam   
and click. The Hill will appear, see it for every one hour, you   
will see the picture changing with time mentioned on top left.   
Arunachala Siva.
