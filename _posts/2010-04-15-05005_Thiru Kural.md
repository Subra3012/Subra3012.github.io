**God:**   
1\. "A" is the first and source of all the letters.   
Even so is God Primordial the first and source of all the world.   
2\. What has learning profited a man, if it has not led him   
To worship the Good Feet of Him who is pure knowledge itself?   
3\. The Supreme dwells within the lotus of the heart. Those who reach   
His Splendid Feet dwell endearingly within unearthly realms.   
4\. Draw near the Feet of Him who is free of desire and aversion.   
And live forever free of suffering.   
5\. Good and bad, delusion's dual deeds, do not cannot cling   
Those who delight in praising the immutable, worshipful One.   
6\. A long and joyous life rewards those who remain firmly   
On the faultless path of Him who controls the five senses.   
7\. They alone dispel the mind's distress   
Who take refuge at the Feet of the Incomparable One.   
8\. They alone can cross life's other oceans who take refuge   
At the Feet of the Gracious One, Himself an ocean of virtue.   
9\. The head which cannot bow before the Feet of the Possessor   
Of eight infinite powers is like the senses lacking the power to perceive.   
10\. The boundless ocean of births can be crossed,   
But not without intimate union with Infinity's Holy Feet.   
 **Knowledge of Truth:**   
1\. The delusion which mistakes the unreal for the Real   
Is the genesis of woeful births.   
2\. For those of undimmed perception, free from delusion,   
Darkness departs and rapture rushes in.   
3\. To those who have dispelled all doubt and perceive Truth,   
Heaven is nearer than earth.   
4\. All knowledge acquired through the five senses is worthless   
To those without knowledge of truth.   
5\. In everything of every kind whatsoever,   
Wisdom perceives Truth in that thing.   
6\. Those who find Divine Truth in this world   
Follow a path which never comes back to this world.   
7\. Those who think with certitude and ponder well that which is,   
Need never think of being born again.   
8\. Banishing the folly of rebirth and thus beholding   
Perfections True Being - that is wisdom.   
9\. The ruinous griefs that he is yet to suffer will not cleave to him who,   
Renouncing other supports, realizes life's true Support.   
10\. Desire, detesting and delusion - the annihilation of these three names   
Is the annihilation of suffering endured.   
 **Charity:**   
1\. Giving to the poor is true charity.   
All other giving expects a recompense.   
2\. Though men may declare it a good path, gathering gifts is bad.   
Though they decree it denies one heaven, giving gifts is good.   
3\. Men of good birth graciously give,   
Never uttering the wretched excuse, "I have nothing."   
4\. How unpleasant a beggar's pleading can become,   
Until one sees his face, so sweetly pleased.   
5\. Great indeed is the power acquired through austerity to endure hunger.   
But greater still is the power of those who relieve the hunger of others.   
6\. Relieving the ravaging hunger of the poor   
Is the most secure use of a rich man's wealth.   
7\. The fiery scourge called hunger never touches   
The man who shares his daily meal with others.   
8\. Is it because they are unaware of the joys of giving   
That hard-hearted men waste their wealth by hoarding it?   
9\. More bitter than even a beggar's bread is the   
Meal of the miser who hoards wealth and eats alone.   
10\. There is nothing more bitter than death;   
Yet even death is sweet when charitable giving is impossible.   
 **Duty:**   
1\. The benevolent expect no return for their dutiful giving.   
How can the world ever repay the rain cloud?   
2\. It is to meet the needs of the deserving   
That the worthy labor arduously to acquire wealth.   
3\. Of all duties, benevolence is unequaled in this world,   
And even in celestial realms.   
4\. He who understands his duty to society truly lives.   
All others shall be counted among the dead.   
5\. The wealth of the world-loving wise man   
May be likened to a well-stocked village water tank.   
6\. Resemble a fruit tree ripening in the heart of a village.   
7\. In the hands of a benevolent man,   
Wealth is like a medicinal tree whose healing gifts help all.   
8\. Those who deeply know duty do not neglect giving,   
Even in their own unprosperous season.   
9\. The benevolent man considers himself poor only   
When he is unable to render his accustomed service to humanity.   
10\. Were it said that loss of wealth is the price of benevolence,   
Such loss is worth selling one's self to procure.   
 **Renunciation**   
1\. Whatsoever a man has renounced,   
From the sorrow born of that he has freed himself.   
2\. After a man has renounced, he enjoys the many true things in this   
World. Let men desiring that renounce in time.   
3\. The five senses must be subdued   
And every desire simultaneously surrendered.   
4\. The mendicant's poverty permits not a single possession,   
For possessions draws him back into delusion.   
5\. What are life's petty attachments to the man who seeks severance   
From future births, when even his body is a burden?   
6\. He who slays the conceit which clamors "I" and "mine"   
Will enter a realm above the celestials' world.   
7\. If one clings to his attachments, refusing to let go,   
Sorrows will not let go their grip on him.   
8\. Those who renounce totally reach the highest peak;   
The rest remain ensnared in delusions net.   
9\. Birth ceases when all attachments are severed;   
Otherwise, one beholds unceasingly the transitoriness of life.   
10\. Attach yourself to Him who is free from all attachments.   
Bind yourself to that bond in order that all other bonds may be broken.

**Truthfulness:**   
1\. What is truthfulness? It is the speaking of words   
Which are entirely free from harmful effects.   
2\. Even falsehood is of the nature of truth,   
If it gives good results free from fault.   
3\. Let a man not speak as truth what he knows to be false,   
For his conscience will scorch him when he has lied.   
4\. He who lives truly in his own heart,   
Truly lives in the hearts of all people.   
5\. Those who speak only truth from the heart   
Surpass even penitents and philanthropists.   
6\. All other virtues flow from it effortlessly.   
7\. Not lying, and merely not lying, is beneficial   
For those who can't practice and won't practice other virtues.   
8\. Water is sufficient to cleanse the body,   
But only truthfulness will purify the mind.   
9\. Not all lamps are effective lamps.   
The lamp of nonlying is the wise man's lamp.   
10\. Among all great truths which we have ever beheld,   
Not one can equal the goodness of veracity.   
 **Purity of Acti  
DateTime: 1\. Good friendships bring wealth to a man,   
But goodness of action fulfills his every desire.   
2\. Actions which bring fame but no real benefit   
Are to be avoided always.   
3\. Declaring that their future will be brighter,   
Men desist from deeds that darken glory's light.   
4\. However troubled the times, men of unperturbable perception   
Never commit shamful or sordid deeds.   
5\. Do nothing that would make you regret, "What have I done!"   
However, do not remain regretful if regretable deeds do occur.   
6\. Though he must behold his own mother's hunger,   
Let a man refrain from deeds that wise men condemn.   
7\. The worst poverty of worthy men is far better   
Than wealth amassed by improper means.   
8\. Even when accomplished, forbidden deeds afflict sorrow   
On those who seek after, rather than shun, them.   
9\. What is gained by tears will go by tears. In the end, goodness   
Reaps many good things, though it begins with loss.   
10\. Protecting the country by wrongly garnered wealth   
Is like preserving water in an unbaked pot of clay.   
 **Perseverance:**   
1\. Never say in weakness, "This task is too difficult,"   
For perseverance will give the ability to accomplish it.   
2\. Beware of leaving any work undone, for the world   
Will abandon those who abandon their work unfinished.   
3\. The pride of profuse giving dwells only   
With the dignity of diligent effort.   
4\. Like the swordsmanship of an effimate man,   
The philanthropy of those who avoid hard work will end in failure.   
5\. He who prefers work to pleasure supports his family   
Like a pillar, sweeping away their every sad sorrow.   
6\. Perseverance creates prosperity,   
And the lack of it produces poverty.   
7\. They say the black ogress called Misfortune lurks in laziness,   
While goddess Fortune lingers in the laboring toils of active men.   
8\. To be devoid of good fortune is no one's disgrace.   
But shame belongs to those destitute of knowledge and tenacity.   
9\. Though destiny decrees one's deeds will fail,   
The wages for determined work are always paid.   
10\. Those who strive with tireless exertion and remain undaunted   
Will see the backside of retreating Fate.

Dear silentgreen,   
I am happy to see your posting of translations of Tiru KuRal.   
In my young days, due to school curicullam and due to my   
father's insistence, I read Tiru kuRal. I know many verses in   
my memory even today. Tiruvalluvar, the author has not said   
anything about Moksham. He has covered only Dharma, Wealth   
by rightful means and Kama, love and marriage. The reason is   
if one could rightfully follow the guidance for these three requirements,   
one would attain liberation. Nevertheless, I do not agree with this   
theory. But Dharma, Artha and Kama are essential in life, no doubt.   
Again, Tiruvalluvar speaks about God, in a very tacit manner.   
From the first ten verses of his book, one can never guess, whether   
he was a Saivite,a Vaishnava or a Buddhist or a Jain. The verses   
are quite general but does not indicate any specific god.   
Purathooimai neeran amaiyum   
Ahathooimai vaymaial kana perum.   
The outward purity comes about through water, i.e bath.   
The inward purity comes about only through Truthfulness.   
One cannot say this in more brevity.   
Bhagavan Ramana said the same thing in His teachings.   
Thanks for the excellent translation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
I got the translation of the Thirukural from the internet. It is difficult to  
say who is the original translator. Might have been circulating for long.   
Thiruvalluvar's verses, I found, are mainly on morality, the foundation of  
life. He did not dive into any particular spiritual practice. It is as if they  
are the verses of life illustrating the sacredness of life...replete with the  
message, "Live Life considering it to be sacred."

Dear silentgreen,   
It is a good translation. No problem.   
There is a story about one verse of Tiru KuraL. It is a book, where   
even one word cannot be changed as in Bhgagavan's ULLadu Narpadu and other  
works.   
There was a Jesuit father in Madurai during British times and such   
missionary heads learned Tamil thoroughly to teach Tamilians in their own  
tongue. Some of these guys read Tamil works like Tiru KuraL and Tiruvachakam.   
One just Jesuit father read the KuraL, verse, saying: A person's worthiness or unworthiness is known   
By the things that had been left by him.*   
(*after death)   
The Jesuit father saw the word "Eccham" in the second line,   
meaning "the remaining things" The first line starts as   
Thakkar Thakavilar... meaning worthiness or unworthiness....   
The Jesuit monk thought that "Thakkar" should go with "MakkaL"   
in the second line for the purpose of alliteration. So he changed   
Eccham (which is not a good alliteration) to Makkal (means sons/   
daughters).   
He showed it to Sri Thyagarja Mudaliar, a famous Tamil scholar   
and an authority on Tiru KuraL and Tiruvachakam and asked about   
his 'changes' in Tiru KuraL.   
Thyagaraja Mudaliar saw it and hit his own head a few times! He   
said: How can you change like this? Why Tiruvalluvar did not   
put Makkal instead of Eccham? Do you know?   
A person's worthiness WILL NOT BE KNOWN BY HIS SONS.   
We have got many such instances in this world. Hiranyakashyap   
got Prahlada. Sunil Dutt got Sanjay Dutt! There are many such   
examples. So this word Makkal does not indicate the universal   
truth. But Eccham, the remains - tell you the real truth. Chozha   
Kings built 70 Siva Temples. Manikkavachagar left Tiruvachakam.   
Azhwars left 4000 Divine Songs. Bhagavan Ramana left ULLadu   
Narpadu. Sri Sankara left Viveka Choodamani. British left a   
partitioned India. Osama Bil Laden left burnt twin towers.   
So Eccham, "the remains" is a better word, and Tiruvalluvar knew   
it. He did not care merely for alliteration!   
Thyagaraja Mudaliar started crying, about the misfortune for   
Tamil and Tiruvalluvar. The Jesuit father went back quietly!   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramaniam Sir   
Any inputs you have regarding Bhagwan's opinion on Thirukural.   
Some say Bhagawan never recommended it as it did not talk about Moksa and has  
"Kamathu Paal" i.e on Love & Kama, other said Bhagwan did refer to certain  
selected portions from "Arathu Paal " only i.e related to Dharma.   
I found in one publication Bhagwan referring to Ayuvviar saying that  
Valluvar's 1330 verses were condensed by 1 verse of Ayuvviar.   
In an Old TV Show that came in DD in early 90s about U Ve Swaminatha Iyer,   
there is a conversation about U Ve Swaminatha Iyer and Bhagwan and Bhagwan  
quotes a verse from Thirukural regarding being detached i.e "Pattr attru" and  
U Ve Swamintahan says he can be free of any desire except the desire for Tamil  
and Bhagwan said that it is a valid desire and he can keep it.   
Can u share anything about Bhagawan and Thirukural?

Krishna(Atmavichar)   
Coming to Sri Bhagavan,I do know this incident in Sri Annamalai Swami's  
life(May not figure in Living by the Words of Bhagavan)that I have posted in  
David's Blog: "A few days back,a cousin of mine handed over a copy of a photograph of Sri  
Bhagavan that swami had made to order.In it Sri Bhagavan's bust is enlarged  
and towers over a photograph of Arunachala in the Foreground!The Technique  
involved is a little primitive but it served Swami's purpose.He had this  
Tirukkural in mind: நிலையில் திரியாது அடங்கியான் தோற்றம்   
மலையினும் மாணப் பெரிது.   
one who without wandering abides in Being   
His appearance is more majestic that the mountain.   
Swami got this photograph made somehow and approached Sri Bhagavan and  
requested him to write the Tirukkural right at the top of the photograph.   
Sri Bhagavan readily acquiesced.   
This photograph was with AnnAmalai Swami and a Good old friend of mine  
requested the Swami and took copies of this photograph.   
It is this copy that reached me unexpectedly,after nearly 20 Years!I had  
almost forgotten about it.   
It is spotted in a few places but still quite okay.I will try to see if any  
professional lab can restore/make copies of it."   
The Tirukkural cannot be condensed into one verse by avvaiyar or by anyone  
else.That is impossible,because the couplets are precisely like Sutras.They  
cover a vast ground.Our Master TG Narayanasamy took a series of Talks where he  
clearly brought out that Tirukkural alone would suffice for Sadhana.He has  
this to say: Tamil pundits are without philosophical, spiritual Background and  
Philosophers,Religious Leaders are without Knowledge of Tamil!Net result was  
that Tirukkural was left to the likes of Parimel azhagar,VVS Iyer who just  
wrote whatever they understood.   
Tiruvalluvar used very Precise 'Words' in Tamil and these words mean the same  
thing when they occur in different couplets.In this way,to understand a  
couplet,one needs to take only that shade of meaning that the word bears in  
the other couplet as well.   
Master TGN advises that Tiruvalluvar never classified his couplets into  
chapters.That was the handiwork of later generation pundits.Master advises  
that an earnest reader of TirukkuraL must break free from the Rigidity of  
Chapterization to arrive at the True Essence of each couplet.   
I have posted a few couplets here.Like the Following: This is what the Great sage TiruvaLLuvar says in TirukkuraL: "எல்லா விளக்கும் விளக்கல்ல சான்றோர்க்கு   
பொய்யா விளக்கே விளக்கு"   
ellA viLLakkum viLLakalla sAnRorkku   
poyyA viLakke viLakku.   
All Lights are not light;To the wise ones   
Infallible Light alone is Light!   
அடக்கம் அமரருள் உய்க்கும் அடங்காமை   
ஆரிருள் உய்த்துவிடும்.   
Adakkam amararul uykkum adangamai   
Arirul uythuvidum.   
Master TGN gives the key to the word-அமரருள்.It is அமர்+அருள்=amar+aruL  
=Abiding Grace.   
The Opposite of அருள் is இருள்.   
He gives the true import of the KuRaL: Reigning in of the mind raises one to abiding Grace(not to amarar=devar as  
other Tamil pandits glibly translate!)   
Lack of it plunges one into dense darkness(Ignorance).   
Many are the 'Key' given by Master whose insight into TirukkuraL was  
absolutely refreshing.   
The same word அருள் occurs in another couplet that I have posted in another  
thread: பொருள்ஆட்சி போற்றாதார்க்கு இல்லை அருள்ஆட்சி   
ஆங்குஇல்லை ஊன்தின் பவர்க்கு.   
Property does not stay with the Thriftless   
Grace does not abide with those who eat flesh.   
Bottom line:People who are under the false assumption that Tirukkural Teaches  
only Dharma, Artha and Kama only and not Moksha are  
mistaken.(Moha+Kshya=Destruction of Moha is Veedu.Veedu in Tamil refers to  
that State obtained by giving up all attachments-viduthal)   
Incidentally,I bought a book TirukkuraL DhyAnam by Swami Omkarananda  
recently.Wonder why Swamiji brought out that Book,since it neither has any  
insight nor any Tamil.I do not even consider it fit to be gifted to someone.I  
know that I am making a harsh comment here, yet this is what I sincerely Feel.   
Namaskar.

Here is another Couplet where TiruvaLLuvar refers to the Glory of one who is  
free from the Ego: தன் உயிர் தான் அறப் பெற்றானை ஏனைய   
மன் உயிர் எல்லாம் தொழும்   
He who has sundered the 'I';such a one   
is worshipped by all Life forms on Earth.   
Sri Bhagavan proves this couplet like a Tee.   
Namaskar.

Dear Ravi   
Thanks for ur detailed inputs on Thirukural.   
 **I am not an expert in Thirukural or Tamil to comment on whose commentary on  
Thirukural is the best**. Like Bhagavad Gita has lots of commentaries ( with  
each contradicting one another ), same with Thirukural Kural and still people  
bringing out new versions of the same.   
I have one relative who belongs to a Mystical Cult in Tamil Nadu and he uses  
the harshest words on "all " the current / past people giving talks on  
Thirukural or writing books on the same. He feels that the true meaning of it  
can be got only from a self realized Guru and that cannot be put in print or  
talk. So this is the **Mystical perspective. **   
A relative of mine who is a great Historian says that Thirukural was never  
written by one person and it was written by a group of people like how they  
draft the constitution and might be Thiruvalluvar had headed that group, like  
we have Dr.B.R.Ambedkar who headed the constitution assembly and is called the  
Father of our Constitution and he says Thiruvalluvar was Democratic enough to  
keep all schools of thought in it so we have Hindus, Christians, Jains,   
Shaivities, Vaishnavites etc saying it reflects their thought. So this is the  
**Historical Perspective. **   
People like Periyar, Karunanidhi etc have given a **Rational perspective** of  
Thirukural.   
Swami Omkarananda is given a **Vedic Perspective** of the same.   
 **There will be many more perspective of Thirukural which I am not aware off  
and I feel all have a right to their respective opinion and each individual  
chooses those version he /she is comfortable with  
**I am interested here in what was Bhagwan 's Opinion on Thirukural. I** did  
read about in a book where he did talk about Thiruvalluvar and Auviyar and I  
will find that book's name and page and post it here when I find it.   
I once asked another person who is a serious Devotee of Bhagawan Ramana and  
his works about certain things missing in Bhagawan's talks or advice and  
Thirukuaral did come as one of such missing things. **He said when Bhagwan  
kept silent over certain things it did not mean that he was not approving the  
same, ** it basically meant some people use his approval/ lack of approval to  
ask mischievous questions and finally create a controversy eg. like some  
people asked him about Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's fish eating habits and  
Bhagawan kept silent. If he says it is wrong people will say Bhagwan  
Criticized Saint Ramakrishna and if he says it is right then everyone will  
say Bhagwan approves of eating fish.   
 **So anyway Bhagawan is not with us right now and neither is Thiruvalluvar  
with us right now to approve what is right. **   
_ _I am just seeking which are the Kural if at all Bhagwan has mentioned  
either as advice or for people to contemplate on. Like the way he selected 42  
essential verses of Bhagavad Gita, I am interested whether Bhagawan did any  
such compilation on Thirukural ?__**   
Anyway thanks for ur details reference points and I will keep it in my reading  
list for Kural.

Krishna(Atmavichar)   
Writing or posting here has its limitations unlike a conversation where it is  
easier to arrive at a understanding of each other's perspective.   
All the Different perspectivesi.e The Doctrinal,The Rational,The Mytical,(The  
Vedic itself is such a layered one only where it has one sense for the common  
man and another for the initiate)do not contradict each other-they only become  
more and more universal as well as gather depth.   
This is what Tiruvalluvar means: தொட்டனைத்து ஊறும் மனற்கேணி;மாந்தர்க்கு   
கற்றனைத்து ஊறும் அறிவு.   
The Deeper one digs the tastier the water from the well;   
The More one learns the Richer the Consciousness(awareness).   
I understand that you are looking for any Recommendation that Sri Bhagavan  
might have made and I leave that to our friend Subramanaian.   
However I thought that you may be interested in TirukkuraL per se and am  
sharing this in the hope it will be of some use.   
For your information TG Narayanasamy is a Jivanmukta ;he lives in chennai.He  
has stopped giving talks some years back,and I have referred to his talks on  
Tirukkural for what it is.   
Namaskar.

Ravi   
It is not just Thirukural but also Thiruvachagam, Thayumanavar songs,   
Theverams etc, I am interested in learning completely but since they are all  
quite serious literature, and since my background in Classical Tamil is quite  
weak **I am interested in first getting a starting point in the same and so  
starting with what Bhagawan Ramana recommended for all these texts. T** hat  
is why I am opening all the Old threads regarding these topics and being an  
Arunachala - Ramana forum I do not want to bring in other topics that will be  
distracting to the main objectives of this forum.   
 **I am happy with your inputs and also thank you for pointing out Shri  
T.G.Narayana Swamy**. I have never heard of him and would like to know if he  
has published any books related to Thirukural or given talks in the same.   
**If he has published any material, I would like to know from where I can get  
the same.   
 **I appreciate your efforts for your prompt and detailed response in this  
thread as well as in the other threads . **I have just started to learn  
Thirukuarl verses and have completed the first 5 Chapters. I am not reading  
any meaning of the verses but just memorizing the verses first. I do not want  
to rush learning more but to just keep digesting what little I have learnt and  
I believe that verses of Kural are like Maha Vakyas that you can always use to  
contemplate on and reflect it in your own life. In that manner only I wanted  
to first see what Bhagwan has selected so that I can start with it.   
 **I am saving your pages in my computer for my own self reflection and will  
forward it to my brother in USA who loves Thirukural a lot and has spent more  
than 10-12 years reading and reflecting on the same. **   
Continue your good work.   
Om Peace.

Krishna(Atmavichar)   
Truly appreciate your earnestness in learning these excellent works.They  
simply have no parallel anywhere else.What a Rich Language Tamil is.My  
knowledge of Tamil is smattering only.Whatever little I have is rubbed on me  
through association with Sages like TGN.   
You may be interested in Master TGN.This is what I posted about him in David's  
blog where another devotee of Sri Bhagavan(Sri Aravind)became interested and  
wanted to know about him!   
In David's Blog,Arvind was asking me to write about Master T G  
Narayanaswamy(TGN as he is called).This is what I had posted: I had not responded to your request regarding my Master-I do not know where to  
start and how to go about-I am keenly aware of How Swami Vivekananda said  
once-'In Trying to paint Lord Siva,you end up painting a Monkey!'- **Master is  
an ORDINARY PERSON!** Had it been some Swami or Yogi,it would have been  
easier!   
I thought about it-I think it will be better to give a snippet here and there  
and allow you to piece together the complete picture.   
Here is the First Snippet- **Master is born in the lineage of Mahakavi  
Subramanya Bharati.He inherits his love of Tamil and it is a pleasure to  
listen to his recitation of the Mahakavi 's Poems**.   
Master serves the Finest of Cuisine-THE BUDDHA,,Jesus The  
Christ,Tiruvalluvar,SANKARA,ANDAAL's Tiruppavai(Gnana  
perspective!),Ramanuja,Prophet Mohammed,Thayumanavar,Pattinathaar(Tamil  
sages),Sri Ramakrishna,Omar Khayyam,SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI,SUBHRAMANYA  
BHARATI(whom he regards as a GREAT SEER POET!He bring out clear evidence!),J  
KRISHNAMURTI.   
The Teachings are a fine Blend from THE BUDDHA,TIRUKKURAL,BHAJA  
GOVINDAM,NAALADIYAR,TIRUPPAVAI,YOGA VAASISHTAM,TRIPURA RAHASYAM,SRI RAMANA  
MAHARSHI(One of his Great favourites along with The Buddha).   
Master never married,remained a Naishtika Brahmachari,served and retired from  
some office(I do not know!).He started giving his TALKS for 3 or 4 People who  
sought his help and it increased to a small crowd(a maximum of may be 100 or  
so).Master says-"It is not for me to seek crowds!Nor is it My Intention to  
spread this teaching!If the thirst is sincere Nature will provide the support  
to whoever and wherever they Be!".   
Master does not expect any Formal Protocol-Like Getting up when he walks in  
,doing Namaskar,etc;nor does he permit any religious symbol -Lighting a  
Lamp,Burning Incense,Distributing Vibhuti,Flowers,etc are a strict no!He is a  
World citizen.Yet an ordinary person.Wears a simple Dhoti and a Kurta,quite  
Neat. Always Clean Shaven(No Beard, etc).   
He is an out and out GNANI.No quarters for any Devotional Practices!(Emotion  
and awareness are mutually exclusive-Sage TG Narayanaswamy)   
Enough for now!"   
Arvind responded with this post: Many thanks for the kind comments; many more for sharing the information about  
your Master.   
It was a real joy to read. I could clearly feel your great shraddha towards  
him shining throâ the narrative. I could also sense your Masterâs  
greatness - in terms of knowledge, his simple and all-inclusive teachings, and  
particularly his uncomplicated lifestyle. He is certainly not an ordinary  
person.   
Of course I would love to hear more about him, but even if you stop with what  
youâve written, I âknowâ him already, so to speak, and do not need to  
hear anything more.   
Please convey my heartfelt namaskars to him when you meet him next."   
I responded to Arvind: Arvind,   
You got me!Yes,I was simply using the term Master used to describe himself to  
one of the persons who had sought his help.His daughter had leucoderma and he  
was worried that he was unable to find a suitable match for her.(LIFE throws  
many such problems and they need to be addressed.'Who am I ' is not going to  
address issues like these.I am just pointing to the fact how Blessed and lucky  
some of us are to even be dabbling with these lofty teachings.) **It was while  
addressing him that master referred himself as ORDINARY PERSON(That man had  
gone to several Swamijis and Yogis before landing up at master 's place).**I  
agree that when you say 'I Know him already';Yes,you got it right! "   
If you happen to meet Master TGN,it will be as if you are meeting another  
elderly man.Master no longer gives public talks or private meets.   
This is all for now.   
Everyone is most welcome to listen to the Talks.The Sage does not give  
'Darshan'.We can definitely see him and he treats everyone equally.He does not  
have 'Disciples'!All are equal.   
This is the address where on Sundays at 19:00 hrs there will be the listening  
to the Recorded Talks.Master also sits as if he is part of the audience  
listening to the Talks.He gives a brief preamble for 5 minutes or so before  
the talk.

Ravi   
Thanks again for the inputs, just now went to the TGN Foundation website and  
market the same. Thanks for the info regarding Sri TGN Talks. As such for  
the past few years I avoid public talks or places where there is crowd, ir-  
respective of who the speaker is. Only recently I visited Sri Sringeri  
Barathi Teertha Swamigal, Sri Swami Omkarananda more as a visit of respect and  
got some of their audio talks.   
I prefer to listen to the talks in silence at my own home and reflect on the  
same. Only now I am getting active in a spiritual forum after a long gap and  
I am happy with all the inputs I am getting here.   
If I have any doubts regarding Thirukural etc I will surely seek your  
explanation and in the meanwhile will try to get the books, audio of Sri TGN  
.   
Om Peace.

Dear atmavichar 100,   
Sri Ravi has said all that have to be said. Sri Bhagavan was fond of  
TirukuRaL and He knew many kuRaLs, couplets.   
The one conversation which you are referring, I think, is in Letters from Sri  
Ramanasramam of Suri Nagamma.   
In Guru Vachaka Kovai, both Muruganar and Sri Bhagavan have used almost the  
same words of TirukuRaL.   
Avvaiyar was told about TirukuRaL once by some person.   
She seemed to have a cut a joke. 'Why there should be 1330 couplets?. "Live  
righteously (dharma). Earn only   
that is required for your life. Live with a wife for getting and raising  
righteous living children."   
Avvaiyar is known for brevity in words like Sri Bhagavan. Her Aathi choodi,  
KonRai Vendhan etc., are single line aphorisms.   
Among ancient commentaries, Parimel Azhagar's is said to be the best. There  
are 10 such ancient commentaries.   
Among modern commentaries in Tamizh, any good commentaries in Tamizh (Say, M.  
Varadarajan) is good. If you want English   
commentary, you have to search for a good one and I do not know about it.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramaniam Sir   
Many thanks for ur inputs.   
Do you any list of the Thirukural Bhagawan or Mururganar selected ? Sorry to  
trouble you with this.   
Do you think Thirukural couplets have been mentioned in "Guru Vachaka Kovai",   
if so then I will go through it. I have the one version of David Godman and  
Michael James.   
Om Peace.
