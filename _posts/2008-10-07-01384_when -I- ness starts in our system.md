Dear sir   
When do the "I" ness i.e. ego the false "I" starts in the system. I forgot  
mine. Now when I see in babies. at the age of 2 they are starting to feel. At  
2 they say this is my doll. She is my mom. Till that time they are pure  
without any stain. That is why we say children and Gods are same.   
This false "I" grows like any thing.It helps for survival in the maya jagat.  
The false "I" grows till it gets self realisation.   
But those who born brahma jnani this false "I" never grow. Am I correct.   
Ramanadli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 False "I"starts with identity with the body.It never gets self realisation.When the identity to the body and mind is nullified   
forever Self reveals spontaneously.This is the so called "self realisation".

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, the 'I' ness starts the moment   
you identify yourself as the body. In the morning as you wake up,   
you become aware of your body, which was absent during the sleep,   
and with that the 'I'ness, the false ego starts its game.   
Arunachala Siva.
