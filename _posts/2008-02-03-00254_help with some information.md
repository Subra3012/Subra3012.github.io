I am looking for a teacher of (coming down from) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi  
in the United States, near Boston if possible. Can anyone help? Thank you.

Hi jaizaon,   
Try to read the Upadesa Saram, written by Bhagavan. Keep reading that and if  
you the meaning along with that, it is better.   
my sincere suggestion to you, is that Bhagavan as a "Pure Aatman" is always  
there in every one of us.   
If you search for a guru external to you, is ignorance.   
No one in present days have the capability to teach and guide you on Aatma  
Vichara (Self-Investigation). i mean there may be guru's but as disciple we  
have to prepare our self in order to digest what a guru is telling.   
Remember the words of bhagavan, " **God, Guru and Self are one and the SAME**  
".   
First start with Upadesa Saram and once you have question arising we can  
discuss online.   
Cheers....

Dear jaizon, as we are used for generations, with a guru   
in physical form, we search for him outside. If It wants, It will come   
to you in a physical form. But do not search for It. Meantime,   
as Mr Ashwin said, you may read Upadesa Saram and then you   
may take up, Who am I?, and Arunachala Padigam. You may   
put into practice to the extent possible.
