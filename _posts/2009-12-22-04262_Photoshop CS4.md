## Photoshop CS4  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: December 22, 2009, 04:40:48 PM  
---  
I am trying to make some Glowsign using PSCS4, which is 360"/28" in size.  
Certain Filter options have got disabled, and I am trying to use the  
Render/Lighting option. But what I observed is that the same feature is  
available when I make a smaller picture. I use Vista with 2GB RAM and 32 BIT  
Op System.   
Any Helpers?   
Thanks

Am I right in assuming that you want to make your sign 30 feet long by 28  
inches tall?   
If so, you should make your changes on a smaller version then increase the  
size afterwards, perhaps one quarter the size. Photoshop CS4 is very good at  
retaining detail during resize.   
You might quite rightly argue that you cannot be sure that the effect will be  
smooth if you work with a smaller image first, but whichever way you do it,  
you are limited to the screen render size for preview accuracy.   
I would also guess that a 30 foot sign is normally designed to be viewed from  
a distance, so the output can reflect that.   
All versions of Photoshop have file size limitations for rendering, etc.

Dear Graham,   
Thanks so much for your reply. Yes, I am trying to make a sign of 30 feet long  
by 28 inches tall. I was stuck with the understanding that effect will never  
be satisfactory after resize, but like you said, the size is designed to be  
viewed from a distance, the output should take care. I'l try this as suggested  
by you. I was stuck with this issue for some time now. I tried getting  
solution from various web related help sites which was of no avail.   
Thanks so much   
Nagaraj

## sanskrit font

If this forum can bring out sanskrit font it would be helpful for members.  
Along with the english verson we can go through with sanskrit letters which we  
can understand correctly. It is my humble thought
