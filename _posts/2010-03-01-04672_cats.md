Cat sits in meditative pose for hours.   
Then when somebody silently enters the kitchen, one of their ears get turned  
towards that side; with the slightest sound of opening of the lid of the milk  
bowl, half of their eyes get opened and when the milk bowl is brought at the  
dining table, the cat is right before you.   
Hasn't they balanced the ethereal with the physical?

I have observed that cats do not have gratitude for the help given by   
human beings. Unlike dogs, they ditch you, if you do not give milk   
for two continuous days. They do not have the sense of scent which   
dogs do have. With your body scent, dogs will find you, the Master.   
Cats do not have this but their sense of alertness is equally great.   
No cats came to Bhagavan Ramana for any food assistance or protection.   
But dogs, monkeys, peacocks came.   
Arunachala Siva.
