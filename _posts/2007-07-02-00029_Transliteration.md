## Tolerance

The purpose of this forum is to permit people to post their questions, answers  
and observations for other members to respond to.   
Faith is an immotive issue and has many facets. No-one has any right to  
condemn other people just because they disagree with them.   
You cannot report topics to the administrator just because you don't like  
them. If you are offended by something then you have the freedom to post your  
own message.   
Everyone wants their voice to be heard, this is a fact of life, but tolerance  
is very important. However, generally offensive material, obvious lies and  
racial comments will be removed without hesitation.   
In January and February of 2007 links to pornographic sites were placed on  
this forum. This is the kind of thing that should be reported immediately.

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thanks for your feedback, i was of the impression that it may be easier to  
read and that readers may be interested with it. I would discontinue with it  
and henceforth continue with the normal practice.
