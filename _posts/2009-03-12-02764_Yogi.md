## "Hello! Watson, can you hear me?"  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 11, 2009, 10:00:53 AM  
---  
Thomas Alva Edison has got 100 inventions in his name. After hard   
work, he invented the telephone. He arranged the wires and asked   
his friend Watson, to try to hear him when he spoke. Watson heard   
him saying: "Hello! Watson, can you hear me?" He came to Edison   
running and said that he heard Edison's words. Watson was jumping   
with joy. After sometime, he asked Edison: "Are you not immensely happy with  
this?" Edison said: "Of course. But I am more happy   
when we understand that the all-powerful God can also hear my   
prayers here from the earth, in the Heavens!"   
A seeker's words will always be heard by Guru or God. It need not   
be loud prayers. It should be full of devotion and sincerity. That is   
all. When Gajendra, the elephant called "O Adimoolam!", Vishnu, it   
is said came running to the river. He did not even wait for the vehicle   
Garuda. He did not even bother about his falling uppercloth. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says, He came in such a hurry and pierced the crocodile   
with His disc!   
When the child-saint Tiru Jnana Sambandhar was crying on bank of   
the tank in Sirkazhi, when he could not see his father, Siva and Uma,   
came swiftly and Uma gave Him the breast-milk. Then only the child-   
saint sang His first song!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The concept of Dharma  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 11, 2009, 10:16:30 AM  
---  
"Dharmam" the Sanskrit word has got many meanings. Apatstamba   
Sutras say, Dharmam is the behaviour of a person depending upon   
his class and community. There are general dharmas like speaking truth, right  
conduct, high morality etc., applicable to all classes of the   
society. But there are particular dharmas for each class. Dharmas   
again vary depending on time and space. The Sutras also say, when these  
dharmas are not applicable, listen to what your conscience says or what elders  
say.   
Buddhists use the Pali word Dhammam for Dharmam.   
A king can kill a thousand people in the battle. But he cannot kill even a  
single person otherwise, unless, he hears him in a dispute or in a purported  
crime. A brahmin can never kill any beings, unless there is a threat for his  
own life. So also other classes.   
Again it depends on a time and space. The king can enjoy the girls of the  
enemy's harem. But not his citizens' girls and wives!   
Anyone excepting a King, cannot marry a second wife, unless the first wife  
cannot bear a child for him in eight years or a male child for him in fifteen  
years. Even here, he should take care of the livelihood of the first wife,  
till his or her death.   
A trader cannot give a product for price or profit to a Sannyasi. He can  
quote a price and make a reasonable profit from others.   
An agriculturist need not take bath in the mornings, before food. He can take  
bath, if he wants, in the evening, after completion of work and eating food.  
He can kill all the creatures that harm his agricultural produce.   
The Sutras say that when something is not clear, ask your conscience or  
elders. This can be applied to many situations even now. Even untruth in  
times of need and as per your conscience, can be spoken. Like the Sannyasi,  
who told the hunter that he did not see the deer, even though he had seen a  
deer running for life from the hunter in a particular direction.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Yogi  
Author: karthikeyan M       Date: March 12, 2009, 05:52:18 PM

I just want put this question on Yogis in Tiruvannamalai.   
Its like a poll question   
Do you believe that yogis in Tiruvannamalai are true to some extent.   
Do you believe in Siddhas in the hill exist.   
Do you believe in the flying yogi which made headlines in the news.   
Do you believe that a yogi exist in this modern world   
The reason for the questions is because ''In search for secret India'', Paul  
Burton travels up and down India visiting many people to find an answer to his  
quest in this timeless country. But finally he arrives back to Maharishi.   
And again, Maharishi is not there now, but one cannot argue that such yogis or  
rishees cannot exist in modern India. India cannot change from its culture  
and faith. They must exist and should we believe in them

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Who is a Yogi? Yoga means union, the one who is united with the   
Self is a yogi. A Yogi may or may not have supernatural powers like   
flying, disappearing from the scene etc.,   
Siddhas are advanced Yogis, who continue to live in subtle form like a light.  
Siddhas are said to live in the Arunachala Hills, even today.   
They can be "seen" in the form of light or in any form, only by an equally  
matured Jnani. Bhagavan Ramana has 'seen' them. The flying yogi is not a  
myth, yogi can have such powers. But the news about flying yogis are not  
true. Perhaps, that yogi may be travelling in a supersonic plane! like  
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi or Osho!   
Arunachala Siva.

To such many similar questions put by devotees to Bhagawan, He says, let the  
Yogis be aside, first find out if 'you' 'I' exist! because such questions  
deviate our path and we tend to get lost in such mysteries!

i completely agree that search / belief in flying yogis / siddhas can distract  
us from our quest. But underpinning such beliefs is a yearning to step out of  
the boundaries of the physical self. Yogis and siddhas are "beings" who can  
bend the physical laws with their "powers". Somewhere within us going beyond  
the physical holds a lot of charm and romance and wonder and attraction, isn't  
it?   
But of course, we have to go beyond attractions...!

Dear munagala,   
Yes. It is human nature to acquire supernatural powers. But   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "The Siddhis are like dreams. They   
are like magics."   
He has further said: "The magician while performing magic, knows   
that it is not true. But Siddhi-performing persons, are themselves   
deluded, thinking that it is true."   
But Siddhas are there in Arunachala Hills. They also say they are   
in Kollimalai, a hill near Ooty. They may be there in Himalayas too.   
But these Siiddhas are there, with a purpose, which we do not know.   
Arunachala Siva.
