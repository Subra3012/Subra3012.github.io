is that god's will, is that destined, is that ordained to happen?

Dear tradere,   
A Saint, if he is truly a Brahmajnani does not commit any   
sin. And he is above sin and merits. In stories, we see   
only a sinner becoming a saint, as in the cases of Valmiki   
and Arunagiri Natha. A saint becoming a sinner is almost   
nil. There may be a couple of cases, like Sage Viswamitra   
who got eanmoured with Menaka, and started a life of   
conjugal bliss. Even here, it is not a sin but an error, and it   
caused only a reversal of the merits of his penance. He had to start the  
penance all over again when he realized his error.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: If someone causes misery for   
a Jnani, he takes over the sins/errors if any of the Jnani   
and Jnani becomes a clean slate. If on the other hand if a   
devotee causes happiness for a Jnani, like giving food,   
medicines etc., then such a devotee takes over the merits   
of a Jnani. Because a Jnani does not need any merits for him.   
Arunachala Siva.

this is a very real question my friends   
this world puts many of us in situations that test our maturity   
and for some of us   
the endless suffering weighs heavily   
and that weight pushes, distorts, confuses   
and people tell you "endure", suffer more, find a way out   
but the attempts fail   
and the hole gets deeper and deeper

but i'm still looking for a satisfactory answer   
if someone watches themselves go from good, in the conventional/society  
sense... to a sinner... should they attempt to interfere, or should they make  
no efforts?

Dear tradere,   
Yes. Tests put forth by god by way of misery and pain,   
should be overcome by one's own perseverence. There   
is no way out. Painkillers are not the way to overcome   
pain [as in the case of Michael Jackson]. Perseverence   
and forberance alone helps. You can understand this   
from this story. A mangoose, after Dharmaputra's great   
yaga [sacrificial rights] where thousands were fed, came to   
roll on the left overs of food. This mangoose had its one side golden and the  
other side normal. After rolling over the left overs, the mangoose told  
Dharmaputra: Your yaga [penance] is   
useless. My other side has not got golden colour. Dharmaputra   
was wondering: "What! I have spent gold coins like water   
and conducted this mass feeding and you are not happy?"   
The mangoose said: "Yes. What is the use of having pots   
of gold and spending a small portion of it for feeding others.   
You have not left yet your pride. Listen to this story. I had   
been to a poor man's house. He used to get three dry rotis   
[bread loaves] from God everyday. He used to lend one to   
the poorer man at his house entrance and then feed himself   
and his wife with the two remaining loaves. One day, I went   
there. After feeding the poorer man at the gate, he and his   
wife were about to eat the remaining two loaves. When   
I went there, he gave me one loaf. I said I was still hungry.   
His wife readily gave me the another loaf. After my eating,   
there were some crumbs on the floor. He and his wife took   
those crumbs and then drank water and went to bed. I rolled   
on that floor, I became golden on one my side! I came to your palace to test  
that self-abnegation. But it is not there!   
Perseverence, self abnegation, self control are the essentials for any good  
act in life."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear tradere,   
If a person goes from good to sin, what can the world do   
about it? How many corrections, the world can offer?   
If one is bent upon moving from good to sin, how can   
the world help him? They can at best tell him some advices,   
give examples of such people who had got ruined due to such   
acts etc., Can they really ensure change? Take the case   
of drug-addicts. I was one such person. I was taking   
10 mg lorazepam in the daytime, apart from the prescribed   
2 mg by doctor at night and I did not get any sleep in the   
daytime to overcome my worries and fears and anxieties.   
[I had numerous problems at that time, in 2005, and everyday   
was a nightmare for me]. My wife, my son, my doctors all   
advised me to stop. They all kept the lorazepam away from   
me, they told the druggists not to give me lorazepam etc., etc.,   
But still, I was stealthily buying and taking. A 2 mg lorazepam   
would give a normal person 8 hours sleep, but my 10 mg   
gave no wink of sleep and it went down the stomach like   
toffees. One day I woke up and told Bhagavan Ramana: "Look, if you cannot save me, no one can save me." Bhagavan   
Ramana came in my dream and gave me the mantra. He   
said: 'You tell this as many times as possible on a day. I shall   
soon remove your financial and other problems. But on one   
condition, that you should not touch lorazepam beyond what is   
prescribed by the doctor for night. If you do not have self   
control, by surrendering to me, no one can save you and I also   
would not help you!" His words were followed by me in toto   
and coupled with my self abnegation, I overcome the hump   
in my life. Today all my problems are behind me and I take   
no lorazepam excepting 1 mg that is prescribed by doctor!   
Deaddiction camps do not help a drug addict unless he   
cooperates with the therapists. One can wake a person   
who is really sleeping, but one can never wake a person   
who is posing that he is sleeping!   
Arunachala Siva.

dear traderer   
I sense that what you call sin is not a sin to yourself but to society...   
the thing is, if you hurt others with your behaviour then it is not correct..   
I alsow as a drug addict when I was a teenager, I took mdma, exstasy all kinds  
of pills, speed etc.. all else was boring, school was boring society was not  
fullfilling me a bit, it was filled iwth people without "knowledge" in the  
drug people sense (a very strange pathological knowledge if one thinks about  
it later)   
I was high most of the week, I didnt care about nothing except my trips and my  
parties...but my health and my mind went bankrupt...   
one night I shouted at my friends that I will kill them, I was high on a drug  
that usually makes you very open and empathic, but instead I was willing to  
kill my own friends..   
the next day I simply stopped with this behaviour all at once...I was crazy  
and sleepless for a month or so...and slowly I became centered again, I used  
the crazy energies of my mind to become a yogi   
sinse thi time I practice very sincere and it helped me to find some sortof  
healthy ground to life again..   
but I suffered much more hard times in my life...this is not sinning to me I  
do not know why, I think because I used this expereinces to create a good  
sadhana instead of blindly continuing my stupidity

matthias, you are correct. i'm not talking about sin to one's self, whatever  
craziness that is. i'm talk about being ruthless in the world in order to gain  
the things of the world   
thanks all for the replies. but the basic question feels unanswered. some  
of you are saying make efforts to correct one's wrong doings. but is that  
really the appropriate advice? if one didn't want to do the wrong things in  
the first place, they wouldn't. so all you are basically saying is don't do  
what you want to, which makes no sense

there are different types of karma you see...Iam not a pandit or something  
like this...   
if you would like a clear and accurate exlplanation what things are creating  
karma and in wich degree please study the scriptures   
please clearify this sentences that you wrote:  _so all you are basically saying is don 't do what you want to, which makes  
no sense_   
and refer to the part of my previous answer so I might understand...

Until you reach the state of Gnani, dangers of pitfalls are there  
.Vivekachudamani warns about this and compares the fall of a ball from  
staircase, not just a drop from one step to the next, but with momentum in  
leaps and bounds. Sex and murderous crimes are replete in lives of many  
sanyasis. Jada Swami attempted to finish Bhagavan. God/Guru always send  
warning signals ; but if one ignores and don't pay heed to the warning,one has  
to pay the price. In th case of Bhagavan he does'nt just warn but see to it  
that you you are in the safety zone.

Dear arcsekar,   
Very true. Falling from high levels gives more harm and it is   
sudden like the ball falling down from stair cases. How difficult it   
would be to take the ball by bumping it on each step to the   
highest step, that is upstairs? But fall happens just by one   
'miss'. The story of Dharmaputra and the game of dice shows   
only this. Thanks for this lucid example from Sankara's Viveka-   
choodamani.   
Arunachala Siva.

"If a saint becomes a sinner..."   
Although several have kindly answered this question, it seems to me that one  
needs know who considers the the saint a saint -- or, was the saint really a  
"saint" \-- then, what are the bad actions & who judges the saint as sinning?  
Without a specific case, I don't see how there can be an answer.   
That said, it was beneficial for me to read how others have come out of their  
bad situations. Here's my rusty ten cents: Early this Spring, I was drowning -- all good intentions, vows and promises  
were dissolving in alcohol (had been for decades...). At the same time I was  
reading, Swedenborg (Heaven and Hell), Thomas Merton(Mystics and Zen Masters),  
and Ramana (Osborne's bio -- for the 5th o5 6th time) -- it was like turning  
the light on and off.   
Then, suddenly, I was hit with an understanding that Ramana's teaching of  
self-enquiry cannot be grasped or practiced by any act of (ego) will -- it has  
to be given and it was. (Osborne mentions a time when Ramana told of someone  
who had received initiation who had never been to see him (physically). I  
figured if 600 miles are not an obstacle, then 6000 miles, 60 years or 6  
centuries ought not to be a problem.)   
Sooo, I started practice after a feeble fashion and things got better. I'd be  
dry for a while then "just a drink or two wouldn't hurt, would it?" And it  
didn't - not the first day - but after at most a week I was up to speed and,  
if anything, drinking even more.   
Then, strange things started happening. I'd be with out a drink for a week  
and almost dry when I thought to "just have one beer". There I sit on the  
park bench, pop the bottle open and a good swallow is on its way down my  
throat -- bang! my mobile (cell) phone rings and some emergency has happened  
at home...   
The third time it happened, my wife called to tell me our daughter had broken  
her foot -- I poured the beer out on the ground and ran home ("Okay, You win!  
I get the message!" I shouted in my mind as I ran home.) Drinking now is  
something this fellow doesn't do, what I mean is, there is no effort to not  
drink. Yes, the old habits are lying there -- when I notice them, I give  
thanks that they are turned off and their batteries taken out. Hopefully,  
they will wither, dry up and blow away.   
Love - Being - Aware
