## Meditation on Mt. Arunachala

How can meditation on a mountain have spiritual benefit? What power does a  
mountain have to influence the soul of a person who merely thinks of it?

Dear "davgad", I do not know much about other mountains.   
Mountains like Himalayas or Nilgiris (Ooty) my give serenity   
due to its climate, calmness, herbs etc., But Arunachala is   
different. As per scriptures and Ramana's own words, this is   
Shiva Himself. Contemplating on Arunachala is equivalent to   
contemplating on Shiva. Try it hard, you will find the results   
yourself. Bhagavan says: "The mere thought or contemplation   
of Arunchala roots out the ego!"

Dear "davgad", Arunachala is also portrayed as Effulgent Light,   
in various puranas, verses like Tiruvachakam and also by Bhagavan   
in His "Talks" and writings. Meditation on the Heart Centre also   
makes It shine with Effulgent Light. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala  
Mahatmiyam also tells a story, where Shiva stood as one Formless,   
Nameless Light, and Vishnu and Brahma could not reach its feet or   
head. In the Heart Centre, the Self also shines as Light. Hence,   
Arunachala=Shiva=Effulgence=Heart Centre=Brahman=Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Mountains Like Himalayas are not merely known for its climate, calmness or  
herbs. Yes these are the part of Himalays. But the Himalaya itself is abode of  
Lord Vishnu, Shiva & Divine Mother. Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamnotri,  
and 9 Main shrines of Divine Mother are located on Himalayas. This is a very  
little description of Himalayas. Thousands of sages go there and medidate as  
it is known as the path to Vaikuntha. Himalaya is also the father of Divine  
Mother. The holy river Ganga's udgam sthal is Himalaya, it is Lord Shiva's  
Head from where Ganga has come.   
Dear Davgad,   
Medidation is fixing your mind on Lord. the whole universe is lord's abode,  
you can think of a form and medidate, it all depends on your faith and  
tendencies. But there are few places where lord is manifested better and  
Arunachala is that one place. Arunachala is Shiva Himself and the vibrations  
there are so strong that it immediately takes your mind to a higher plane.

Dear Shivani, I am sorry I had given a poorer description of Himalayas.   
The Himalayas contain abodes of Shiva, Uma and Vishnu and it is the   
birthplace of Ganga. But these are all temples of gods but Arunachala   
is God Himself. There are, it is said, 51 sakti-peetas and 107 vishnu   
sthalas (108th is Vaikunta, where one can go after the death only) and 5 Siva  
sthalas representing 5 elements. But these are all again houses of gods ony.  
Arunachala is itself Siva with concorporate Sakti. Arunachala Puranam gives  
the difference in detail. Arunachala Siva.

I completely agree to you point, but then Which place is not Shiva Himself  
Subramanianji? Tell me....   
I feel The whole universe is His manifestation. Be Arunachala, Himalaya, the  
house where i stay, it is all He Himself.

Dear Shivani, I have no second opinion. While the whole universe   
is doubtlessly God, everyone one needs a form and name outside,   
for prayer and meditation, before one pitches on the formless   
'Aham' inside. Even here, a person needs a place and hence   
Bhagavan suggested the Heart. eg., we have a home and a home-   
altar. That way, Arunachala is Siva Himself. Bhagavan and so   
many realized souls who were there in Tiruvannamalai in the past.   
have vouchsafed it. Arunachala Siva.

Mountains are 'achala' whereas mind is 'chala' (unsteady). Meditation on the  
still mountains helps in stilling the mind. The majestic peaks of the  
mountains make the ego humble before Creation. It is a known fact that  
Arunachala is attracting lakhs of people towards it.

Welcome, S. Subramanian.   
Yes. Arunachala is the mountain which is Siva Himself. It is   
primordial. Several poets and Bhagavan Ramana have sung   
Its glory. Geologists have concluded that the Hills is as old   
as the earth. It is prayed as a Great Medicine, a Great Waterfall   
of Bliss. If you meditate on the Hills, it will root out your ego,   
says the first verse of Aksharamanamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Everything is Siva. ..   
Just meditate on the mountain as one's own self. .. Not to make yourself still  
but to see yourself as Achala, Stillness itself.   
That is a beautiful form of meditation.

Good question! And some of the answers given would be ones I would quote or  
give. But many people here ask this also, and some already know the quotes.   
On a different level than those answers given; physically the mountain is  
highly magnetic, being full of iron ore, and ancient as far as mountains go.  
It was obviously once much taller, and the whole plain around it has the same  
granite a few feet under the earth, spreading at least 30 miles outwards.   
Many sages have lived here, prior to Ramana, who must have also felt its pull.  
We can certainly be assisted and helped by their presence here.   
I have not answered but will continue to ask and ponder upon the question.   
Thank You
