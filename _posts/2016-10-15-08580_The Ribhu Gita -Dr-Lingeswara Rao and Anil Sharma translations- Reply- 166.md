38. The Self alone is the Self eternal. The Self alone illuminates the qualities. The Self alone is of the form   
of the fourth state. The Self is all transcending and beyond that.   
39. The Self alone is the eternal and perfect Self. I am the Self alone - there is no doubt. You and I are   
the Self, indeed the Self. All is only the Self.   
40. I am eternal. I am the eternally perfect. I am eternal, ever and anon. I am the Self alone; the world   
is not different; the immortal and ancient Self.   
41. I am the ancient. I am the Purusha (God) and the Lord. I am beyond the beyond. I am Parameswara.   
I am the bestower of worldly existence. I am the destroyer of worldly  
existence. I am the granter of   
happiness and the form of non dual happiness.   
42. I am Bliss. I am endless. I am immortal - there is no doubt of this. I am birth-less. I am of the form   
of the Self. There is naught else that is lovable.   
43. I am Brahman alone. This is Brahman. All is the undiminshing Brahman always. There is never the word 'all'. 'All' is always naught.   
44\. I am attributeless. I am support-less. I am ever non existent. There is  
no cause for calamity at all.   
There is not a trifling of delusive affects.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
