387: Through the miracle of grace that penetrated me in the form of true, all  
embracing consciousness,   
so that the ghostly charade created by the evil ego was abolished, I  
perceived that there was nothing   
that I needed to learn employing the intellect. Learned as I was, that unique  
nature, wherein I acted   
like an untutored simpleton, one who uses a mark to sign His name, became my  
own.   
373: Through the glory of a nature that is not even aware of its own greatness,  
through a compassion   
whose nature it is to not even see my own unworthiness, He abolished all  
differentiation, transmuting   
all into His own Self, so that all my deeds, possessing a unique divine  
quality, excelled as His own.   
194: The state in which one attains and becomes permanently established in  
limitless space, the pure state   
of grace, the exquisite supreme bliss whose nature is delight, is none other  
than the holy feet of the guru,   
the tender flame of true knowledge that ever watches over those devotees whose  
love is true.   
393: You shone within my heart, beyond duality, as my own self, and I, with a true  
love flaring up within me,   
worshipped You in a variety of ways, so that to others, my worship appeared  
dualistic. Forgive me,   
I beg You, and do not reject me!   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
