A logician once asked Sri Ramakrishna, "What are knowledge, knower, and the  
object known?"   
To which he replied, "Good man, I do not know all these niceties of scholastic  
learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and that I am Her son."

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to explain such things if someone asks   
with ardent interest. Otherwise, He will also keep silent.   
But if someone were to say: "I do not anything.," Bhagavan   
Ramana used to give two types of answers: 1\. He will say: "Find out who says 'I do not know'. Is it the   
Atma? Atma need not know anything. If it is your mind, when   
find out, 'What the mind is? Where is this mind when you are   
in deep sleep?'   
2. For bhaktas, who know only devotion, He would say "Then   
repeat Rama, Rama or Siva, Siva. That is sufficient. You need   
not know anything else."   
Arunachala Siva.

Within the "I do not know" expression is also hidden the "I know" expression: " _I know only my Mother Divine_ "   
That is the beauty of this sentence.
