Self-inquiry is the right way to relate with the darkness of Self-ignorance  
and its progeny the ego.   
Awareness is existential; unawareness is only the absence of awareness. And  
the problem with any   
absence is that you cannot do anything directly about it.   
Self-ignorance is like darkness. What can you do about darkness directly? You  
cannot drop it, you cannot   
throw it out, you cannot bring it in. There is no way to relate with darkness  
without bringing light in. The   
way to darkness goes via light. If you want darkness, put the light off; if  
you don't want darkness, put   
the light on. But you will have to do something with light, not with darkness  
at all.But from centuries   
together man tried his best to throw away the darkness with another figment of  
darkness in the name   
of meditation,inquiry.One part of the mind assumes the role of observer to  
observe the rest of mind.   
But both parts are conditioned entities born out of Self-ignorance.In this  
type of observation mind will   
be in status quo even if you do inquiry for thousands of years sincerely.This  
what JK points out that   
observer is the observed and they are qualitatively the same but few  
understood him.The western   
psychologists are more concerned with the dark side of the self and they tried  
their best to find solutions   
to the ego problems of human with ego through analysis of the contents of the  
mind.The man who   
analyzes is a conditioned one and is also a product of Self-ignorance.Anything  
analyzed through   
conditioning is a limited observation and results in residue of non-  
understanding and so leads to perennial   
conflict.That is why psychologists like Adler,Jung,Froid,Jean Paul  
Sartre,Camus Friedrich Nietzsche could   
throw some limited light on human consciousness but were unable to solve the  
psychological problems   
born out of ego.They themselves felt they came to a dead end,frustrated and  
some of them committed   
suicide.They are more interested in categorizing the contents of ego rather  
than finding the root cause   
of ego.If by chance some mystic is born in the west and he speaks truth he is  
killed.Best examples are   
Socrates and Pythagoras.The culture in the east is different and people  
recognize a realized soul and   
they start adore him.When they have some psychological problem they prefer  
going to saint rather than   
a psychologist because they know the latter is travelling in the same boat as  
them. In Self-inquiry we   
bring in the light of awareness and in that light the conscious layer,the  
subconscious layer and the   
unconscious layers of mind that are hidden can be brought to the conscious  
level.If only we could   
perceive and understand these false things as false through light of awareness  
in Self-inquiry   
we come upon to truth.A mind which is free of these false things in the form  
of belief and dogmas   
acts with awareness.Any action born out of unawareness results in ego.Majority  
of us lead a mechanistic   
life.First of all we must be aware of small things in life.We awake from sleep  
and immediately we start   
doing something routine which is mechanistic.As we awake from deep sleep there  
is a time interval   
when we do not completely cognise outward things through senses.In that time  
interval there is the   
awareness of Pure "I" which is not associated with the non-Self yet and if we  
can hold on to that   
Pure "I" it shows us the way to Self.We are not aware of beauty of the morning  
with chirping of birds,   
the daily life of our fellow human beings,we relate with our family members  
mechanically by taking them   
for granted and we are not sensitive in relating them,we are not aware of  
mutual usage in relationship,   
our reaction of the mind to the other.We fresh up in the morning without  
awareness,we take food   
without noticing the taste,smell,quality,what type of food we take which suits  
best to the body and mind   
and majority of us are never in the present moment while we take food.Later we  
go to office and   
majority of times we attend to it in a mechanical way,we relate to the boss  
with hypocrisy,we behave in   
a different way with the servants and all these are due to unawareness.Unless  
we cultivate awareness   
in simple areas of life like these we do not develop the capacity to observe  
thoughts,feelings,emotions   
that   
are happening in our interior.We can follow a thing if it moves slowly; a  
rapid movement of thought must   
be made to slow down if one is to study its movements.This is possible if we  
cultivate awareness in   
small things of life.Thoughts-feelings can be studied and understood only if  
the   
mind is capable of proceeding slowly.If we do Self-inquiry earnestly mind i.e  
thought flow slows down.   
in the light of awareness.   
The person who becomes obsessed with ego will never be able to resolve the  
problem. It is like wrestling   
with darkness -- you are bound to be exhausted sooner or later, tired and  
defeated. And the miracle is,   
defeated by something which is not there at all! And when one is defeated, one  
certainly feels how   
powerful the darkness is, how powerful the fear is, how powerful the ignorance  
is, how powerful the   
unconscious is. They are not powerful at all -- they don't exist in the first  
place.   
Never fight with the nonexistential. That's where all the ancient religions  
got lost. Once you start fighting   
with the nonexistential you are doomed. Your small river of consciousness will  
be lost in the   
nonexistential desert -- and it is infinite.   
Don't make a problem out of ego. Awareness is the question. Something can be  
done about awareness   
immediately; there is no need to wait or postpone. Start being aware! And it  
is a natural gift from God to   
you, or from the whole, whichever term you like. If you are brought up in a  
religious way, then God; if   
you are not brought up in a religious way, then the whole, the universe, the  
existence.   
Remember, awareness is born with you; it is your intrinsic quality. All that  
is needed is to give it a way --   
to make a passage for it, to let it flow, to allow it to happen. We are all  
blocking it, holding it back.   
Be aware of this first layer.This is all that people know about each other.   
Then the second layer, which you are suppressing, is continuously forcing its  
way up. It wants to come   
up, it is part of you -- and it is truer than the first. The first is social,  
the second is natural, more   
authentic than the first.   
Then by and by, when you have become aware of the first two layers, your  
consciousness will be   
intense enough to penetrate the third layer, the unconscious.   
To penetrate the third layer is very difficult because it consists of all your  
past lives, all the millions of   
past lives you have lived.   
The third layer consists of all these lives, the whole cumulative effect --  
all the Sanskaras(tendencies), all   
the conditionings, all the karmas.   
When you have dealt with the first two layers and you have become aware, not  
only aware, but master   
of them, now they are no longer masters of you but servants -- as servants  
they are beautiful, they   
have much utility, but as masters they are dangerous -- then your  
consciousness can penetrate the third   
layer.   
The third is the real struggle, and without passing the third, passing through  
it, one can never reach to   
the innermost core which you are in reality i.e Self or being.This is how we  
become the masters of our   
own mind and one who is master of his mind is master of whole world because  
world is nothing but   
a projection of our own mind.That is why all saints are at ease with  
themselves because they are in a   
state of no-mind and all psychologists and vast majority of humanity are in  
tension because they are   
rooted in ego.So Self-inquiry and Self-knowledge are panacea to all human  
problems.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana has said this in His Verses 4 and 5 of   
Sri Arunachala Ashtakam.   
Verse 4: To search for God ignoring You who stand as Being and   
shine as Awareness, is like looking, lamp in hand, for darkness.   
In order to reveal Yourself atlast as Being and Awareness, You dwell in  
various forms in all religions. If still there are people who fail to see You  
whose Being is Awareness, they are no better than the blind who do not know  
the Sun. O mighty mountain Aruna, peerless Jewel, stand and shine, One  
without a second, the Self   
within my Heart.   
Verse 5: Like the string that holds together the gems, in a necklace, You it  
is that penetrate and bind all beings, and the various religions. If, like a  
gem that is cut and polished, the separate mind is whetted on the grindstone  
of the pure, universal   
Mind, it will acquire the light of Your Grace and shine like a ruby,   
whose brightness is not flawed by any other object. When once   
the light of the Sun has fallen on a sensitive plate, will the plate   
register another picture? Apart from You, O Aruna Hill, bright,   
auspicious does any other thing exist?   
(Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
