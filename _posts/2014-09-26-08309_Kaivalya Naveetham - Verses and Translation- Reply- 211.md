Verse 108 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: The whole universe is as unreal as water in a mirage, silver in mother of  
pearl, the city of Gandharva in the air,   
the dream land in a dream, the blue in the sky, the serpent in a rope, the  
offspring of a barren woman, the horn   
of a hare, or the thief in a thick post. O Son! Pure Consciousness is alone  
real. Do not therefore forget the Self   
at any moment.   
The first part - Tattuva ViLakkap Patalam - Exposition of the Truth -  
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
