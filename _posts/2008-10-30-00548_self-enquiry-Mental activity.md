## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Final words of advice from the silent sage - Thayumanavar

**Withdraw the mind from the senses   
and fix it in meditation.   
Control the thought-current.   
Find out the thought-centre and fix yourself there.  
Then you will be conscious of the Divine Self;   
you will see it dancing in ecstasy.   
Live in that delight.   
That Delight-Consciousness, is the God in you.   
He is in every heart.   
You need not go anywhere to find Him.   
Find your own core and feel Him there.   
Peace, bliss, felicity, health - everything is in you.   
Trust in the Divine in you.   
Entrust yourself to His Grace.   
Be as you are.   
Off with past impressions.   
He who lives from within an ingathered soul-life   
is a real Sage though he may be a householder.   
 **He who allows his mind to wander with the senses   
is an ignoramus, though he is learned.   
See as a witness, without the burden of seeing.   
See the world just as you see a drama.   
See without attachment, Look within.  
Look at the inner light unshaken by mental impressions.   
Then, floods of conscious bliss   
shall come pouring in and around you from all directions.   
This is the supreme Knowledge;   
realise ! Aum Aum ! "

## Inventions from the pure mind.

Dear sirs,   
Some people are born with pure mind (suddha manas). These people turned to  
Self realisation. But what about   
the great scienctists. They should also have suddha manas who invented many  
things for the world. Is not it?   
Therefore as the world is created from the impure mind, the great inventions  
also happened from the pure mind.   
So both mind is a veil from "Self:". Is it?   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 The Ekagrata(one pointedness) of Suddhamanas is selfwards in a saint,whereas it is directed outwards in a scientist.So Saint   
is a subjective scientist,whereas scientist is an objective scientist.The  
character of exploration is the same in both but directions are different.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, the scientific inventions/   
discoveries are the objective experiences, and perhaps may   
fatten the egos of the scientists. I am not sure. But Dr. Einstein,   
after the discovery of general theory of relativity, has said: "These are all nothing. I want to know the God's mind. The rest   
are all details!"   
He has also said once the following, which are inscribed in his   
room in Syracuse University: "I believe in God who is very subtle!"   
Arunachala Siva.

it is a fact that alot of the great scientists like Einstein and others were  
and are mystics....   
einstein said some tings that can just come from an "inspired" mind, the same  
with mozart, beethoven etc..   
beethoven said: "what loftier mission is there to approach the godhead"   
even the great nietzsche who said "god is dead" also said something like the  
true desire of the human is to melt into the universe....

Yes. Great artists have also been mystics, in a way. But some of them were  
looking abnormal in their behavior. The power inside, which they know, were  
the outpourings of the arts and scientific discoveries. Van Gogh was in love  
with a girl. The girl complained that he has got ugly ears. So he cut them  
off and sent them to the girl friend. The same artist produced great  
paintings in later years. Wagner, the great musician, was deaf. Einstein  
started believing in god, after he discovered the General Theory of  
Relativity. Kekule who discovered the hexagonal structure of benzene, which  
the base for all aromatic compounds, could not succeed in his goal. One  
night, he prayed to God and had a dream where he found six serpents holding  
each others' tail through their mouths. He got up from sleep and drew the  
hexagonal closed structure of benzene!   
Alekhine the world champion chess player, was a mad man. But   
if he sits before a chess board, he would play wonderful games.   
He was beaten only a few times in his hundreds of games. (The   
Chess Mind by Gerald Abrams). Robert Fisher, the first non-American to become  
a world chess champion was also abnormal. He always preferred a room without  
windows!   
He had said that even the ceiling fan that was revolving over his   
head was a disturbance to him, while playing chess.   
Bhagavan Ramana who had no intention of writing any poems either   
for spreading bhakti or jnana, had one day, found that the words   
'Karunaiyal ennai aanada nee..... coming repeatedly in his mind   
and could not forget them till He completed the stroll on the Hill!   
On return, He wrote the first poem of Sri Arunachala Padigam. Then followed  
the other verses of Padigam, Ashtakam, Navamani Maalai   
and Pancharatnam!   
Arunachala Siva.

Mano Nasam is destruction of the ego, [which also lies in the form   
of mind and thoughts.]. Ahandai uru azhithale mukti, the destrcution   
of the ego is liberation, thus ends ULLadu Narpadu.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju ji   
First of all it is a thought we identify with the body and mind. 2nd thought  
is I am incomplete or unhappiness.   
3rd is without going inside going for truth is also thought. Once we realised  
there we do not require any thoughts   
i.e. thoughtless state. Bhagavan also says. like a stick which helps to burn  
the dead body at last the stick also will get burnt. These types of good  
thoughts are welcome which lead us to thoughtless state.   
(these are all I learned points. That is all. I am always with full of  
thoughtful stage only. Praying Bhagavan to that stage daily)   
Ramanaduli
