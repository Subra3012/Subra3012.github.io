Dear Ramanaduli,   
I think that confessions and prayer go hand in hand. Confession   
is of two kinds. One is speaking frankly about inability to do   
certain [good] things, and seeking through prayer God's help.   
The other type of confession to speaking to God frankly about   
our sins and errors and again imploring God's forgiveness.   
Both the categories go with prayers.   
Sri Bhagavan says about the first one in Verse 105 of Sri   
Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: May You live for ever, as the loving saviour of poor and helpless   
people like me, O Arunachala!   
The second one is mentioned in Verse 19 of Sri AAMM: O Arunachala, You stand and shine before me in the form of   
my Guru, destroy utterly my faults, cure me and convert me   
and as your servant govern me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Confession is often associated with a guilty feeling and emptying one's heart  
before God, confessing the guilt and asking for forgiveness. Prayer on the  
other hand is often used in a much broader sense to include remembrance of God  
also. So if a person does not have any guilty feelings, confession is not  
required; but a person can pray at all times. A person can pray even after  
self-realization to remember God, chant His name etc. So prayer has a more  
broader scope.

I don't know how you could measure these two things. Confession can be plenty  
"powerful" when someone has something bottled up inside and has tried to  
ignore it for years confessing it can be the first step to correcting it or  
releasing it. I think a lot of neuroses comes from people not facing their  
imperfections or past bad actions. The common idea is to blame the world for  
all your problems and never give an inch to recognizing your own  
imperfections... this discord gets worse and worse as it builds up. Confession  
can be a release valve.   
Prayer, as we all know can be powerful spiritual tool also, but it can be  
nothing more than constantly asking for things to when not understood  
correctly.   
The question seems like asking "Which is food: A sandwich or soup"?   
They both are.

Dear soham3,   
Yes. Kaivayla Navaneetam says that there are 7 stages of   
ignorance and 7 stages of knowledge, before liberation. The   
latter 7 are called mental states or planes of enlightenment.   
The eighth one is added later. Sri Bhagavan does not accept   
the eighth one.   
The 7 stages of ignorance: 1\. Brihat Jagrat - the germinal state of waking.   
2\. Jagrat - Waking state.   
3\. Maha Jagrat - the waking state firmly established.   
4\. Jagrat Svapna - day dreaming   
5\. Svapna - dreaming state   
6\. Svapna Jagrat - cogitation of the dream after waking up from it.   
7\. Sushupti - dreamless deep sleep.   
The 7 stages of knowledge or planes of enlightenment: 1\. Subeccha - desire for Truth   
2\. Vicharana - investigation into the Truth.   
3\. Tanumanasi - Pure and attenuated mind.   
4\. Sattvpatti - Realization of Truth.   
5\. Asamskti - a detached outlook on the universe and its contents.   
6\. Padarthabhavani - untained awareness of the Self.   
7\. Turiya - the highest and indescribable state.   
8\. Turiyatita \- actually it is a state after Videha Mukti, the state   
of liberation after disembodiment. But Bhagavan Ramana does not accept this  
since it cannot be established by a person living and   
explaining all these. There is nothing to speak of, says Sri   
Bhagavan.   
Arunachala Siva.

No. Sri Bhagavan did not say anything like that. How to be aware   
of Awareness? If I am a man, should I be always aware that I am a man? Even  
the state that 'I am' is natural to everyone.   
Arunachala Siva.

**The Magic Horse   
A king had two sons. The first helped the people by working for them in a  
manner they understood. The second was called 'Lazy' because he was a dreamer,  
as far as anyone could see.   
The first son gained great honours in his land. The second obtained from a  
humble carpenter a wooden horse and sat astride it. But the horse was a  
magical one. It carried the rider, if he was sincere, to his heart's desire.   
Seeking his heart's desire, the young prince disappeared one day on the horse.  
He was absent a long time. After many adventures he returned with a beautiful  
princess from the Country of Light, and his father was overjoyed at his safe  
return and listened to the story of the magic horse.   
The horse was made available to anyone who wanted it in that country. But many  
people preferred the obvious benefits which the actions of the first prince  
provided for them because to them the horse always looked like a plaything.  
They did not get beyond the outer appearance of the horse, which was not  
impressive - just like a plaything.   
When the old king died, the 'prince who liked to play with toys' became, by  
his wish, the king. But people in general despised him. They much preferred  
the excitement and interest of the discoveries and activities of the practical  
prince.   
Unless we listen to the 'lazy' prince, whether he has a princess from the  
Country of Light with him or not, we shall not get beyond the outer appearance  
of the horse.. Even if we like the horse, it is not its outward shape which  
can help us travel to our destination.

**The Way Out   
Bees seem to have something like human minds, exactly the same kind of  
stupidity. The doors may be open, but if a bee is inside the room, caught  
inside the room... and she may have come from the open door but she will try  
to get out from the closed window. Not only bees but other birds also behave  
in the same way. Any bird can enter in your room; the doors are open, he has  
come from the door, but he cannot go back from the same door.   
He starts trying to get through the wall, through the ceiling... and the more  
he tries, the more desperate he becomes, because there is no way to get  
through the ceiling or through the wall or through the closed window. And in  
that desperation, frustration he becomes more and more blind, afraid, scared.  
He loses all intelligence. And the same is the case with human beings.   
One day Buddha came into his assembly of the monks. It must have been just a  
morning like this. His sannyasins were sitting and waiting for him. They were  
puzzled because this was for the first time that Buddha had come with  
something in his hand  a handkerchief. They all looked at the handkerchief  
What was the matter? There must be something special in it. And Buddha sat on  
the platform and rather than starting speaking to the assembly he looked at  
the handkerchief, started tying a few knots in it, five knots in all.   
The whole assembly watched  what is going on? And then he asked the assembly,  
Can anybody tell me: is this handkerchief the same as it was before the knots  
were tied?   
Sariputta said, This is a tricky question. In a way the handkerchief is the  
same because nothing has changed, in a way it is not the same because these  
five knots have appeared which were not there before. But as far as the inner  
nature of the handkerchief is concerned  its nature is concerned  it is the  
same; but as far as its form is concerned it is no more the same. The form has  
changed: the substance is the same.   
Buddha said, Right. Now I want to open these knots. And he started  
stretching both ends of the handkerchief farther away from each other. He  
asked Sariputta. What do you think? By stretching farther will I be able to  
open the knots?   
He said, You will be making knots even more difficult to open because they  
will become smaller, more tighter.    
Buddha said, Right. Then I want to ask the last question: what should I do so  
that I can open the knots, the tied knots? How I can untie them again?   
Sariputta said, Bhagwan, I would like first to come close and see how in the  
first place the knots have been tied. Unless I know how they have been tied it  
is difficult for me to suggest any solution.   
Buddha said, Right, Sariputta. You are blessed, because that is the most  
fundamental question to ask. If you are in a certain fix, the first thing is  
how you got into it rather than trying to get out of it. Without asking the  
most fundamental and the primary question, you will make things worse.   
And thats what people are doing. They ask, How we can get out of our  
sexuality, greed, anger, attachment, jealousy, possessiveness, this and that?  
without asking, How in the first place we get into them?   
Buddhas whole approach is, first see how you get into anger. If you can see  
the entrance, the same door is the exit; no other door is needed. But without  
knowing the entrance if you try to find out the exit you are not going to  
find; you will get more and more desperate. And thats what people go on  
doing. In the scriptures, what are you looking for?  solutions. You create  
the problems  and the solutions are in the scriptures! Why dont you look at  
the problems yourself. How you create them?   
Why dont you watch when you are creating a certain problem? And you create  
every day, so it is not a question that you have to go back. Today you are  
going to be angry again, today you will feel again the sexual urge: see how it  
arises, see how you enter into it, how you get hooked into it, how it becomes  
so big like a cloud that surrounds you and you are lost in it. And then you go  
to ask others! You are functioning almost like a silly bee. Bees can be  
forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven.

Dear Jewellji,   
Very simple and clear story. I was listening to a Bagavath Gita discourse when  
Swamiji mentioned the same thing. He said the answer is in the problem and  
instead of looking there people go to other places like temple etc., looking  
for the solution. I did not fully understand what he meant then but your story  
makes it very clear.   
Thank you for sharing.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Dear Lathaji,   
Yes indeed. The solution is always in the problem itself. We create  
everything,and then get catch in it. The thing i saw is that there are never  
problems. It is only matter of wrong interpretation. And things are never the  
way they look or the way we think they are. We look everything through mind  
prism,and all that is mind buisiness anyway. And we are entagled just because  
we are holding onto it,and create even more problems. It is the matter of  
wrong focused attention and interest. One thing i learned is that mind cannot  
be trusted at all.   
I live this story too,and especially the way Osho narates it.   
Thank You Very much,dear Lathaji!   
With love and prayers,

**Want   
There is a very old story about an ascetic who was doing penance in a dense  
forest. He was sitting with closed eyes and was praying to God continuously.  
He wanted to gain heaven. Hunger and thirst did not worry him.   
A very poor young woman used to come to that forest to collect firewood. Out  
of kindness and consideration for the ascetic she used to pluck some fruits,  
bring water from the pond in cups made of leaves, and she used to put them  
near him. The ascetic was able to sustain himself on these things.   
 Gradually his asceticism became even more intense. He forgot about hunger and  
thirst and he neither touched the fruits nor the water. That poor young woman  
felt very unhappy and sad about this but there was no way out. Lord Indra also  
became worried and said that this person is going beyond the limits: does he  
intend to get hold of the throne of heaven? It is absolutely necessary to  
disturb his penance.   
It was not very difficult to do so because Lord Indra knows the mind of man. A  
breeze came from heaven and turned that poor dark, ugly, young woman into a  
stunning beauty. It seemed as if a ray came down from heaven and turned her  
ordinary body into a golden one. As she was filling water for the ascetic from  
the pond, she saw her reflection in the water and just could not believe that  
she was looking like a fairy. She became fascinated by her own reflection.   
She continued to look after the ascetic. Then one day the ascetic opened his  
eyes and told the young woman that he wanted to leave that place and go to  
other mountains as he has to tread on a more difficult path; he cannot rest  
till he has conquered heaven itself.   
The young woman started crying, tears fell from her eyes. She said, What  
wrong have I done that you are stopping me from serving you? I have never  
asked you for anything.   
The ascetic thought and he looked at her face. He had never seen such a beauty  
 not even in his dream! The woman looked familiar and unfamiliar both. The  
outlines were just the same but now there was a glory in it. The body and the  
features were the same but they were radiant now. She was like the forgotten  
melody, played again on a flute by some musician. The ascetic sat down and  
closed his eyes again. He did not go.   
That night the young woman could not sleep because she felt happy at her  
victory and also repentant for polluting an ascetic. She was happy that she  
had won but felt unhappy for being an obstacle in the path of the ascetic. She  
felt sorry that because of her he could not continue the journey upwards. She  
could not sleep at night. She cried and she laughed. In the morning she took  
the decision. She touched the feet of the ascetic and told him, I have to go.  
My family is going to another village. The ascetic blessed her so that she  
would be happy wherever she lives, and the young woman went away.   
After many years the asceticism was complete. Lord Indra himself came down,  
bowed and said, The doors of heaven are open to welcome you.   
The ascetic opened his eyes and said, I do not want heaven.   
Indra was very surprised. He could not believe that any human being can say  
that he does not want heaven. Then Indra thought that maybe this ascetic has  
the desire of attaining liberation. So he asked, Do you want liberation?   
The ascetic said, What will I do with liberation? Lord Indra was highly  
impressed by this attitude. He thought to himself that this is the height of  
asceticism  even the desire of attaining liberation is not there. So out of  
regard he wanted to bow down in front of that ascetic but before doing so he  
said, But there is nothing beyond liberation. What else do you want?   
The ascetic replied, Nothing except that young maiden who used to collect  
wood in this forest. I want her!

**Questions..   
A man was sitting at the gate of a town, an old man. A rider stopped, a horse  
rider and asked him, What are the people of this town like?   
The old man asked, Why do you ask this?   
The rider said, The people of the town I have come from are very indecent. I  
was upset and disturbed by them. I had to leave that town. Now I want to  
become a resident of some new town. So I am asking you how the people of this  
town are.   
The old man said, Brother, you had better move on. The people of this town  
are even more vile, more wicked, more indecent. Here you will get into  
trouble, go look somewhere else.   
The rider moved on. Just behind him a bullock cart came to a halt and a man  
looked around and said, Grandfather, how are the people of this village? I am  
searching for a new residence.   
The old man asked again, How were the people of the village you have left?   
Tears came to the eyes of that man. He said, I didnt want to leave,  
helplessly I had to leave. The people of that village were very loving. Now  
wherever I live the memory of those people will torment me. I was helpless, I  
was in economic difficulty. I had to leave it so that I can earn something, I  
need to try my luck somewhere else. But I have just one ambition that whenever  
my luck improves, I will return there. I will reside in that village, in the  
end I want to die in that village. If I cannot live there then at least I want  
to die there.   
That old man said, You are welcome. You will find the people of this village  
even more loving than the people of that village.   
A man was sitting there listening to all this. First he heard what the horse  
rider said and the old mans answer. Then he heard what this man on the  
bullock cart said and the old mans answer.   
The man said, _You have really surprised me. You said to one man that this  
village is very vile and wicked, just move on. And to the other you said this  
village has very loving people, you have no need to go further, you are  
welcome! The old man explained, People are just the way you are. Everywhere  
men are the same. The real thing is your question._**

The idea that all forms and all names belong to God is verily Constant  
Integrated Awareness. The experience of sarvam vishnumayam jagat - the world  
is pervaded by Vishnu, is but Constant Integrated Awareness. God can be  
experienced in any form, at any time or place.   
The life of Tulasidas illustrates this beautifully. He could not recognise God  
even when He approached him and talked to him. One day Tulasidas sat under a  
tree, grinding a piece of sandalwood on a mortar to prepare the paste. Right  
then, two cowherd boys came there and asked him, "Grandfather! Will you give  
us some sandal paste?"   
Then, Tulasidas replied, "My children! I am preparing this for Lord Sri  
Ramachandramurthi". Two parrots, perched on a bough of that tree, observed  
this, and commented, "For whose sake is all this paste? Why doesn't he realise  
it?" Tulasidas heard these words. He knew the language of the birds.   
The next day, while he was preparing the paste, the two cowherd boys turned  
up. This time, even without asking him, they took some sandal paste into their  
palms, applied it to the forehead, and left. Tulasidas who had noticed this  
was dumbfounded. This time too he heard the birds? comments from the branch of  
the tree, "Aha! What a wonder! Those for whom the sandal paste was prepared,  
had themselves come, and received it! What fortune!" As he knew the language  
of the birds, Tulasidas realised that the boys who had adorned themselves with  
the paste were, indeed, Rama and Lakshmana. Out of ignorance, he had at first  
denied them.   
You may have heard of Vemana too. He was a thinker who belittled worship  
offered to stones and idols. He used to doubt, "God, who pervades the whole  
world, how can He be inside stone statues?" He used to make fun of idol  
worshippers. One day, his elder brother's daughter, whom he loved dearly,  
passed away.   
Grief stricken, he kept on gazing at the little girl's picture hanging on the  
wall. His elder brother's wife was observing all this. One day, she threw down  
the picture. It broke into pieces. This was too much for Vemana to bear.   
Then, she said, "My son! My girl is no more, isn't she? Why do you cry over a  
broken picture?" Vemana replied, "Mother! Though she is gone, her picture was  
here, wasn't it? Looking at it has been some consolation for me. That is why  
when it broke into pieces, I am grieving ever more." Then his elder brother's  
wife counseled him admirably, "My son! It is very true that God is present  
everywhere. But, the devotee delights in seeing Him and worshipping Him in an  
idol as well. Just as you consoled yourself looking at the picture even though  
she whom you love is no more, the devotee invokes God in an idol, and offers  
it worship."   
Straightaway Vemana grasped her message, and the secret behind idol worship.  
In this way, the experience of visualising the Supreme Lord in all places,  
times, and creatures is truly Constant Integrated Awareness. This can also be  
called the existence and intimation of Divinity.   
as told by Satya Sai Baba

Ganesha went outdoors one day to play and found a stray cat. Too small to know  
better, he began to pull her ears and tail. He roughed up that poor cat and  
even began to beat her with a stick, making marks on her head till, yowling,  
she ran for her life.   
Some hours later Ganesha went into the house. His mother, to his astonishment  
and dismay, was looking terrible. Her hair was a mess, she had scratches on  
her face and she limped from the bruises on her body.   
"Mom!" cried Ganesha. "Who beat you up?"Sadly Sri Durga replied, "It was you,  
I'm afraid."   
"No way! What do you mean? I never did it!"   
"Do you remember, his mother asked, "a while ago, how you treated a certain  
cat?"   
Now Ganesha though that the cat's owner must have come and beat Mother Durga  
on account of him, and he burst into tears. "Where is that man?" he  
sobbed."No, not that. You see, my boy, I am not just your physical mother. I  
have filled the whole universe with My Being.   
As a matter of fact, whatever you do to any least part of it, you do that to  
Me.   
"Some years later the Mother was sitting in her dressing room in a very lofty  
mood. She had recently been meditating and in that mood had become quite  
conscious of her own divinity. Now she put around her neck a lovely necklace  
of gems, a gift from her husband, Shiva. But seeing Ganesha and her other son,  
Kartik, playing nearby, she said to them "Look, I will give this precious  
necklace to whichever of you comes back first, after traveling all around the  
universe. So run this race, but cover every mile of the universe. "Kartik  
immediately dropped what he was doing, went out, and finding the animal he  
most liked to ride upon (which was a magic steed), he set off on the long  
journey. He went as fast as he could, over the earth, out to the moon and  
planets, sailed through the galaxies and visited the asteroids, even peeping  
into a black hole or two. Almost exhausted, he recalled that he had to save  
energy enough to return. When Kartik finally reached home he saw his brother  
was already wearing the necklace of gems! Ganesha, you see, had become much  
wiser now: he had simply gone all the way around his Mother's body and then  
bowed down before Her. He knew full well that apart from Her there was no  
universe.   
(From Puranas)

Final days of Thirunaavukkarasar   
At Kanchipuram, appar visited Ekambam, Mayanam, Merrali and other Siva  
temples. From Kanchi he went to Thiruvorriyur, visiting enroute  
Thirukkalukkunram, Thiruvanmiyur and Mayilappur. From there he went to T  
hiruvalangadu, Karikkarai and Kalahasti. From Kalahasti, he went to Srisailam  
(Sriparvata). Upto the temple of Srisaila Sekkilar gives the name of the  
Sivakshetras.   
But then on Sekkilar gives only the name of the countries Appar passed  
through. After Srisaila, Appar is said to have crossed the borders of the  
Gelungu country and reached the Kannada and from there the Malaya country.  
Then crossing dense forests, he reached he Lata country, crossed several  
hills, forests and rivers and reached ?Madhya paitiram?. Crossing this  
country, he reached the banks of the Ganges and came to Varanasi. Having  
worshipped Siva at Varanasi, he reached ?Karcuram?i.e. the hilly tract.   
Having reached Kailasa mountain, he started climbing the hill by hand. As the  
hands got tired he made use of his chest and crawled. Later he rolled up to  
reach the summit. _After reaching a certain height Appar could not climb  
further._ At that place, a saivaite saint appeared wearing a bark of tree,  
jatamakuta, sacred thread and sacred ashes on his body. There was a lake  
nearby. Appar told the saint that he was going to the summit of Kailasa to  
behold Lord Siva seated with Parvati there.   
_The saint advised Appar to turn back as Kailasa was beyond the reach of even  
Devas, and it was impossible for human beings to reach it._ _Appar stood firm  
and replied that he would not return with his body, without beholding Lord  
Siva on Kailasa._ Thereupon, _the sage, who was none other than Siva, appeared  
before Appar in his true form and blessed him_. Appar prayed that he be given  
the sight of Lord Siva?s appearance on Kailasa. Siva asked Appar to take bath  
in the lake and at Thiruvaiyaru, he would behold the divine appearance. Appar  
bathed in the lake. _When he emerged from the waters of the lake, he found  
himself in a lotus pond at Thiruvaiyaru in Tamilnadu. As he approached the  
temple he found everything in front as Siva and Sakti as if appearing in  
Kailasa._ It was a vision of unsurpassed beauty with Lord Siva and Parvati  
seated, Nandikesvara standing in attendance, the mount Bull seated in front,  
and surrounded by ganas. Appar sang the hymn ?Matar pirai Kanniyanai?. He  
stayed for some time at Thiruvaiyaru and later visited Thirumalapadi, Neytanam  
and Punturutti. At Punturutti he established a matha.

**Papa Ramdas meets Swami Kaivalyananda, M.A.**   
Another day a sepoy of Raja Ram, a kind friend, took him out for a stroll. He  
asked the friend to lead him to a solitary place, away from the haunts of men.  
But being of an officious nature, the sepoy escorted him to a distant cave  
occupied by a sannyasi. In the midst of a jungle he found himself in front of  
a large wide open rock-cut cave. In it was seated a young sannyasi, clad in  
ochre coloured cloth, clean shaven, with a number of books scattered beside  
him.   
The kind friend whispered into Ramdas ears: "This is Swami Kaivalyanand."   
Ramdas went up to the sannyasi and prostrated before him.   
With a look of surprise he asked: "To whom are you offering this salutation?"   
"To Ram," Ramdas replied.   
"Who are you?"   
"Ramdas."   
"Ramdas, Ramdas, funny ain't it? There is only one Truth. Why do you assume  
this false duality?"   
"It is Ram himself, being One, has chosen to be many."   
"Wrong, He is always one; many is false, is illusion," he said.   
"Truth has become God and His devotee for the sake of lila or play."   
"Why play?" he asked.   
"For love and bliss; so, when Ramdas prostrates before you, it is yourself who  
do it in the form of Ramdas," Ramdas rejoined.   
"Bosh, there is only one, never two.?   
"To whom are you talking then, Swamiji?"   
He reflected for a while and replied, "To myself."   
"Exactly - you assume there are two, although in the light of absolute Truth  
there is only one."   
"No, no - no realised man believes in duality."   
"What of Tulsidas, Surdas, Kabir, Samarth Ramdas and many others?"   
"Oh!" he laughed, they had not attained jnana. They were struggling still on a  
lower plane!"   
"But their teachings and works show that they possessed high illumination.  
They held out parabhakti as the highest realisation," Ramdas rejoined.   
"I maintain they were ignorant folk,?"and, taking a book from the pile near  
him, he added, "brush them all aside, here, take this book and read; you will  
understand things more clearly."   
"Ramdas does not need to understand. Knowledge has been defined to him as that  
state in which you know that you know nothing."   
"Well, well, I say read this work; it is written by me."   
He pressed Ramdas hard to accept it. A glance at the book revealed its title  
and its author: 'Will to Satchidanand by Swami Kaivalyananda,M.A.'   
Ramdas took leave of him after his usual way of a parting dandawat at his  
feet. He carried the book with him.

Friends, i share a beautiful story: One day, Ubhayabharathi was going along with her disciples to the river Ganga  
for taking bath. On the way, she observed a Sanyasi who was relaxing with a  
dried bottle gourd under his head. He was using this as a container for  
storing drinking water, and hence he was mindful of it. Ubhayabharathi saw  
this Sanyasi?s attachment to the bottle gourd and said to her disciples,  
?Look! This man calls himself a Sanyasi, but he is attached to a bottle gourd  
which he is keeping under his head as a pillow.? The Sanyasi heard this  
comment, but did not utter anything then. While Ubhayabharathi and her  
disciples were returning from the river, he threw away the bottle gourd in  
front of them in order to demonstrate that he was not attached to it.  
Observing his action, Ubhayabharathi remarked, ?I thought there was only one  
defect in him, namely, Abhimana (attachment). Now I realise that he has  
another defect also, i.e., Ahamkara (ego). How can one with Abhimana and  
Ahamkara become a Jnani and Sanyasi?? Her comment was an eye-opener to the  
Sanyasi. He expressed gratitude to Ubhayabharati for imparting true knowledge  
of renunciation to him. Ubhayabharathi then explained to him further, ?The  
whole world is illusory. There are several objects in this world which are  
attracting man. But, they are not outside. They are all the reflection of  
one?s inner thoughts. They are created by man himself. You develop attachment  
to the physical body. Later on, you yourself will discard the body. You are  
the one who develops attachment to the body and you are again the one who will  
discard the body. Developing attachment to the body or discarding it - both  
are the result of your delusion. You are developing Dehabhranti. Hence,  
discard Dehabranti and develop Daivabhimana (attachment to Divinity). The body  
is a temple of God. Consider the Indweller in the body as Devadeva (the  
supreme Lord).

**_ Learning Humility from Bayazid al-Bistami   
There was a certain ascetic who was one of the great saints of Bestam. He had  
his own followers and admirers, and at the same time he was never absent from  
the circle of Bayazid al-Bistami (or Abu Yazid al-Bistami). He listened to all  
his discourses, and sat with his companions.   
One day he remarked to Abu Yazid, "Master, for thirty years I have been  
keeping a constant fast. By night too I pray, so that I never sleep at all.  
Yet I discover no trace of this knowledge of which you speak. For all that I  
believe in this knowledge, and I love this preaching."   
"If for three hundred years," said Abu Yazid, "you fast by day and pray by  
night, you will never realize one atom of this discourse."   
"Why?" asked the disciple.   
"Because you are veiled by your own self," Abu Yazid replied.   
"What is the remedy for this?" the man asked.   
"You will never accept it," answered Abu Yazid.   
"I will so," said the man. "Tell me, so that I may do as you prescribe."   
"Very well," said Abu Yazid. "This very hour go and shave your beard and hair.  
Take off these clothes you are wearing, and tie a loincloth of goat's wool  
about your waist. Hang a bag of nuts around your neck, then go to the  
marketplace. Collect all the children you can, and tell them, 'I will give a  
nut to everyone who slaps me.' Go round all the city in the same way;  
especially go everywhere people know you. That is your cure."   
"Glory be to God! There is no god but God," cried the disciple on hearing  
these words.   
"If a nonbeliever uttered that formula, he would become a believer," remarked  
Abu Yazid. "By uttering the same formula you have become a unbeliever."   
"How so?" demanded the disciple.   
"Because you count yourself too grand to be able to do as I have said,"  
replied Abu Yazid. "So you have become a unbeliever. You used this formula to  
express your own importance, not to glorify God."   
"This I cannot do," the man protested. "Give me other directions."   
"The remedy is what I have said," Abu Yazid declared.   
"I cannot do it," the man repeated.   
"Did I not say you would not do it, that you would never obey me?" said Abu  
Yazid.

In Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam, there is a story where Siva came as a bangle  
seller, and touched Meenashi's   
wrists to fix bangles on her hands. She, by the mere touch of Siva, knew that  
the bangle seller is Siva.   
This story is called Chetty Valaiyal Vitra Padalam, the story of Chetty  
(trader) selling bangles. This   
is one of the 64 holy sports of Siva in the Puranam.   
Regarding Valaiyapathi, this is one of the 5 great epics (Kaappiyam) of Tamil,  
dating from 3rd C. AD to   
7th C. AD. Of the five great epics only two are available, viz.,  
Silappadikaram, the story of Kannagi and Manimekalai, the story of Madhavi's  
(the woman of Kovalan) daughter, who embraced Buddhism.   
The Valaiyapati epic is not available. There are some stories and that is  
all. So also, Jeevaka Chintamani,   
and Kundalakesi.   
These two are also not available excepting some stories.

Verse 1 of Manisha Panchakam: Annamayadhannamayam athava,   
Chaitanyamena Chaitanyath,   
Dwijavara dhurikathum vaanchasi,   
Kim bruhi gaccha gacchati.   
O the best among Brahmins. This body is formed from food that is making up  
another body. So also Chaitanyam (Consciousness) comes from Chaitanyam. Now  
you are asking 'Go away, go away to a far off place!' Tell me   
which one should away to a far off place, from which?   
The Chandala asks Sri Sankara, whether the body made up   
of food should go farther away from another body made up   
of food, or whether the Chaitanyam, which is all pervading,   
should go away farther from another Chaitanyam?   
Consciousness or Chitanyam, is one without a second. It is all   
pervading, occupying everything in this universe. There is nothing   
other than Consciousness. There is no Space where there is   
no prevalence of Consciousness. Srimad Bhagavatam says   
that Narayana is there even in a straw as well as in big pillar.   
Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram says that only Sivam is there in   
all eight forms of five elements, sun, moon, and the jivas.   
Where can It go at all? Where is the space for It go away?   
This is the lightning like question of Chandala which struck   
Sri Sanakara.   
In the Old Hall, many devotees would ask Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether the Heart is within the body?" This is because   
Bhagavan Ramana had said that for meditators the Heart should   
be meditated upon, and this is in right side of the chest. But   
this limited description is only for the seekers and meditators.   
Once the Self is realized, the Heart contains all. The body   
is also in Heart. The Self, the Heart, is everywhere in all   
things and in all beings. When Bhagavan Ramana replied: "No, the body is in Heart" the seekers should further probe   
into the truth of His statement. Since Chaitanyam is everywhere,   
the bodies which are temporary cannot be a point of reference   
either to come near or go far. The bodies are made up of   
five elemeents. Since the five elements are also in the Consciousess, all  
bodies are in Consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 2 of Manisha Panchakam: Kim gangambuni bhimbithe ambaramanou chaandaalavatipaya,   
Bhure chandaramsthi kanchanagati mrutumbhayorvambare,   
Pratyagvasthuni nistharange sahajanandarapodham buthou,   
Viproayam chvapachoyamitrapi mahaan koyam vibhetaprama.   
The Sun reflects on the Ganga waters and also in the gutters   
of a Chandaala. (Is there any difference?). The Space is within   
the golden pot and outside and so also is within the mudpot   
and the outside. (Is there any difference?). The Atma which   
is waveless and limitless ocean of Ananda, is ever the same!   
What is this delusion that makes you feel that difference in   
a brahmin's body and the dog eating body of Chandala?   
Sri Sankara calls the Atma as Pratyakvasthu. This is   
experienced as "I AM". This feeling of am-ness, I AM, is   
common to all living beings, as the Sun without differentiation   
reflects in the Ganga waters as well as in the gutter waters   
near the Chandala's house. The Space is again without any   
differentiation is within and outside of both golden pot and   
mud-pot.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say that I AM feeling and "I"-ness   
is more sublime than even Om. It is the feeling not connected   
with one's body or one's mind. If a leg is amputated, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man becomes blind, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man is sleeping, his I am feeling is no way  
absent.   
This Pratyakvastu is eternal, without change, all pervading but not  
specifically in one place or another.   
Arunachala Siva.

There was in lndia a king called Shikhardhwaj. He was a great king and mighty  
monarch. He wanted to realize his God-consciousness; and in order to do that  
he thought that he ought to give up his family life.   
His wife was Chudala. She wanted to teach him, but he would not listen to her,  
for he thought nothing of her.   
He renounced everything, gave up his kingdom, and his wife became the ruler.  
He then went to the Himalayas, and there he lived about a year or so.   
In the meantime the empress, his wife thought of a plan to bring him real  
happiness. So one day she put on the garb of a Sannyasin, and walked upto the  
cottage where her husband then was. She found him lost in a state of  
meditation; she remained standing beside him and when he came to his senses he  
was filled with joy. Thinking her a great Sannyasin, he showered flowers on  
her.   
She was in a blissful mood. He exclaimed, ?I think God has incarnated in you  
to lift me up." She replied, "Yes, yes.? He Wanted her to teach him and she  
did so. She said, ?0 king, it you want to enjoy perfect bliss. you will have  
to renounce everything.? He was surprised and replied, "l have renounced my  
empire, my wife, my children." She said. ?You have renounced nothing."   
He could not understand and asked ?Am i not a man of renunciation, have I not  
given up my empire, my family?" She answered, "No, no, do you not possess  
something still?" "Yes" he replied, ?l possess this cottage, this staff and  
this water-vessel." "Then you are not a man of renunciation," she replied ?So  
long as you possess anything, you are possessed by that thing. Action and  
reaction being opposites, you cannot possess anything without its possessing  
you." He then burnt the cottage, threw his staff into the river, burnt his  
water-vessel, and exclaimed, "Now, am I not a man of renunciation?" She  
replied, " Renunciation cannot come from renouncing these objects.? She said,  
"O king, you have burnt the cottage, but do you not still possess three cubits  
and a half of clay? It was wrong for you to destroy those things, you have  
gained nothing by it. What you possessed then you still possess, namely, that  
three cubits and a half of clay, where you lie down." He began to think and  
determined to burn the body. He piled up wood and made a great fire and was  
about to jump into it, but the wife prevented him and exclaimed, "0 king, when  
your body is burnt. what will be left?" He replied, "Ashes will be left."  
"Whose ashes?" she asked. He replied, "My ashes.? Then she replied. "You must  
still possess ashes. By burning the body you have not attained renunciation."  
He began to think and exclaimed. ?How can i renounce, what shall I renounce?"   
She asked, "Whose body is this?" He answered. ?My body.? ?Well renounce it.?  
?Whose mind is this?" He answered. ?My mind". ?Then renounce it." The king was  
then made to ask questions. He said, ?Who am i then? if i am not the mind. i  
am something else. and it I am not the body, I must be something ditterent" He  
reflected and the conclusion was that the king realuzed "I am the God at gods,  
the Lord of lords. the lnfinite Being, the Supreme Excellence.? He realized  
that and sald that this Supreme Excellence cannot be renounced, though other  
things may he.

Once a disciple saw at a distance of about a hundred feet a young couple under  
a tree. Probably, they were on their honeymoon trip just after the marriage  
and they were lost in their own world. The Guru asked the disciple,   
'What do you feel on seeing them.'   
It was a very unexpected situation for the disciple and he blurted out,   
'Guru, I feel disgusted!'   
'Can you not see a spiritual symbolism in that scene?'   
'Can you not see Radha and Krishna in them? Do they not symbolise Prakriti and  
Purusha?'   
The disciple could just bend his head in silence with a heart of  
understanding.   
Then the Guru said to the disciple: "the ultimate goal of spiritual path is to  
experience God in every being and every atom of the universe. That is what is  
meant by "sarvam Khalu Idam Brahma", "Vasudevah Sarvamidam", "Vishwam Vishnu  
Swaroopam".

It is said in one of the Hindu scriptures that Sri Rama Chandra,  
the greatest hero of the world, or at least of India, when he went  
to search out Truth, to discover or regain Truth, all nature offered  
him her services. It is said that monkeys formed his army, and  
squirrels helped him building a bridge over the gulf. It is said  
that even geese came up on his side to assist him in overcoming  
his foes. It is said that the stones offered him their services. The  
stones forgot their nature; the stones, when thrown into water,  
instead of sinking, said, "We shall float in order that the cause  
of Truth be advanced." It is said that air, the atmosphere, was on  
his side, fire helped him, winds and storms were on his side. There  
is a saying in the English language that the wind and wave are  
always for the brave.   
All Nature stands up on your side when you persist, when you  
overcome the primitive seeming difficulties. If you overcome the  
struggles or temptations in the beginning, the whole of Nature must  
serve you. Persist in standing by the Truth, and you will find that  
you live in no ordinary world. The world will be a world of  
miracles for you. You will be the master of the Universe, the  
husband of the whole world, if you persist by the Truth. MORAL: The whole  
Nature is bound to co-operate with and serve one -who stands by Truth.   
Swami Rama Tirtha

A PURANIC STORY of Sage Ribhu and his disciple Nidagha, is particularly  
instructive.   
Although Ribhu taught his disciple the Supreme Truth of the One Brahman  
without a second, Nidagha, in spite of his erudition and understanding, did  
not get sufficient conviction to adopt and follow the path ofjnana, but  
settled down in his native town to lead a life devoted to the observance of  
ceremonial religion.   
But the sage loved his disciple as deeply as the latter venerated his Master.  
In spite of his age, Ribhu would himself go to his disciple in the town, just  
to see how far the latter had outgrown his ritualism. At times the sage went  
in disguise, so that he might observe how Nidagha would act when he did not  
know that he was being observed by his master.   
On one such occasion Ribhu, who had put on the disguise of a rustic, found  
Nidagha intently watching a royal procession.   
Unrecognised by the town-dweller Nidagha, the village rustic enquired what the  
bustle was all about, and was told that the king was going in procession.   
?Oh! It is the king. He goes in procession! But where is he?? asked the  
rustic.   
?There, on the elephant,? said Nidagha.   
?You say the king is on the elephant. Yes, I see the two,? said the rustic,  
?But which is the king and which is the elephant?? ?What!? exclaimed Nidagha.  
?You see the two, but do not know that the man above is the king and the  
animal below is the elephant? What is the use of talking to a man like you??  
?Pray, be not impatient with an ignorant man like me,? begged the rustic. ?But  
you said ?above? and ?below? - what do they mean??   
Nidagha could stand it no more. ?You see the king and the elephant, the one  
a^bove and the other below. Yet you want to know what is meant by ?above? and  
?below??? burst out Nidagha. ?Ifthings seen and words spoken can convey so  
little to you, action alone can teach you. Bend forward, and you will know it  
all too well?.   
The rustic did as he was told. Nidagha got on his shoulders and said, ?Know it  
now. I amabove as the king, you are below as the elephant. Is that clear  
enough??   
?No, not yet,? was the rustic?s quiet reply. ?You say you are above like the  
king, and I am below like the elephant. The ?king?, the ?elephant?, ?above?  
and ?below? - so far it is clear. But pray, tell me what you mean by ?I?and  
'you?'?   
When Nidagha was thus confronted all of a sudden with the mighty problem of  
defining the ?you? apart from the ?I?, light dawned on his mind. At once he  
jumped down and fell at his Master?s feet saying, ?Who else but my venerable  
Master, Ribhu, could have thus drawn my mind from the superficialities of  
physical existence to the true Being of the Self? Oh! Benign Master, I crave  
thy blessings.?   
~ Ribhu Gita, as told by Bhagawan

The idea that all forms and all names belong to God is verily Constant  
Integrated Awareness. The experience of sarvam vishnumayam jagat - the world  
is pervaded by Vishnu, is but Constant Integrated Awareness. God can be  
experienced in any form, at any time or place.   
The life of Tulasidas illustrates this beautifully. He could not recognise God  
even when He approached him and talked to him. One day Tulasidas sat under a  
tree, grinding a piece of sandalwood on a mortar to prepare the paste. Right  
then, two cowherd boys came there and asked him, "Grandfather! Will you give  
us some sandal paste?"   
Then, Tulasidas replied, "My children! I am preparing this for Lord Sri  
Ramachandramurthi". Two parrots, perched on a bough of that tree, observed  
this, and commented, "For whose sake is all this paste? Why doesn't he realise  
it?" Tulasidas heard these words. He knew the language of the birds.   
The next day, while he was preparing the paste, the two cowherd boys turned  
up. This time, even without asking him, they took some sandal paste into their  
palms, applied it to the forehead, and left. Tulasidas who had noticed this  
was dumbfounded. This time too he heard the birds? comments from the branch of  
the tree, "Aha! What a wonder! Those for whom the sandal paste was prepared,  
had themselves come, and received it! What fortune!" As he knew the language  
of the birds, Tulasidas realised that the boys who had adorned themselves with  
the paste were, indeed, Rama and Lakshmana. Out of ignorance, he had at first  
denied them.   
You may have heard of Vemana too. He was a thinker who belittled worship  
offered to stones and idols. He used to doubt, "God, who pervades the whole  
world, how can He be inside stone statues?" He used to make fun of idol  
worshippers. One day, his elder brother's daughter, whom he loved dearly,  
passed away.   
Grief stricken, he kept on gazing at the little girl's picture hanging on the  
wall. His elder brother's wife was observing all this. One day, she threw down  
the picture. It broke into pieces. This was too much for Vemana to bear.   
Then, she said, "My son! My girl is no more, isn't she? Why do you cry over a  
broken picture?" Vemana replied, "Mother! Though she is gone, her picture was  
here, wasn't it? Looking at it has been some consolation for me. That is why  
when it broke into pieces, I am grieving ever more." Then his elder brother's  
wife counseled him admirably, "My son! It is very true that God is present  
everywhere. But, the devotee delights in seeing Him and worshipping Him in an  
idol as well. Just as you consoled yourself looking at the picture even though  
she whom you love is no more, the devotee invokes God in an idol, and offers  
it worship."   
Straightaway Vemana grasped her message, and the secret behind idol worship.  
In this way, the experience of visualising the Supreme Lord in all places,  
times, and creatures is truly Constant Integrated Awareness. This can also be  
called the existence and intimation of Divinity.   
as told by Satya Sai Baba

Ganesha went outdoors one day to play and found a stray cat. Too small to know  
better, he began to pull her ears and tail. He roughed up that poor cat and  
even began to beat her with a stick, making marks on her head till, yowling,  
she ran for her life.   
Some hours later Ganesha went into the house. His mother, to his astonishment  
and dismay, was looking terrible. Her hair was a mess, she had scratches on  
her face and she limped from the bruises on her body.   
"Mom!" cried Ganesha. "Who beat you up?"Sadly Sri Durga replied, "It was you,  
I'm afraid."   
"No way! What do you mean? I never did it!"   
"Do you remember, his mother asked, "a while ago, how you treated a certain  
cat?"   
Now Ganesha though that the cat's owner must have come and beat Mother Durga  
on account of him, and he burst into tears. "Where is that man?" he  
sobbed."No, not that. You see, my boy, I am not just your physical mother. I  
have filled the whole universe with My Being.   
As a matter of fact, whatever you do to any least part of it, you do that to  
Me.   
"Some years later the Mother was sitting in her dressing room in a very lofty  
mood. She had recently been meditating and in that mood had become quite  
conscious of her own divinity. Now she put around her neck a lovely necklace  
of gems, a gift from her husband, Shiva. But seeing Ganesha and her other son,  
Kartik, playing nearby, she said to them "Look, I will give this precious  
necklace to whichever of you comes back first, after traveling all around the  
universe. So run this race, but cover every mile of the universe. "Kartik  
immediately dropped what he was doing, went out, and finding the animal he  
most liked to ride upon (which was a magic steed), he set off on the long  
journey. He went as fast as he could, over the earth, out to the moon and  
planets, sailed through the galaxies and visited the asteroids, even peeping  
into a black hole or two. Almost exhausted, he recalled that he had to save  
energy enough to return. When Kartik finally reached home he saw his brother  
was already wearing the necklace of gems! Ganesha, you see, had become much  
wiser now: he had simply gone all the way around his Mother's body and then  
bowed down before Her. He knew full well that apart from Her there was no  
universe.   
(From Puranas)

Final days of Thirunaavukkarasar   
At Kanchipuram, appar visited Ekambam, Mayanam, Merrali and other Siva  
temples. From Kanchi he went to Thiruvorriyur, visiting enroute  
Thirukkalukkunram, Thiruvanmiyur and Mayilappur. From there he went to T  
hiruvalangadu, Karikkarai and Kalahasti. From Kalahasti, he went to Srisailam  
(Sriparvata). Upto the temple of Srisaila Sekkilar gives the name of the  
Sivakshetras.   
But then on Sekkilar gives only the name of the countries Appar passed  
through. After Srisaila, Appar is said to have crossed the borders of the  
Gelungu country and reached the Kannada and from there the Malaya country.  
Then crossing dense forests, he reached he Lata country, crossed several  
hills, forests and rivers and reached ?Madhya paitiram?. Crossing this  
country, he reached the banks of the Ganges and came to Varanasi. Having  
worshipped Siva at Varanasi, he reached ?Karcuram?i.e. the hilly tract.   
Having reached Kailasa mountain, he started climbing the hill by hand. As the  
hands got tired he made use of his chest and crawled. Later he rolled up to  
reach the summit. _After reaching a certain height Appar could not climb  
further._ At that place, a saivaite saint appeared wearing a bark of tree,  
jatamakuta, sacred thread and sacred ashes on his body. There was a lake  
nearby. Appar told the saint that he was going to the summit of Kailasa to  
behold Lord Siva seated with Parvati there.   
_The saint advised Appar to turn back as Kailasa was beyond the reach of even  
Devas, and it was impossible for human beings to reach it._ _Appar stood firm  
and replied that he would not return with his body, without beholding Lord  
Siva on Kailasa._ Thereupon, _the sage, who was none other than Siva, appeared  
before Appar in his true form and blessed him_. Appar prayed that he be given  
the sight of Lord Siva?s appearance on Kailasa. Siva asked Appar to take bath  
in the lake and at Thiruvaiyaru, he would behold the divine appearance. Appar  
bathed in the lake. _When he emerged from the waters of the lake, he found  
himself in a lotus pond at Thiruvaiyaru in Tamilnadu. As he approached the  
temple he found everything in front as Siva and Sakti as if appearing in  
Kailasa._ It was a vision of unsurpassed beauty with Lord Siva and Parvati  
seated, Nandikesvara standing in attendance, the mount Bull seated in front,  
and surrounded by ganas. Appar sang the hymn ?Matar pirai Kanniyanai?. He  
stayed for some time at Thiruvaiyaru and later visited Thirumalapadi, Neytanam  
and Punturutti. At Punturutti he established a matha.

**Papa Ramdas meets Swami Kaivalyananda, M.A.**   
Another day a sepoy of Raja Ram, a kind friend, took him out for a stroll. He  
asked the friend to lead him to a solitary place, away from the haunts of men.  
But being of an officious nature, the sepoy escorted him to a distant cave  
occupied by a sannyasi. In the midst of a jungle he found himself in front of  
a large wide open rock-cut cave. In it was seated a young sannyasi, clad in  
ochre coloured cloth, clean shaven, with a number of books scattered beside  
him.   
The kind friend whispered into Ramdas ears: "This is Swami Kaivalyanand."   
Ramdas went up to the sannyasi and prostrated before him.   
With a look of surprise he asked: "To whom are you offering this salutation?"   
"To Ram," Ramdas replied.   
"Who are you?"   
"Ramdas."   
"Ramdas, Ramdas, funny ain't it? There is only one Truth. Why do you assume  
this false duality?"   
"It is Ram himself, being One, has chosen to be many."   
"Wrong, He is always one; many is false, is illusion," he said.   
"Truth has become God and His devotee for the sake of lila or play."   
"Why play?" he asked.   
"For love and bliss; so, when Ramdas prostrates before you, it is yourself who  
do it in the form of Ramdas," Ramdas rejoined.   
"Bosh, there is only one, never two.?   
"To whom are you talking then, Swamiji?"   
He reflected for a while and replied, "To myself."   
"Exactly - you assume there are two, although in the light of absolute Truth  
there is only one."   
"No, no - no realised man believes in duality."   
"What of Tulsidas, Surdas, Kabir, Samarth Ramdas and many others?"   
"Oh!" he laughed, they had not attained jnana. They were struggling still on a  
lower plane!"   
"But their teachings and works show that they possessed high illumination.  
They held out parabhakti as the highest realisation," Ramdas rejoined.   
"I maintain they were ignorant folk,?"and, taking a book from the pile near  
him, he added, "brush them all aside, here, take this book and read; you will  
understand things more clearly."   
"Ramdas does not need to understand. Knowledge has been defined to him as that  
state in which you know that you know nothing."   
"Well, well, I say read this work; it is written by me."   
He pressed Ramdas hard to accept it. A glance at the book revealed its title  
and its author: 'Will to Satchidanand by Swami Kaivalyananda,M.A.'   
Ramdas took leave of him after his usual way of a parting dandawat at his  
feet. He carried the book with him.

Friends, i share a beautiful story: One day, Ubhayabharathi was going along with her disciples to the river Ganga  
for taking bath. On the way, she observed a Sanyasi who was relaxing with a  
dried bottle gourd under his head. He was using this as a container for  
storing drinking water, and hence he was mindful of it. Ubhayabharathi saw  
this Sanyasi?s attachment to the bottle gourd and said to her disciples,  
?Look! This man calls himself a Sanyasi, but he is attached to a bottle gourd  
which he is keeping under his head as a pillow.? The Sanyasi heard this  
comment, but did not utter anything then. While Ubhayabharathi and her  
disciples were returning from the river, he threw away the bottle gourd in  
front of them in order to demonstrate that he was not attached to it.  
Observing his action, Ubhayabharathi remarked, ?I thought there was only one  
defect in him, namely, Abhimana (attachment). Now I realise that he has  
another defect also, i.e., Ahamkara (ego). How can one with Abhimana and  
Ahamkara become a Jnani and Sanyasi?? Her comment was an eye-opener to the  
Sanyasi. He expressed gratitude to Ubhayabharati for imparting true knowledge  
of renunciation to him. Ubhayabharathi then explained to him further, ?The  
whole world is illusory. There are several objects in this world which are  
attracting man. But, they are not outside. They are all the reflection of  
one?s inner thoughts. They are created by man himself. You develop attachment  
to the physical body. Later on, you yourself will discard the body. You are  
the one who develops attachment to the body and you are again the one who will  
discard the body. Developing attachment to the body or discarding it - both  
are the result of your delusion. You are developing Dehabhranti. Hence,  
discard Dehabranti and develop Daivabhimana (attachment to Divinity). The body  
is a temple of God. Consider the Indweller in the body as Devadeva (the  
supreme Lord).

**_ Learning Humility from Bayazid al-Bistami   
There was a certain ascetic who was one of the great saints of Bestam. He had  
his own followers and admirers, and at the same time he was never absent from  
the circle of Bayazid al-Bistami (or Abu Yazid al-Bistami). He listened to all  
his discourses, and sat with his companions.   
One day he remarked to Abu Yazid, "Master, for thirty years I have been  
keeping a constant fast. By night too I pray, so that I never sleep at all.  
Yet I discover no trace of this knowledge of which you speak. For all that I  
believe in this knowledge, and I love this preaching."   
"If for three hundred years," said Abu Yazid, "you fast by day and pray by  
night, you will never realize one atom of this discourse."   
"Why?" asked the disciple.   
"Because you are veiled by your own self," Abu Yazid replied.   
"What is the remedy for this?" the man asked.   
"You will never accept it," answered Abu Yazid.   
"I will so," said the man. "Tell me, so that I may do as you prescribe."   
"Very well," said Abu Yazid. "This very hour go and shave your beard and hair.  
Take off these clothes you are wearing, and tie a loincloth of goat's wool  
about your waist. Hang a bag of nuts around your neck, then go to the  
marketplace. Collect all the children you can, and tell them, 'I will give a  
nut to everyone who slaps me.' Go round all the city in the same way;  
especially go everywhere people know you. That is your cure."   
"Glory be to God! There is no god but God," cried the disciple on hearing  
these words.   
"If a nonbeliever uttered that formula, he would become a believer," remarked  
Abu Yazid. "By uttering the same formula you have become a unbeliever."   
"How so?" demanded the disciple.   
"Because you count yourself too grand to be able to do as I have said,"  
replied Abu Yazid. "So you have become a unbeliever. You used this formula to  
express your own importance, not to glorify God."   
"This I cannot do," the man protested. "Give me other directions."   
"The remedy is what I have said," Abu Yazid declared.   
"I cannot do it," the man repeated.   
"Did I not say you would not do it, that you would never obey me?" said Abu  
Yazid.

In Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam, there is a story where Siva came as a bangle  
seller, and touched Meenashi's   
wrists to fix bangles on her hands. She, by the mere touch of Siva, knew that  
the bangle seller is Siva.   
This story is called Chetty Valaiyal Vitra Padalam, the story of Chetty  
(trader) selling bangles. This   
is one of the 64 holy sports of Siva in the Puranam.   
Regarding Valaiyapathi, this is one of the 5 great epics (Kaappiyam) of Tamil,  
dating from 3rd C. AD to   
7th C. AD. Of the five great epics only two are available, viz.,  
Silappadikaram, the story of Kannagi and Manimekalai, the story of Madhavi's  
(the woman of Kovalan) daughter, who embraced Buddhism.   
The Valaiyapati epic is not available. There are some stories and that is  
all. So also, Jeevaka Chintamani,   
and Kundalakesi.   
These two are also not available excepting some stories.

Verse 1 of Manisha Panchakam: Annamayadhannamayam athava,   
Chaitanyamena Chaitanyath,   
Dwijavara dhurikathum vaanchasi,   
Kim bruhi gaccha gacchati.   
O the best among Brahmins. This body is formed from food that is making up  
another body. So also Chaitanyam (Consciousness) comes from Chaitanyam. Now  
you are asking 'Go away, go away to a far off place!' Tell me   
which one should away to a far off place, from which?   
The Chandala asks Sri Sankara, whether the body made up   
of food should go farther away from another body made up   
of food, or whether the Chaitanyam, which is all pervading,   
should go away farther from another Chaitanyam?   
Consciousness or Chitanyam, is one without a second. It is all   
pervading, occupying everything in this universe. There is nothing   
other than Consciousness. There is no Space where there is   
no prevalence of Consciousness. Srimad Bhagavatam says   
that Narayana is there even in a straw as well as in big pillar.   
Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram says that only Sivam is there in   
all eight forms of five elements, sun, moon, and the jivas.   
Where can It go at all? Where is the space for It go away?   
This is the lightning like question of Chandala which struck   
Sri Sanakara.   
In the Old Hall, many devotees would ask Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether the Heart is within the body?" This is because   
Bhagavan Ramana had said that for meditators the Heart should   
be meditated upon, and this is in right side of the chest. But   
this limited description is only for the seekers and meditators.   
Once the Self is realized, the Heart contains all. The body   
is also in Heart. The Self, the Heart, is everywhere in all   
things and in all beings. When Bhagavan Ramana replied: "No, the body is in Heart" the seekers should further probe   
into the truth of His statement. Since Chaitanyam is everywhere,   
the bodies which are temporary cannot be a point of reference   
either to come near or go far. The bodies are made up of   
five elemeents. Since the five elements are also in the Consciousess, all  
bodies are in Consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 2 of Manisha Panchakam: Kim gangambuni bhimbithe ambaramanou chaandaalavatipaya,   
Bhure chandaramsthi kanchanagati mrutumbhayorvambare,   
Pratyagvasthuni nistharange sahajanandarapodham buthou,   
Viproayam chvapachoyamitrapi mahaan koyam vibhetaprama.   
The Sun reflects on the Ganga waters and also in the gutters   
of a Chandaala. (Is there any difference?). The Space is within   
the golden pot and outside and so also is within the mudpot   
and the outside. (Is there any difference?). The Atma which   
is waveless and limitless ocean of Ananda, is ever the same!   
What is this delusion that makes you feel that difference in   
a brahmin's body and the dog eating body of Chandala?   
Sri Sankara calls the Atma as Pratyakvasthu. This is   
experienced as "I AM". This feeling of am-ness, I AM, is   
common to all living beings, as the Sun without differentiation   
reflects in the Ganga waters as well as in the gutter waters   
near the Chandala's house. The Space is again without any   
differentiation is within and outside of both golden pot and   
mud-pot.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say that I AM feeling and "I"-ness   
is more sublime than even Om. It is the feeling not connected   
with one's body or one's mind. If a leg is amputated, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man becomes blind, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man is sleeping, his I am feeling is no way  
absent.   
This Pratyakvastu is eternal, without change, all pervading but not  
specifically in one place or another.   
Arunachala Siva.

There was in lndia a king called Shikhardhwaj. He was a great king and mighty  
monarch. He wanted to realize his God-consciousness; and in order to do that  
he thought that he ought to give up his family life.   
His wife was Chudala. She wanted to teach him, but he would not listen to her,  
for he thought nothing of her.   
He renounced everything, gave up his kingdom, and his wife became the ruler.  
He then went to the Himalayas, and there he lived about a year or so.   
In the meantime the empress, his wife thought of a plan to bring him real  
happiness. So one day she put on the garb of a Sannyasin, and walked upto the  
cottage where her husband then was. She found him lost in a state of  
meditation; she remained standing beside him and when he came to his senses he  
was filled with joy. Thinking her a great Sannyasin, he showered flowers on  
her.   
She was in a blissful mood. He exclaimed, ?I think God has incarnated in you  
to lift me up." She replied, "Yes, yes.? He Wanted her to teach him and she  
did so. She said, ?0 king, it you want to enjoy perfect bliss. you will have  
to renounce everything.? He was surprised and replied, "l have renounced my  
empire, my wife, my children." She said. ?You have renounced nothing."   
He could not understand and asked ?Am i not a man of renunciation, have I not  
given up my empire, my family?" She answered, "No, no, do you not possess  
something still?" "Yes" he replied, ?l possess this cottage, this staff and  
this water-vessel." "Then you are not a man of renunciation," she replied ?So  
long as you possess anything, you are possessed by that thing. Action and  
reaction being opposites, you cannot possess anything without its possessing  
you." He then burnt the cottage, threw his staff into the river, burnt his  
water-vessel, and exclaimed, "Now, am I not a man of renunciation?" She  
replied, " Renunciation cannot come from renouncing these objects.? She said,  
"O king, you have burnt the cottage, but do you not still possess three cubits  
and a half of clay? It was wrong for you to destroy those things, you have  
gained nothing by it. What you possessed then you still possess, namely, that  
three cubits and a half of clay, where you lie down." He began to think and  
determined to burn the body. He piled up wood and made a great fire and was  
about to jump into it, but the wife prevented him and exclaimed, "0 king, when  
your body is burnt. what will be left?" He replied, "Ashes will be left."  
"Whose ashes?" she asked. He replied, "My ashes.? Then she replied. "You must  
still possess ashes. By burning the body you have not attained renunciation."  
He began to think and exclaimed. ?How can i renounce, what shall I renounce?"   
She asked, "Whose body is this?" He answered. ?My body.? ?Well renounce it.?  
?Whose mind is this?" He answered. ?My mind". ?Then renounce it." The king was  
then made to ask questions. He said, ?Who am i then? if i am not the mind. i  
am something else. and it I am not the body, I must be something ditterent" He  
reflected and the conclusion was that the king realuzed "I am the God at gods,  
the Lord of lords. the lnfinite Being, the Supreme Excellence.? He realized  
that and sald that this Supreme Excellence cannot be renounced, though other  
things may he.

Once a disciple saw at a distance of about a hundred feet a young couple under  
a tree. Probably, they were on their honeymoon trip just after the marriage  
and they were lost in their own world. The Guru asked the disciple,   
'What do you feel on seeing them.'   
It was a very unexpected situation for the disciple and he blurted out,   
'Guru, I feel disgusted!'   
'Can you not see a spiritual symbolism in that scene?'   
'Can you not see Radha and Krishna in them? Do they not symbolise Prakriti and  
Purusha?'   
The disciple could just bend his head in silence with a heart of  
understanding.   
Then the Guru said to the disciple: "the ultimate goal of spiritual path is to  
experience God in every being and every atom of the universe. That is what is  
meant by "sarvam Khalu Idam Brahma", "Vasudevah Sarvamidam", "Vishwam Vishnu  
Swaroopam".

It is said in one of the Hindu scriptures that Sri Rama Chandra,  
the greatest hero of the world, or at least of India, when he went  
to search out Truth, to discover or regain Truth, all nature offered  
him her services. It is said that monkeys formed his army, and  
squirrels helped him building a bridge over the gulf. It is said  
that even geese came up on his side to assist him in overcoming  
his foes. It is said that the stones offered him their services. The  
stones forgot their nature; the stones, when thrown into water,  
instead of sinking, said, "We shall float in order that the cause  
of Truth be advanced." It is said that air, the atmosphere, was on  
his side, fire helped him, winds and storms were on his side. There  
is a saying in the English language that the wind and wave are  
always for the brave.   
All Nature stands up on your side when you persist, when you  
overcome the primitive seeming difficulties. If you overcome the  
struggles or temptations in the beginning, the whole of Nature must  
serve you. Persist in standing by the Truth, and you will find that  
you live in no ordinary world. The world will be a world of  
miracles for you. You will be the master of the Universe, the  
husband of the whole world, if you persist by the Truth. MORAL: The whole  
Nature is bound to co-operate with and serve one -who stands by Truth.   
Swami Rama Tirtha

A PURANIC STORY of Sage Ribhu and his disciple Nidagha, is particularly  
instructive.   
Although Ribhu taught his disciple the Supreme Truth of the One Brahman  
without a second, Nidagha, in spite of his erudition and understanding, did  
not get sufficient conviction to adopt and follow the path ofjnana, but  
settled down in his native town to lead a life devoted to the observance of  
ceremonial religion.   
But the sage loved his disciple as deeply as the latter venerated his Master.  
In spite of his age, Ribhu would himself go to his disciple in the town, just  
to see how far the latter had outgrown his ritualism. At times the sage went  
in disguise, so that he might observe how Nidagha would act when he did not  
know that he was being observed by his master.   
On one such occasion Ribhu, who had put on the disguise of a rustic, found  
Nidagha intently watching a royal procession.   
Unrecognised by the town-dweller Nidagha, the village rustic enquired what the  
bustle was all about, and was told that the king was going in procession.   
?Oh! It is the king. He goes in procession! But where is he?? asked the  
rustic.   
?There, on the elephant,? said Nidagha.   
?You say the king is on the elephant. Yes, I see the two,? said the rustic,  
?But which is the king and which is the elephant?? ?What!? exclaimed Nidagha.  
?You see the two, but do not know that the man above is the king and the  
animal below is the elephant? What is the use of talking to a man like you??  
?Pray, be not impatient with an ignorant man like me,? begged the rustic. ?But  
you said ?above? and ?below? - what do they mean??   
Nidagha could stand it no more. ?You see the king and the elephant, the one  
a^bove and the other below. Yet you want to know what is meant by ?above? and  
?below??? burst out Nidagha. ?Ifthings seen and words spoken can convey so  
little to you, action alone can teach you. Bend forward, and you will know it  
all too well?.   
The rustic did as he was told. Nidagha got on his shoulders and said, ?Know it  
now. I amabove as the king, you are below as the elephant. Is that clear  
enough??   
?No, not yet,? was the rustic?s quiet reply. ?You say you are above like the  
king, and I am below like the elephant. The ?king?, the ?elephant?, ?above?  
and ?below? - so far it is clear. But pray, tell me what you mean by ?I?and  
'you?'?   
When Nidagha was thus confronted all of a sudden with the mighty problem of  
defining the ?you? apart from the ?I?, light dawned on his mind. At once he  
jumped down and fell at his Master?s feet saying, ?Who else but my venerable  
Master, Ribhu, could have thus drawn my mind from the superficialities of  
physical existence to the true Being of the Self? Oh! Benign Master, I crave  
thy blessings.?   
~ Ribhu Gita, as told by Bhagawan

An old man lived on a farm in the mountains of eastern Kentucky with his young  
grandson. Each morning Grandpa was up early sitting at the kitchen table  
reading his Quran.   
His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to imitate him in every way  
he could. One day the grandson asked, "Baba, I try to read the Quran just like  
you but I don't understand it, and what I do understand I forget as soon as I  
close the book. What good does reading the Quran do?"   
The Grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied,  
"Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water."  
The boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out before he got back to  
the house. The grandfather laughed and said, "You'll have to move a little  
faster next time," and sent him back to the river with the basket to try  
again.   
This time the boy ran faster, but again the basket was empty before he  
returned home. Out of breath, he told his grandfather that it was impossible  
to carry water in a basket, and he went to get a bucket instead.   
The old man said, "I don't want a bucket of water; I want a basket of water.  
You're just not trying hard enough," and he went out of the door to watch the  
boy try again.   
At this point, the boy knew it was impossible, but he wanted to show his  
grandfather that even if he ran as fast as he could, the water would leak out  
before he got back o the house.   
The boy again dipped the basket into river and ran hard, but when he reached  
his grandfather the basket was again empty.   
Out of breath, he said, "See Baba, it's useless!"   
"So you think it is useless?" The old man said, "Look at the basket."   
The boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket  
was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket and was  
now clean, inside and out.   
"Son, that's what happens when you read the Quran. You might not understand or  
remember everything, but when you read it, you will be changed, inside and  
out. That is the work of God in our lives."

A very popular story in the North Indian Satsangs: A guru told his disciple to chant the mantra- SOHAM, for his betterment. This  
simply means whatever is, it?s me or in other words, God is me and I am god,  
arising from the principle that God is present in every particle. Another guru  
came and told him this is very arrogant way to think, please add DA before it  
so say DASOHAM, that is I am a servant of the lord. He did so and one day came  
the first guru, he elaborated the meaning of SOHAM again, and advised him to  
add SA before the word and say SADASOHAM, that means I am always. Then came  
the second guru and asked him to add another DA and say DASADASOHAM, meaning  
that I am servant to the servant of GOD. This way teachings and  
interpretations differ, and a cycle of chakra goes on.   
Another version brief one: in that Varanasi Ghat, one Vedanti wrote on a wall in big letters ? ?SOHAM?.  
Means, ?I am That?. Next day, when he came back, he saw one Dasa Parampara  
sadhu had put ?DA? in front of that word ?Soham?. It now read ?DASOHAM?.  
Means, ?I am the Servant?. And this Vedanti cannot keep quiet. Next day day,  
this Vedanti added in front of that, the word ?SA?. It now read ?SADASOHAM?.  
Means, ?Always I am That?. He put ?SA? and went away. Next day, the Dasa  
Parampara fellow didn?t keep quiet. That fellow comes and puts one more ?DA?  
and made it ?DASADASOHAM?. And this fellow (the Vedanti) comes and adds one  
more ?SA? to make it ?SADASADASOHAM?! And it continues....  
?DASADASADASOHAM?.... ?SADASADASADASOHAM?...!   
I leave the moral of this story to ourselves to ponder!

Verses 273 and 274 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: Q: If I am Brahman, how does it happen that I do not know this 'I"?   
A: Who says 'i' now?   
Q: The intellect.   
A: If the intellect gets lost in a swoon. That which remains is never lost, as  
perfect Consciousness is 'I'.   
Q: The state of perfection is not clear to me. How can I experience it?   
A: There is the experience of happiness in deep sleep and it is That. No  
happiness can be experienced anywhere when a want is felt. Therefore the Self  
must be this perfection. This is the Source of all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 275 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: மனத்தினால் எண்ணித்தானே   
 வந்தது இவ் உலகமாகும்   
நினைத்திடில் அனேக லோக   
 நிற்பது அவ் அறிவில் அன்றோ

 அந்த மற்று அறிவு இதாமென்று   
எனைத் தனி விசாரித்திட்டால்   
 ஏகாமாய் நிறைந்தோன் நானே. (275)   
Verse 275 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: The cosmos originated in the imagination of the mind. Reason shows that these  
worlds have their   
being in that Consciousness. If the inquiry is pursued into the Self as  
transcending all this extending   
limitless, 'I' remains as the one perfect Being.

Additional translations given by Munagala Venkataramiah in his book: 1\. Through the Grace of his Lord, Tandavesa, has shown how, freeing oneself  
from everything   
interior and exterior one may be transformed into the ONE and having been  
convinced that the   
intended sense of the Vedas, which are beyond thought is 'I' and that the body  
and such are but   
modes of sound (nada), one may become the 'All Eye' and see everything as  
oneself.   
2\. Those who, without wavering, recognize the One Witness of blazing lustre -  
turiyateeta, which   
is perfected in the meaning of those three most excellent words: Thou art That  
- will unravel the knot   
of 'differences' and overcoming every obstacle, will be themselves absorbed in  
the SELF.   
3\. This is the delight of knowledge spoken of by the Vedas. Those who worship  
the feet of Narayana,   
who has described it, are without blemish; those who, through the teacher of  
this pupil., approach   
the stage in which doubt is finished and steadily go forward to Perfection,  
will obtain spotless emancipation.

4\. The author has, through the two parts of this work, kindled the sublime  
light of the spirit, so that   
eternal darkness of Maya may perish and, clearing all doubts rising from  
mental knowledge, which is   
affected by differences, has subjected the disciple to himself.   
5\. Praise, praise, to the author of my salvation! He placed on his head the  
foot of Narayana, the Infinite Lord, who had made him his slave, and who, by  
means of the process of negation had destroyed what   
through imposition had arisen as a mere fictitious appearance, and put me in  
such a condition that I,   
with eyes of grace, can remain for ever the Spectator.

## Re:[15]Topic:  Sri Aurobindo-The Four Aids, a chapter in The Synthesis of Yoga  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: September 19, 2014, 10:19:57 PM

**The Concept of Grace**   
Each mind can have its own way of approaching the supreme Truth and there Is  
an entrance for each as well as a thousand ways for the journey to it. It is  
not necessary to believe in the Grace or to recognise a Godhead different from  
one's highest Self - there are ways of yoga that do not accept these  
things....   
For, as to this "Grace", we describe it in that way because we feel in the  
infinite Spirit or Self-existence a Presence or a Being, a Consciousness that  
determines, - that is what we speak of as the Divine, - not a separate person,  
but the one Being of whom our individual self is a portion or a vessel. But it  
is not necessary for every body to regard it in that way. Supposing it is the  
impersonal Self of all only, yet the Upanishad says of this Self and its  
realisation: "This understanding is not to be gained by reasoning nor. by  
tapasya nor by much learning, but whom this Self chooses, to him it reveals  
its own body". Well, that is the same thing as what we call the Divine Grace,  
- it is an action from above or from within independent of mental causes which  
decides its own movement. We can call it the Divine Grace; we can call it the  
Self within choosing its own hour and way to manifest to the mental instrument  
on the surface; we can call it the flowering of the inner being or inner  
nature into self-realisation and self-knowledge. As something in us approaches  
it or as it presents itself to us, so the mind sees it. But in reality it is  
the same thing and the same process of the being in Nature.

## Re:[16]Sri Aurobindo-Equality  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: February 20, 2015, 06:20:01 AM

**Equality**   
Equality is the chief support of the true spiritual consciousness and it is  
this from which a sadhak deviates when he allows a vital movement to carry him  
away in feeling or speech or action. Equality is not the same thing as  
forbearance, though undoubtedly a settled equality immensely extends, even  
illimitably, a man's power of endurance and forbearance.   
Equality means a quiet and unmoved mind and vital, it means not to be touched  
or disturbed by things that happen or things said or done to you, but to look  
at them with a straight look, free from the distortions created by personal  
feeling, and to try to understand what is behind them, why they happen, what  
is to be learnt from them, what is it in oneself which they are cast against  
and what inner profit or progress one can make out of them; it means self-  
mastery over the vital movements, anger and sensitiveness and pride as well  
as desire and the rest, not to let them get hold of the emotional being and  
disturb the inner peace, not to speak and act in the rush and impulsion of  
these things, always to act and speak out of a calm inner poise of the spirit.  
It is not easy to have this equality in any full perfect measure, but one  
should always try more and more to make it the basis of one's inner state and  
outer movements.   
Equality means another thing -to have an equal view of men and their nature  
and acts and the forces that move them; it helps one to see the truth about  
them by pushing away from the mind all personal feeling in one's seeing and  
judgment and even all the mental bias. __Personal feeling always distorts and  
makes one see in men 's actions, not only the actions themselves, but things  
behind them which, more often than not, are not there. Misunderstanding,  
misjudgment which could have been avoided are the result; things of small  
consequence assume larger proportions__. I have seen that more than half of  
the untoward happenings of this kind in life are due to this cause. But in  
ordinary life personal feeling and sensitiveness are a constant part of human  
nature and may be needed there for self-defence, although, I think, even  
there, a strong, large and equal attitude towards men and things would be a  
much better line of defence. But for a sadhak, to surmount them and live  
rather in the calm strength of the spirit is an essential part of his  
progress.   
 _The first condition of inner progress is to recognise whatever is or has  
been a wrong movement in any part of the nature, wrong idea, wrong feeling,  
wrong speech, wrong action, and by wrong is meant what departs from the truth,  
from the higher consciousness and higher self, from the way of the Divine_.  
__Once recognised it is admitted, not glossed over or defended, and it is  
offered to the Divine for the Light and Grace to descend and substitute for it  
the right movement of the true Consciousness__.

Nirvana or the Absolute Nirguna Brahman is the highest accomplishment.   
Sri Aurobindo's conclusions are not in tune with that of Advaita or Masters  
like Sri Ramana, Sri Nisarghadatta.   
He was a great yogi but he did not endorse advaita.   
Maharishee clearly spoke of the differences in his answers to one Swami from  
Gujarat ( power of presence)

The Story of Sant Ekanath continued....   
Eknath's reformist views brought him into conflict not only with orthodox  
pundits but also with his own family. His son Hari Pundit was annoyed at his  
father's habit of preaching in Marathi and of eating in low-caste homes. He  
went away on a pilgrimage to Varanasi and didn't return. When Eknath followed  
him, Hari Pundit told him the reason for his exile. With a heavy heart, Eknath  
promised to give up his discourses and unorthodox ways. Hari Pundit returned  
and gave discourses in Sanskrit, while Eknath remained silent. The audience  
dwindled to near-zero while the people clamoured for Eknath's discourses and  
kirtans. One day an old, low-caste widow came to invite Eknath for a meal at  
her place. She desired to feed a thousand Brahmins, but, being poor, could not  
do so.   
Since she considered Eknath to be worth a thousand Brahmins, she decided to  
feed him. Eknath turned to Hari Pundit, who was moved by her plight. But Hari  
Pundit made two conditions: one, that he would accompany Eknath; and two, that  
he himself would cook the food. On the appointed day, the two of them went to  
the woman's house and settled down to eat. Hari Pundit noticed that the woman  
had slipped a dish that she had prepared onto Eknath's leaf plate. He resented  
this but kept quiet. After finishing the meal, Eknath told Hari Pundit to pick  
up the leaf plates, so as not to trouble the old woman. Hari Pundit bent down  
to pick up Eknath's leaf plate. As he picked it up, he found another plate  
beneath it. Perhaps he had been served on two leaf plates. But below the  
second was a third. Eventually, Hari Pundit had to pick up a thousand leaf  
plates! A thunderstruck Hari Pundit realized his stupidity. His father was  
worth a thousand Brahmins and more. He fell at his feet begging forgiveness.  
Eknath forgave him saying, "Hari, you have learnt the shastras, but not  
humility." Needless to say, after this Eknath resumed his preaching and other  
activities.   
Besides the Eknathi Bhagavat, he wrote the Rukmini-Swyamvar, the story of Lord  
Krishna's marriage to Rukmini Devi. It is an allegorical tale of the meeting  
of the jiva and Shiva, though in Maharashtra it was popular as simply a story.   
In 1583, Eknath renovated the samadhi (tomb) of Jnanadeva in Alandi. In 1584  
he completed editing the Jnaneshwari. In his day, there were several  
interpolations on the Jnaneshwari and more than one version was extant. The  
Jnaneshwari we read today is his edition. He began writing the Bhavartha  
Ramayana, a Marathi translation of the Ramayana, but took Mahasamadhi (left  
his body) in 1599 before completing it. This parallels the story of the sage  
Valmiki: Scholars believe that Valmiki never wrote the Uttar Kanda, but that  
it was added later. Similarly, in Eknath's case, the Uttar Kanda was written  
later by his disciples.   
According to scholars, in Maharashtra, Eknath's place as philosopher-writer-  
saint is second only to Jnanadeva's. His main achievement, outwardly, was to  
spread Sanatana Dharma (the Eternal Religion) and its philosophy down to the  
lowest stratum of society. As one of his biographers puts it, " _With  
Jnanadeva, philosophy reigned in the clouds; with Eknath, it came down to  
earth and dwelt among the people_ ".   
concluded.

**Saint Ekanath and The vagabond**   
An incident in his life highlights his broad mind, forbearance and  
compassionate nature.   
Sant Eknath lived in a village called Prathinapura, in Maharastra. He  
practiced Bhagvath Dharma - singing the names and glories of the Lord. He  
performed pooja to the idols of Rukmini and Panduranga which was presented to  
him by his Guru - Sri Janardana Swami. Sant Eknath was particularly famous in  
his village for his patience; nobody ever saw him angry, and nothing could  
ever make him lose his temper. Almost all his fellow-villagers paid respects  
to Eknath for his great virtues.   
In the same village, there were a few vagabonds who used to regularly meet for  
gambling. One morning it so happened that one of them arrived late. When the  
others looked at him with a questioning look, he said, "I had been to Sant  
Eknath's residence to pay respects to him. So I could not come here in time."   
On hearing this, the others guffawed and with a mocking tone asked him, "So my  
friend, what is so special about this gentleman, which makes you fall at his  
feet?"   
"Sri Eknath never loses his temper under any circumstance. Isn't this trait  
unusual?"   
They teased him further..."How can he who never gets angry be called a human?"  
On hearing thus, he immediately answered, "That is the reason why I regard him  
a saint..." The conversation which started in a light vein, took a serious  
turn... In the end, one of them challenged, "I shall make Saint Eknath lose  
his temper, and prove to you all that he is no different from others and I  
shall accomplish what I just said by tomorrow itself."   
The next morning, Sant Eknath went to bathe in the Holy Godavari river early  
in the morning. While he was returning, the one who threw down the gauntlet,  
was waiting for Sant Eknath on a rooftop with mouthful of Paan (Betel leaves  
and Betel nuts, usually taken after meals). While walking back home, Eknath  
suddenly felt something wet falling on him. Without any signs of surprise, and  
without losing his composure, he walked back to the river for a holy dip.   
The defiler was surprised, but when Sri Eknath returned from his second dip,  
he again spat on this great saint. Sri Eknath again went back to the river for  
a dip without losing his calm. But the vagabond was persistent in his efforts  
to make this saint angry, and he kept on spitting at Saint Eknath.   
Each time he spat on the saint, he could not even detect a faintest frown in  
Eknath's face. As the twilight of the dawn started to bounce off from the  
glittering waters of Godavari, the vagabond got tired of spitting at Eknath.   
He was totally bewildered on seeing the patience and forbearance of Eknath.  
While his mouth was aching stiff due to repeated spitting, Eknath was looking  
as composed and as fresh as he was early in the morning!   
The vagabond, feeling guilty and ashamed, rushed down to fall at the feet of  
Saint Eknath. Saint Eknath, with eyes brimming with compassion and love even  
for this offender, blessed him.   
Now the vagabond was totally perplexed, "Swami, how is it possible for you to  
be like this?"   
Saint Eknath replied, "Brother, if you can stick so stubbornly to this vice of  
harassing sadhus, it isn't the least surprising that I, on my part, should  
stick to virtue of not losing temper.I am on the way to offer my morning  
worship to the Lord. The dirt on my body can be easily cleansed by a dip in  
the river, but if I let anger enter my mind, it defiles the mind, and no  
amount of bathing in any river can cleanse me of this impurity.Worshiping with  
an impure mind would not bear fruits."

**Saint Ekanath and his vision of Dattareya** : Saint Ekanath served his Guru Janardana Swami as his assistant. One night,  
Eknath was checking the accounts as usual. He found that there was 1 paisa  
missing in the account and he had excess in hand. He was breaking his head to  
find out what happened. This was because he felt all the work he was doing in  
the ashram was Guru seva and that he should be correct in that. As he was  
awake till late in the night, his guru came to see what he was doing. Eknath  
did not even realize that his guru was standing behind as he was thinking  
deeply about reconciling the accounts. Janardhana swami understood that he is  
checking accounts and went back to his place. He again came at mid night to  
see if he was done with it, but saw that he was still working on it and went  
back. Around 2 A.M in the morning, Eknath emotionally shouted ?Gurunatha, I  
found it? as he had reconciled the accounts. Janardhana Swami immediately got  
up and went to him and asked him what he had seen. Eknath immediately  
apologized for waking him up and said that an entry for 1 paisa was missing  
and that he had found it. As soon as the Guru heard this, his eyes were filled  
with tears and told him that there were so many sishyas who had come here and  
found so many great things and after serving me for 12 years you are happy  
that you have found 1 paisa. Janardhana Swami then said that he is now  
indebted to him for having taken care of him and the ashram for all these  
years. He then went back to sleep. Janradhana Swami?s deity was Dattatreya and  
he requested him to give darshan to Eknath and Dattatreya agreed to his  
request. The next day Eknath went to Godhavari River to have his bath as  
usual. After completing his bath he would bring water from the river to the  
ashram. On his way back Dattatreya gave him his darshan in godly form. The  
four Vedas stood next to him as 4 dogs. Dharma devata stood behind him as a  
bull. Eknath on seeing him prostrated to him. Dattatreya then blessed him and  
Eknath came back to the ashram and started doing his work as usual. Janardhana  
Swami came and saw what Eknath was doing and he found him boiling the milk. He  
then thought that he doesn?t look like someone who has had the darshan of god.  
The state of a person who has realised and seen god would be different and  
they would be in deep meditation, sometimes crying or smiling and would not  
look like normal persons to the outside world. Janardhana Swami was now  
wondering if god had given him darshan or not. Janardhana Swami was now really  
confused and asked Eknath if had seen anything this morning. Eknath then told  
him that when he was returning from the river he saw his guru?s deity standing  
under the tree and that he had worshiped him. Janardhana Swami was further  
perplexed and told him that there are so many rishis trying to realize god for  
so many janmas and after having realized god how he could continue with his  
regular work. Eknath then replied to him that his Guru was everything to him  
and that he was happy to see this form of god rather than the form he saw in  
the morning. Hearing this Janardhana Swami was moved. Janardhana swami then  
asked him to go back to his parents, get married and lead a family life.  
Eknath hesitated as he dint want to leave his guru but Janardhana Swami told  
him that he would realize his presence wherever he was. This consoled Eknath  
and he returned home.

**Saint Ekanath and Kandiya Krishna** : One day when he was reading Bagavatha a 12 year old boy came to him,  
prostrated to him and asked him to make him his sishya as he wanted to learn  
the Vedas from him. Eknath asked him who he was and where does he come from.  
He replied to him that his parents were no more and that he considered Eknath  
as his mother, father, Guru and God. He said that he was from Dwaraka and his  
name was Kandiya Krishna. Eknath accepted him as his sishya and looked after  
him as his own son. Krishnan was very smart and a learnt everything easily. He  
took care of all the needs of his guru and served him well. He did all service  
to his guru right from washing his clothes, cleaning his pooja vessels,  
cleaning his pooja room, preparing garlands for his god etc. He would also  
serve his Guru matha by getting vegetable from the market, bringing water from  
Godhavari etc.   
One day Eknath was performing his ancestral rituals. Two outcastes happened to  
pass by his house and understood that a feast was being prepared. They were  
discussing that it would be good if they could get this food. Eknath on  
listening to these discussions called them and gave them the food that was  
being prepared. They were happy with him, thanked him and then left. The other  
Brahmans who had come for the ceremony left the place on seeing this. All  
Brahmans in the village on seeing this started speaking ill about him for  
giving the food that was prepared for ancestral ceremony to some outcastes  
before completing the ceremony. They all spoke to each other and decided that  
Eknath should be punished for this deed of his. All the Brahmans in the  
village then came to Eknath and asked him how he could do this in spite of  
learning sastras. Eknath then said that, he gave them food as they were hungry  
and that hunger doesn?t have any caste difference and hence decided to feed  
them. He also said that the sastras say that annadhanam can be given to anyone  
and that there was no caste discretion on that. They then said that none of  
the Brahmans in the village would mingle with him and not have any contact  
with him and his family from now on. Eknath now had to prepare food again for  
the ceremony and perform the ceremony. Eknath was now worried that he would  
not be able to feed the Brahmans after the ritual is over as no one would come  
to his house now. Kandiya Krishna then told Eknath that if Brahmans were not  
available the sastras say that they could give it to kurcham (a type of holy  
dried grass used in religious ceremonies) Eknath then started performing the  
rituals and when he kept the 1st kurcham, Vitthal came and sat down to have  
the food. As soon as he came other gods and his forefathers who were called  
during the ceremony came down and took the food directly. Kandiya Krishna was  
watching all these happening and smiling at Eknath. Once it got over, they  
blessed Eknath by reciting holy mantras and disappeared. His neighbours heard  
the chanting of holy mantras and thought that some Brahmans from neighbouring  
villages would have come without knowing what had happened with Eknath and  
were waiting for them to come out of the house so that they could warn them  
and advice them not to go to his house. After some time Eknath came out of the  
house. The Brahmans asked him who had come for the lunch and he was quiet.  
They then said that they heard some people reciting some mantras. Kandiya  
Krishnan then asked them what their problem was and said that no one had come.  
The Brahmans then left and thought that Eknath and Krishnan would have chanted  
the mantras in some different voices to fool them. It was almost one year  
since they had given this punishment to Eknath. He then went to the Brahmin  
Samaj and said that he was ready to do whatever pariharam (doing penance) to  
clear the mistake he had done by feeding the outcastes. The Brahmans then told  
him that they would discuss among themselves and come back to him on the same.  
They got together and started preparing a list of things to be done as per  
their wish. One said that he has to make a gold cow and gift it to some one.  
Another one said he has to gift land and another said he has to gift a house.  
Like this each one came up with whatever they wished and this list was given  
to Eknath. Eknath then felt that he would use all his wealth and perform the  
list of parihara given by the Brahmins. The Brahmans were now happy that  
Eknath will now gift all his wealth to them and Kandiya Krishna was thinking  
how teach them a lesson. Krishnan tried to tell his Guru that they were  
cheating him and planning to acquire all his wealth in the name of parihara,  
but did not agree. The Brahmans were performing the rituals and Eknath was  
doing the sankalpam. It was noon and a leper came enquiring about Eknath. The  
Brahmans stopped him and asked him who he was. He said that he came from  
Triambakeshwar and wanted to see him. They then asked him why he wanted to see  
him. The leper said that he had come to do some praihara from him. The  
Brahmans then told him that they were doing pariharam even for Eknath and  
asked the leper to do it from them. The leper then said that they would not be  
able to do it for him and only Eknath could perform prayachitta for him. The  
leper said that he has done several pariharams from many people and had taken  
holy dips in many holy rivers but nothing had cured his leprosy. Just then  
Krishnan came and asked him what happened. The leper said that he went to  
Triambakeshwar and prayed to Lord Shiva. He said that he then asked him to  
cure his leprosy failing which he will commit suicide by jumping in the  
Godhavari River. He then said that Lord Shiva came in his dream and asked him  
to take the paada theertham (water taken by cleaning the feet of saints) of  
Eknath and that it was the only cure for him. As soon as he said this,  
Krishnan told him that it was his Guru whom he was mentioning and took him to  
Eknath. The ceremonies were still going on and the leper asked Eknath for his  
paada theertham. Eknath then told him that he was not such a great person and  
refused his request. The leper then told him that it was Lord Triambakeshwarar  
who had asked him to do this and that he should not refuse. When Eknath heard  
that it was the wish of Lord Shiva he agreed to it. The leper then performed  
paadha pooja for Eknath and consumed the water. As soon as he drank this water  
his body became normal and leprosy had vanished. The Brahmans there astonished  
to see this. Krishna then looked at the Brahmans and asked if they at least  
now understood the greatness of Eknath. The Brahmans now did not have the guts  
to continue with these parihara they were doing and Krishna was happy that  
Eknath?s wealth was saved.

**Saint Ekanath and Kandiya Krishna** continued....   
There was a Brahman who was very pious. He set out on a yatra to visit all the  
holy places and wherever he went the deity in that temple would speak to him  
because of his bhakthi. One day he went to Dwaraka, the deity here  
(Kalyanarayar) did not give him darshan or speak to him. He felt that  
Kalyanarayar was not there and it was only the statue that was there. After  
sometime he thought that he dint have enough bhakthi and that is why god did  
not speak to him. He decided to be on fast till he gets a reply form him.  
After fasting for 12 days, Lord Krishna came in his dream and said that he was  
in Prathistanapuram (now Paithan) doing service to Eknath as his sishya for  
the past 12 years. He then told him that he can have his darshan if he comes  
there. He also asked him to do service to Eknath instead of wandering all over  
India. The next morning the Brahman got up and started going to  
Prathistanapuram. He reached Paithan and enquired where Eknath?s house was and  
came to meet him. Eknath was reading Srimad Bhagavadam, the Brahman prostrated  
to him and asked him where Krishna was. Eknath thought that he was asking  
about Kandiya Krishna and told him that he has gone to Godhavari and would be  
back soon. Eknath thought that the Brahman was related to Krishna and had come  
to see him. He also asked him to be seated till he comes back. Krishna then  
returned from Godhavari with some water but did not say anything to the  
Brahaman. Eknath was surprised why both of them dint recognize each other. He  
then asked the Brahman if he saw Krishna going inside the house. The Brahman  
then told him that he was looking for Lord Krishna and not this Krishna and  
also explained to him what had happened to him in Dwaraka. Eknath on hearing  
this ran in to the house searching for Kandiya Krishna but only the vessels in  
which he fetched water were there but Krishnan had disappeared. He searched  
for him all over the house and started crying. He cursed himself for not being  
able to recognize god when he was there with him. He could not perform any  
work as everything reminded him of Krishna only. He went to a Samadhi state  
and was thinking only about god. The Brahman who came now started serving  
Eknath.   
Truly the Glory of saints like Ekanath puts to shade even that of the Lord.

**Saint Ekanath and the Thirsty Donkey**   
One day Eknath decided to go on a yatra and he set out on a yatra with few  
others who joined him. They went to places like Kasi, Prayagai, Vrindavan,  
Ayodha, Mathura etc. Eknath performed Bhajans and pravachans wherever he went.  
When the finished the yatra and returning to Paithan with Ganga theertham,  
they got stuck in a place where there was no water and all of them were  
thirsty. Even though they had water in hand they did not use that as it was  
Ganga theertham and that it was supposed to be used only for religious purpose  
and not for quenching thirst. They then found a donkey lying down in an  
unconscious state due to thirst and heat. Seeing the donkey dying Eknath felt  
bad and moved forward to give his Ganga theertham to it so as to prevent it  
from dying. The others who were with him said that he should not do that as  
this water was supposed to be used only for religious purpose. Eknath then  
said that there was no better deed that saving the life of someone and that he  
would give it to the donkey and save it from death. Hearing this, the others  
left him behind and started moving forward as they dint approve of his action.  
Eknath then gave the water to the donkey. As Eknath was feeding the donkey it  
turned out to be Vitthal. He then prostrated to Vitthal and asked him why he  
did this leela. **Vitthal then told him that he wanted to show the world that  
Eknath sees every living being in this world as Vitthal and hence did this  
leela**. Eknath then returned back home.

**_ The Story Of The Three Travelers   
Three travelers on a long and exhausting journey had become companions, and  
shared the same pleasures and sorrows, pooling all their resources. After many  
days they realized that all they had between them was a piece of bread and a  
mouthful of water in a flask. They fell to quarrelling as to who should have  
all the food. Making no progress on this score, they tried to divide the bread  
and water. Still they could not arrive at a conclusion.   
As dusk was falling, one finally suggested that they should sleep. When they  
awoke, the person who had had the most remarkable dream would decide what  
should be done.   
The next morning the three rose as the sun came up and the first traveler  
said, "This is my dream: I was carried away to places such as cannot be  
described, so wonderful and serene were they. I met a wise man who said to me,  
'You deserve the food, for your past and future life are worthy and suitable  
subjects for admiration.'"   
"How strange," said the second traveler. "For in my dream, I actually saw all  
my past and my future. In my future I saw a man of great knowledge, who said,  
'You deserve the bread more than your friends, for you are more learned and  
patient. You must be well-nurtured, for you are destined to lead men,'"   
The third traveler said, "In my dream I saw nothing, heard nothing, said  
nothing. I felt a compelling presence which forced me to get up, find the  
bread and water, and consume them then and there. And this is what I did."   
The two companions were very angry and demanded to know why they were not  
called when the mysterious power compelled him to consume the bread.   
"But you were far from here! One of you was carried away to far places and the  
other to another time! How could you hear my calling?" he replied.

Once a ship while reaching the shore near Udupi faced a great storm and was in  
imminent danger. MadhwAchArya who was standing on the seashore, saw the scene,  
waved his cloth towards the ship and by the Grace of God the ship was saved.  
The first thing the captain did on landing was to prostrate himself before the  
AchArya and thank him for what he believed was the AchArya's miracle and  
request him to take something as gift. The AchArya by his inner vision saw a  
heavy lump of gopi-chandana (a species of white clay) lying in the ship as  
ballast. He asked for that to be given him as gift. Surprised at this  
seemingly trivial request the captain obliged. The AchArya drove his hand  
inside the lump of clay and brought forth a sAligrAma stone idol of  
Balakrishna (Krishna in his childhood) from within. The idol was so heavy that  
the very fact that the AchArya could carry it all by himself was itself a  
miracle. But more miraculous was the information he gave on the idol. It  
appears it was originally made by the divine architect viSva-karma and was  
kept by no less a person than Rukmini hrself in Dwaraka in the dvApara yuga.  
When Dwaraka was submerged in the sea at the end of Krishna's time, the idol  
was lost. That was the idol which the AchArya had unearthed! It adorns the  
temple of Udupi even today.

**In The Vision of God** -Papa Ramdas, CHAPTER XVI,CHITRAKUT   
 (i) **A Bania 's Renunciation**   
Ramkinkar expressed a wish that Ramdas had a companion to take care of him.  
Hearing this, a bania, who was then on the platform, coming forward said: 'I am also proceeding to Chitrakut. I shall be so happy to keep him company  
and serve him.'   
Accordingly, side by side, the bania and Ramdas took seats in the train. The  
train steamed out of the station. The bania carried a kambal and a lota(metal  
vessel). He spread the kambal on the bench and making Ramdas lie on it,  
massaged his feet. While doing this service he opened his mind: 'Maharaj, I am  
disgusted with worldly life. I too would lead the life of a sadhu. I have  
turned my back on a life full of cares and sorrows. Consider me as your  
disciple and take me under your protection.'   
'Ramji', Ramdas replied, 'there is nothing wrong with the world. It is your  
mind that is obsessed. So long as your mind is not intensely longing to tear  
up the veil of illusion that clouds the Truth within you, mere external  
renunciation is of no avail. It will only be a leap out of the frying pan into  
the fire. True happiness consists in our right attitude towards life and the  
world. Now right attitude depends on right vision. The vision comes through  
the realisation of Truth or God. Do not be deceived. You cannot   
have liberation and peace by simply turning your back upon the world. Know  
your mind well. Freedom and joy are within you. Conquest of lust, wrath and  
greed is the path. Don't cling to Ramdas. He is no guru. He can only show you  
the path. _The effort and struggle are your own. Be, therefore, the disciple  
of Truth_.'   
The bania's mind appeared to have been preoccupied. Ramdas' words did not  
elicit any reply nor did he evince any sign that he had comprehended them. The  
night passed. Early next morning the train reached the Chitrakut station.  
Alighting, Ramdas and the bania moved towards the hills of Chitrakut which lay  
about three miles from the station.   
On the way he had again a conversation with the Bania. 'Are you doing any  
sadhana, Ramji, for concentration of mind?'   
Ramdas asked.   
'Why not?' he returned, 'I am taking God's Name sometimes.'   
' _Sometimes is not good, ' Ramdas said, 'you ought to repeat the Name  
ceaselessly, and keep up an unbroken flow of remembrance in your thoughts.'_   
'So far as that is concerned I am all right,' he cut short.   
'Ramji, leave Ramdas alone. You live your own life, because he wanders alone',  
Ramdas put in.   
'No, no' he said with vehemence, 'I am not giving you up'.   
'The path Ramdas walks is beset with pains and dangers. He is fearless and has  
no dread of death. To follow him would mean for you so much discomfort and  
misery,' suggested Ramdas.   
'I too am not afraid of anything. I can adapt myself to any life you choose to  
live. I am determined to cast my lot with you,' he spoke with great emphasis.   
Ramdas had no alternative but to submit. So God willed. Now they reached the  
banks of the river Mandakini in the heart of the town. They came to a bathing  
ghat where Ramdas took his seat on a low, worn out table. The fit of vairagya  
that had seized the bania was at work. He removed his shirt and, calling a  
passing barber, squatted down on a stone step.   
continued....

**Bania 's Renunciation** continued....   
'Shave me clean,' he instructed the barber, 'I am taking up sannyas.'   
'You mistake me,' remonstrated the barber, 'I am not prepared to bring down on  
my head the curses of your wife and children by helping you adopt sannyas.'   
'Brother, why do you mind all that? Do as I ask you,' the bania pressed  
coaxingly. 'I will give you my shirt and a watch, in addition to the usual  
shaving charges.'   
The barber was firm. His fear of the curses outweighed all other  
considerations. He refused to yield to the temptation. He got up and was about  
to leave the spot when the bania clutched him by the arm and begged:'Shave all  
the hair on my head and face except the eyebrows and a small tuft on the head.  
What do you say? You can have no objection now.' At this the barber lowered  
his leather bag of shaving materials and sat down. He agreed to the  
compromise. In fifteen minutes the bania?s face and head, except the tuft in  
the middle of the latter, were cleared of all hair. He gave away to the barber  
the shirt and the watch and also some money. Now he turned to Ramdas  
anticipating a look of approbation from him. Ramdas could only be a cheerful  
spectator of the performance.   
He had now left with him a greasy old cap, which he threw away, two dhotis and  
a small bag containing some money. On his finger was also a gold ring. One of  
the dhotis he presented to a beggar. All that he now possessed consisted of  
one dhoti, a gold ring, some money and a lota. Bath over, he escorted Ramdas  
to a neighbouring sweetmeat shop where they had a tiffin of purees and milk.  
Then they sauntered along the bank of the river and came to a place called  
Phatakshila, where they saw   
nearly a dozen sadhus living in a hut close by the river. Resting for some  
time beneath a tree they retraced their steps to the town again by noon. The  
bania felt hungry. A recourse again to the sweetmeat shop satisfied the  
ravenous wolf within. In the afternoon they went round the famous Kamtanath  
hill, on which it is said Sri Ramchandra made his abode with Sita for twelve  
years. In the evening they returned once more to the sweetmeat shop.   
For the night Ramdas preferred to settle down beneath a tree and the bania  
slept beside him. The bania moved with him like his shadow. He was afraid that  
Ramdas might give him the slip at any moment. On rising next morning from the  
grassy bed, the bania felt that something was wrong with him. 'We shall go  
down to Karvi station,' he said to Ramdas, 'it is only four miles from here,  
and be back by evening.' It was not for Ramdas now to question why; his was to  
submit. After a visit to the fascinating tiffin shop they started. On the way,  
when they were walking through a narrow pass of a hillock, Ramdas had to  
follow the bania closely. Now a hissing noise and a low moan emanated from  
him. Ramdas jumped on one side and faced him. He was shedding tears.   
'What is the matter?' inquired Ramdas.   
Wiping away his tears with many a grief-laden hiccup, he said: 'I feel so  
keenly for my wife and children. I ran away from them without their knowledge.  
They might be remembering me and living in agony over my absence. For myself I  
don?t mind. It is for them my heart goes out.' And he burst into tears.   
'Ramji, why don?t you then return to them?' asked Ramdas.   
'You see I have almost burnt my boats. Oh! the barber was right.'   
Now handling fondly the short pigtail on his head he continued. 'Yes, the  
prospect is not after all so bad. I may yet go back to them.'   
continued.....

**Bania 's Renunciation** continued.....   
 (ii) **Failure of the Peace Mission**   
Thus they arrived at Karvi. The bania went directly to the courtyard of a  
small thatched house near the railway station. Both sat on a bench in the  
yard, a few steps from the entrance of the house. Two boys were playing in  
front of it. The bania made several signs to the boys who neither recognised  
nor heeded him. His transformed appearance was the reason for their non-  
recognition.   
Then he called one of the boys and whispered into his ears: 'Tell your mother  
a man wants to see her.'   
The boy went in. Meanwhile, the bania confided to Ramdas the secret of his  
mission. He had come to his wife?s sister?s house. He wished to reveal himself  
to her so that through her he might find a means of reconciliation with his  
wife. It was evident that he had a quarrel with her which ended in his  
departure from his house with a threat that he would never darken its doorstep  
again.The boy returned and unconcernedly commenced his play with his brother.  
How could a lady condescend to see a stranger inside her house?   
Again he drew towards the boy and told him in a low voice: 'Tell your mother  
that her sister Mami?s husband has come.'   
The lad gaped with raised eyebrows at the face of the bania, and a smile lit  
up his chubby face. He again ran into the house and soon reappeared beckoning  
the bania to go in. With a happy face the bania now hastened to the house.  
Ramdas waited. About fifteen minutes - and the bania came out. He looked like  
a whipped dog. His bitter face told of the unpalatable stuff with which he was  
served by his sister-in-law! She must have given him a big slice of her mind.  
The burning lashes of her tongue had charred and wrinkled his face!'Her tongue  
cuts - like a razor. Bah! a woman?s tongue!' he exclaimed knowingly. Then he  
added: 'Maharaj, I have got it now. I am not   
fitted for a family life. A sadhu?s life has a charm for me. I will never  
return to my home, there to face another sister! No, never.' The resolution  
made, he continued: 'Maharaj, let us be off from this undesirable place.'   
It was now past midday. The wolf again sorely troubled the bania. He sought a  
sweetmeat shop and they had a light repast. _In spite of his heart having been  
lacerated with conflicting emotions, his treatment of Ramdas was marked by  
undiminished respect and kindness. Ramdas could well understand that it was  
the Lord Himself playing the game. How perfect a player!_   
When night approached, they sought refuge in a dharmashala, but it was so  
fully crowded that there was no room for them. They came out. The moon was up  
in the heavens. Its cool and soft rays illumined the retiring world. It  
flooded the vast railway-yard with its genial effulgence. Ramdas went towards  
it followed by the bania, and crossing the gate they entered the yard. In the  
yard were scattered large slabs of stones. Ramdas took his seat on one of  
them, asking the bania to occupy another which lay by its side.   
'This is a fine place to sleep in for the night,' Ramdas remarked.   
The bania grunted as much as to say that he did not agree with him. He peered  
suspiciously into the dark spaces below the stones on all sides, but seeing  
that Ramdas had already laid himself down at full length on his slab, with  
another long drawn squeak, the bania also followed suit. Ramdas gazed on the  
bright moon above and the limitless blue space all around. He was charmed and  
absorbed. Suddenly, an unearthly yell issued from the bania. Ramdas sat up and  
looked at him. He was shouting out: 'A serpent! a serpent!' He had stood up  
and was shaking his cloth, the only cloth, with feverish agitation.   
'Maharaj, this place is infested with snakes. Let us go away from here,' he  
said.   
Ramdas had observed that lizards had made the snug nooks below the stone slabs  
their home.   
'There is no fear, Ramji. They are lizards, not snakes, under the stone. They  
are harmless,' Ramdas assured him.   
continued.....

**Bania 's Renunciation** continued....   
'Oh!' he cried, 'the thing, whatever it is, crawled on my legs. What a  
horrible sensation I got!'   
'Never mind, sleep on; there need be no fear,' Ramdas said encouragingly.   
Finding Ramdas was in no mood to leave the place, he coiled himself on the  
stone, covering his body fully from head to foot with the cloth.   
During the night he started in his sleep twice with a cry of fright; the cries  
were only the after-effects of the first alarm. The first shriek had terrified  
the poor lizards so much that they dared not come out of their lairs to touch  
one who could produce such a soul-racking sound!   
The bania?s peace mission having utterly failed, the next day, they left Karvi  
again for Chitrakut. Bath in the river over, the favourite tiffin shop  
entertained them with its purees and milk. The day was hot. They rested for  
some time in the cool shade of a tree on the river bank. When the sun had  
descended half way down the heavens, Ramdas proposed that they should go up  
the hill of Hanumandhara and remain on it for the night.   
(iii) **Sadhuism is not a Joke**   
Ascending over a hundred stone steps uphill, they reached the place called  
Hanumandhara. Here a big jet of water was pouring down from a height of about  
fifty feet into a reservoir below, made of brick and mortar. There was also a  
small rest-house near the waterfall. The place is considered sacred because it  
is said to have been once occupied by Sri Ramchandra and Sita. From here an  
extensive view of the surrounding country can be had - vast plains, high hills  
covered with dense vegetation and the smooth running river, are all presented  
to the gaze of the spectator. Chitrakut is a land of sages and saints.  
Hundreds of sadhus are still doing penance in their small   
ashrams called kutis, scattered over and around the hills and the riversides.  
From where they stood at the waterfall, Ramdas casting a glance upward, saw  
the mountain rise still higher. He was about to climb up when the bania  
suggested: 'Maharaj, there is a neat little rest-house here,' pointing to the  
building, 'what if we spend the night there?' Ramdas without reply, taking to  
a straggling path, went up, of course, followed by the bania. He now came upon  
a somewhat level piece of ground where stood two huts and an open shed. He  
entered one of the huts and found in it an image of black stone dressed in  
female robes, representing Sita. A sadhu was sitting near the image in order  
to collect the pice offered to the goddess by the pilgrims. It appears Sita  
was using the mandir as her kitchen, hence it goes by the name - Sita-rasuyee.   
The other hut was locked up. The bania sat inside the open shed to rest his  
tired limbs. The hill was still higher up by a couple of hundred yards. The  
whole place was thickly covered with tall wild trees.   
continued....

**Bania 's Renunciation** continued....   
'Ramji,' Ramdas said to the bania, 'this place is best suited for bhajan and  
so we shall stop here for the night.' He replied that the idea did not appeal  
to him and that the idea was simply preposterous or something to that effect.  
The sun had set and darkness was rapidly creeping on the world. The sadhu of  
Sita mandir came out and saw Ramdas seated on the root of a tree and the bania  
in the tiny shed.   
'How, now,' the sadhu said, 'what are you doing here? Don?t you see it is  
getting dark? - Iet us go down.'   
'Ram wills that Ramdas should remain here for the night,' answered Ramdas.   
'Madness,' he muttered, 'this jungle is haunted by wild beasts and nobody is  
permitted to remain here in the open in the nights. The shut-up kuti belongs  
to my guru who has gone down to the city for riddhi siddhi. It is his order  
that none should be here in the night.'   
'Ramdas obeys the command of Ram who says that he should not move from here,'  
Ramdas rejoined.   
'Then, do as you like at your own risk,' the sadhu retorted. 'But one thing,'  
he added, ?don?t make use of that shed. You, you,' turning to the bania, 'get  
out of the shed.' The bania came out. With a last warning the sadhu left the  
place and went down-hill. About ten yards higher up from the shed, Ramdas saw  
a flat stone beneath a   
cluster of trees. Going up, he occupied it. No sooner had the sadhu gone out  
of sight than the bania got back to the seat in the shed. Darkness came on.   
'Maharaj-ji, please do come to the shed,' the bania called.   
'No, Ramji, this flat stone is large enough to accommodate two persons. So you  
may also come here,' answered Ramdas.   
'This is a better place, Maharaj' he urged.   
By now it became pitch dark. The bania cried out in terror: 'O Maharaj, do  
come, I cannot remain here alone in this dreadful place.'   
Ramdas abandoning the flat stone went up to him in the shed. With the advent  
of darkness cold had also set in. The shed, open on all sides, being supported  
on four bamboo poles, allowed freely the chill breezes to sweep into it.  
Ramdas sat up while the bania lay down to sleep. But where was sleep for him  
in that fearful place? He was shivering both from dread and cold. At midnight  
there was a rustling noise among the thickly strewn dry leaves beneath the  
trees. Hearing the noise, with a sharp cry the bania bounded into a sitting  
posture.   
'Maharaj,' he whispered, 'what is that noise?'   
'It is nothing, Ramji,' consoled Ramdas, 'it may be only mountain rats,  
sporting about.'   
'For all that we know, it might be a wild animal or a cobra. I have heard that  
these jungles are inhabited by large sized cobras,' he spoke with   
deep concern.   
'Give up your fears, Ramji, they may be rats,' assured Ramdas.   
continued...

**Bania 's Renunciation** continued...   
Again an hour later, a similar noise louder and closer was heard. This time  
the bania was thoroughly frightened, and clung to Ramdas as the scared young  
one of a monkey does its mother.   
'What shall we do?' he cried.   
'Repeat the Name of Ram,' Ramdas suggested, 'you need not be afraid of  
anything when that powerful Name is on your lips. Do repeat it and keep calm.'   
Thereafter, Ramnam worked on his lips with amazing continuity. Till the  
appearance of dawn he went on with the japa, and no more noises disturbed him.  
The day-break dispelled his fears. He lay down through utter exhaustion from  
want of sleep, and directly commenced to snore.   
Ramdas got up from the place, and wandering in the jungle, came to the top of  
the hill. Through the morning mist he beheld the distant landscapes and the  
faint outlines of the turrets and domes of the temples of Chitrakut. The sight  
was enchanting and Ramdas stood still for some minutes under its magic spell.  
He roamed deeper into the forest where he discovered at places dry bones of  
animals scattered on the ground, the telltale signs of the work of wild  
beasts.   
Remembering the bania he hastened to the spot where he had left him. But where  
was the bania? He had vanished. When Ramdas was looking for him, the sadhu who  
had come up inquired: 'Whom are you seeking for? - the bania! When I was  
coming up I saw him running down as though pursued by a devil.' He added with  
a laugh: 'After all he learnt that sadhuism is not a joke.'   
The jungle called Ramdas back again and he rambled freely through it, till  
about eleven o ?clock when he descended the hill and directed his steps  
towards the river.

**Life of Nag Mahasaya continued**...   
There is a common belief among the Hindus that those who bathe in the holy  
river Ganga during Ardhodaya Yoga (An auspicious day which comes once every  
fifteen years) become free from impurities and ignorance, and go to heaven.  
Three or four days before that auspicious occasion Nag Mahashay left Calcutta,  
which is on the bank of the Ganga, to return to his village. His father was  
furious and said to him, 'People are selling everything they own to go and  
bathe in the Ganga on this holy occasion, and you have come back home, leaving  
the Ganga! I really don't understand your attitude towards religious life!  
Still a few days are left. Take me to Calcutta.'   
But Nag Mahashay humbly said: If a man has true devotion, Mother Ganga reveals  
herself in his house. It is needless for him to go any place'.   
On the day of Ardhodaya Yoga, several of Nag Mahashay's devotees came to visit  
him. Suddenly one of the women noticed a stream of water gushing out of the  
southeast corner of the courtyard. The devotees gathered around it in  
amazement and watched as it formed a flowing stream. Nag Mahashay was in his  
room when he heard the excitement of the devotees. He came out and, seeing the  
stream, bowed down to it reverently. Then, sprinkling a little water on his  
head, he prayed: 'Victory to Mother Ganga! Mother, purify us'.   
Word of the mysterious water spread throughout the village, and on that  
auspicious day devotees and villagers alike were blessed by bathing in that  
miraculous stream. Hearing of this episode some time later, Swami Vivekananda  
commented: 'The wish of a great soul like Nag Mahashay can make the impossible  
possible. Their infallible will power can even liberate people'.   
Nag Mahashay did not wear the ochre cloth of a monk, but he was true a yogi.  
To him all women were the veritable manifestation of the Divine Mother. 'I  
have never touched a woman in my life, so I have nothing to do with this  
world', he said to his father when the latter scolded him about his  
unmindfulness of the household. His purity was almost tangible. Desire for  
progeny, wealth, and name and fame simply could not appear in his mind. But as  
he himself observed: 'A man can overcome the temptation of gold and diamonds  
through renunciation, but he needs the grace of God to overcome lust. Where  
there is lust, there God is not; and where God is, therefore cannot be lust.  
As long as your body is not burned into ashes, do not be proud of your  
chastity. No one can escape Maya unless the Divine Mother allows one to pass'.  
Without having taken any monastic vows, he was a true monk.   
Once Girish Chandra Ghosh presented a Nag Mahashay with a blanket, even though  
he knew he did not accept gifts. Out of his deep respect for Girish, Nag  
Mahashay accepted the blanket by putting it on his head and went home. Later a  
devotee went to visit him and found him seated with the blanket on his head.  
Hearing of this, Girish found a tactful way of taking it back so that Nag  
Mahashay might not suffer any further discomfort.   
Although this type of behaviour seems very strange to ordinary people, it is  
called in devotional scriptures urjhita bhakti, or exuberant devotion. When  
this type of devotion awakens in the heart of an aspirant his behaviour  
becomes erratic. For no outwardly discernable reason he may smile, cry, dance,  
sing, or even remain motionless like a log. The least remainder of the beloved  
puts him into ecstasy.   
Three years later after the passing away of his father, Nag Mahashay became  
seriously ill with colic and dysentery. He said to his wife: 'My prarabdha  
karma (action performed in a past life, the fruit of which is being reaped in  
the present life) has almost come to an end - only a little is left. Don't  
worry about this cage of flesh and bones.'   
The last few days Nag Mahashay was in samadhi off and on. Because Sri  
Ramakrishna had asked him to stay at home and live the life of a householder,  
he had never gone on a pilgrimage to the holy places, although he had once  
gone to Gaya to perform to the last rites for his father. Two days before he  
passed away, at 2' clock in the morning, he said to Sharat Babu: 'Sri  
Ramakrishna has come here to show me the holy places. Please tell me the names  
of holy places you have seen, and I will visit them one after another'. As  
Sharat Babu mentioned the name of each place-Hardwar, Prayag, Varanasi and  
Puri- Nag Mahashay immediately had a vision of it and vividly described what  
he was seeing. Sharat Babu knew he was witnessing the blessing of Sri  
Ramakrishna upon his disciple, yet, seeing Nag Mahashay pain and suffering, he  
could not help thinking that god was a cruel Master. But Nag Mahashay read his  
mind and said: 'please, never doubt the boundless mercy of God. What good will  
this body be to the world? Look, I am bedridden; I cannot serve you, so Sri  
Ramakrishna, out of compassion, is taking away this body'. Then he said in a  
feeble voice, 'Let the body and its suffering know each other; O my mind, you  
be happy'.   
On December 27, 1989, the auspicious time of his final departure came. Nag  
Mahashay was in bhava samadhi. Sharat Babu began to chant the name of Sri  
Ramakrishna in his ear and, placing the picture of the Master in front of him,  
and said 'This is the picture of your Master, in whose name you have renounced  
everything'. Nag Mahashay opened his eyes and saw the face of his beloved  
Master. With folded hands he saluted him and murmured, 'Grace, grace-you  
blessed me out of your boundless mercy'. He then slowly merged into  
mahasamadhi.

Came across this thought provoking story, source, unknown.   
 there was once a woman who was very pious and wise and very religious and  
spiritual. she knew that it was a sin to harm any one and she was very  
conscious of every act of hers. one day while she was sweeping the floor, her  
broom fell on an insect and killed it. this woman went mad with grief and ran  
around the streets of the town crying terribly, saying -oh my god, i have  
killed a creature today, oh my god i have killed a creature today..   
there was an unlettered fisher woman selling fish in the market. she was  
watching this woman's agitation for a long time and then at one point could  
not take it any more. she called her and said - lady, listen to me. .... i  
kill fish for my living every day. ... killing one more insect is not going to  
add to my sins. so i will take that sin off you right now. you please do not  
worry and go and rest in peace.   
this woman happily gave her the dead insect and went away. after praying, she  
fell asleep with a very clear heart. years later, both of them died on the  
same day. the 'pious' womn was being taken to hell when she saw that the  
fisher woman was being led to heaven. thinking there was some confusion, she  
tried calrifying who she was and who the other woman was.   
the god of justice said - oh woman, you presumed yourself so well read, wise  
and pious. . yet you were willing to do anything to cheat yourself and believe  
that u had not sinned. .. wheras the other woman was killing fish as part of  
her duty. .. she took such pity on you that she was willing to increase her  
sin and take it off you so that you could have peace of mind. .   
what use is your 'piety' and 'wisdom' in front of that?

Very interesting story,dear Sri Nagaraj.   
Well,it seems that is much important our very heart,and the motive behind  
every act. Second woman showed compassion and simplicity,which reflect purity  
of the heart. The first one was doing everything for some wrong reasons,i  
think selfish.   
My interpretation can be wrong,thatsts the way i see this story.   
Nice story,indeed worth pondering.   
Thank You Very much!

Dear Sri Jewel,   
Yes, its a beautiful story that makes us ponder. Its like a flash, ligjtning,  
God being present at.all timed and who is a witnesd to everything.   
Here is one small from mahabharata,   
 Vaisampayana said: Thy heart is a witness to the truth or falsehood. He who  
being one thing represents himself as another thing to others, is like a thief  
and a robber of his own self. Of what sin is he not capable? Thou thinkest  
that thou alone hast knowledge of thy deed. But knowest thou not that the  
Ancient, Omniscient one (Narayana) liveth in thy heart? He knoweth all thy  
sins, and thou sinnest in His presence. He that sins thinks that none observes  
him. But he is observed by the gods and by Him also who is in every heart.

Follow Your Heart: The Story of Layla and Majnun   
by J. T. Coker   
Layla and Majnun have been characters for Sufi poets, as Krishna was for the  
poets of India. Majnun means absorption into a thought and Layla means the  
night of obscurity. The story is from beginning to end a teaching on the path  
of devotion, the experience of the soul in search of God. -- Pir-o-Murshid  
Inayat Khan   
The story of Layla and Majnun is one of the most popular in the Islamic world,  
enduring in legends, tales, poems, songs, and epics from the Caucasus to  
Africa and from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Scholars find good reasons  
to believe that the central character -- Qays, nicknamed Majnun (Madman) --  
lived in northern Arabia in the second half of the seventh century, five  
hundred years before the poet Nizami. At the behest of the Transcaucasian  
chieftain Shervanshah, Nizami collected many of the widely dispersed  
traditional versions and wove them into his great narrative poem.   
 The story begins with the Sayyid, a man of wealth, power, and prestige,  
desiring a son and heir. He importunes Allah, who grants his request. The  
beauty of his son Qays "grew to perfection. As a ray of light penetrates the  
water, so the jewel of love shone through the veil of his body." At the age of  
ten, Qays goes to school and meets his kismet/fate, Layla. "Does not 'Layl'  
mean 'night' in Arabic? And dark as the night was the color of her hair." Love  
struck them both; others noticed, tongues wagged, and Qays first tastes  
bitterness. He refrains from seeing her, but his heart breaks and he begins to  
slip into melancholy. Layla's tribe, to protect her (and their) honor, deny  
her right to see him, and he falls into madness: "A madman he became -- but at  
the same time a poet, the harp of his love and of his pain."   
In time Majnun runs away into the wilderness, becoming unkempt, not knowing  
good from evil. His father takes him on pilgrimage to Mecca, to seek God's  
help in freeing him, but Majnun strikes the Kaaba and cries "none of my days  
shall ever be free of this pain. Let me love, oh my God, love for love's sake,  
and make my love a hundred times as great as it was and is!" He continues to  
wander "like a drunken lion," chanting poems of Layla's beauty and his love.  
Many come to hear him. Some write down the poems he spontaneously speaks.   
Meanwhile, Layla holds their love quietly so none will knowshe lived between  
the water of her tears and the fire of her love,. . . Yet her lover's voice  
reached her. Was he not a poet? No tent curtain was woven so closely as to  
keep out his poems. Every child from the bazaar was singing his verses; every  
passer-by was humming one of his love-songs, bringing Layla a message from her  
beloved,. . . -- p. 40   
Refusing suitors, she writes answers to his poems and casts them to the  
wind.It happened often that someone found one of these little papers, and  
guessed the hidden meaning, realizing for whom they were intended. Sometimes  
he would go to Majnun hoping to hear, as a reward, some of the poems which had  
become so popular.. . . Thus many a melody passed to and fro between the two  
nightingales, drunk with their passion. -- p. 41   
Eventually Layla is married to another, but refuses conjugality. Being in  
love, her husband accepts her condition of an outward marriage only. Majnun  
learns of the marriage and of her faithfulness. Neither his father nor his  
mother, when near death, can induce him to return to his people. Wild animals,  
loving rather than fearing him, congregate in his presence, protecting him.  
One night Majnun prays to Allah, thanking Him for making him the pure soul he  
now is and asking God's grace. He sleeps, and in his dream a miraculous tree  
springs from the desert, from which a bird drops a magic jewel onto his head,  
like a diadem.   
An old man, Zayd, helps Layla and Majnun to exchange letters and finally to  
meet, though she cannot approach him closer than ten paces. Majnun  
spontaneously recites love poetry to her, and at dawn they go their separate  
ways.   
Nizami asks: For how long then do you want to deceive yourself? For how long will you  
refuse to see yourself as you are and as you will be? Each grain of sand takes  
its own length and breadth as the measure of the world; yet, beside a mountain  
range it is as nothing. You yourself are the grain of sand; you are your own  
prisoner. Break your cage, break free from yourself, free from humanity; learn  
that what you thought was real is not so in reality. Follow Nizami: burn but  
your own treasure, like a candle -- then the world, your sovereign, will  
become your slave. -- p. 148   
After the death of Layla's husband, she openly mourns her love for Majnun, and  
dies shortly thereafter. Majnun hears of her death and, mad with grief,  
repeatedly visits her tomb. He dies and is buried beside his beloved.   
In a dream, Zayd, who tends their joint grave, has a vision of them in  
paradise, where an ancient soul tells him: These two friends are one, eternal companions. He is Majnun, the king of the  
world in right action. And she is Layla, the moon among idols in compassion.  
In the world, like unpierced rubies they treasured their fidelity  
affectionately, but found no rest and could not attain their heart's desire.  
Here they suffer grief no more. So it will be until eternity. Whoever endures  
suffering and forebears in that world will be joyous and exalted in this  
world. -- p. 176   
On waking Zayd realized that   
Whoever would find a place in that world must tread on the lusts of this  
world. This world is dust and is perishable. That world is pure and eternal..   
.. Commit yourself to love's sanctuary and at once find freedom from your  
ego. Fly in love as an arrow towards its target. Love loosens the knots of  
being, love is liberation from the vortex of egotism. In love, every cup of  
sorrow which bites into the soul gives it new life. Many a draft bitter as  
poison has become in love delicious.. . . However agonizing the experience,  
if it is for love it is well. -- pp. 176-7

**Bulleh Shah and His Master   
Bulleh Shah was born in Syed family. Thus he was descendant of Prophet  
Mohammed. Bulleh Shah was well versed in many scriptures but what ever he knew  
from scriptures was not his personal experience. So Bulleh Shah was searching  
for a Guru. And when ever a seeker is ready, Guru appears. This is the rule of  
existence.   
He had a deep desire to meet his Guru who can take him to other shore. He was  
doing many spiritual practices even before meeting guru and had some spiritual  
powers also. But his heart was not satisfied. His thirst for God was very deep  
and only real experience could have satisfied it.   
One day he heard about one man Inayat Shah who had attained the Ultimate.  
Bulleh Shah belonged to a very rich family but this man was from very low  
caste family land. He was a Gardener.   
When Bulleh Shah first time went to meet Inayat Shah, he was Planting an Onion  
crop. Inayat Shah's back was towards him. Now he didnât had the courage to  
call the attention of Inayat Shah. Bulleh Shah saw there are many mango trees  
in front of Inayat Shah.   
He closed his eyes and remembered Allah for a minute. Mangoes started falling  
from the tree. When mangoes started falling Inayat Shah looked at falling  
mangoes and saw one man standing behind him.   
Inayat Shah said âOh you thief, why you are making these mangoes fallâ   
Bulleh looked here and there but there was no one around. Bulleh shah said  
âif you are asking me then see, I donât have any stone or stick in my  
hand. How can I make these mangoes fallâ   
Inayat Shah said âYou are clever also. What do you want?â   
Bulleh said âI am searching for Godâ and he fell at Inayat Shah feet.   
Inayat Shah said âWhy you are falling below. Look upwards towards me.â   
He looked towards Inayat Shah. And the way Inayat Shah looked at him. Seeing  
so much compassion and love in Inayat Shah eyes Bulleh shah fell in deep love  
with him.   
Sahajo is one lady in whole spiritual history who has sang lot of songs in  
praise of Guru. But Bulleh Shah's love for his Guru was exceptional. Bulleh  
Shah's eyes were always thirsty for his Guru's Vision. His Love for his Guru  
was so intense that once his guru became angry with Bulleh Shah and asked him  
to leave his house immediately.   
Now Bulleh Shah can was in terrible agony. Day and night he was thinking how  
to please his Guru. From some where he came to know that his guru loves dance.

**Maulingaputta and Gautam Buddha   
 : One great philosopher, Maulingaputta, came to Buddha, and he started asking  
questions... questions after questions. Must have been an incarnation of  
Patrick! Buddha listened silently for half an hour. Maulingaputta started  
feeling a little embarrassed because he was not answering, he was simply  
sitting there smiling, as if nothing had happened, and he had asked such  
important questions, such significant questions.   
Finally Buddha said, "Do you really want to know the answer?" Maulingaputta  
said, "Otherwise why should I have come to you? I have traveled at least one  
thousand miles to see you." And remember, in those days, one thousand miles  
was really one thousand miles! It was not hopping in a plane and reaching  
within minutes or within hours. One thousand miles was one thousand miles.   
It was with great longing, with great hope that he had come. He was tired,  
weary from the journey, and he must have followed Buddha because Buddha  
himself was traveling continuously. He must have reached one place and people  
said, "Yes, he was here three months ago. He has gone to the north" \-- so he  
must have traveled north.   
Slowly slowly, he was coming closer and closer and then the day came, the  
great day, when people said, "Just yesterday morning he left; he must have  
reached only the next village. If you rush, if you run, you may be able to  
catch him."   
And then one day he caught up with him, and he was so joyous he forgot all his  
arduous journey and he started asking all the questions he had planned all the  
way along, and Buddha smiled and sat there and asked, "Do you really want to  
have the answer?"   
Maulingaputta said, "Then why have I traveled so long? It has been a long  
suffering -- it seems I have been traveling my whole life, and you are asking,  
'Do you really want the answer?'"   
Buddha said, "I am asking again: Do you really want the answer? Say yes or no,  
because much will depend on it."   
Maulingaputta said, "Yes!"   
Then Buddha said, "For two years sit silently by my side -- no asking, no  
questions, no talking. Just sit silently by my side for two years. And after  
two years you can ask whatsoever you want to ask, and I promise you I will  
answer it."   
A disciple, a great disciple of Buddha, Manjushree, who was sitting underneath  
another tree, started laughing so loudly, started almost rolling on the  
ground. Maulingaputta said, "What has happened to this man? Out of the blue,  
you are talking to me, you have not said a single word to him, nobody has said  
anything to him -- is he telling jokes to himself?"   
Buddha said, "You go and ask him."   
He asked Manjushree. Manjushree said, "Sir, if you really want to ask the  
question, ask right now -- this is his way of deceiving people. He deceived  
me. I used to be a foolish philosopher just like you. His answer was the same  
when I came; you have traveled one thousand miles, I had traveled two  
thousand."   
Manjushree certainly was a great philosopher, more well-known in the country.  
He had thousands of disciples. When he had come he had come with one thousand  
disciples -- a great philosopher coming with his following.   
"And Buddha said, 'Sit silently for two years.' And I sat silently for two  
years, but then I could not ask a single question. Those days of  
silence...slowly slowly, all questions withered away. And one thing I will  
tell you: he keeps his promise, he is a man of his word. After exactly two  
years -- I had completely forgotten, lost track of time, because who bothers  
to remember? As silence deepened I lost track of all time.   
"When two years passed, I was not even aware of it. I was enjoying the silence  
and his presence. I was drinking out of him. It was so incredible! In fact,  
deep down in my heart I never wanted those two years to be finished, because  
once they were finished he would say, 'Now give your place to somebody else to  
sit by my side, you move away a little. Now you are capable of being alone,  
you don't need me so much.'   
Just as the mother moves the child when he can eat and digest and no longer  
needs to be fed on the breast. So," Manjushree said, "I was simply hoping that  
he would forget all about those two years, but he remembered -- exactly after  
two years he asked, 'Manjushree, now you can ask your questions.' I looked  
within; there was no question and no questioner either -- a total silence. I  
laughed, he laughed, he patted my back and said, 'Now, move away.'   
"So, Maulingaputta, that's why I started laughing, because now he is playing  
the same trick again. And this poor Maulingaputta will sit for two years  
silently and will be lost forever, will never be able to ask a single  
question. So I insist, Maulingaputta, if you really want to ask, ASK NOW!"   
From Dhammapada Vol 1 Osho   
Note: Maulingaputta accepted Buddha's condition and realized the Buddha  
Nature.

**Zen Master Rinzai   
One day the Zen monk Rinzai is speaking in a temple. He has gone into a  
sermon, but someone is disturbing him there. So Rinzai stops and asks, "What  
is the matter?" The man stands up and says, "What is soul?" Rinzai takes his  
staff and asks the people to give him way. The man begins to tremble. He never  
expected that such will be the answer.   
Rinzai comes to him, takes hold of his neck with both hands and presses it.  
The man's eyes bulge out. He goes on pressing and asks, "Who are you? Close  
your eyes!" The man closes his eyes. Rinzai goes on asking, "Who are you?" The  
man opens his eyes and laughs and bows down. He says, "I know you have really  
answered what is soul."   
Such a simple device! But the man was ready. Someone asks Rinzai, "Would you  
do the same thing when anybody asks?" He says, "That man was ready. He was not  
just asking for the question's sake, he was ready. The first part was  
fulfilled; he was really asking. This was a life and death question to him: `What is soul?' The first part was fulfilled completely. He was disillusioned  
completely of life, and he was asking, `What is soul?' This life has proved  
just a death to him; now he is asking, `What is life?' So no answer from me  
would have been meaningful. I helped him to just stand still in the present."   
Of course, when someone presses your neck just on the verge of killing you,  
you cannot be in the future, you cannot be in the past. You will be here and  
now. It is dangerous to miss the moment. If you just say to such a man, "Go  
deep and know who you are," the man becomes transformed. He goes into samadhi;  
he stands still in the moment.   
If you are in the present, even for a single moment, you have known, you have  
encountered, and you will never be able to lose the track again.   
Spiritual feeling is to know what is -- what is all this. Not that, this. What  
is all this -- this me speaking, this you hearing, this whole? What is this?  
Just stand, be deep in this. Let it open to you, and let yourself open to it.  
Then there is a meeting. That meeting is the seeking.   
That meeting is the whole search. That is why we have called it yoga. Yoga  
means meeting. The very word yoga means meeting \-- joining again, becoming  
one once more. But so-called spiritual seekers are not seeking any  
spirituality. They are only projecting their desires in a new dimension. And  
no desire can be projected in this spiritual dimension, because this spiritual  
dimension is only open to those who are not desiring. So those who desire go  
on creating new illusions, new dreams.

**King Jayamal - Devotee of Lord Krishna   
There was a king named Jayamal who worshipped Lord Krishna with all his heart.  
Even a small doubt from Mind creates barrier between the Lord and Devotee.  
Only the Heart can converse with the divine. The Heart that is purified by  
fire and tears in separation of beloved, ultimately merges with the Beloved.   
Jayamal used to worship Lord Krishna with complete dedication under the name  
Syamalasundra (Syamala means Black and Sundra means beautiful). He never felt  
the need to worship any other deity.   
As a rule he used to worship his deity till mid-day and he never bothered  
about any thing else during his worship. When a devotee is really worshipping  
its deity from heart then nothing else can bother the devotee. The bliss  
experienced during that time is indescribable.   
The neighboring king came to know of this secret and he attacked Jayamal in  
the early hours of day. Jayamal's soldiers were waiting for their master  
response. But Jayamal felt âthis kingdom was given to me by my lord and if  
he has decided to take it away then what can I do and none will be able to  
harm me if he protects meâ.   
The Real devotee becomes a child and put all its faith on the deity and when  
it happens then the deity takes charge of the devotee's life, as Sri  
Ramakrishna did for Girish. In the mean time Syamalasundra, the deity himself,  
had taken the kingâs horse and alone destroyed the enemies.   
After the worship was over, King Jayamal came out and saw his horse panting  
and covered with sweat and when King Jayamal went to battle field with his  
army he saw the whole army of enemy is destroyed except the king.   
Enemy king told Jayamal about the Blue warrior who destroyed his whole army  
and he is no longer interested in his wealth but he wants to know about the  
Blue warrior who has cast a spell on his heart and soul.   
Both the kings understood that it was Jayamal's deity who had fought the  
battle on his behalf. The Enemy king worshipped Jayamal and through his  
blessings received Lord Krishnaâs grace.   
Source: From âBhaktamalaâ a book by Vaishnava(worshipper of Lord Vishnu)  
saints. But I have read this story in âThe Gospel of Sri Ramakrishnaâ   
Note: In the book âLiving with Himalayan Mastersâ I have read one story  
similar to this in which Sage protects the devotee.**

**How to Stop the Mad Mind   
There is a Sufi story...   
Junaid was going through the market-place of the town with his disciples. And  
it was his way to take any situation and use it. A man was dragging his cow by  
a rope, and Junaid said âWaitâ to the man, and told his disciples  
âSurround this man and the cow. I am going to teach you something.â   
The man stopped â Junaid was a famous mystic â and he was also interested  
in what he was going to teach these disciples and how he was going to use him  
and the cow. And Junaid asked his disciples âI ask you one thing: who is  
bound to whom? Is the cow bound to this man or is this man bound to this  
cow?â Of course, the disciples said âThe cow is bound to the man. The man  
is the master, he is holding the rope, the cow has to follow him wherever he  
goes. He is the master and the cow is the slave.â   
And Junaid said âNow, see.â He took out his scissors and cut the rope â  
and the cow escaped.   
The man ran after the cow, and Junaid said âNow look what is happening! Now  
you see who is the master; the cow is not interested at all in this man â in  
fact, she is escaping.â And the man was very angry, he said âWhat kind of  
experiment is this ?â But Junaid said to his disciples âAnd this is the  
case with your mind.   
All the nonsense that you are carrying inside is not interested in you. You  
are interested in it, you are keeping it together somehow â you are becoming  
mad in keeping it together somehow. But you are interested IN it. The moment  
you lose interest, the moment you understand the futility of it, it will start  
disappearing; like the cow it will escape.â   
People come to me and ask âHow to stop this mad mind?â I say âThere is  
no need to stop, all that is needed is that you become disinterested in it and  
the rope is cut.â That is the meaning of sannyas: become disinterested in  
the mind. That is the meaning of real vairagya, detachment.   
It has nothing to do with renouncing the world, but it certainly has something  
to do with cutting the rope to the mind. Just become disinterested in the  
rubbish and slowly slowly you will see a gap arising. The cloud that used to  
surround you always is getting farther and farther away and, one day, suddenly  
it is no more there.   
And when you are left without mind, that is the state of spiritual perception,  
that is the state of darshan, that is the state when you can see, you have  
eyes; otherwise your eyes are so full of smoke you cannot see.

**Jalaluddin Rumi teachings to his disciples   
 \- One day Jalaluddin Rumi took all his students, disciples *and devotees*  
*to a field. That was his way to teach them things of the beyond, through the  
examples of the world. He was not a theoretician, he was a very practical man.  
The disciples were thinking, âWhat could be the message, going to that  
faraway field... and why canât he say it here?â   
But when they reached the field, they understood that they were wrong and he  
was right. The farmer seemed to be almost an insane man. He was digging a well  
in the field â and he had already dug eight incomplete wells.   
He would go a few feet and then he would find that there was no water. Then he  
would start digging another well... and the same story was continued. He had  
destroyed the whole field and he had not yet found water.   
The master, Jalaluddin Rumi, told his disciples, âCan you understand  
something? If this man had been total and had put his whole energy into only  
one well, he would have reached to the deepest sources of water long ago.   
But the way he is going he will destroy the whole field and he will never be  
able to make a single well. With so much effort he is simply destroying his  
own land, and getting more and more frustrated, disappointed: what kind of a  
desert has he purchased? It is not a desert, but one has to go deep to find  
the sources of water.â   
He turned to his disciples and asked them, âAre you going to follow this  
insane farmer? Sometimes on one path, sometimes on another path, sometimes  
listening to one, sometimes listening to another... you will collect much  
knowledge, but all that knowledge is simply junk, because it is not going to  
give you the enlightenment you were looking for. It is not going to lead you  
to the waters of eternal life.â

Dear Jewell,   
This is like Sri Ramakrishna's story. He said instead of digging many wells,  
where work is only half way done, without getting   
water, dig one well deeper and deeper and you will get plenty of water.

**Three Old Men   
Once three old man came to a house and told the house lady that they are  
hungry. The House lady asked them to come inside the house and eat the food.   
They refused saying âwe three have an agreement between us. Only one of us  
can go inside the houseâ. The woman was surprised to hear their reply and  
asked about the reason. They replied âWe three are wealth, success and  
love. You can invite any one among usâ.   
The woman asked them to wait as she wanted to consult her husband. Woman went  
inside the house and consulted his husband. They decided to invite the Love as  
Love can fill their house.   
So the Woman went outside and asked love to come inside the house. The old man  
who was love got up and walked towards the house.   
Other two old men also got up and started following love. Surprised, the woman  
asked âI only invited Love, why both of you are coming now.â   
The old men replied together âif you would have invited wealth or success,  
other two would have stayed outside. But where ever love goes, we also go with  
him.â**

**MASTER AND DOG,Sufi story   
One day I was going to the fields, accompanied by my faithful dog, guardian of  
our farms and sworn enemy of those monkeys who devastate them. It was the time  
of the great heat of April. My dog and I were so hot that it was only with  
great pain that we were able to breathe properly. I had no doubt that in the  
end one of us, perhaps myself, would faint. Thanks to God we came upon a  
thicket of clustered branches with a thick covering of green leaves. My dog,  
whimpering slightly, raced towards the shadow. But when he reached it, he did  
not stay there, but returned to me, his tongue hanging out, his lips sagging,  
his pointed white teeth, bared. His sides throbbed rapidly making me realise  
how exhausted he was. I moved towards the shade and the dog became happier.  
But I decided to continue on my way. He whined plaintively, but nonetheless  
followed me, his head more bowed, his tail curled between his legs. He was  
visibly in despair, but decided to follow me whatever the consequences.   
This faithfulness touched me deeply. I did not know how to appreciate the act  
of this animal, ready to follow me to the death without any need of his own,  
and without being constrained to do it by anything whatever. He was loyal just  
because he considered me his master. He proved his attachment to me by risking  
his life with the sole aim of following me and being at my side.   
âLord,â I cried in an outburst of feeling, âcure my troubled soul.  
Render my fidelity similar to that of this being whom I disparagingly call  
dog. Give me, like him, the strength to be able to scorn my life when it is a  
question of accomplishing Your will. And give me the strength to follow the  
road on which You place me without asking âWhere am I going?ââ

**_Kodhana Sutta -- An Angry Person (paraphrased)   
Seven things happen to people who are angry, which end up making their enemies  
happy: Some people wish that their enemies become ugly. But when people are angry,  
even if they are well bathed, beautifully dressed, and their hair neatly cut,  
they become ugly themselves! This is exactly what their enemies would wish  
for them!   
Some people wish that their enemies sleep poorly. But when people are angry,  
even if they sleep on luxurious beds, with white sheets, fluffy pillows, and  
beautiful blankets, they will sleep poorly because of their anger. This, too,  
is exactly what their enemies would wish!   
Some wish that their enemies not profit in business. But when people are  
angry, they become confused: When they suffer a loss, they think they are  
making a profit; when they make a profit, they think they are suffering a  
loss. This leads to constant worry, which is exactly what is enemy would  
wish!   
Some wish that their enemies not have any wealth. But when people are angry,  
even if they start out with wealth that they have worked hard to accumulate,  
they will behave badly and may wind up in jail or paying fines for their  
misbehavior, and eventually lose their fortunes. This is exactly what his  
enemy would wish!   
Some wish that ther enemies lose their reputation. But when people are angry,  
whatever reputation they have, and however well earned it may be, will  
disappear, which is exactly what their enemies would wish!   
Some wish that their enemies have no friends. But when people are angry,  
their friends and relatives avoid them because of their temper. This is  
exactly what their enemies would wish!   
And finally, some people wish that their enemies would go to hell. But when  
people are angy, they commit all kinds of sins, in their behavior, their  
speech, and in their minds. When they die, they may find themselves in hell,  
which is exacly what their enemies would wish!   
These are the seven things which happen to angry people, which end up making  
their enemies happy.

**Not everyone desires enlightenment. Sometimes, all we want is to be able  
to meet once again the ones we love: Samajivina Sutta -- Living in Tune   
Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.   
Once the Blessed One was staying among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at  
Bhesakala Grove, near Crocodile Haunt. Then early in the morning the Blessed  
One put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to the home  
of the householder, Nakula's father. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made  
ready. Then Nakula's father & Nakula's mother went to the Blessed One and, on  
arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting  
there, Nakula's father said to the Blessed One: "Lord, ever since Nakula's  
mother as a young girl was brought to me [to be my wife] when I was just a  
young boy, I am not conscious of being unfaithful to her even in mind, much  
less in body. We want to see one another not only in the present life but also  
in the life to come."   
And Nakula's mother said to the Blessed One: "Lord, ever since I as a young  
girl was brought to Nakula's father [to be his wife] when he was just a young  
boy, I am not conscious of being unfaithful to him even in mind, much less in  
body. We want to see one another not only in the present life but also in the  
life to come."   
[The Blessed One said:] "If both husband & wife want to see one another not  
only in the present life but also in the life to come, they should be in tune  
[with each other] in conviction, in tune in virtue, in tune in generosity, and  
in tune in discernment. Then they will see one another not only in the present  
life but also in the life to come."   
 _Husband & wife, both of them   
 having conviction,   
 being responsive,   
 being restrained,   
 living by the Dhamma,   
 addressing each other   
 with loving words:  they benefit in manifold ways.   
 To them comes bliss.   
 Their enemies are dejected   
 when both are in tune in virtue.   
 Having followed the Dhamma here in this world,   
 both in tune in precepts & practices,   
 they delight in the world of the devas,   
 enjoying the pleasures they desire._   
Buddha**

**Dhul-Nun al-Misri (the Egyptian) and how he was converted   
Dhul-Nun al-Misri the Egyptian told the following story of his conversion.   
 I was informed that in a certain place an ascetic was living. I set forth to  
visit him, and found him suspending himself from a tree.   
âO body,â he was saying, âassist me to obey God, else I will keep you  
hanging like this until you die of hunger.â   
A fit of weeping overcame me. The devotee heard me crying.   
âWho is this,â he called, âwho has compassion upon one whose shame is  
little and whose crimes are many?â   
I approached him and gave him greeting.   
âWhat is this state of affairs?â I asked.   
âThis body of mine gives me no peace to obey God,â he replied. âIt wants  
to mingle with other men.â   
I supposed that he must have shed a Muslimâs blood, or committed some other  
deadly sin.   
âDid you not realize,â the ascetic said to me, âthat once you mingle  
with other men, everything else follows?â   
âWhat a tremendous ascetic you are!â I cried.   
âWould you like to see someone more ascetic than I?â he said   
âI would,â I said.   
âGo into yonder mountain,â he said. âThere you will see.â   
I proceeded thither, and saw a young man squatting in a hermitage; one foot  
had been amputated and flung out of the cell, and the worms were devouring it.  
I approached him and saluted him, then I enquired after his circumstances.   
âOne day,â he told me, âI was seated in this hermitage when a woman  
happened to pass by. My heart inclined towards her and my body demanded of me  
to go after her. I put one foot out of the cell, then I heard a voice saying,  
âAre you not ashamed, after serving and obeying God for thirty years, an now  
you obey Satan and chase a loose woman?â So I cut off the foot that I had  
set outside the hermitage, and now I sit here waiting for what will transpire  
and what they will do with me. What business has brought you to such sinners?  
If you desire to see a man of God, proceed to the top of this mountain.â   
The mountain was too high for me to reach the top, so I enquired about this  
man.   
âYes,â I was told. âIt is a long time now that a man has been serving  
God in that cell. One day a man came along and disputed with him, saying that  
daily bread was meant for earning. The devotee vowed that he would eat nothing  
that involved the acquisition of material possessions. For many days he ate  
nothing. Then Almighty God sent a cloud of bees to hover around him and give  
him honey.â   
The things I had seen and the words I had heard caused a mighty pain to clutch  
my heart. I realized that whoever puts his trust in God, God cares for him and  
suffers not his anguish to be in vain. As I went on my way, I saw a blind  
little bird perched in a tree. It fluttered down from the tree.   
âWhere will this helpless creature get food and water?â I cried.   
The bird dug the earth with its beak and two saucers appeared, one of gold  
containing grain and the other of silver full of rosewater. The bird ate its  
fill, then it flew up into the tree and the saucers vanished.   
Utterly dumbfounded, Dhul-Nun al-Misri thenceforward put his trust in God  
completely, and was truly converted. He pushed on several stages, and when  
night fell he came to a desert. In that desert he sighted a jar of gold and  
jewels, and on the top of the jar a tablet on which was written the name of  
God. His companions divided the gold and the jewels between them.   
âGive me the tablet on which is written the name of my Friend,â Dhul-Nun  
al-Misri cried.   
And he took the tablet. He kissed the tablet all through the day and night,  
till by the blessing of the tablet he so progressed that one night he dreamed  
a voice said to him, âAll the rest chose the gold and jewels, for they are  
precious. You chose what was loftier than that, my Name. Therefore I have  
opened to you the door of knowledge and wisdom.â   
Dhul-Nun al-Misri then returned to the city. His story continues.   
I was walking one day when I reached the margin of a river. By the water I saw  
a pavilion. I proceeded to make my ablutions, and when I had finished my eye  
suddenly fell on the roof of the pavilion. On the balcony I saw a very  
beautiful girl standing. Wanting to prove her, I said, âMaiden, to whom do  
you belong?â   
âDho âl-Nun,â replied she, âwhen you appeared from afar I supposed you  
were a madman. When you came nearer, I supposed you were a scholar. When you  
came still nearer, I supposed you were a mystic. Now I see you are neither  
mad, nor a scholar, nor a mystic.â   
âWhy do you say that?â I demanded.   
âIf you had been a madman,â she replied, âyou would not have made your  
ablutions. If you had been a scholar, you would not have gazed at that which  
is prohibited you. If you had been a mystic, your eye would have fallen upon  
naught but God. â   
So saying, she vanished. I then realized that she was not a mortal creature,  
but had been sent as a warning. A fire invaded my soul, and I flung myself in  
the direction of the sea.   
When I reached the seashore, I saw a company of men embarked in a ship. I also  
embarked in that ship. After some days had passed, by chance a jewel belonging  
to a merchant was   
lost on board. One by one the passengers were taken and searched. Finally they  
reached the unanimous conclusion that the jewel was on me. They set about  
belabouring me and treated me with great disrespect, whilst I remained silent.  
At last I could endure no more.   
âO Creator, Thou knowest,â I cried.   
Thousands of fishes thereupon put their heads out of the water, each with a  
jewel in its mouth.   
Dhul-Nun al-Misri took one of the jewels and gave it to the merchant. All on  
board when they saw this fell at his feet and begged his pardon. So highly was  
he considered in the eyes of men. That was why he was called Dhul-Nun al-Misri  
(âThe Man of the Fishâ).   
Dho âI-Nun is arrested and taken to Baghdad   
When Dhul-Nun al-Misri had already attained a high degree, no one recognized  
his true greatness. The people of Egypt denounced him unanimously as a  
heretic, and informed the caliph Motawakkel of his activities. Motawakkel sent  
officers to convey him to Baghdad in fetters. When he entered the caliphâs  
court he declared, âThis very hour I have learned true Islam from an old  
woman, and true chivalry from a water-carrier.â   
âHow is that?â he was asked.   
âWhen I reached the caliphâs palace,â he replied, âand beheld that  
court in all its magnificence, with the chamberlains and attendants thronging  
its passages, I wished that some change might take place in my appearance. A  
woman with a stick in her hand came up and, looking straight at me, addressed  
me.   
ââDo not be afraid of the body before whom they are taking you, for he and  
you are both servants of one   
Almighty Lord. Unless God wills it, they can do nothing to His servant.â   
âThen on the road I saw a water-carrier. He gave me a draught of pure water.  
I made a sign to one who was with me to give the man a dinar. He refused to  
take it.   
ââYou are a prisoner and in bonds,â he said. âIt would not be true  
chivalry to take anything from such a prisoner, a stranger in bonds.â â   
After that it was ordered that he should be put in prison. Forty days and  
nights he remained in gaol, and every day the sister of Beshr the Barefoot  
brought him a loaf, the earnings of her spindle. The day when he came out of  
prison, the forty loaves remained intact, not one having been eaten. When  
Beshrâs sister heard of this, she became very sad.   
âYou know that those loaves were lawful food and unsolicited. Why did you  
not eat them?â she protested.   
âBecause the plate was not clean,â Dhul-Nun al-Misri replied, meaning that  
it had been handled by the gaoler.   
As Dhul-Nun al-Misri came out of the prison he stumbled and cut his forehead.  
It is related that much blood flowed, but not one drop fell on his face, his  
hair or his clothes, and all the blood that fell on the ground vanished at  
once, by the command of Almighty God.   
Then they brought him before the caliph, and he was ordered to answer the  
charges preferred against him.   
He explained his doctrine in such a manner that Motawakkel burst into tears,  
and all his ministers stood in wonder at his eloquence. So the caliph became  
his disciple, and accorded him high honour.   
 Dhul-Nun al-Misri**

**Lying is such an institutionalized part of modern society it is hard for  
many of us to imagine a world without it. Buddha has a lesson for his son in  
this sutra: *Ambalatthikarahulovada Sutta -- Lesson for Rahula at Mango Stone*(paraphrased)   
When Rahula, Buddha's son, was seven, he set out some water for his father to  
wash his feet. Buddha picked up a ladle full of the water and began to wash.  
He showed his son the ladle with a little bit of water left in it and said  
"This is how little worth is left in someone who isn't ashamed at telling a  
lie."   
Tossing away the little bit of water, he said "What little honor is left in  
someone who is not ashamed when telling a lie is tossed away just like that."   
Turning the ladle upside down, he said "What little honor there is in someone  
who is not ashamed is turned upside down just like that."   
And showing Rahula the empty ladle, he said "What little honor there is in  
someone who is not ashamed is empty and hollow just like that."   
"A royal elephant going into battle who holds back in the fight hasn't given  
of himself fully. But when he gives his all, there is nothing he will not do.  
The same thing is true of someone who is not ashamed when they tell a lie: There is no evil he will not do! So train yourself not to lie, even in jest.   
"What do your think a mirror is for?"   
"For reflection, sir."   
"Just like a mirror, you actions, whether they are physical, verbal, or  
mental, should be done with constant reflectiion.   
"When you are considering doing something, reflect on it: Is this something  
which will cause harm to myself or others? If so, stop yourself from doing  
it. If not, if it leads to happy consequences, you may feel free to do it.  
While you are doing something, reflect on it: Is this act harming anyone? If  
so, stop. If not, go ahead. After you have done something, reflect on what  
you have done. If it resulted in harm to yourself or others, confess it to  
your teacher or companions, and resolve to restrain yourself in the future.  
If the act had happy consequences, then be joyful.   
"The same things apply to verbal acts. Before, during, and after you say  
something, reflect on it. If it seems that your speech will have or does have  
negative consequences, then restrain yourself or, if you are too late, confess  
and resolve to do better in the future. If what you have to say has positive  
consequences, then go ahead.   
"And the same thing applies to mental acts. Reflect on them, before, during,  
and after. If a thought has negative consequences, abandon it or, if it is  
too late, be ashamed and resolve to improve. If the thought has positive  
qualities, then act upon it.   
"Before, during, and after, reflect on your behavior, and purify yourself this  
way."   
Liberally paraphrased from That the True Dhamma Might Last a Long Time: Readings Selected by King Asoka, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu  
(www.accesstoinsight.org).

**Story of Solomon the son of David and the lovesick ant   
'Solomon, in the midst of all his occupations, passed by a swarm of ants on  
the roadside.All the ants came forward to do obeisance; in an hour many  
thousands had come.   
But one ant did not come quickly before him because there was a mound of earth  
in front of its home.With the speed of the wind that ant was carrying out each  
separate particle of earth so that that mound might be cleared away.   
Solomon summoned it and said: "0 ant, I perceive thee to be without strength  
or endurance,And yet if thou wert to acquire the lifes pan of Noah and the  
patience of Job,thy task would not be accomplished.This is no task for the arm  
of thy likes; thou wilt not cause this mound to disappear."   
The ant opened its mouth and said: "0 king, by high endeavour one can proceed  
along this road.   
Look not at my constitution and build, have regard to the perfection of my  
endeavour.There is a certain she-ant who is invisible to me and who had drawn  
me into the snare other love.   
She has said to me: 'If thou removest this mound of earth from here and  
clearest the way,I will cast on one side the boulder of separation from thee  
and then sit together with thee.'Now my loins are girded for this task; I know  
about nothing except this carrying of earth.   
If this earth is made to disappear I can achieve union with her,And if I die  
in this endeavour, at least I shall not be an idle boaster and a liar."â   
Friend, learn of love from an ant; learn of such sight from one who is  
blind.Though the ant's cloak is very black, yet it is one of the attendants on  
the road.   
Look not with contempt upon an ant, for it too has passion in its heart.I know  
not what state of affairs it is upon this road when a lion is chid by an  
ant.â

**Story of Nushirv and the Just and the aged cultivator   
Nushirvan was riding his horse with the speed of an arrow when he saw in the  
road an old man [bent] like a bow.   
The old man was planting a number of trees. The king said to him: "Sincethy  
hair has turned to milk,And since thou wilt remain only a few more days, why  
art thou planting trees here?"   
The old man replied: "There is reason enough. Since many have planted for  
us,So that today we have the benefit thereof, we too are planting for others.  
One should take each step in accordance with one's capacity, for in every step  
there should be order.   
The king was pleased with the old man's speech. He filled his hand with gold  
and said: "Take this."   
The old man said to him: "0 victorious king, already today my trees have borne  
fruit.   
For If I live to be over seventy thou knowest that I have not fared badly by  
this planting. The planting did not make me wait ten years; it has borne gold  
as fruit this very day."   
The king was even more pleased with this reply of his, and he bestowed upon  
him the land, the village and the water.â   
Thou must perform thy labour today for without labour thou wilt have no fruit.  
Thou must set thy foot on the road of the Faith, thou must lay aside vanity.   
If thou art a man, then like a man make thy beard a broom for the privy. Art  
thou not ashamed with all that strength of arm to place thy weight on the  
scales? Thou art less than a dog. Listen to this story if thou think thyself  
more than a dog.'

**The independent man   
Many hundreds of years ago there were two man of Kabul who fell upon very hard  
times. They lost all they owned and suffered great hardship and poverty. So  
great was their misfortune that, try as they might, they could not improve  
their position. Always something happened to them to cause them a setback.  
Great were the bodily hunger and distress of mind, which they suffered. Grief  
and sorrow lay upon them like a heavy cloud. One day one man said to the  
other: âWe have suffered much and have toiled hard, yet there seems no hope  
of improving our lot. Let us leave this country and seek our fortune  
elsewhere. Surely that would be a wise move. The good sultan Mahmud is now  
reigning, and he is well known for his generosity. Let us go to Ghazna and try  
to see him. Then at least it will give us some hope that our miserable  
circumstances may be alteredâ.   
So they set out for Ghazna and on the road they met a man who joined their  
company and walked with them. He was a very pious man and he seemed happy and  
contented; indeed it was as if he walked the earth like one of the blessed.   
âTell me, my brothersâ, he asked the two men, âwhere are you going? And  
what is the purpose of your journey?â   
âWe have both suffered great and prolonged misfortune and have endured great  
hardshipâ, the two men replied. âIn Kabul we have toiled hard and long and  
have yet failed to improve our lot, and having heard of the great generosity  
of sultan Mahmud and his concern for the poor and needy we have decided to  
make our way to him in the hope that he will look kindly upon us and help us  
back on the road of prosperityâ.   
The two men of Kabul then asked the stranger whither he was bound and what the  
object of his journey was.   
âI, too, have nothing I can call my own in my country and my affairs too are  
going badlyâ, he replied. âI go in search of some lawful means of support,  
but I do not expect anything from sultan Mahmud or anyone like him. Sultan  
Mahmud and his kind are besieged by a hundred thousand men all hoping that he  
in his infinite grace and bounty will bestow some gift or favour upon them. I  
shall look elsewhere for a solution to my difficultiesâ.   
The three men continued their journey in company and when at length they  
arrived in Ghazna they took up their lodging together in a ruined building.   
One night the three men were sitting together in the ruin talking of this and  
that, and it so happened that at this time sultan Mahmud had left his palace  
with two close friends to take a walk in the moonlight. As they approached the  
ruin the sultan was attracted by the sound of voices; he walked on, discovered  
the three travellers and asked them who they were.   
The two men of Kabul replied: âWe have been crushed in the press of poverty  
and misfortune and are now distressed and helpless. We left our own country to  
seek some betterment of our lot elsewhere. Fate has led us hither and we hope  
that somehow, somewhere, the cloud of misery which envelops us will be  
liftedâ.   
âAnd what are your wishes?â inquired the sultan.   
âEven if we say what our wishes are we know they will never be fulfilledâ,  
said the two men of Kabul. âWhat useful purpose will be served by reciting  
them?â   
And the sultan said: âIt is the duty of men to help each other. Therefore,  
tell me your desires that I at least may know how you could be helpedâ.   
The first man replied: âI was once prosperous and had great wealth. This  
world, with its chances and changes, ceased to be lucky for me, and the shame  
of my poverty and the disgrace of my family have caused me to leave my  
country. Now, if I had ten thousand dinars I could regard the sum as fresh  
capital and could then raise my head again and return to my countryâ.   
The second man replied: âI had a dutiful and loving wife. The loveliness of  
her features surpassed the rose in beauty; the radiance of her face made the  
moon seem to decline in splendour. I loved her much and could not bear to be  
parted from her. But she died and I was so consumed with grief that I felt  
lost and helpless. If his highness the sultan were to present me with a member  
of his harem so that my life might once more be lighted by the sun of her  
presence, I would gladly return to my own countryâ.   
The third man remaining silent, the sultan turned to him and said: âAnd have  
you no wish?â And the third man answered: âI place all my trust in God. I need neither a wife nor gold. I turn my face  
towards the mercy of God by Whom all favours are granted. All our desires are  
known to God and God knows what we deserve. I place myself in His hands; He  
will grant whatever is right for me. All I ask of you is this: if you enjoy  
the favour of God and if He grants you your desires, please pray to Him for my  
sake that I may never follow a line of thought or action which is against His  
willâ.   
The sultan said no more and, without letting it be known who he was, rose and  
departed. Next morning he ordered that the three strangers whom he had met in  
the ruin be brought to his presence.   
When the men saw the sultan and realised that he was the man with whom they  
had spoken on the previous evening, they thought at first that he was going to  
be angry with them. But the sultan asked each to step forward in turn and  
state his wants, and the two men of Kabul repeated what they had said before.  
When it was the turn of the third man to step forward and speak he said: âBegging leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Sweet is the generosity of the  
noble-minded. O most kind of the rulers, may the treasury of your desires  
remain filled with the gold, silver and jewels of prosperity so long as the  
storehouse of God is full of blessings. Although many rejoice in your bounty  
and you yourself know the sweet taste of good deeds, those who have found  
their peace with God are so contented that they have no desire to take  
anything from another man. Contentment is not sweetened by the generosity of  
others and the delights of independence are far greater than any pleasure  
there may be in receiving gifts from others. I submit my hopes and longings  
only to God; He will grant what is right and good for me. I have no need to  
ask another man for anythingâ.   
Now the sultan, who was not used to meeting such independence, tried to  
persuade the man to ask for some gift or favour, but the man could not be  
shaken from his avowed principles. The sultan then gave orders that the man  
who wanted a wife should be given one of the sultanâs own damsels, while the  
man who wanted money was presented with two purses of gold. He then commanded  
that all three men should return to their own countries. The three men  
accordingly set out on the road back to Kabul.   
When the companions had walked about seven miles the man who had been given  
the gold began to feel tired from the weight of it so he handed it to his  
empty-handed friend, requesting him to carry it until he had rested a while.   
After the three men had left the presence of the sultan, the ruler turned to  
his courtiers and said: âThat independent man has put me greatly to shame.  
Although I tried to persuade him to accept a gift of some kind he would take  
nothing and when he left me I felt as if I was in the position of a poor  
manâ.   
Now one of the courtiers was a very greedy man, and greedy men are the natural  
enemies of the contented. âThe sultans and kings of this worldâ â said  
the greedy courtier â âare Godâs treasurers. Men who will not turn to  
their rulers for help or scorn their favours are guilty of the sin of pride  
and act contrary to the will of God. Such men deserve to die and should be  
punishedâ.   
This statement greatly excited the sultan and he at once ordered one of his  
chamberlains to hasten along the road which the three men had taken and,  
leaving undisturbed the man with the gold and the man with the girl, to seize  
the man

Lord Vithal, or Panduranga Vittala, is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and is  
worshipped in the world famous Pandarpur Rukmini Vithal Temple at Pandarpur in  
Maharashtra. There is an interesting story that explains about the incarnation  
of Lord Vithal at Pandarpur.   
Once a devotee named **Pundalik** was traveling to Kashi and reached the  
Ashram of Saint Kukkut. He asked the sage the way to Kashi. Kukkut Rishi said  
that he did not know the way to Kashi and he had never been there.   
Pundalik made fun of Kukkut Rishi for not knowing the way to Kashi and said  
that a holy man like him should have already visited Kashi. Kukkut Rishi kept  
quiet and did not bother to answer Pundalik.   
 During the course of the night Pundalik heard the voice of women in the  
ashram.   
He came to out to look what was happening and saw that three women were  
sprinkling water on the Ashram and cleaning it.   
On enquiry, Pundalik found out that the three women were Ganga, Yamuna and  
Saraswathi and they had come to clean the Ashram of Kukkut Rishi. Pundalik  
wondered how a saint like Kukkut who had not visited Kashi was such holy and  
powerful that the three holy rivers came down to purify his ashram.   
The three women told Pundalik that piety, spirituality and devotion does not  
depend on visiting holy places or doing costly rituals but in performing one?s  
karma.   
The three women told him that Sage Kukkut had served and nursed his parents  
most faithfully and devoted all his life to that one aim. He had thus  
accumulated Punya enough to earn Moksha and bring us down to earth to serve  
him.   
Pundalik had left is old parents at home and was visiting Kashi to gain moksha  
and blessing. He did not bother to entertain the request of his parents to  
take them also to Kashi.   
 Pundalik now understood his mistake and rushed back home and took his  
parents to Kashi and on return started looking after them. From then onwards  
the care of his old mother and father came before everything else.   
Lord Krishna was moved by the sincere devotion of Pundalik towards his  
parents. He decided to visit Pundalik?s home.   
When Lord Krishna visited Pundalik?s home he was serving food to his old  
parents.   
Pundalik saw the Lord at his door but his devotion to his parents was so  
intense that he wanted to finish his duties first and then attend to his  
guest. Pundalik had reached such a stage that it didn?t matter to him whether  
the guest was a mere mortal or God. All that mattered was service to his  
parents.   
 Pundalik gave Lord Krishna a brick to stand on and asked Him to wait until  
his duty was completed. Lord Krishna was moved by the devotion of Pundalik to  
his parents and waited for him patiently.   
Later when Pundalik came out he asked the Lord forgiveness for making Him  
wait. Lord Krishna blessed him and asked him to ask a boon.   
Pundalik said what more can I ask when the Lord himself waits for me.   
When Lord Krishna insisted that he ask a boon, Pundalik asked that the Lord  
should remain on earth and bless and take care of His devotees.   
Lord Krishna agreed to stay there and is known as Vithoba or the Lord who  
stands on a brick. This form of the Lord Vithoba is Swayambhu which means that  
His idol has not been carved or etched but it came into existence on its own.

Nagaraj,   
What a wonderful story!Thanks very much.   
In this excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna where the master talks  
about Debts to parents: A long conversation ensued about Ram's household affairs. Ram's father was a  
devout Vaishnava and worshipped Krishna daily at home. He had married a second  
time when Ram was quite young. Both the father and the stepmother lived with  
Ram at Ram's house. But Ram was never happy with his stepmother, and this  
sometimes created a misunderstanding between himself and his father.   
They were talking about this when Ram said, "My father has gone to the dogs!"   
MASTER (to the devotees): **" Did you hear that? The father has gone to the  
dogs and the son is all right!**"   
RAM: "There is no peace when my stepmother comes home. There is always some  
trouble or other. Our family is about to break up. So I say, let her live with  
her father."   
GIRINDRA (to Ram): "Why don't you too keep your wife at her father's home?"  
(Laughter)   
MASTER (smiling): "Are husband and wife like earthen pots or jars, that you  
may keep the pot in one place and the lid in another? Siva in one place and  
Sakti in another?"   
RAM: "Sir, we are quite happy. But when she comes the family is broken up. If  
such is the case-"   
 **Our duties to father and mother**   
MASTER: "Then build them a separate home. That will be a different thing. You  
will defray their monthly expenses. How worthy of worship one's parents are!   
 Rakhal asked me if he could take the food left on his father's plate. 'What  
do you mean?' I said. 'What have you become that you cannot?' But it is also  
true that good people won't give anyone, even a dog, the food from their  
plates."   
GIRINDRA: "Sir, suppose one's parents are guilty of a terrible crime, a  
heinous sin?"   
MASTER: "What if they are? You must not renounce your mother even if she  
commits adultery. The woman guru of a certain family became corrupt. The  
members of the family said that they would like to make the son of the guru  
their spiritual guide. But I said: 'How is that? Will you accept the shoot and  
give up the yam? Suppose she is corrupt; still you must regard her as your  
Ishta. "Though my guru visits the tavern, still to me he is the holy  
Nityananda." '   
 **" Are father and mother mere trifles? No spiritual practice will bear fruit  
unless they are pleased**. Chaitanya was intoxicated with the love of God.  
Still, before taking to the monastic life, for how many days did he try to  
persuade his mother to give him her permission to become a monk! He said to  
her: 'Mother, don't worry. I shall visit you every now and then.'   
 _(To M., reproachfully) "And let me say this to you. Your father and mother  
brought you up. You yourself are the father of several children. Yet you have  
left home with your wife. You have cheated your parents. You have come away  
with your wife and children, **and you feel you have become a holy man**. Your  
father doesn't need any money from you; otherwise I should have cried, 'Shame  
on you!'_"   
Everybody in the room became grave and remained silent.   
continued...

An Excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna where the Master asks M whether  
he can do prostration to his father:  **Advice to M**   
The Master was still in the ecstatic mood. Suddenly he said to M: "Look here,  
you have had enough of reasoning. No more of it. Promise that you won't reason  
any more."   
M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir. I won't."   
MASTER: "You have had enough of it. When you came to me the first time, I told  
you your spiritual Ideal. I know everything about you, do I not?"   
M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir."   
MASTER: "Yes, I know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside  
and outside, the events of your past lives, and your future. Do I not?"   
M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir."   
MASTER: "I scolded you on learning that you had a son. Now go home and live  
there. Let them know that you belong to them. But you must remember in your  
heart of hearts that you do not belong to them nor they to you."   
M. sat in silence. The Master went on instructing him.   
MASTER: " **You have now learnt to fly. But keep your loving relationship with  
your father. Can 't you prostrate yourself before him?**"   
M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir. I can."   
MASTER: "What more shall I say to you? You, know everything. You understand,  
don't you?"   
M. sat there without uttering a word.   
MASTER: "You have understood, haven't you?"   
M: " _Yes, sir, I now understand a little._ "   
MASTER: " **No, you understand a great deal**. Rakhal's father is pleased  
about his staying here."   
M. remained with folded hands.   
MASTER: "Yes, what you are thinking will also come to pass."   
One book(It is not just a Book!) I invariably recommend over and over again is  
this-The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.It addresses almost all circumstances and  
doubts that an aspirant can possibly encounter and gives definitive course of  
action.Truly indispensable for all aspirants.   
Namaskar.

Lives of Saints: **Sant Eknath**, Dec 31, 2009 by varsha(From Amrita Bala  
Kendra)   
Sant Eknath is one of the greatest saints of Maharashtra. He was born in  
Paithan on the banks of the Godavari River around 1533. Paithan is a holy  
place, and in those days it was a centre of Sanskrit learning, as well as of  
Brahminical orthodoxy. Eknath was the great grandson of the well-known saint,  
Saint Bhanudas. His parents died when he was three years old, and he was  
brought up by his grandparents.   
He became a disciple of Janardana Swami who lived a little distance away from  
his town. One story has it that he ran away from home and stayed with his Guru  
for 12 years. Another story says that he was entrusted to Janardana Swami by  
his grandfather Chakrapani. This is more likely since there are historical  
records which show that Janardana Swami and Chakrapani were scholars and good  
friends.   
His Guru made him undergo spiritual disciplines and taught him Sanskrit  
grammar, philosophy and basic texts of Vedanta and other holy books. It was  
here that Eknath studied the Jnaneshwari, Jnandeva's commentary on the  
Bhagavad Gita, and his mastery of this classic comes through in his writings.  
Janardana Swami was a state official, and Eknath helped him in his official  
work.   
Essentially, however, Janardana Swami was interested in his disciple's  
spiritual progress and he took every opportunity to drive home a lesson. On  
one occasion he asked Eknath to square up the accounts. Eknath discovered that  
there was a discrepancy of one adhela (the equivalent of one paisa) in the  
accounts, and he sat up all night to rectify it. He danced with joy when the  
accounts were finally squared up. Seeing his jubilation, his Guru remarked,  
"If you have the same concentration and devotion for Lord Krishna, you will  
realize the Truth and attain everlasting happiness."   
When Eknath had completed his education, Guru and disciple went on a  
pilgrimage. At Tryambakeshwar (near Nasik) they heard a discourse on the four  
fundamental slokas of the Bhagavat Mahapurana (Canto II 9:32-9:35) given by  
Pundit Chandroba in Sanskrit. Janardana Swami asked his disciple Eknath to  
translate them into Marathi and to write his own commentary, so that ordinary  
people could enjoy it. Eknath did this, and the result was the Chatusloki-  
Bhagvat, his first important work. Eknath was a great Guru-bhakta and he  
attributed not just this first book but all his works to his Guru's  
inspiration, invariably writing "Eka-Janardana" (Eknath of Janardana) as his  
signature.   
After his education, as per his Guru's instructions, Eknath settled into a  
householder's life. He married Girijabai from Bijopur. She proved to be a  
saintly woman, a lifelong companion and a great support. Eknath is a  
remarkable example of a man who blended worldly life and spiritual  
attainments. He lived in the world but was not of it, and achieved complete  
renunciation in the midst of activity. He was a prolific writer who wrote a  
number of abhangas (hymns) and bharudas (short allegorical poems), besides  
philosophical and devotional works. He spent his life spreading the gospel of  
Lord Krishna among the masses, not in Sanskrit, but in Marathi, their own  
language. This frequently brought him in conflict with the orthodox sections  
of society.   
His most important work is the Eknathi Bhagavat. It is his commentary on Canto  
XI of the Bhagavat Mahapurana -- the dialogue between Lord Krishna and  
Uddhava. Composed between 1570 and 1573, it was begun in Paithan and completed  
in Varanasi. There is an interesting story behind this. After the first five  
preliminary chapters had been completed, one of his disciples took them to  
Varanasi and recited them on the banks of the Ganges River. The pundits of  
Varanasi took umbrage at what they called the "pollution" of the holy text in  
the language of the shudras (the lowest caste). Eknath was summoned to  
Varanasi and asked for an explanation. He requested that he be given an  
opportunity to present his work before judgment was passed. This was given  
reluctantly. In fact, the chief pundit even kept a curtain between himself and  
Eknath, so that he would not be polluted. Then Eknath started reciting his  
poem. So beautiful was the melody, so profound the philosophy, and so moving  
the mystical imageries created by him, that the audience of learned pundits  
became ecstatic. The chief pundit tore down the curtain and requested him to  
complete the work in Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges. After completion,  
the work was paraded on the back of an elephant, through the streets of  
Varanasi.   
Like many poets-saints of the period, Sant Eknath creates a fusion of bhakti  
(devotion) and advaita (non-duality). The reflection of God in the soiled  
mirror of avidya (ignorance) is jiva (individual soul), and in the clear  
mirror of vidya (knowledge) it is Shiva -- the difference is not real. He  
emphasised the practice of bhajan singing, nama-smarana (chanting the Lord's  
name), purity of conduct, meditation, discharging one's duties, retirement  
into solitude from time to time, and saguna bhakti (devotion to the Divine  
with a form) leading to Nirguna (formless). His ideal was to see God  
everywhere and in everything (Gita, Ch. IX, s 1:29-30).   
continued...

**The Magic Horse   
A king had two sons. The first helped the people by working for them in a  
manner they understood. The second was called 'Lazy' because he was a dreamer,  
as far as anyone could see.   
The first son gained great honours in his land. The second obtained from a  
humble carpenter a wooden horse and sat astride it. But the horse was a  
magical one. It carried the rider, if he was sincere, to his heart's desire.   
Seeking his heart's desire, the young prince disappeared one day on the horse.  
He was absent a long time. After many adventures he returned with a beautiful  
princess from the Country of Light, and his father was overjoyed at his safe  
return and listened to the story of the magic horse.   
The horse was made available to anyone who wanted it in that country. But many  
people preferred the obvious benefits which the actions of the first prince  
provided for them because to them the horse always looked like a plaything.  
They did not get beyond the outer appearance of the horse, which was not  
impressive - just like a plaything.   
When the old king died, the 'prince who liked to play with toys' became, by  
his wish, the king. But people in general despised him. They much preferred  
the excitement and interest of the discoveries and activities of the practical  
prince.   
Unless we listen to the 'lazy' prince, whether he has a princess from the  
Country of Light with him or not, we shall not get beyond the outer appearance  
of the horse.. Even if we like the horse, it is not its outward shape which  
can help us travel to our destination.

**The Way Out   
Bees seem to have something like human minds, exactly the same kind of  
stupidity. The doors may be open, but if a bee is inside the room, caught  
inside the room... and she may have come from the open door but she will try  
to get out from the closed window. Not only bees but other birds also behave  
in the same way. Any bird can enter in your room; the doors are open, he has  
come from the door, but he cannot go back from the same door.   
He starts trying to get through the wall, through the ceiling... and the more  
he tries, the more desperate he becomes, because there is no way to get  
through the ceiling or through the wall or through the closed window. And in  
that desperation, frustration he becomes more and more blind, afraid, scared.  
He loses all intelligence. And the same is the case with human beings.   
One day Buddha came into his assembly of the monks. It must have been just a  
morning like this. His sannyasins were sitting and waiting for him. They were  
puzzled because this was for the first time that Buddha had come with  
something in his hand â a handkerchief. They all looked at the handkerchief  
What was the matter? There must be something special in it. And Buddha sat on  
the platform and rather than starting speaking to the assembly he looked at  
the handkerchief, started tying a few knots in it, five knots in all.   
The whole assembly watched â what is going on? And then he asked the  
assembly, âCan anybody tell me: is this handkerchief the same as it was  
before the knots were tied?â   
Sariputta said, âThis is a tricky question. In a way the handkerchief is the  
same because nothing has changed, in a way it is not the same because these  
five knots have appeared which were not there before. But as far as the inner  
nature of the handkerchief is concerned â its nature is concerned â it is  
the same; but as far as its form is concerned it is no more the same. The form  
has changed: the substance is the same.â   
Buddha said, âRight. Now I want to open these knots.â And he started  
stretching both ends of the handkerchief farther away from each other. He  
asked Sariputta. âWhat do you think? By stretching farther will I be able to  
open the knots?â   
He said, âYou will be making knots even more difficult to open because they  
will become smaller, more tighter. â   
Buddha said, âRight. Then I want to ask the last question: what should I do  
so that I can open the knots, the tied knots? How I can untie them again?â   
Sariputta said, âBhagwan, I would like first to come close and see how in  
the first place the knots have been tied. Unless I know how they have been  
tied it is difficult for me to suggest any solution.â   
Buddha said, âRight, Sariputta. You are blessed, because that is the most  
fundamental question to ask. If you are in a certain fix, the first thing is  
how you got into it rather than trying to get out of it. Without asking the  
most fundamental and the primary question, you will make things worse.â   
And thatâs what people are doing. They ask, âHow we can get out of our  
sexuality, greed, anger, attachment, jealousy, possessiveness, this and  
that?â without asking, âHow in the first place we get into them?â   
Buddhaâs whole approach is, first see how you get into anger. If you can see  
the entrance, the same door is the exit; no other door is needed. But without  
knowing the entrance if you try to find out the exit you are not going to  
find; you will get more and more desperate. And thatâs what people go on  
doing. In the scriptures, what are you looking for? â solutions. You create  
the problems â and the solutions are in the scriptures! Why donât you look  
at the problems yourself. How you create them?   
Why donât you watch when you are creating a certain problem? And you create  
every day, so it is not a question that you have to go back. Today you are  
going to be angry again, today you will feel again the sexual urge: see how it  
arises, see how you enter into it, how you get hooked into it, how it becomes  
so big like a cloud that surrounds you and you are lost in it. And then you go  
to ask others! You are functioning almost like a silly bee. Bees can be  
forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven.

Dear Lathaji,   
Yes indeed. The solution is always in the problem itself. We create  
everything,and then get catch in it. The thing i saw is that there are never  
problems. It is only matter of wrong interpretation. And things are never the  
way they look or the way we think they are. We look everything through mind  
prism,and all that is mind buisiness anyway. And we are entagled just because  
we are holding onto it,and create even more problems. It is the matter of  
wrong focused attention and interest. One thing i learned is that mind cannot  
be trusted at all.   
I live this story too,and especially the way Osho narates it.   
Thank You Very much,dear Lathaji!   
With love and prayers,

**Want   
There is a very old story about an ascetic who was doing penance in a dense  
forest. He was sitting with closed eyes and was praying to God continuously.  
He wanted to gain heaven. Hunger and thirst did not worry him.   
A very poor young woman used to come to that forest to collect firewood. Out  
of kindness and consideration for the ascetic she used to pluck some fruits,  
bring water from the pond in cups made of leaves, and she used to put them  
near him. The ascetic was able to sustain himself on these things.   
 Gradually his asceticism became even more intense. He forgot about hunger and  
thirst and he neither touched the fruits nor the water. That poor young woman  
felt very unhappy and sad about this but there was no way out. Lord Indra also  
became worried and said that this person is going beyond the limits: does he  
intend to get hold of the throne of heaven? It is absolutely necessary to  
disturb his penance.   
It was not very difficult to do so because Lord Indra knows the mind of man. A  
breeze came from heaven and turned that poor dark, ugly, young woman into a  
stunning beauty. It seemed as if a ray came down from heaven and turned her  
ordinary body into a golden one. As she was filling water for the ascetic from  
the pond, she saw her reflection in the water and just could not believe that  
she was looking like a fairy. She became fascinated by her own reflection.   
She continued to look after the ascetic. Then one day the ascetic opened his  
eyes and told the young woman that he wanted to leave that place and go to  
other mountains as he has to tread on a more difficult path; he cannot rest  
till he has conquered heaven itself.   
The young woman started crying, tears fell from her eyes. She said, âWhat  
wrong have I done that you are stopping me from serving you? I have never  
asked you for anything.â   
The ascetic thought and he looked at her face. He had never seen such a beauty  
â not even in his dream! The woman looked familiar and unfamiliar both. The  
outlines were just the same but now there was a glory in it. The body and the  
features were the same but they were radiant now. She was like the forgotten  
melody, played again on a flute by some musician. The ascetic sat down and  
closed his eyes again. He did not go.   
That night the young woman could not sleep because she felt happy at her  
victory and also repentant for polluting an ascetic. She was happy that she  
had won but felt unhappy for being an obstacle in the path of the ascetic. She  
felt sorry that because of her he could not continue the journey upwards. She  
could not sleep at night. She cried and she laughed. In the morning she took  
the decision. She touched the feet of the ascetic and told him, âI have to  
go. My family is going to another village.â The ascetic blessed her so that  
she would be happy wherever she lives, and the young woman went away.   
After many years the asceticism was complete. Lord Indra himself came down,  
bowed and said, âThe doors of heaven are open to welcome you.â   
The ascetic opened his eyes and said, âI do not want heaven.â   
Indra was very surprised. He could not believe that any human being can say  
that he does not want heaven. Then Indra thought that maybe this ascetic has  
the desire of attaining liberation. So he asked, âDo you want liberation?â   
The ascetic said, âWhat will I do with liberation?â Lord Indra was highly  
impressed by this attitude. He thought to himself that this is the height of  
asceticism â even the desire of attaining liberation is not there. So out of  
regard he wanted to bow down in front of that ascetic but before doing so he  
said, âBut there is nothing beyond liberation. What else do you want?â   
The ascetic replied, âNothing except that young maiden who used to collect  
wood in this forest. I want her!â

**Questions..   
A man was sitting at the gate of a town, an old man. A rider stopped, a horse  
rider and asked him, âWhat are the people of this town like?â   
The old man asked, âWhy do you ask this?â   
The rider said, âThe people of the town I have come from are very indecent.  
I was upset and disturbed by them. I had to leave that town. Now I want to  
become a resident of some new town. So I am asking you how the people of this  
town are.â   
The old man said, âBrother, you had better move on. The people of this town  
are even more vile, more wicked, more indecent. Here you will get into  
trouble, go look somewhere else.â   
The rider moved on. Just behind him a bullock cart came to a halt and a man  
looked around and said, âGrandfather, how are the people of this village? I  
am searching for a new residence.â   
The old man asked again, âHow were the people of the village you have  
left?â   
Tears came to the eyes of that man. He said, âI didnât want to leave,  
helplessly I had to leave. The people of that village were very loving. Now  
wherever I live the memory of those people will torment me. I was helpless, I  
was in economic difficulty. I had to leave it so that I can earn something, I  
need to try my luck somewhere else. But I have just one ambition that whenever  
my luck improves, I will return there. I will reside in that village, in the  
end I want to die in that village. If I cannot live there then at least I want  
to die there.â   
That old man said, âYou are welcome. You will find the people of this  
village even more loving than the people of that village.â   
A man was sitting there listening to all this. First he heard what the horse  
rider said and the old manâs answer. Then he heard what this man on the  
bullock cart said and the old manâs answer.   
The man said, _âYou have really surprised me. You said to one man that this  
village is very vile and wicked, just move on. And to the other you said this  
village has very loving people, you have no need to go further, you are  
welcome! The old man explained, âPeople are just the way you are. Everywhere  
men are the same. The real thing is your question.â_**

Trust in Allah, but tether your camel first   
DON'T BE PASSIVE. God has no hands other than your hands. Trust in Allah,  
trust in God, but that should not be an excuse for becoming lousy, lazy.  
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. One thinks he has to do a thing;  
he himself is THE DOER. He does not trust the whole, the encompassing whole.  
He simply lives on his small, small energy, and naturally is defeated again  
and again and proves a failure. If you live on your very small energy against  
this vast energy that surrounds you, you are going to be a loser, a goner. And  
you will suffer great agonies and anguish. Your whole life will be nothing but  
a long, long misery. Then the second type of person is one who thinks,  
"When God is doing everything, I need not do anything. I'm not supposed to do  
anything." HE SIMPLY SITS AND WAITS. His life becomes more and more lazy. And  
there comes a point when he no longer lives, he simply vegetates. THESE  
TWO TYPES REPRESENT EAST AND WEST. The West represents the doer, the active  
type, and the East represents the non-doer, the passive type. THE WEST IS  
DRIVING ITSELF CRAZY. The problem of Western humanity is too much action, no  
trust, too much dependence upon oneself, as if, "I have to do everything", as  
if, "I am alone", as if, "The existence does not care a bit about me."  
Naturally it creates anxiety, and the anxiety is too much, unbearable. It  
creates all kinds of neuroses, psychoses. It keeps people always on the verge,  
tense, nervous. It is murderous, it is maddening. THE WEST HAS SUCCEEDED  
IN DOING MANY THINGS, and has succeeded in getting rid of the idea of God, and  
has succeeded in dropping all kinds of trust and surrendering, has dropped all  
kinds of relaxing moods, knows nothing of let-go, has forgotten completely.  
That's why in the West people are finding it more and more difficult every day  
ever to fall asleep, because that needs a certain kind of trust... THAT  
IS EXACTLY WHAT IS CREATING INSOMNIA IN THE WEST. People think they cannot  
fall asleep, that something has gone wrong in their bodies. Nothing has gone  
wrong in their bodies. Their bodies are as healthy as ever -- in fact, more  
healthy than ever. But something has gone so deeply into their minds: that  
they have to DO everything. And sleep cannot be done, that is not part  
of doing -- sleep has to be allowed. You cannot do it, it is not an act; sleep  
comes, it happens. AND THE WEST HAS FORGOTTEN COMPLETELY HOW TO LET THINGS  
HAPPEN, how to be in a let-go, so sleep has become difficult. Love has become  
difficult. Orgasm has become difficult. Life is so tense and strained that  
there seems to be no hope, and man asks again and again, "What to live for?  
Why go on living?" THE WEST IS ON THE VERGE OF COMMITTING SUICIDE. That  
suicide-moment is coming closer and closer.   
 THE EAST HAS SUCCEEDED IN RELAXING TOO MUCH, in being in a let-go too much. It has become very lazy. People go on dying, starving -- and they are happy with it, they are not worried about it, they trust God. THEY ADJUST TO ALL KINDS OF UGLY SITUATIONS. They never change anything. They are good sleepers, and they have a certain calm and quietude about them -- but their lives are almost like vegetating. Millions of people die every year in the East just because of hunger. Neither they do anything, nor anybody else bothers about it -- "It must be the will of Allah!"   
 This Sufi saying wants to create the third type of man, THE REAL MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO DO AND WHO KNOWS HOW NOT TO DO; who can be a doer when needed, can say "Yes!", and who can be passive when needed and can say "No"; who is utterly wakeful in the day and utterly asleep in the night; who knows how to inhale and how to exhale; who knows the balance of life. "TRUST IN ALLAH, BUT TETHER YOUR CAMEL FIRST."   
 _   
 This saying comes from a small story:  A MASTER WAS TRAVELING with one of his disciples. The disciple was in charge of taking care of the camel. They came in the night, tired, to a caravanserai. IT WAS THE DISCIPLE'S DUTY TO TETHER THE CAMEL. He didn't bother about it, he left the camel outside. Instead of that he simply prayed. He said to God, "Take care of the camel," and fell asleep. IN THE MORNING THE CAMEL WAS GONE -- stolen or moved away, or whatsoever happened. The Master asked, "What happened to the camel? Where is the camel?" And the disciple said, "I don't know. You ask God, because I had told Allah to take care of the camel, and I was too tired, so I don't know. AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE EITHER, BECAUSE I HAD TOLD HIM, AND VERY CLEARLY! There was no missing the point. Not only once. In fact, I told him thrice. And you go on teaching, 'Trust Allah', so I trusted. Now don't look at me with anger." The Master said, "TRUST IN ALLAH BUT TETHER YOUR CAMEL FIRST -- BECAUSE ALLAH HAS NO OTHER HANDS THAN YOURS." If he wants to tether the camel he will have to use somebody's hands; he has no other hands. And it is your camel! The best way and the easiest and the shortest, the most short, is to use your hands. Trust Allah. Don't trust only your hands, otherwise you will become tense.Tether the camel and then trust Allah. You will ask, "Then why trust Allah if you are tethering the camel?" \-- because a tethered camel can also be stolen. YOU DO WHATSOEVER YOU CAN DO. That does not make the result certain, there is no guarantee. SO YOU DO WHATSOEVER YOU CAN, AND THEN WHATSOEVER HAPPENS, ACCEPT IT. This is the meaning of tether the camel: do whatever is possible for you to do, don't shirk your responsibility. And then if nothing happens or something goes wrong, trust Allah. Then he knows best. Then maybe it is right for us to travel without the camel. IT IS VERY EASY TO TRUST ALLAH AND BE LAZY; IT IS VERY EASY NOT TO TRUST ALLAH AND BE A DOER. The third type of man is difficult-- to trust Allah and yet remain a doer. But now you are only instrumental -- God is the real doer, you are just instruments in his hands. And you ask: "I love this Sufi saying but I don't know who or what the camel is."   
 It depends on the context. The content of the camel will be there, but the context will be different. Each day it happens: YOU COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT YOU DIDN'T DO IT, and YOU ARE USING THE EXCUSE THAT IF GOD WANTS IT DONE, HE WILL DO IT ANYHOW. You do something and then you wait for the result -- you expect, and the result never comes. Then you are angry, as if you have been cheated, as if God has betrayed you, as if he is against you, partial, prejudiced, unjust. And there arises great complaint in your mind. Then trust is missing. THE RELIGIOUS PERSON IS ONE who goes on doing whatsoever is humanly possible but creates no tension because of it. Because we are very, very tiny -- small atoms in this universe. Things are very complicated. Nothing depends only on my action -- there are thousands of criss-crossing energies. THE TOTAL OF THE ENERGIES WILL DECIDE THE OUTCOME. How I can decide the outcome? But if I don't do anything then things may never be the same.   
 I HAVE TO DO, AND YET I HAVE TO LEARN NOT TO EXPECT. Then doing is a kind of prayer, with no desire that the result should be such. Then there is no frustration. TRUST WILL HELP YOU TO REMAIN UNFRUSTRATED, and tethering the camel will help you to remain alive, intensely alive. And the camel is not a fixed entity, it is not the name of a certain entity. It will depend on the context. OSHO

**Dropping The Past   
Let the dead bury the dead   
Gather courage--the journey has already started. Even if you go back you will  
not find the old shore again. Even if you go back, those old toys will not be  
of any help anymore; you are finished with them, you will know they are toys.  
Now the real has to be found, has to be inquired into. And it is not very far  
away either--it is within you.   
A man who lives according to the past is bound to feel boredom,  
meaninglessness, and a kind of anguish: "What am I doing here? Why am I  
continuing to live? What is there in tomorrow?--another repetition of today?  
And what was in today was a repetition of yesterday, so what is the point? Why  
go dragging yourself from the cradle to the grave, in the same routine?"   
It is perfectly good for buffaloes and donkeys--because they don't have a  
memory of the past, they don't have any idea of the future. They are not  
bored, because for boredom a certain consciousness is needed. This  
consciousness is aware that you have done it before, you are doing it again,  
and you will be doing it tomorrow also--because you don't move away from the  
past, you don't let it die, you keep it alive. This is the dilemma that  
everybody faces in life, and the only solution is to let the past die.   
There is a beautiful story in the life of Jesus. He comes to a lake; it is  
early morning, the sun has yet not risen, and one fisherman is just going to  
throw his net into the lake. Jesus puts his hand on his shoulder and says,  
"How long are you going to do this thing, every day--morning, afternoon,  
evening--just catching fish? Do you think this is all life is meant for?"   
The fisherman says, "I have never thought about it, but because you have  
raised the question, I can see the point, that life must be something more."   
Jesus says, "If you come with me I will teach you how to catch men, rather  
than catching fish." The man looked into Jesus' eyes... such depth, such  
sincerity, so much love that you cannot doubt this man, such a great silence  
surrounding him that you cannot say no to this man. The fisherman threw his  
net into the water and followed Jesus.   
As they were leaving the town a man came running and told the fisherman, "Your  
father who was ill for many days has died. Come home!"   
The fisherman asked Jesus, "Just give me three days so that I can do the last  
rituals that a son is expected to do when his father dies." And this is the  
statement that I want you to remember: Jesus said to that fisherman, "Let the  
dead bury their dead, you come with me."   
What does he mean? "The whole city is full of dead people; they will manage to  
dispose of your dead father. You are not needed. You just come with me."   
Every moment something is becoming dead. Don't be antique collectors; that  
which is dead, leave it. You go with life, you flow with life, with your  
totality and intensity, and you will never face any dilemma, any problem.   
Osho**

**One has only to become a witness and the mind becomes pure   
Manâs mind is wonderful. It holds the mystery of the world and of  
liberation. Sin and virtue, bondage and liberation, hell and heaven reside  
within it. Darkness and light are its own creation. Birth is in it and death  
too is in it. It alone is the door to the external world, it alone is the  
ladder to the internal being. When it ceases to exist, we transcend both  
worlds. The mind is everything. Everything is its own imaginative creation. If  
it disappears, all imagining ceases to exist.   
Yesterday I said this somewhere. Someone came forward to ask, âThe mind is  
very unstable and fickle. How to lose it? The mind is polluted. How can it be  
made pure?â   
Then I told a story.   
After Buddha had become old, one afternoon he stopped to rest at the foot of a  
tree in the forest. He felt thirsty, and Ananda went to a nearby mountain  
stream to fetch water. But just before, some carts had crossed the stream, and  
the water had turned muddy. Rotting leaves and scum had begun to float on the  
surface. Ananda returned without water, and said to Buddha, âThe water in  
the stream is not clean; I shall go back to the river and bring water from  
there.â The river was very far off, and Buddha asked him to fetch water from  
the stream. After a short while Ananda returned again empty-handed: the water  
did not appear to him fit to bring.   
But Buddha made him go back once more. On the third occasion that Ananda  
reached the stream, he was amazed. The stream had now become completely clear  
and unpolluted. The mud had settled and the water had become pure.   
I find the story very interesting. The state of the human mind is just the  
same. The traffic of life comes and stirs it up. But if one goes on watching  
it, sitting in silence and patience, the impurities settle and a natural  
clarity returns. In this clarity of mind, life renews itself. It is only a  
matter of patience, silent awaiting, and without doing anything the impurities  
of the mind settle.   
One has only to become a witness and the mind becomes pure. Our task is not to  
make it pure. All difficulty arises because of doing. Simply watch it, just  
sitting on the bank â then see what happens!   
Osho**

**THE TALE OF THE THREE QUESTIONS   
A certain Sultan owned everything a man could wish for and still he did not  
know the purpose of life. The answer to three questions made his life  
difficult: 1\. What should I do?   
2\. With which people should I do the things God asks me to do?   
3\. When should I do it?   
The Sultan asked the advice of all kinds of wise people, and then he was told  
that there was a Chishti dervish, who lived far away, and who might give him a  
satisfactory answer. The Sultan immediately left and after a journey of  
several weeks he met the dervish. The dervish was cultivating his own land. He  
was a simple man, but no simpleton, as he was reciting a Persian quatrain over  
and over again:  _There is a work beyond knowledge, realise that, go!   
Do not work to get jewels, be the mine, go!   
The heart is a temporary abode, leave it and come!   
The soul is the final abode, realise that, go!_   
The Sultan was however not interested in Persian poems and asked his three  
questions to the dervish. The dervish did not answer him and continued with  
his work. The Sultan became angry and said: âDon't you know who I am. I am  
the Sultan of Sultansâ. But this did not make any impression as well and the  
dervish continued doing what he was doing.   
A heavily wounded man suddenly appeared and he dropped to the ground in front  
of the dervish. The dervish said to the Sultan: âHelp me to carry this man  
to my place!â âI'll help you,â the Sultan said, âbut will you answer  
my questions afterwards?â   
âLater!â the dervish said and together they brought the wounded man to the  
hut of the dervish and took care of him.   
âAnd now I'd like to receive the answers to my questions,â the Sultan  
said.   
âYou can return to your palace,â the dervish said, âbecause you have  
already received the answers to your questions. As to what to do, you should  
do what comes to you on your path. As to with whom you should do it, the  
answer is with those who are present. And as for the when to do it, you should  
do it the moment it takes placeâ.**

**THE VALUABLE SUFI MANTLE   
Once upon a time shaykh Nasiruddin Chishti went on a journey. He appointed a  
young man as his caliph. Several of the other disciples were disappointed. One  
of the older disciples, a very learned man, was very jealous of the young man,  
but he had to accept the decision of the shaykh.   
When shaykh Nasiruddin Chishti had appointed the young man as his caliph he  
had clothed him in his own robe, surely a great blessing! This created an even  
stronger jealousy among several of the disciples. One day a dervish passed by  
and approached the young man for alms. As the young man had no possessions but  
his Sufi robe the only thing he could give to the dervish was this very  
mantle. Many of the jealous disciples became extremely angry as this object of  
great blessings, had been given away to a wandering dervish. We however will  
not deal with them anymore, nor with the young man, but the story continues by  
relating what happens to the Sufi mantle.   
The dervish who had received the mantle met a stranger on the road. He did not  
know that this stranger was the immortal Khizr and behaved towards him as he  
always behaved himself, i.e. he was kind towards the stranger. Khizr then  
returned the kindness by saying some words because of which the Sufi robe  
turned into a very valuable one. The dervish then saw, that he now possessed a  
magnificent golden mantle, which was embroidered with precious gems. Wherever  
he went, he always put on the same light-giving garment; and, since his circle  
of wandering was actually quite small, soon he was known far and wide, to the  
people he met, as the dervish with the valuable Sufi mantle.   
One day, while traveling along the highroad, singing a little song to himself  
in praise of the Beloved, he encountered a band of robbers. "Oho!" they cried.  
"If the life of holy poverty is indeed such a free life, let us make baste to  
liberate this servant of Allah from his valuable Sufi mantle." "Stand back!"  
warned the dervish. "This cloak is a gift of God, and those who steal God's  
gifts will surely incur His wrath." "We'll take that chance," laughed the  
robbers, and after raining on him a storm of kicks and blows for his trouble,  
stripped him of valuable robe, and rode off.   
Bruised and crestfallen, the dervish continued on his way down the highroad,  
none too sure - if the truth be known - that God's Wrath would necessarily  
fall upon his adversaries any time soon; after all, He was the one with all  
the bruises, wasn't he? Still, he commended himself to Allah, and walked on.  
Imagine his surprise, then, when he turned a corner of the road, and saw  
before him the robbers who had just waylaid him, lying dead in a pool of their  
own blood. At first he could not understand what had happened; but then he  
looked up, and saw the precious robe hung on a tree of thorns, beneath which  
lay the corpses of the robbers; slowly it dawned upon him that the robbers had  
in fact killed one another. They had been fighting for possession of the  
cloak, which, they realized, would lose half its value if they divided it.  
"Praise be to Allah!" cried the dervish. "This goes to prove how generous He  
is, and how just in His dealings with His servants. He has simply been testing  
me, that much is certain." Then the delighted dervish wrapped himself anew in  
his cloak, which - if the truth be known - he'd been certain he would never  
see again. "How great is Allah! He bas punished my enemies and returned to me   
"Your story bas been to me like a miracle of Allah," the widow said. "How can  
I ever repay you? Ah! I know just the thing. Nothing can satisfy me unless you  
will accept as a gift this very cloak, which is more yours than my husband's.  
He already carries with him provisions for his journey, while you, poor  
homeless dervish, have nothing and no one in this world." And so, humbly and  
with many protests, Moâin accepted the valuable Sufi cloak. When dawn broke  
the next day the funeral procession passed on, and Moâin made ready to  
follow them. But what of the mantle? How could he wear it now? His years of  
struggle and suffering had changed the heart in his breast. Yet how could he  
leave it behind? At last he tied the cloak in a bundle, placed it on his back,  
and resumed his aimless wandering. But though he was still unsure of this  
destination, somehow he felt, after his encounter with the widow, that a great  
burden had been lifted from his heart.   
One day in early Spring, when the sun was bright and the rain had woven a thin  
carpet of green over the Earth, Moâin, who had been traveling since before  
dawn, encountered on the road an old man of venerable aspect, wearing a worm  
and patched cloak. The old mendicant was reciting some poem:  _   
I ask myself   
Why would a limitless entity   
Subject itself to the limits of time and space?   
I ask myself   
What is it that makes an entity an entity?   
At a minimum a continuity of identity?   
If time and space   
Clothes an entity with a continuity of identity   
Tell me, what is a limitless entity?_   
"Where are you traveling to, my son?"\- the old man said, "and what is in that  
bundle you carry on your back?"   
"Where I am traveling to God only knows, unc1e; I am without any path but the  
one I make with my own steps. As for this bundle on my back, it is the famous  
valuable Sufi Cloak." "That cloak!" said the old man; "it must be worth 10,000  
dinars. Tell me, what are you planning to do with it? Are you going to sell it  
for its value in gold coins?" "No," replied Moâin. "Then you must be  
planning to wear it." "No," replied Moâin. "Ah yes, I see, very wise,  
undoubtedly you fear to attract thieves; but tell me - what ARE you going to  
do with it? Are you going to make a gift of it to someone?"   
Moâin was taken aback by the old man's question, and pondered how to answer.  
He had done with wearing it, that much was certain. And he had already sold it  
once, and bought poverty with its price. Why in the name of Allah was he  
carrying it on his back? What, in fact, was there left for him to do but give  
it away? "I would rather answer with actions than words, my Master; take it,  
it is yours." And Moâin removed the bundle from his back, opened it, and  
handed the old man the precious mantle. "What a wonderful gift," the old man  
said, "and believe me, I have a use for it. But here, you must take something  
of my own; I cannot allow you to do this thing without expressing my  
gratitude." And so saying, the old man removed his worn, patched c1oak, and  
handed it to Moâin. Immediately a change came over the old man. A great  
light shone out of him. His beard, that had been white, now became black and  
glossy. The jewels and gold threads of the valuable Sufi cloak shot rays in  
all directions, as if touched with the sun: Thus the old man in the patched  
cloak was revealed as Khizr, whom we have already met in the beginning of this  
tale.   
"Now you can see," said Khizr, "that this cloak, which you valued so highly,  
but which proved useless to you in the markets of the world, does indeed hold  
all the value you imbued it with, and infinitely more., Your valuation, in  
tact, was far too low, your paltry degree of admiration insulting to the  
sublimity of this garment. You valued it only as high as your own vanity -  
while it saw in you the knowledge of Allah. This is why it came into your  
life, and clung to you like a loyal friend, and always returned to be with  
you, even through great hardship. But perhaps vanity for knowledge is not, all  
in all, a bad exchange. Nevertheless, the cloak bas now been returned to its  
rightful owner, because only in this moment has it been given with an open  
hand, neither stolen, nor bartered, nor sold There is nothing inside this  
cloak but knowledge; consequently knowledge may be your companion from now on,  
and accompany you in all your travels. But as for that tiny particle of  
knowledge called 'The Tale of the Dervish with the Valuable Sufi Mantle' its  
time to speak is now ended."

**The Frogs   
A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a  
deep pit. All the other frogs gathered around the pit. When they saw how deep  
the pit was, they told the unfortunate frogs they would never get out. The two  
frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit.   
The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead.  
Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and  
simply gave up. He fell down and died.   
The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of  
frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and suffering and just die. He jumped  
even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs asked  
him, "Why did you continue jumping. Didn't you hear us?"   
The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging  
him the entire time...   
This story holds two lessons: 1\. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to  
someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day.   
2\. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill  
them. Be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path.   
The power of words... it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging  
word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another  
of the spirit to continue in difficult times.   
Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.**

**THE BLOODLETTER 'S EMULATION OF THE MERCHANT   
It is said that in one of the distant cities of Khwarazm there was a merchant  
of much wealth and property whose name was âAbd al-Malik. He was always  
trying to find ways to make more money, so he frequented the gatherings of the  
learned men as well as those of the poor.   
One day he thought: âI have been engaged in many kinds of business in  
different parts of the world, but now I am going to follow the Qurâanic  
preceptâ:  _   
HE WHO DOES A GOOD DEED SHALL BE REWARDED TENFOLD._   
Having decided upon this, he proceeded to carry out his decision. Whatever  
wealth he possessed he distributed for charity. Whatever riches he had he gave  
as alms to the poor. He did not even had enough money left for his breakfast.   
That night in a dream he saw a monk. He asked him: âWho are you?â   
The monk replied, âI am the spirit of your good fortune. Since you have  
given all your wealth for charity and all your money to the poor, you must not  
be left to starve. Tomorrow morning I will reappear in this form before you.  
At that time you must hit me on the head with a cudgel and I will fall down  
and turn into gold. Whenever you cut off a part of me that part will grow back  
again and whatever limb you remove another will immediately grow in its  
placeâ. _   
O, Nakhshabi, relinquish whatever wealth you possess.   
How long will you charity and benevolence disdain?   
For the sake of God donate to someone a pure gold coin   
And a thousand will later be your well deserved gain._   
The next day when the night-travelling monk â the moon â was entering the  
temple in the west, and when the great, devout wayfarer â the sun â was  
spreading the carpet of light in the sky, and at the moment when the  
bloodletter was trimming the beard and the moustache of âAbd al-Malik, the  
monk appeared.   
âAbd al-Malik arose and hit him on the head several times with a cane. The  
monk immediately fell down and turned into gold. âAbd al-Malik gave a few  
silver coins to the bloodletter and warned him not to divulge the secret.   
The bloodletter surmised that if anyone struck a monk on the head, that monk  
would turn into gold. He went home and made preparations for a feast inviting  
several monks to be his guests. After the dinner was over, he fetched a heavy  
stick and hit the monks on their heads with such force that their scalps were  
cut and blood began to flow like a stream. When the monks started to scream  
and wail with pain, a large crowd gathered. They bound the bloodletter  
securely and took him along with the monks to the magistrate of the city.   
The magistrate asked: âWhy did you beat up those poor people and crack their  
heads open?â   
The bloodletter replied: âI was in the house of âAbd al-Malik when a monk  
came to see him. He beat him on the head several times with a cane and the  
monk immediately turned into gold. I thought that anyone who hit a monk on the  
head could cause him to turn into gold. With this temptation I invited the  
monks to be my guests and struck a few blows on their heads. Not only their  
condition failed to change, but the whole affair ended in a great fiascoâ.   
The magistrate summoned âAbd al-Malik and asked him: âwhat is this  
bloodletter claiming?â   
âAbd al-Malik answered: âThis man lives on my street. For several days his  
senses have been affected and his mind has become deranged. He wanders around  
all day like a madman and talks nonsense. Otherwise why would a sane person  
act in such a manner or an intelligent man utter such words? He needs care,  
proper treatment, medicine and potions. He must be taken to a doctor. He must  
be sent to a capable physician. It is a pity that such a bloodletter should be  
wasted and it is regretful that his skill should be lostâ.   
The words of âAbd al-Malik met with the approval of the magistrate. He made  
excuses to the monks and ordered that the bloodletter be released.   
 _   
O Nakhshabi, conduct your true self with integrity.   
When will you ever forsake thought of worldly possession!   
Fools will imitate unsuitable actions of others.   
To maintain self esteem, you should always use discretion._
