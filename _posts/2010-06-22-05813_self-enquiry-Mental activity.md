http://news.rediff.com/report/2010/jun/21/thousands-participate-in-london-  
rath-yatra.htm   
Thousands of pilgrims and faith leaders from all over the world participated  
in the London [ Images ] Rath-yatra, festival of chariots, on Sunday evening  
as the city was illuminated by wonderful colours and sounds of the annual Hare  
Krishna Festival.   
The devotees pulled three 40-foot high colourful chariots carrying the sacred  
deities of Lord Jagannatha, Lady Subhadra and Lord Balarama from Hyde Park to  
Trafalgar Square. The giant chariots were accompanied by a procession of  
singers, musicians and dancers. At Trafalgar Square, where the procession  
concluded, thousands of people had gathered to witness cultural and  
educational displays and exhibitions linked to the Rath-yatra.   
The festival of chariots is a celebration dating back to over 5000 years,  
annually observed in the ancient holy city of Jagannatha Puri in Orissa,  
making it the oldest street festival in the world.   
Devotees believe that if they get the honour of pulling the ropes of the giant  
chariot, carrying Lord Krishna, known as Jagannatha - Lord of the Universe,  
then, at the end of this life, they will be granted eternal service to the  
Lord in the spiritual world.   
"Each year, we aim to make the Festival of the Chariots a more vibrant and  
colourful festival for London. Now over forty years on, it's amazing to see  
yet another generation of Londoners enjoying the Ratha-Yatra celebration in  
our capital," said Titikshu Das, Coordinator of London Carnival of Chariots.   
This ancient festival was brought to western shores by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami,  
founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.   
The first Rath-yatra festival outside of India [ Images ] took place in San  
Francisco in 1967. This festival came to London in 1969, where it has been  
faithfully observed every year for over 40 years attracting more than 30,000  
people throughout the day.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Final words of advice from the silent sage - Thayumanavar  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 22, 2010, 06:39:44 AM

**Withdraw the mind from the senses   
and fix it in meditation.   
Control the thought-current.   
Find out the thought-centre and fix yourself there.  
Then you will be conscious of the Divine Self;   
you will see it dancing in ecstasy.   
Live in that delight.   
That Delight-Consciousness, is the God in you.   
He is in every heart.   
You need not go anywhere to find Him.   
Find your own core and feel Him there.   
Peace, bliss, felicity, health - everything is in you.   
Trust in the Divine in you.   
Entrust yourself to His Grace.   
Be as you are.   
Off with past impressions.   
He who lives from within an ingathered soul-life   
is a real Sage though he may be a householder.   
 **He who allows his mind to wander with the senses   
is an ignoramus, though he is learned.   
See as a witness, without the burden of seeing.   
See the world just as you see a drama.   
See without attachment, Look within.  
Look at the inner light unshaken by mental impressions.   
Then, floods of conscious bliss   
shall come pouring in and around you from all directions.   
This is the supreme Knowledge;   
realise ! Aum Aum ! "

Dear Subramanian ji,   
I have to completely agree with you : people who hanker after money cannot be  
realized people may be they are just good speakers.   
Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi are true examples.   
As regards Swami Dayananda i think he was realized. IF he said Bhagavad  
Gita contains it all indeed i cannot but agree. One does not require whole  
Gita just one like "sarva dharman parityajya, maam ekam sharanam vraja"  
is sufficient in my opinion. Swami Dayananda is not only a very very rational  
thinker, but also a great Scholar. He speaks from inner realization. I cannot  
say the same regarding Swami Chinmayananda with certainity though he may  
be realized, i am not certain.   
Jaggi Vasudev, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar both give too much importance to  
experience. Experience is conditioned by time, since it is born and what  
is born shall die. All experiences are unreal.   
As of now, only the people i listed seem to be realized.   
I should mention Swami Suddhananda of Samvit Sagar trust to me, he appears  
to be Realized person. He has an ashram in arunachalam also so may be  
someone who is interested in a living guru should meet him.   
Love!   
Silence

Many scholors are not self-realised.   
Many self-realised are not scholors.   
If a realised person is scholor disciples are lucky.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
A monk was asked by his disciple what a particular star is so he took them  
to their window, showed them two leaves of a tree and said "My child do you  
see those two leaves?", "yes master", they replied.   
"So when you look through them, into the sky what you see is the star" \  
and lo! They all got it !   
This wonderful teaching was documented in their scriptures and  
generations down the line, the scholars still pointed through two leaves   
but no star was seen ; no one saw it !   
today what has happened is, there are so many scholars they speak ; see  
between those two leaves they say : when you do not see it ; u r blamed for ur  
inability they blame you on your impurity : and who ever does this is a  
liar.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahma jnana valimala : Sakruta Sravana Matrena [By just  
listening once] Brahma Jnanm yatho bhavet [The Knowledge of Self is revealed  
 Brahma Jnanam happens] : if it does not; its a lie. Be sure of this.   
it has to happen here, now. Or else, its a lie. Coz future and past are lies.  
Who ever tells you you are impure is lying. .. coz where is God ? God is right  
now all around you, embracing you ! how can you be impure we are all  
purest of the pure ! who ever tells such nonsense is a liar.   
Yoga methods are completely rejected in Panchadasi and also the Brahma Sutras.  
Patanjali yoga sutras will calmen the mind nothing else. Yogah chitta  
vritti nirodham they say, meaning : stopping mental modifications is yoga.  
Many people think this is the aim of their lives ! And unfortunately this is a  
lie. Coz, In deep sleep Mental modifications were stopped, what happened ?   
Ramana talked, walked and discussed things how can he do so without  
thoughts?   
Actually thoughts are there, just as the body is there but he no more  
thinks he is the thoughts / the body : This is Self Knowledge. .. and Sankara  
says that alone is the means to salvation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, non duel, DRPVSSN Raju, Very interesting exchange   
of posts between you. Very nice. Only a few things.   
The Arundati Nyaya, as skrudai points out, the guru shows the way   
and the goal has to be reached by us. To reach the star, Arundati,   
the guru shows the two leaves of the tree, through which the disciple,   
should further see. Beautiful. Bhagavan Sri Ramana says, in Who   
am I? "God and Guru will show the way to salvation but not take   
you to the salvation". In fact, Bhagavan never approved the   
'cat-way' but recommended the 'monkey way.' The mother cat will   
bite the baby cat and lift it to the place, that she wants to go. The   
baby need not make any effort. But in case, monkey's case, the baby monkey  
should hold to the mother. If the baby monkey falls, it is lost,   
because the baby has ceased the efforts.   
Dear non duel, you are correct. We are all bubbles in the ocean.   
No one pure, no one is impure. We are all pure. There is neither   
jnani nor ajnani, as Bhagavan says. There is only Jnana.   
Talking about Chinmayanada of Bhagavad Gita, (the Original Chinamaya Mission  
people), he was a great scholar and authority on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, and there it ends. He used to have snuff, for his   
nostrils and will have a sniff of the powder, even during his lecture.   
He used to say, "Even if Krishna wants to me to Vaikunta, I cannot   
go without my snuff box!"   
There were during Bhagavan's time the ganja-takers in the Hill.   
The ganja was not banned during His days. Even someone had   
given to Him a large doze of ganja, on a few occasions and He has   
taken without any effect, since it was 'offered' by a devoee! Some   
Yogi has remarked, "Oh Siva, you are calling me, please wait, let   
me take my ganja and then come with you!"   
I propose to write about Panchadasi, starting from this afternoon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Are you anti Chinmaya \ just kidding[be sure i am not an affiliate of his in any way]. But, i guess, what he said was just a joke ! he was attached, and he accepted it i think that was genuine.   
Even Swami Vivekananda smoked!   
Nissargadatta maharaj used to smoke too!   
how do u explain that ?   
But i do not really know if chinmayananda is realized or not.   
His disciple Swami Dayananda is however realized!   
Swami chinmayananda used to get angry i asked Swami Suddhananda [i met him  
only once, so i asked him then] how a realized person could get angry, he  
said, "Thats what, i am not sure". What do i understand ? just that he did  
not know abt it !   
Love!

Dear srkudai, yes, you are correct. Certain characteristics of   
Jnanis are inscrutable. But they are like a burnt rope, it is   
neither harmful to them nor to others. Even Sri Ramakrishna used   
to have "hookah". Saint Tirunavukkarasar says, " Even if   
some one is a dog eater, if he prays to Siva, I am his servant."   
Hunter Kannappa (of Kalahasti), was a meat eater.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear All,   
For bhagavan devotees who can understand **telugu** and who think they need  
guidance from a living guru then i suggest Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami.   
He is the follower of advaita vedanta and admirer of bhagavan ramana maharshi.   
I have watched few of his discourses on Updasa Saram,Bhaja Govindam.....etc  
and he has great depth of understanding.

nothing else. It was cheap to get in also, some gurus will charge a small  
fortune!

Mano Nasam is destruction of the ego, [which also lies in the form   
of mind and thoughts.]. Ahandai uru azhithale mukti, the destrcution   
of the ego is liberation, thus ends ULLadu Narpadu.

Dear Raju ji   
First of all it is a thought we identify with the body and mind. 2nd thought  
is I am incomplete or unhappiness.   
3rd is without going inside going for truth is also thought. Once we realised  
there we do not require any thoughts   
i.e. thoughtless state. Bhagavan also says. like a stick which helps to burn  
the dead body at last the stick also will get burnt. These types of good  
thoughts are welcome which lead us to thoughtless state.   
(these are all I learned points. That is all. I am always with full of  
thoughtful stage only. Praying Bhagavan to that stage daily)   
Ramanaduli
