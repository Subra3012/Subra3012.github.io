## Tiruppavai - 21

Today, the 21st day of Margazhi, Dhanur month, the 21st song   
of Tiruppavai by AndaL is sung.   
This is a simple direct song, speaking about the cows in Gokulam,   
the locality of cowherds.   
O son of Nandagopa, in whose sheds the cows give out milk in   
abundance, to fill the vessels and overflow. Please wake up.   
O the valorous, the Lord of our clan, full of brilliance, please wake   
up. Like your enemies come to your house falling on the ground   
(after accepting their defeat), we too are falling at your feet, singing   
Long Live Krishna, Long Live Krishna!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 20  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 04, 2010, 05:40:56 AM

Today is the 20th day of Margazhi (Dhanur) month and it is the   
practice to sing the 20th song of Tiruppavai of AndaL.   
With this song, the reference to Nappinnai is over.   
O the Ocean of Mercy who rush swiftly to the 33 crores of gods,   
to remove their miseries. (1 crore = 10 million), please wake up.   
O the One with great valour to protect the devotees, to remove   
their miseries and the One who is justice and power embodied,   
please wake up. O the beautiful Nappinnai please wake up. Please   
send your husband with gifts of hand-fan and mirror to us and make   
us quickly complete the bath in the river.   
The handfan, mirror, kumkum, turmeric etc., are the gifts given to   
womenfolk by the rich kings and chieftains. For menfolk, sandal   
paste, betel leaves and nuts are usually given as gifts.   
The mirror is called ThattoLi in this song. Those were the days,   
when mirror with glass of chromium plating was not invented. Hence, a thattu,  
large polished silver plate is given, with which one can see oneself for  
combing, dressing up, applying kumkum etc., ThattoLi means the light from the  
silver plate!   
Compared to this the 20th song of Tiruvembavai of Saint Manikkavahchagar has  
more of imagery. 20th song is the last   
song of Tiruvembavai.   
O Salutations to your primordial lotus feet, which confers bliss.   
O Salutations to your creeper like feet, which is the goal for all.   
O Salutations to your golden feet, from where all living beings   
 sprout.   
O Salutations to your flower like feet, which is the enjoyment of   
 all living beings.   
O Salutations to your two feet, which are the final destination   
 for all living beings.   
O Salutations to your lotus feet which are not fathomed by Brahma   
 and Vishnu.   
Salutations to your golden feet, which rule over the living beings,   
 for liberation.   
Salutations to You, let us go for Margazhi bath, O my girl.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 22  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 06, 2010, 09:32:21 AM

The 22nd song of Tiruppavai, is sung on this day, the 22nd day   
of Margazhi (Dhanur month). This again is a simple narrative song,   
perhaps with a discreet reference to Duryodana and Arjuna going   
to Krishna while the latter was lying on the bed, for support for   
their war at Gurukshetra.   
We are all coming to you Krishna, leaving all our ego, like the   
great kings who came to you leaving all their self respect, and   
stood beside your bed. Will you not, please direct towards us your lotus like  
eyes full of grace and it will be like sun and moon rising   
together. If you could show your gaze once towards us, all our   
sins will vanish and we shall merge at your lotus feet!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Why a couple of God's photos, in the hall?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 09, 2010, 06:38:38 AM

Once a visitor (he is from United States), asked me: You have   
got a home altar, with a number of God's pictures. Apart from   
this, you have got a couple of God's photos in the hall too?   
Why so many photos? Is not one enough?"   
I asked him: "Where is your daughter now?" "She is at home   
only," he replied. Do you have her recent photo, I would like   
to see, since I have not seen her for quite some years." He   
became very happy and showed me her photograph in his wallet.   
He then showed his cellphone, where with each touch, several   
photographs of his daughter's photographs appeared on the screeen. He also  
said: "In my office, I have got her latest photograph on my desk and also on  
my laptop."   
I asked him: "Why so many photographs of your daughter?   
You are seeing her in flesh and blood everyday in the morning   
and in the evening at home. Why then, several photographs?"   
He smiled and changed the topic of conversation.   
Arunachala Siva.
