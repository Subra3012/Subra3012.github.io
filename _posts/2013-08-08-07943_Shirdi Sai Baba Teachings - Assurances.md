_**" Take pity on Me like this.   
First give bread to the hungry, and   
then eat yourself. Note this well."**_   
 **Context**   
Once, Mrs. Tarkhad was staying in a certain house in Shirdi. At noon, meals  
were ready and dishes were being served, when a hungry dog turned up there and  
began to cry, Mrs. Tarkhad got up at once and threw a piece of bread, which  
the dog gulped with great relish. In the afternoon, when she went to the  
Masjid and sat at some distance, Sai Baba said to her, " _ **Mother, you have  
fed Me sumptuously up to my throat, My afflicted pranas (life-forces) have  
been satisfied. always act like this, and this will stand you in good  
stead.**_ "   
(Sai Sat Charitra)

_**" Slave of slaves I am your debtor, I am satisfied at your darshan.   
It is a great favour that I saw your feet. I am an insect in your excreta.   
I consider Myself blessed thereby". **_   
He drew the devotees to Him, or how else one could have known Him!   
For the sake of His Bhaktas Baba spoke such words, as the Goddness   
of Speech dare not utter. Here is a specimen. Baba spoke very humbly as above.   
 _ **What humility is this?**_ If anybody would think that by publishing this,   
any disrespect is shown to Sai, we beg His pardon and to atone for   
this we sing and chant Baba's name.   
(Sai Sat Charitra)

Very true sri Jewel, i too pray this thread turns out well, and he bless us  
with what he wishes to bring to our conscience. i always wanted to delve more  
on teachings of Baba. previously i thought of posting the stories but they are  
big and require little effort to assimilate the essence, hence a thought  
occurred if he bless us with short quotes of His, through which the essence of  
His teachings are revealed.

_**âThere will never be any dearth or scarcity, regarding food and clothes

to and provide for, the welfare of those devotees, who worship Me   
wholeheartedly with their minds ever fixed on Me."**_

_**âLet us all four do some Bhajan,   
the doors of Pandhari are open, let us sing merrily!â **_   
Then they began to sing in chorus, the bhava of the song being   
_**âI have to go to Pandharpur and   
I have to stay on there, for it is the house of my Lord.â**_
