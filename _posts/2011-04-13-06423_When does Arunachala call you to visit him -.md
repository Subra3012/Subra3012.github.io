Dear fellow Arunachala and Bhagavan devotees,   
I wanted to ask members some questions pertaining to visiting Arunachala and  
will appreciate a pointwise feedback.I do hope these queries are of use to  
other devotees as well.   
1.They say that Arunachala makes you reach him and he decides when the time is  
ripe including for subsequent visits. Can someone elaborate.   
2.Bhagavan has also said that some are here destined to live here, some are  
taken away from this place as per the will of Arunachala when the time is  
appropriate etc. Here again can someone elaborate.   
3.Thirdly he has also mentioned that eventually everyone has to come here  
.Again can some one elaborate on this.   
4.Wouldnt it be a great loss if someone has an opportunity to come to  
Arunachala frequently and due to some reasons later like a transfer then  
looses out on this opportunity. Does Arunachala make up this loss of physcial  
proximity in some other way otherwise the devotee can be expected to be  
disconsolate.Here again can someone elaborate.   
5.We also some how manage to bring our family members(say for eg children or  
spouses) to Arunachala so that they imbibe his grace but somehow they do not  
share our enthusiasm. How does Arunachala bestow his grace on such people.Does  
it materialise later say perhaps when we are no longer around.Here again can  
someone elaborate.   
Thanks and Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Anand Sundaram,   
1\. Right up to the year 2000, I was visiting with my father and my wife and  
my young son, the Asramam, mainly as a quick visit for a day, on our way to  
Chidambaram, Swamimalai and other pilgrim centers.   
2\. There was a big gap after the year 2000, due to my office problems, my  
health problems, my son studying outside Bangalore   
etc., However I was going to Ramana Maharshi Center for Learning at   
Bangalore [it was at that time in Sadasiva Nagar and I was living close by] to  
meet Sri A.R. Natarajan and he gave me some books on Sri Bhagavan. I read  
them, but only a few things went into mind, since my problems were plenty.   
3\. In the year 2007-08, when the problems were behind me, I could concentrate  
on reading Sri Bhagavan's books, reminiscences about Him, Talks, Day by Day,  
Letters etc., in depth and realized that here is a Person who can show me the  
way.   
4\. From 2008, I have been going to Tiruvannamalai exclusively   
to stay for three or four days, eating in the Asramam and visiting only the  
Big Temple other than Asramam. I made it a point to visit two to three times  
in a year. Bought more books, spoke to people there who helped me to  
understand Him still better.   
5\. My wife did not read many books on Sri Bhagavan. But she   
had an experience in the first visit itself. When we stopped the car and when  
I went out to pick up 2 cups of coffee, a young boy of about 20 year old,  
entered the car through driver's seat and looked at my wife. He dabbled with  
some CDs on the dashboard. My wife got afraid. He was also trying to operate  
the steering wheel. Then, he said: I do not want anything. I have come to  
check up. He left within a minute. When I came back with her cup of coffee,  
she looked bewildered and horripilated. She said that the boy looked exactly  
like Sri Bhagavan, in the famous first photo, with deep penetrating eyes, and  
huge hair.   
6\. From that time, she and I are visiting the Asramam two or three times a  
year. Our last visit was on 26-29th Jan 2011. My son is yet to develop faith  
and interest in Sri Bhagavan and further he is in Hongkong. So we do not  
disturb him to join us for darshan at any time.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sir,   
Thanks for sharing your personal experiences relatd to the points raised.   
1.CAn you also taken an additioinal pain and give a pointwise feedback in more  
general terms based on your own experiences related, based on what you have  
read and perhaps based on what some others may have shared with you in the  
light of their own experiences.   
2.CAn you also then based on the general feedback elaborate on the possible  
esoteric conclusions that can be so derived which will give hope to one for  
all.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Anand Sundaram,   
1\. Yes. It is Sri Bhagavan who called me first as a visitor, and then as   
a devotee. It is He who called me again and again.   
2\. I have no idea of staying in Tiruvannamalai right now. Whether I would  
settle down there, He only knows.   
3\. He will not drive away anyone from Arunachala, unless one's ego   
finds it difficult to stay there, because, Arunachala Mahatmyam says   
that those whose egos are diabolic cannot stay there for ever.   
4\. There are some experiences for me but they are too personal to divulge.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear fellow Ramana devotees,   
Based on feedback I have received and my own take on the subject I wanted to  
share with what I feel about whatever i have asked. Kindly excuse me and bear  
with me but I am sure our joint love of Annamaliyar will make you forgive  
me.regards,anand.   
1.They say that Arunachala makes you reach him and he decides when the time is  
ripe including for subsequent visits. Can someone elaborate.   
 It is recharging your batteries.But Arunachala takes over the tasking of  
recharging your batteries- you do not have to keep a log of the same.i.e  
Arunachala calls you when you feel sometimes down and out and like a true  
father he will give you necessary succour.   
2.Bhagavan has also said that some are here destined to live here, some are  
taken away from this place as per the will of Arunachala when the time is  
appropriate etc. Here again can someone elaborate.   
I feel that Arunachala will keep you nearby till you learn the lesson that the  
whole universe is nothing but Annamalaiyar.   
3.Thirdly he has also mentioned that eventually everyone has to come here  
.Again can some one elaborate on this.   
 I feel that if we had fervently prayedfor physical proximity to Arunachala  
then either in our lifetime or in a subtle body Arunachala will bring us to  
him. This will be until we realise again that the whole universe is Arunachala  
i.e become one with the universal self.   
4.Wouldnt it be a great loss if someone has an opportunity to come to  
Arunachala frequently and due to some reasons later like a transfer then  
loosesurther who out on this opportunity. Does Arunachala make up this loss  
of physcial proximity in some other way otherwise the devotee can be expected  
to be disconsolate.Here again can someone elaborate.   
I feel that Arunachala will make the bond on the pyschic plane even stronger  
or in some other way fathomable only to one who experiences his grace.   
5.We also some how manage to bring our family members(say for eg children or  
spouses) to Arunachala so that they imbibe his grace but somehow they do not  
share our enthusiasm. How does Arunachala bestow his grace on such people.Does  
it materialise later say perhaps when we are no longer around.Here again can  
someone elaborate.   
here i feel that we have done our job and the CEO will do his.How he does is  
beyond our level?Further didnt the CEO also make us do our job?
