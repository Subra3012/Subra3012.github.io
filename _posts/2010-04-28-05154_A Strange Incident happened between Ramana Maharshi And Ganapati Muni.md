## Chitra Pournami - Souramana Chaitra Full Moon -28.04.2010

Today is Chaitra Full Moon. Usually for full moon, many many   
go for giri pradakshina, starting in the evening in Tiruvannamalai.   
Even in the evenings, the road will be hot and it will be difficult   
do pradakshina. Of course, some devotees, on the way, keep some   
stalls for distributing cool water and butter-milk with some ginger.   
In various Siva and Vishnu and Muruga temples, Chitra Pournami   
is the day of culmination of 10 day long festivals. In Madurai,   
after Meenakshi's wedding with Sundareswara, a day or two before,   
it is today, Kallazhagar, (Vishnu) comes (late) to the wedding of   
his sister, Meenakshi. Vishnu is angry but becomes cool on seeing   
the couple. This festival of Vishnu crossing Vaigai to reach Madurai   
is celebrated with all pomp and glory in that city even today. The   
sun will no doubt, be blistering hot. But devotees do not mind.   
In other Vishnu, Siva and Muruga temples there are festivities.   
In Kanchipuram, there is a separate shrine for Chitragupta, the   
First Lieutenant of Yama (god of death) and today there is   
a special puja for him. Chitragupta writes the accounts of   
merits and demerits of human beings today. (There were no   
computers those days for real-time accounting.) The devotees   
pray to him, for 'taking care' of their accounts.   
For Siva bhaktas, (devotees), where is the worry about their   
accounts? They are devoted to Kalakala, the death to death   
itself and what can Yama's assistant do? Nevertheless one   
can believe that a true Siva bhakta loves others and are sincere   
in their devotion. So their merits will be many and perhaps some   
demerits in course of life.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ A Strange Incident happened between Ramana Maharshi And Ganapati Muni

In the first three months of 1908 the Maharshi, Ganapati, and other disciples  
stayed at the Pachaiamman Kovil at the foothill of Arunachala. Most of the  
expenses relating to the stay were borne by Ramaswamy Ayyangar, a devotee.  
During that period, Ganapati, took to meditation as taught by Bhagavan. One  
dawn, a brilliant light arose and touched the forehead of the Maharshi six  
times, Ganapati noticed this and also observed that the light got absorbed in  
the aura around the Maharshi's head as six star- like formations.   
Though he practised the Maharshi's way Ganapati's original ideals did not  
leave him. Towards the end of March (1908) he wanted to leave Arunachala and  
asked the Maharshi whether the enquiry into the source of the `I- thought'  
would result in the fulfilment of his ideals or whether he had to do mantra  
japa also. The Maharshi replied that the former was enough. Ganapati also  
asked the Maharshi whether his intention was good, to which the latter replied  
"Leave everything to God, your burden will cease and He will take on your  
burden. He knows what to do."   
 **Much later Bhagavan said, "While God sustains the burden of the world, the  
spurious ego assumes its burden grimacing like an image on a tower seeming to  
support it."   
Reality in forty verses - Supplement verse 17**   
 Tr. K. Swaminathan   
**With the Maharshi 's permission Ganapati left Arunachala in 1908 for  
Tiruvottiyur near Madras for performing tapas. He performed tapas in a Ganesa  
temple for eighteen days. On the last day he had a problem during the tapas  
and felt that it would be fine if the Maharishi were to give his darshan. He  
was asleep while being, wide awake. All of a sudden Ramana arrived there and  
sat by Ganapati's side. Surprised at this, Ganapati tried to get up but the  
Maharshi pressed him on the head and made him sit. Ganapati felt as if an  
electric current had passed through him. He took it to be initiation by hand  
(hasta- diksha).**   
Ever since 1896 the Maharshi never left Arunachala but how can anyone account  
for Ganapati's experience?   
 **About twenty one years later, on 17 Oct 1929 to be precise, Ganapati  
narrated his experience to the Maharshi. The Maharshi also confirmed it,  
saying,   
"Several years ago I was resting at Virupaksha cave. I was not in samadhi. Yet  
I felt as if the body was floating in air. As the upward floating continued  
all material objects vanished from my sight, only white light was all around.  
Suddenly the body began descending and objects came into view. I thought this  
was what was meant by the disappearance and reappearance of those with occult  
powers (siddhas). It struck me that it was Tiruvottiyur and I walked along a  
main road. As I did so I noticed a Ganesa temple at a distance and I went in.  
I do not remember what I did or what I spoke. At that stage I woke up and  
found myself to be asleep at the Virupaksha cave. I narrated this experience  
at once to Palaniswami."**   
Ganapati in turn confirmed that the description of the Ganesa temple as given  
by the Maharshi was accurate.   
Kavya Kantha would visit Arunachala occasionally to have the darshan of  
Bhagavan. Between 1922 and 1929 he stayed at Arunachala with his family. Once,  
while at the mango tree cave the bones of his skull loosened and he  
experienced a softening of the area where the Brahma- randhra exists.   
Ganapati himself confessed that however much he tried to follow the jnana  
marga he had not been able to achieve abidance in the Self. In the first years  
possibly the latent tendencies proved to be insurmountable obstacles. Also,  
the activities of the sakti in the body were intense which it could not bear.  
On such occasions he would seek Bhagavan's help and get over that.   
Ganapati Sastry used to say that sakti was of two types- mahas and sahas of  
which the former was divine and that only when sahas got transformed as mahas  
the bones of the skull loosend. Because of this sakti he could not bear to  
touch any metallic object and he always had to wear sandals made of wood. A  
number of his disciples also had experienced that sakti. Any copper coin held  
in the palm became golden.   
Bhagavan had great love for Ganapati Sastry. His erudition, exalted ideals,  
and the power of his tapas endeared him to Bhagavan. But for Ganapati's  
encouragement Bhagavan would not have composed poetry in Sanskrit and Telugu.   
Bhagavan addressed Ganapati as "Nayana" as did the latter's disciples.  
Ganapati was a great man with extraordinary foresight, and power of speech.   
One may go to the extent of saying that he was a Vidyadhara in human form. His  
glory can be fully appreciated by going through Kapali Sastry's Vasishta  
Vaibhavam. **But for his ideals and love of the country which bound him,  
Ganapati would have attained Self reatisation.**   
He wrote a lot of poetry in praise of Bhagavan, one of these poems, Sri Ramana  
Chatvarimsat was recited in Bhagavan's presence every morning. It is still  
recited at Bhagavan's shrine.   
In order to realise his ambitions Ganapati participated in politics and social  
reform activities till 1930. Thereafter he gave them up and devoted himself to  
tapas. He left his mortal body on 25 July 1936 at Nimpura near Kharagpur in  
his ashram.   
More than the service he did for Bhagavan, Ganapati's service to the nation in  
propagating Bhagavan's message is greater. The answers Bhagavan gave to the  
questions of the disciples were incorporated as slokas in Sri Ramana Gita  
composed by Ganapati Sastry. This book is an invaluable guide to all.  
Simirarly, he translated into Sanskrit Bhagavan's Ulladu Narpadu under the  
title Sat-darsanam. As early as 1903 Ganapati Muni, through his foresight,  
recognised the greatness of Bhagavan and spread the word. Under his guidance,  
his disciples Pranavananda and Kapali Sastry wrote commentaries on Bhagavan's  
Upadesasaram and Sat-darsanam respectively. Kapali Sastry also wrote an  
excellent commentary on Bhagavan's Arunachala Pancharatna. Ganapati's  
disciples were all Bhagavan's disciples too. They were spread all over the  
country and they carried forward Bhagavan's message.

1\. Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri and Bhagavan had mutual respect and love.  
Bhagavan Ramana used to call Sastri as Nayana (which in   
Telugu means Father and an elderly brother). Nayana used to   
call Him, as only Bhagavan. Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri was elder   
to Bhagavan by a few years and so the call, "elder brother" made   
him very happy. He was also considering Bhagavan as Skanda   
and so he, as Ganapati should be rightfully called by Muruga as   
Anna!   
2. Sri Ramana Chatvarimsat was originally planned by Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Sastri as a Satakam, 100 verses, but he was making verses, intended  
for different chapters, (ten chapters were planned) as when it had occurred  
to him. But he suddenly passed away   
and the work could not be completed. The verses made and sent   
by Sastri were only 40 in number, but pertaining to different chapters.  
However, Bhagavan organized them into a cogent group of 40 verses.   
3\. Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.   
4. The Complete Works of Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri have come   
out recently in 10 volumes. Each volume was when ready from printer, was  
brought to Asramam and placed before Bhagavan's   
Samadhi for blessing. Now, ten volumes are over and these can   
be had from Sri Ramanasramam.   
Arunachala Siva.
