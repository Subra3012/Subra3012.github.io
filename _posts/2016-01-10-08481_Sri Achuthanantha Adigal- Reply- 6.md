The astonished Sadguru also went into Nirvikalpa Nishta. Both slowly came out  
of that inner absorption   
the next day, one after another. Adigalar, who had direct experience of the  
Self which had immersed   
him in the ocean of Bliss, exclaimed, 'Oh, Father, I have attained it; I have  
reached life's goal. You   
have revealed to my real Self, so easily, like a gooseberry in the palm of my  
hand, as no one else has   
done till now. So, from this date, you shall be called 'Nijanandar' (one who  
revels in the Bliss of Self)."   
Swamigal then composed a Padigam (decade) incorporating that name in it,  
placed it at the feet of the   
Sadguru Nijanandar and stood with clasped hands.   
Nijanandar, the Sadguru, on seeing Swamigal's overwhelming love and his  
ability to spontaneously compose   
a poem, was extremely pleased and said, 'Illumined son! Nirvikalpa Nishta,  
which cannot be attained except   
by long, rigorous practice, has been attained by you so easily, and you are  
also abiding firmly in that state,   
focused on attaining Selfhood. Henceforth you shall be called 'Achuthanandan'  
(one who revels in joy without swerving). He blessed Adigalar saying, 'The  
state of Nirvikalpa will become steady and you will delight   
in Self Realization.'
