**Talk 384.**   
A young prodigy was mentioned. **Sri Bhagavan remarked that latent impressions  
of previous births (purva janma samskara) were strong in him.**   
D.: How does it manifest as the ability to cite well-known saints? Is it  
vasana in the form of a seed only?   
M.: Yes. Predisposition (samskara) is acquired knowledge and kept in stock. It  
manifests under favourable circumstances. **One with strong samskara  
understands the thing when presented to him much quicker than another with no  
samskara or weak samskara.**   
 **D.: Does it hold good with inventors also?   
M.: There is nothing new under the sun. What we call inventions or  
discoveries are merely rediscoveries by competent men with strong samskara in  
the directions under consideration.**   
D.: Is it so with Newton, Einstein, etc.?   
M.: **Yes. Certainly. But the samskaras, however strong, will not manifest  
unless in a calm and still mind.** It is within the experience of everyone  
that his attempts to rake up his memory fail, whereas something flashes in the  
mind when he is calm and quiet. Mental quiet is necessary even for remembrance  
of forgotten things.   
 **The so-called genius is one who worked hard in his past births and acquired  
knowledge and kept it in store as samskaras.** He now concentrates his mind  
until it merges in the subject. In that stillness the submerged ideas flash  
out. That requires favourable conditions also.

One young boy came to the Hall and for about an hour speaking   
about Upanishads and Brahmasutra and other scriptures. After   
about one hour, he remained and silent, shedding tears. He then told  
Bhagavan: "Swami, I have not yet realized."   
The outpour of torrential speech in front of Bhagavan was due   
to purva samskara. It has now been emptied. So he became silent.   
And perhaps, after that, he would have known that it was better   
to be silent and inward looking to attain self realization.   
"The Vasanas have to be emptied totally. Even a single vasana,   
may cause a rebirth." said Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

They say our hidden desires also spring up in our sub consiousness that is the  
reason sometimes we unexpected experiences. Like a man who never gone to  
swimming pool he may see he is swimming. So it is better to aspire for self  
knowledge which may be our samskara. NALLADAIYE NINAI, NALLADAIYE CHEI,  
NALLADHE NADAKKUM... elder people say like this.   
Is it the old samaskara for Namalzhwar, Hasthakamala, and Kumarakurupara  
Swamigal.   
I had the story of Namalzhwar. When he was a kid some one asked Him. What are  
you doing? Namazhwar told   
ATHTHAI THINRU ADHUVAHI ERUKEN.   
In the same way Hasthakamala & Kumarakurpara swamigal. They are the brahma  
jnani prodigies.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. The samskaras spring up unexpectedly. Tiru Neelakanta   
Kuyavanar was a potter and he was a great Siva devotee. He   
was married and lived a life total dedication and honesty to Siva   
and faithful to his wife. It so happened, once when he went out   
to some other town, he saw a dancing girl and had union with her.   
The potter's wife came to know about it and she swore in the name of Tiru  
Neelakantan (Siva) that he should not touch her thereafter.   
This is an old vasana for the potter and this was over. But his present life  
became miserable. He had no issues and both remained without touching each  
other. They became old. Then   
Siva came in the form of a sannyasi and set right things and also   
gave them liberation. When VaLLalar Ramalingam sang about the   
saints of Periya Puranam, he mentions, the three greatest saints, first about  
Siruthondar, (who gave his son's meat to Siva nicely cooked), this potter Tiru  
Neelakanta Kuyavanar and finally the hunter Kannapar. Their devotion to Siva  
is the highest.   
But there are certain Brahma Jnanis who are born without any   
samsakara at all. Apart from Hastamalaka, there is Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar. He started singing at the age of 3 when he had the   
divine vision of Siva and Parvati and had the breast milk from Parvati. He is  
said to be an avatara of Skanda.   
Talks with Ramana Maharshi No. 643 says: Question: What is the true meaning of renunciation? Subjugation of lust,  
passion, greed etc., is common to all and forms the essential, preliminary  
step for any course. Does not freedom from passions indicate  
renunciation?......   
Bhagavan: You have said it all. Your question contains the answer also.  
Freedom from passions is the essential pre-requisite. When that is  
accomplished, all else is accomplished.   
Arunachala Siva.
