Verse 114 of Kaivalaya Navaneetham: You were pleased to say: 'Know it from the scriptures (that the Self is  
Brahman), the Non dual Brahman   
cannot be reached by speech (study or discussion). It must be realized in the  
Heart. Self shining Brahman cannot   
be reached by the miserable mind.' I have doubts about these two statements.  
Please clear them.'   
Arunachala Siva.
