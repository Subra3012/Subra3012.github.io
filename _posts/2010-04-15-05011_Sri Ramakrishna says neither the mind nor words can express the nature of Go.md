Once, two friends were going along the street when they saw some people  
listening to a reading of the Bhagavata. "Come, friend," said the one to the  
other, "let us hear the sacred book." So saying he went in and sat down. The  
second man peeped in and went away. He entered a house of ill fame.But very  
soon he felt disgusted with the place."Shame on me!" he said to himself. "My  
friend has been listening to the sacred word of Hari and see where I am!" But  
the friend who had been listening to the Bhagavata also became disgusted.  
"What a fool I am!" he said. "I have been listening to this fellow's blah-  
blah, and my friend is having a grand time."   
In course of time they both died. The messenger of death came for the soul of  
one who had listened to the Bhagavata and dragged it off to hell. The  
messenger of God came for the soul of the one who had been to the house of  
prostitution and led it up to heaven.   
 **Verily, the Lord looks into a man 's heart and does not judge him by what  
he does or where he lives.**

**Sri Ramakrishna said that once a doll, made of salt, wanted to measure the  
depth of the ocean; but no sooner did it touch the water than it melted in the  
ocean.**   
How could it tell about the depth?   
Similarly, neither the mind nor words can express the real nature of God when  
the aspirant has merged in Him.   
A text of the Vedas says: "The words come back with the mind vainly trying to  
express what Truth is."

In one of the Upanishads, it is said, that "Vedas try to reach   
Brahman and come back losing, crestfallen."   
Arunachala Siva.
