**Sri Ramakrishna said that once a doll, made of salt, wanted to measure the  
depth of the ocean; but no sooner did it touch the water than it melted in the  
ocean.**   
How could it tell about the depth?   
Similarly, neither the mind nor words can express the real nature of God when  
the aspirant has merged in Him.   
A text of the Vedas says: "The words come back with the mind vainly trying to  
express what Truth is."

In one of the Upanishads, it is said, that "Vedas try to reach   
Brahman and come back losing, crestfallen."   
Arunachala Siva.
