## Living in exile with only three books

Sometime back, a friend wrote in the Forum, about the book   
that turned his life into spirituality. Every other member   
gave his response.   
Yesterday, with continuous power shut down, I was thinking,   
what would I do when I am lifted and placed in a far off   
island for one year by god? God will house you in a cottage,   
where food and bathing facilties are provided. But no TV,   
no comp., no cellphone, no company of man or woman. You   
can go out of the cottage but you should not even take a sea   
bath. God permits you to take only three books with you   
for reading during that one year. The books can be in any   
language. It need not even be spiritual books. You can   
take right from Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Nietszhe or anything.   
What are the three books that you would prefer to take?   
My selection was the following: 1\. Tiruvachakam, in Tamil.   
2\. Viveka Choodamani, Sanskrit slokas & Tamil commentary.   
3\. The Complete Works of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi   
 in Tamil. It is called Nool Tirattu in Tamil.   
If God gives a small concession of a fourth book, I shall   
take Essays in Zen Buddhism, by Dr. D.T. Suzuki.   
I seek responses from others.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I would prefer to go without any books. In my case I found, knowledge is also  
an addiction? maybe, for some time, I may turn into a monkey.... but then  
eventually, I would like be settle down as I am.... no talking, reading, no  
nothing...

For me the choice might be (it can change from time to time, there are  
thousands of good ones, including modern, to choose from!!): 1) Srimad Bhagavatham (which is the essence of all scriptures) with inner  
meaning explained (not just stories)   
2) The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle   
3) Viveka Choodamani (quite voluminous and an ocean by itself) or any book  
by/on Sri Ramana.   
I think of these, Viveka Choodami would take the most time to finish as it is  
filled with so much knowledge and is quite tough as it is abstruse and not  
much commentaries exist.

**Divine Exile**   
It is only through God's Grace we can get such "exile".   
I would like to carry the following Satsangs: 1\. The nectar of Bhakti and Jnana poured out from "Sri Ramakrishna  
Kathamritha"   
2\. Silence of the Self in the form of "Who Am I?" of Sri Ramana   
3\. Japa, Tapa, Yoga, Dhyana and more contained in "Srimad Bhagavatam" of Sri  
Krishna   
Om Shanti....

one year old mail. just chanced to read today and wished to react with my  
personal experience.   
. Just one book Talks by Ramana Maharshi compiled by Munagalu Venkataramiah.  
Regularly, I browse this book. Bhagavan answers my doubts,gives  
instruction,keeps company and makes me feel the power of his prescence.
