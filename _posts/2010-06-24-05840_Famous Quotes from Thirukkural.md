Dear prasanth,   
Nice collection from TirukuraL couplets. TirukuraL is one of the oldest   
works in Tamizh, dated as 3rd Century AD. It is a book of ethics.   
TiruvaLLuvar speaks only about Dharma, Artha and Kama. He does   
not say anything about Moksha, Veedu in Tamil. He perhaps felt that if one  
could perform the functions of dharma, artha and kama, he will get Moksha. I  
do not agree with this. The one who does dharma, artha and kama may get  
Heavens but not liberation.   
I like the Kural 655 very much. He says one has to think the pros   
and cons before entering the performance of a karma., After starting the  
performance of a karma, if one thinks, whether it is good or bad, will only be  
lowly and miserable.   
TiruvaLLuvar's religion is considered to be Buddhist or Jainism or   
Hindu. But I feel he is a Hindu Brahmin. He speaks about god   
in different ways in his invocatory verses. He calls him as Vaalarivan, of  
great Knowledge, Chit. He also says he is engunattan, of 8 characteristics,  
i.e. as described in Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram of Sri Sankara. He also speaks  
about   
non-injury to other living beings. And about Yagas (sacrifices)   
without killing animals. Hence I consider him as Hindu Brahmin.   
TirukuraL has been published by many Tamil publishers. There are   
editions with concessional price also. There are 10 commentaries   
for TirukuraL. The one by Parimelazhagar, is said to be the best.   
In the Theme Song of Tamil Meet, Mr. Karunanidhi quotes one   
TirukuraL and got into trouble. It says Pirappokkum ella oyirkum... which  
means, there is birth which is common to all human beings. Mr. K says it is  
saying universal brotherhood and no castes. This is wrong as per  
Parimelazhagar. The commentator says that only   
birth alone is common. But vasanas, are different. Hence one could grow up  
as good or bad. One may do good merits or do sins.   
One may be born as Brahmin or a non Brahmin. Only the birth is   
common to all. What happens afterwards, is dependent on one's   
vasanas and prarabdha.   
TiruvaLLuvar also speaks about oozh vinai i.e prarabdha, the carry   
bag of our good deeds and bad deeds of earlier births. Hence he   
is definitely a Hindu Brahmin. The other religions do not speak   
much about prarabdha.

## Re:[3] Famous Quotes from Thirukkural  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 26, 2010, 10:42:06 AM

There is also one more poem, this time it is from Purananuru (400   
songs about puram, outside, i.e. artha and dharma; aham = inside,   
kama.) quoted by the Chief Minister of Tamizh Nadu for the recent   
Tamizh Meet. It starts as Yaadhum Oore Yavarum kelir... It is by   
one poet Kaniayan Poongundranar. The line means apparently -   
Every town is my town and every one is my relative. Again, the   
Chief Minister says that there were no castes in the ancient Tamizh   
society and brahminism came from Aryans!   
The real meaning of this line is: For a person born in this world,   
every town is his town. What does it mean? The living being had   
taken many many births in the past [8.40 million births according to   
Hindu sastras], so this man might have been born in every town   
worth its name in this world. Thus the poet accepts the rebirth and   
karma theory and the vasanas. Yavarum kelir.... Everyone is my   
relative. For the same reason quoted above, every one become his   
family members. One might have been his mother and another might have been  
his father in previous birth.   
The second line of the poem reveals this aspect more clearly.   
Theethum nanrum pirar thara vaara.... All good things and bad   
things that are faced by you, are not given by others. What does   
it mean? His own past karmas have now produced such happy   
things and miseries. Thus the poet speaks about destiny and karma.   
The ancient Tamizhs totally trusted the Vedic truths. They were   
god loving people, trusting the concept of destiny, karma and vasanas and  
rebirths.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is also one more poem, this time it is from Purananuru (400   
songs about puram, outside, i.e. artha and dharma; aham = inside,   
kama.) quoted by the Chief Minister of Tamizh Nadu for the recent   
Tamizh Meet. It starts as Yaadhum Oore Yavarum kelir... It is by   
one poet Kaniayan Poongundranar. The line means apparently -   
Every town is my town and every one is my relative. Again, the   
Chief Minister says that there were no castes in the ancient Tamizh   
society and brahminism came from Aryans!   
The real meaning of this line is: For a person born in this world,   
every town is his town. What does it mean? The living being had   
taken many many births in the past [8.40 million births according to   
Hindu sastras], so this man might have been born in every town   
worth its name in this world. Thus the poet accepts the rebirth and   
karma theory and the vasanas. Yavarum kelir.... Everyone is my   
relative. For the same reason quoted above, every one become his   
family members. One might have been his mother and another might have been  
his father in previous birth.   
The second line of the poem reveals this aspect more clearly.   
Theethum nanrum pirar thara vaara.... All good things and bad   
things that are faced by you, are not given by others. What does   
it mean? His own past karmas have now produced such happy   
things and miseries. Thus the poet speaks about destiny and karma.   
The ancient Tamizhs totally trusted the Vedic truths. They were   
god loving people, trusting the concept of destiny, karma and vasanas and  
rebirths.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Nice collection from TirukuraL couplets. TirukuraL is one of the oldest   
works in Tamizh, dated as 3rd Century AD. It is a book of ethics.   
TiruvaLLuvar speaks only about Dharma, Artha and Kama. He does   
not say anything about Moksha, Veedu in Tamil. He perhaps felt that if one  
could perform the functions of dharma, artha and kama, he will get Moksha. I  
do not agree with this. The one who does dharma, artha and kama may get  
Heavens but not liberation.   
I like the Kural 655 very much. He says one has to think the pros   
and cons before entering the performance of a karma., After starting the  
performance of a karma, if one thinks, whether it is good or bad, will only be  
lowly and miserable.   
TiruvaLLuvar's religion is considered to be Buddhist or Jainism or   
Hindu. But I feel he is a Hindu Brahmin. He speaks about god   
in different ways in his invocatory verses. He calls him as Vaalarivan, of  
great Knowledge, Chit. He also says he is engunattan, of 8 characteristics,  
i.e. as described in Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram of Sri Sankara. He also speaks  
about   
non-injury to other living beings. And about Yagas (sacrifices)   
without killing animals. Hence I consider him as Hindu Brahmin.   
TirukuraL has been published by many Tamil publishers. There are   
editions with concessional price also. There are 10 commentaries   
for TirukuraL. The one by Parimelazhagar, is said to be the best.   
In the Theme Song of Tamil Meet, Mr. Karunanidhi quotes one   
TirukuraL and got into trouble. It says Pirappokkum ella oyirkum... which  
means, there is birth which is common to all human beings. Mr. K says it is  
saying universal brotherhood and no castes. This is wrong as per  
Parimelazhagar. The commentator says that only   
birth alone is common. But vasanas, are different. Hence one could grow up  
as good or bad. One may do good merits or do sins.   
One may be born as Brahmin or a non Brahmin. Only the birth is   
common to all. What happens afterwards, is dependent on one's   
vasanas and prarabdha.   
TiruvaLLuvar also speaks about oozh vinai i.e prarabdha, the carry   
bag of our good deeds and bad deeds of earlier births. Hence he   
is definitely a Hindu Brahmin. The other religions do not speak   
much about prarabdha.   
Arunachala Siva.
