I read recently about Anandmayi ma. She met Yogananda, The conversation in  
between them is unique.   
Yogananda came to Ramana Maharishi asramam and had darshan. Any body have any  
thing about this meeting? I saw picture of Yogananda and Maharishi.   
Like Yogananda Ma also travelled many places. Did she come to Thruvanamalai.  
Please post.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yogananda came to see Bhagavan Ramana in his long red gown   
and a trouser within. There is a photograph too. Some details   
are available in the 8-volume book of Arunachala Ramana. I have   
to pick up and tell you. To me, on seeing the photograph, it appeared that  
Yogananda and Bhagavan Ramana represent the   
long and short of Jnana Marga.   
Ma Ananda Mayi, I have no idea. There is a reference about her,   
in Devaraja Mudaliar's Day by Day, page 305-306, 1995 edition.   
There, Mudaliar refers to her super-conscious state where she   
would tell the future and past of visitors. Bhagavan Ramana   
said: "Yes. It is possible. Through yogic siddhis, one can know   
the hidden aspects of time and space. But it has nothing to do   
with Jnana."   
There is one beautiful book titled "160 Reminiscences, Transforming  
Encounters" by Ramana Kendra, Hyderabad.   
There may be a reference about Ma Ananda Mayi, in that book.   
Let me refer to that and revert.   
Arunachala Siva.

As far as i remember   
very little conversation took place between the two [Ramana and Yogananda].   
Yogananda seems to have asked him how people's spiritual consciousness be  
evolved or some thuch question.   
And Ramana explained that it can only be done case by case depending on  
people's maturity and understanding.

Thank you very much. But I want to know whether Ma also came with Yogananda to  
visit Bhagavan. If you know please let me know.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
From the reference of Bhagavan Ramana's books, I trust that   
Ma Ananada Mayi did not meet Bhagavan Ramana. She was   
with Papa Ramadas in Kunchengod Asramam. Papa Ramadas   
had of course seen Bhagavan Ramana.   
Incidentally, Ramanaduli, could see the posts on Ashta   
Virasthanams of Siva, which was written for your query?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you verymuch for the reply. I read the Yogananda's book where he asked  
Ma to tell about herself. The reply is superb. She was born with   
enlightened mind and lived. What a great souls those who are.   
And for the Ashta veerathanams of siva I will see the previous posts.   
Ramanaduli

i think it was in 1978 when we went to haridwar and decided to visit the  
ashram of ananmayi ma. we were told that she did not normally give darshan. a  
small crowd had gathered waiting for her darshan and we also joined them. then  
there was some sudden activity and we were told that ma would afterall be  
available for darshan. she stood next to a grilled door, eyes so calm and  
serene and so radiant. yes, there was a power that could be felt instantly on  
eye contact. for some reason my eyes became tearful. the door where she stood  
was soon shut. but tears continued to flow and i did not want to speak to  
anyone for a long time.i feel so fortunate even now for this experience.

Dear Vinita   
You are so lucky and did lots of good karma to have a darshan of Mahatma.
