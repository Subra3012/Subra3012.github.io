Dear Members, let us all spend a few minutes in silence in memory of Sri. Ravi  
Ramanan. This news is published the current issue of Sharanagati Newsletter.   
Quote  
> It is with a heavy heart that we write this. On 14th August 2010, Ravi  
> Ramanan, the leading member of our Editorial Team and youngest son of the  
> Ashram President Sri V. S. Ramanan, was absorbed in Arunachala. Ravi faced  
> his two year battle against brain cancer with remarkable courage and  
> dignity. The passing on was peaceful, a sure sign of Sri Bhagavanâs  
> boundless Grace! As we work on this issue of Saranagathi we can feel  
> Raviâs quiet presence guiding and encouraging us to continue doing  
> âBhagavanâs Workâ.   
>   
> A Satsang was held at the Ashram Presidentâs residence on Saturday the  
> 21st of August 2010 on the eighth day of Ravi Ramananâs Absorption in  
> Bhagavan. Sri V.S. Ramanan, Susila Ramanan, Ranjani Ravi Ramanan, her mother  
> Mangalam, daughters Rasika and Raksha, and many relatives and other devotees  
> of Bhagavan were present. Nochur Sri Venkataraman spoke on the occasion when  
> he expressed his heart-felt feelings to Ranjani and other bereaved members  
> of the family and proceeded to explain how devotees of Bhagavan may  
> effectively face such a crisis in the light of Bhagavanâs teaching. He  
> began by saying that he knew the mental agony of one who loses a dear one,  
> especially at a young age. His sisterâs husband passed away young last  
> year and the agony lingers in his heart. However, as devotees of Bhagavan we  
> have no choice but to listen to his words and live by them and attain the  
> highest goal of life. Bhagavanâs own life and his teachings give us very  
> precious insights into the phenomenon of death. In fact, Death is the most  
> important happening in Sri Bhagavanâs life. About the middle of July in  
> the year 1896, young Venkataraman, not yet 17, took on Death, as it were,  
> vanquished It and came out of the experience as a Deathless One. No more, to  
> him, the sense of identity with the body, no more the personal I, no more  
> duality. From that moment, the timeless time, he abided as the Self  
> uninterruptedly throughout the rest of his life. After the Death Experience,  
> he remained in form without form (vadivilaavadivaanavan) to show us in the  
> most dramatic and telling manner that there is no death. The body may go,  
> but âare we the body?â   
>   
> Kathopanishad, one of the most important Upanishads, is in the form of a  
> dialogue with death, the dialogue of young Nachiketa with Lord Yama. This  
> Upanishad may be called a brief biography of young Ramana. Nachiketa asked  
> Yama to tell him how death may be conquered and Yama taught him how to   
> conquer it with the (Nachiketa) fire. Venkataraman conquered Death with the  
> fire of Jnana Vichaara. Bhagavan is the supreme symbol of jnana and peace.  
> Peace is our real nature and Bhagavan is our own true nature. In that  
> supreme state, there is neither joy nor sorrow. Bhagavan has said that peace  
> is   
> itself mukti, liberation. If we live by Bhagavanâs words, peace is  
> inevitable. For one who has found that supreme inner peace, what can health  
> and ill-health matter? For these pertain to body and mind whereas peace is  
> the very nature of Self. Death and birth are only moving shadows on the  
> screen of the Self. By doing Self-enquiry or by surrendering to Bhagavan, we  
> can conquer the fear and sorrow of death once and for all. Bhagavan has  
> poured his Grace on Ravi like a torrent. Ravi was totally devoted to  
> Bhagavan and identified himself with the interests of the Ashram. It is for  
> us to realize that Bhagavanâs ways cannot be comprehended by our finite  
> minds and accept whatever happens. His basic teaching âWhatever is  
> destined to happen will happen, do what you may to prevent it,â is like a  
> mantra, which, when followed in actual practice, is sure to give us peace.  
> Bhagavanâs basic teaching, quoted above, is a Cosmic Law and death and  
> birth happen in nature strictly according to that Law. Raviâs illness and  
> death were according to that Law.   
> But Bhagavanâs arul (Grace) made it so sacred that his own parents and his  
> wife could feel its sacredness and maintain an amazing inner calmness and  
> composure at the moment of the happening and afterwards. This shows how deep  
> was Raviâs devotion to Bhagavan and how abundant is Bhagavanâs Grace on  
> the whole family.   
>   
> What is death? Well, it can aptly be viewed as an acronym of Divine Eater  
> And Teacher of Humanity. Devotees of Bhagavan, of course, see it as  
> Absorption in Arunachala Ramana. How can we be afraid of or mourn such  
> Absorption? We were all, of course, praying for Raviâs complete cure.  
> However, the way it has happened, the way he faced the challenge over a  
> period of two years and the incredible calmness and dignity with which he  
> left his body must awaken us all to the real meaning of death and the  
> purpose of life. In other words, we should take Bhagavanâs teachings ever  
> more seriously and live by them. Bhagavan never minced matters, certainly  
> not on the subject of death. He told everyone, young or old, devotee or a  
> visitor, that âBody is another name of deathâ. So long as we nurse the  
> idea that âI am the bodyâ, we are wedded to death. The only way to  
> deathlessness, to immortality is by realizing the Self which is ever  
> bodiless, ever free, ever blissful, eternal and of the very nature of peace.   
>  
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
I saw it in the latest Sarangathi issue yesterday. The news shocked   
me. I do not know, whether I have seen Ravi Ramanan during my   
last three years' visits to the Asramam. The news really shocked   
me. Since Bhagavan Ramana has told me not to post new posts,   
I kept mum. I and my wife have sent one message of deep condolence to the  
editor of Saranagati. He has been absorbed in Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
