Once Bhagavan Ramana, when asked by Annamalai Swami   
about the greatenss of Jivan Muktas, replied: "Every person who comes under the 'look' of a Jivan Mukta,   
gets relieved from all the sins of the past and will be liberated.   
Even the lineage of a Jivan Mukta becomes Pure.* His mother   
is a Kritarthai, that is who has done her work. The whole world   
becomes Pure due to a Jivan Mukta. Such greatness is attributed   
to a Jivan Mukta in Suta Samhita."   
* It is also said in Bhagavatam that thirty generations before and   
thirty generations after the Jivan Mukta get liberated. Hiranya   
Kashyap was said to have been liberated due to Prahlada.   
The mother of Jivan Mukta is beyond compare. It is she who has   
done the work in this world, and there is nothing more to be done.   
Sundaramoorthy Swami's mother and father had been liberated and   
form two of the 63 saints of Siva Canon. Tilakvati, the mother-   
like sister of Tirunavukkarasu became liberated because of her   
brother.

Adi Shankra's mother and Bhagavan's mother both are like Kousalya and Devaki.   
How much tapas they might have done to give birth to these Avatara Purusha   
I prostrate to their feet from here.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Surely. Yesterday, I forgot to mention Aryambika, Sankara's   
mother, when I had mentioned about Tilkavati, Sundaramoorthy   
Swamigal's mother and Mother Azhagamma. In fact, Aryambika   
should come first. Azhagamma in Tamil, and Aryambika in Sanskrit   
are meaning the same! Is it not more than a coincedence?   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, on Mother's Mahasamadhi, has   
composed a poem titled: Aryambika Shatkam.   
Arunachala Siva.
