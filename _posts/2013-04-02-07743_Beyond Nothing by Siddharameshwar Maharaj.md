Dear Friends,   
I opened this topic coz i want to share some excerpts from this wonderful  
book. Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj was Guru of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.   
This introduction and writings i am copying from the wonderful site www.inner-  
quest.org.   
 "SIDDHARAMESHWAR Maharaj wished that people all over the world be happy.  
His teaching is available to those who are fully dedicated to realising final  
Reality [Brahman] so that they may enjoy eternal happiness.   
"   
"The following exposition describes only one of the ways to attain final  
Reality â the knowledge that you are apart from the four bodies. Once this  
knowledge penetrates the heart, the ego of knowledge dissolves in Reality.   
"

*Who* *is* *this* *'I'? **"   
"*Once upon a time there lived a person [a non grata] in a village called  
Andheri [Darkness]. He, however, could establish a custom in courts of Law,  
that no order or document be accepted as legal unless it bore the stamp,  
"Gomaji Ganesh" ["The Brass Door"]. Afterwards, all the officers of that city  
accepted a document as legal only if it bore this stamp on it. This procedure  
continued for a long time and thus the stamp became firmly rooted in the city  
of Andheri. No one ever enquired as to who this "Gomaji Ganesh" was.   
But as time passed, it so happened that an important document which bore no  
stamp of the "Gomaji Ganesh" was cited as evidence in a case filed in a court  
of law and even though, as ordinary procedure goes it was thoroughly legal, it  
was still not accepted as evidence. At that point, a courageous man, who was a  
party to the suit, put before the judge the argument that the document was  
perfectly valid as it bore all the signatures of all the relevant government  
officers. He argued, "Why should this document not be admissible if it is  
otherwise perfectly legal? Why should it have in addition this stamp of  
"Gomaji Ganesh"?" Thus, he questioned the legality of the stamp itself, and in  
consequence, the legality of the stamp was made an issue of contention. Till  
that day, no one had ventured to bring this issue before a court of law. Since  
it had risen for the first time, it was decided that this point should be  
brought to a decision as to what this fuss was all about.   
So the judge, out of curiosity about the procedure of the "Gomaji Ganesh"  
stamp, took the matter in hand first for enquiry. When the enquiry was  
complete, it showed that some person of no status, taking advantage of the  
badly administered government, had pushed in his own stamp and the government  
officers went on following this tradition blindly. As a matter of fact, this  
Gomaji Ganesh was a man of no importance and had no authority of any kind. It  
is not necessary to describe how this stamp was looked upon with ridicule,  
since that day when the decision was taken by the court.   
In the same way, we should also enquire about who this 'I' is, and how it  
dominates everything as 'I' and 'mine', just like in the story concerning the  
"Gomaji Ganesh" stamp. It is a general rule that if two people quarrel, it  
usually results in advantage to the third party, or if two things get mixed  
up, some third thing is produced. For example, by the contact of a piece of  
thread and flowers, a garland is produced which was not there in the first  
place. Even the names of the parents [thread and flowers] whose contact was  
responsible in producing a garland get eclipsed as soon as the garland comes  
into existence. The garland itself is brought into prominence and is known by  
its own label. The names 'flowers' and 'thread' become extinct because a new  
name, 'garland', is now evoked, and with this new name further actions take  
place. With the contact of earth and water, both the earth and water become  
extinct and mud arises as 'I'. So also, stones, bricks, mud and mason come  
together and a third thing called a 'wall' stands before the eyes. The stones,  
bricks, mud and mason simply vanish from our sight.   
Through the conveyance of knowledge and ignorance, this is how a peculiar  
thing called an 'intellect' comes into existence, and with this contact,  
emerges the 'world'. Gold and a goldsmith produce a certain object with a  
certain form, and that thing starts tempting our eyes as an 'ornament'. The  
gold and the goldsmith are forgotten. As a matter of fact, if anyone is  
curious to find out if there is anything like an ornament inside the gold, one  
would see nothing but gold! If we told a goldsmith to make an ornament without  
touching any gold, what would he make? Actually, the thing called an  
'ornament' would simply vanish into thin air.   
In the same way, due to the meeting of Brahma [the Creator] and maya [the  
illusion], this thief 'I' has appeared, and proudly hums 'I' while raising his  
head. This 'I' has uprooted both Brahma and maya. This barren women's [maya's]  
son [I'] actually never existed and yet tries to establish his unlimited  
sovereignty permanently in the world. If we observe the parents of this 'I',  
it would be clear that it is impossible for them to get such an issue. The  
mother of the child is maya and does not exist. From the womb of this maya,  
'I' has appeared and pretends to be born from pure existence. But existence  
has no gender and does not even claim to possess the art of 'doership'. So the  
readers can imagine what kind of an 'I' this is.   
As described above, the existence of 'I' is only in name and yet like Gomaji  
Ganesh, he announces his own name while moving around everywhere and saying,  
"I am wise and great!". This man has forgotten from where he came. Instead, he  
starts glorifying himself as 'I' and even if this glory is deserving, he is  
like a cat who laps up milk with closed eyes, unaware of the stick that is  
ready to strike it on the back. As soon as he accepts a right or privilege, he  
must also accept the responsibility which goes along with it. As soon as I say  
that "I am the doer of a certain act" I must enjoy the fruit of such an  
action. Enjoyment or sufferance of a fruit, or result of an action is yoked to  
the action itself.   
Actually there exists no one like 'I' and the entire doership is contained in  
Reality. Final Reality is so smart that the moment He finds that some pride of  
doership appears as "I did it", He leaves all the responsibility of the action  
on the head of that 'I' and remains unattached. He leaves this poor 'I' to  
it's destiny of revolving on the wheel of birth and death.   
Like in the above mentioned example of a 'garland' being produced by the  
contact of a piece of thread and flowers, when the garland dries up, nobody  
says that the flowers dry up. Everyone says that it is the 'garland' which  
dries up. And when the thread snaps, everyone says that it is the 'garland'  
which has snapped. It means the doership of the original objects is imposed  
upon the third object due to the pride of the object. In the same way, a  
series of miseries strike this non-existent 'I'. if one wants to get free from  
this misery, he must leave that 'I', but before it is left, we will find out  
where exactly this 'I' resides. And once we find him, then we will talk about  
leaving him.   
Everyone should begin the search for this 'I' at his own centre if he is keen  
to find it. This 'I' will never be found outside of us. In every human being  
this 'I', or ego-sense of 'mine' and possession, is filled up to the brim. All  
the actions in the world are carried on the strength of this ego-sense of  
'mine'. This theorem of "my action" is taken for granted by all human beings,  
but in fact the totality of all actions can easily be carried out without this  
ego-sense. We shall see how this can be done later on, but at present we shall  
enquire into this sense of 'I' and 'mine'. In order to make the search for 'I'  
successful, we shall first look into our gross physical body which has become  
very dear to us. After analysing it, let us see if any such 'I' is found to  
reside in this body.   
*

*Gross* *body**"   
"*   
What is a body? It is a collective assembly of parts or members such as hands,  
feet, mouth, nose, ears, eyes, etc... We call the assembly of all these  
members a 'body'. Out of these members let us find out which one is the 'I'.  
If one says, "The hand is 'I'", and then if the hand is cut off, nobody says  
"I have been cut off or discarded." Suppose the eyes go blind, no one says, "I  
am gone or have disappeared." If the the stomach is distended, no one says, "I  
am inflated." Instead, one says, "My hand has been cut off", or "My eyes have  
gone blind", or "My stomach is distended." All these parts are spoken of as  
being 'mine', and not only that, the body itself which is the assembly of all  
these members is also spoken of as being 'mine'. Thus, this 'I' is not any  
part or limb of the gross body. But the maxim goes, "Where 'I' does not exist,  
there does not exist anything which can be called 'mine'." You cannot be in  
the neighbours' house.   
Lets say that you go to the house of Rao Bahadur, your neighbour, and say "I  
am Rao Bahadur and his wife is mine", you will see what experience you will  
get! If you start making advances to his wife, saying that she is 'yours', Rao  
Bahadur's hand will immediately turn your cheek pink and red with a slap, and  
you will get a sharp and sudden realisation that "I am not Rao Bahadur and his  
wife is not mine." In the same way, when 'I' cannot be traced anywhere in the  
body, then how can it be said that the limbs of the body and its tendencies  
belong to me? If you still insist on calling it your own, first think of the  
result [a slap], and ask yourself whether it is really necessary to possess  
anything at all? See the result of such thinking.   
Everyday we see the condition of all the human beings who look upon their  
bodies as their own and who act accordingly. The human being has forgotten his  
true Self and does not even try to understand who he really is. Therefore, he  
must take birth in every species. Sometimes he takes birth as a worm and is  
passed out in a stool. Sometimes he takes birth as a bullock and gets yoked to  
an oil extracting mechanism and spends the day turning around in circles.  
Sometimes he takes birth as a donkey and works hard while wallowing in a heap  
of garbage! It is almost impossible to describe how many such miseries he has  
to suffer. After suffering births in all the other species, at last one takes  
birth as a human being. In this birth he attains an intellect, so that he  
should know God â the ultimate Self.   
Even if we look at the body of the human species, it merely looks like a  
dressed up character in a vulgar play performed during the Shimga Festival.  
The character has his face smeared with black paint and his body is dressed in  
rags. A garland of shoes is placed around his neck and an umbrella made of  
shoes is held over his head. He is placed on a donkey and is taken in a  
procession through the streets, accompanied by weird noises. But this deity  
character takes pride in being the centre of such a demeaning show and salutes  
the crowd as he passes.   
In the same way, man's body is also a peculiar part of this passing show of  
life. All the beauty of the face is supposed to be concentrated in the nose  
and eyes. We say a man is handsome or a woman is beautiful if their nose and  
eyes are well-proportioned. But in fact, the nose is only a tube for nasal  
discharge. The mouth is a spittoon containing saliva and phlegm and the  
stomach is like a sewage depot of the municipality. The body, which is a  
mixture of bone, flesh and blood, is given some respectable name like "Shiral  
Seth". The Paramatman's intention is to awaken a human being by demeaning him  
through this body. He makes the human being cry aloud for happiness and wander  
about in all directions in search for it.   
In spite of this, the human being considers the body as a great gift and  
accepts it with joy. He eulogises the body with flowery language â the nose,  
which is a tube of mucus, is compared to the bud of a champaka flower; the  
eyes, which are the repositories of discharge, are called lotus eyes; the  
face, with a spittoon of saliva for a mouth, is called a moon face; the arms  
and legs, which are crooked branches of a tree, are claimed to possess lotus  
hands and feet! The human being looks upon this demeanour as a great victory  
and exhibits his shamelessness! The Great Lord, however, has granted a  
wonderful thing called an 'intellect', even to this Shimga character of a  
human being, which He has not given to any other species. The purpose of this  
gift is to use it to understand the ultimate Truth â the Self â and to put  
and end to this demeaning show. Yet the human being misuses his intellect. He  
looks upon the gutter as the Ganges and the body as God and he is spoiling it  
further. This person spends a lot of his time engrossed in adorning his  
physical body, taking this body as 'I', and then when he comes in contact with  
a female body, he even calls her body his own! He deposits all his sense of  
'mineness' or possession in that female body. By virtue of the contact of this  
'I' and 'mine', many children are born, and a whole household is brought into  
existence. The household is shattered at last, and the poor man suffers  
ridicule â his story has been described in the book "Dasbodh" by Sri Samarth  
Ramdas. It cannot but be recommended that this book should be read thoroughly.

The 'I' cannot be traced anywhere in the body. It is also a fact, therefore,  
that the body is not 'mine'. Then to whom does the body belong? Who is the  
'owner' of the body?   
The five elements [pancha] â the earth, water, heat, light and air or space  
â have the rightful ownership of this body. After this body falls, each of  
these elements reclaims their own share from it, and finally the body is  
destroyed. The body is a bundle of these five elements and each of these  
element returns back to its rightful owner. The clothes that were tied in the  
bundle have been taken away by the respective owners, and the cloth in which  
the bundle was tied up is also taken away by it's owner. How then can a thing  
called a 'bundle' remain? There is nothing left to be seen. In the same way,  
once the body which is composed of the five elements gets absorbed back into  
in the five principles of these elements, there remains no object such as the  
'body' at all.   
Thus, 'I' am not in the body, nor does the body belong to me. This type of  
body cannot sustain the pride of 'I' or ego nor can it sustain all the  
relationships which exist due to the contact of the body, such as birth and  
death, or the six passions that affect the body. All these cannot thus be  
related to me as 'mine'! The body may be in a state of childhood or youth or  
old-age, or the body may be dark, fair, beautiful or ugly, it may have been  
infested with a disease, it may be just wandering aimlessly, or going to holy  
places for a pilgrimage, or it may be motionless in samadhi â all these  
attitudes, conditions, properties or modifications belong only to the body â  
but the 'I' is quite separate from all these. This at least we have learnt  
from the analysis of the physical body. Someone else's beautiful, cute, bonnie  
baby is of no value to us compared to our own dark, stocky boy, who has pock  
marks and a dirty, running nose. We do not suffer if someone else's sweet  
child dies, as much as we suffer if our old slipper is lost.   
The reason for this is that we do not have the same sense of 'possession' or  
'mine' for the other person. Once however, one understands that this  
particular thing is not 'mine', and that it belongs to someone else, one  
becomes indifferent and gradually even starts despising that 'someone else' or  
'another'. And then it is renounced. Body belongs to 'another', to the five  
elements. Once we understand that it is not 'mine' and is the property of  
'someone else', then whatever kind of body it may be, how can it affect us? So  
come on â leave this body and let it proceed ahead. Yet, to leave this body  
does not mean that it should be pushed into a well or be hung with a noose  
around it's neck. The body, if destroyed on purpose, definitely gets born  
again and again. This is a reason for rebirth. "Leaving it" means gaining  
factual knowledge about the body. When it is known as it really is â  
belonging to the five elements â then the abiding interest in it wanes and  
the body automatically gets renounced. Complete renunciation of the body is  
achieved only through discriminative thinking, and renunciation liberates a  
human being from the body altogether.   
There are five kinds of dissolution that take place everyday. They are: *1.* dissolution through death,   
*2.* constant dissolution,   
*3.* dissolution of the Creator [Brahma pralaya],   
4\. dissolution of the world at the end of a kalpa [kalpa pralaya] or a  
thousand yugas, and   
*5.* dissolution through discriminative thinking.   
Out of these, everyone knows the constant daily dissolution. This dissolution  
refers to sleep. In deep sleep, the whole world including our body gets  
dissolved. After awakening, however, the body and world are present as before  
and all the actions start as they did before. The dissolution after death is  
the same as this. After death, in the absence of Self-knowledge, the being has  
to take another body in accordance with his karma. In the new body, the  
actions â like eating, sleeping, getting afraid and mating â happen  
according to the impressions gained in previous lives. Brahma pralaya is the  
dissolution of the Creator of the whole universe. Kalpa pralaya is the  
dissolution that takes place at a certain point in time, in which many  
Creators have come and gone [and has a cycle of 4,32 billion years]. Again, a  
new kalpa starts and the creation, which was latent for sometime, rises with  
renewed vigour and activity and starts all over again. In this way, this wheel  
drawing forth each life, continues to revolve by rising and setting at fixed  
periods. Bodies therefore cannot be dissolved in these four types of  
dissolution. But the result of the dissolution by discriminative thinking is  
very powerful and unique. In this type of dissolution the body not only  
dissolves itself while living, but after death, when it completely dissolves,  
it will not allow itself to rise again.   
Suppose there is a toy snake made of rubber lying about. Till such a time that  
one does not understand that it is made of rubber, the fear of the snake will  
remain. As long as the snake is taken for real, one will be shaken with fear.  
In deep sleep the snake is not there, but upon awakening, it reappears.  
Getting drunk to forget about the snake will not do because the effect of the  
drink wears off, and again the snake reappears. Even if the snake is hidden  
from sight, still the image remains within the mind, and the fear is  
sustained. This shows that the eradication of the fear of the snake by the  
above described means is not everlasting. The only remedy to destroy the fear  
so that it never returns is to know for certain that the snake is only made of  
rubber. Once this knowledge dawns, even if the eyes see the snake again, there  
is no cause for fear. In the same way, when one correctly knows what this body  
is, even if the body is alive, the pride of the body being 'mine' vanishes and  
automatically the body is renounced. This is what is called the "dissolution  
by thought". One who dies with certainty of thought is free from the cycle of  
birth and death. However, one who dies thoughtlessly, it should be taken for  
granted that he died in order to take birth all over again!   
Thus, by virtue of dissolution through thought, the thing is seen as if it is  
immaterial. With the other four types of dissolution, whether the thing is  
there in front of you or is hidden out of sight, it is still seen as if it is  
existing there! Samrath Ramdas therefore asserts that it is only thought that  
fulfils a human being by making him complete. The 'I' could not be gleaned  
even when the physical body was passed through the sieve of the procedure of  
dissolution by thought.

*Subtle* *body**"   
"*   
Now, we will use the same sieve of dissolution by thought to try and trace the  
'I' in the subtle body and see if this thief called 'I' is found anywhere. Let  
us first find out what the subtle body is. This body is comprised of a higher  
committee of seventeen members â the five senses used for action, the five  
used for gaining knowledge, the five pranas, and the mind and intellect.  
Whatever orders this committee promulgates are carried out by the working  
members of the working committee, which is the gross body. The subtle body's  
field of authority is very vast, so it might be possible to spot that 'I'  
here, for he has a strong passion for authority. But the moment we start our  
search here, that 'I' has already put his stamp of 'mine' here. Whatever is  
found here is also called 'my' senses, 'my' pranas, 'my' mind, and 'my'  
intellect. But no sound like "I am the intellect" is ever heard here. That 'I'  
parades about as the 'owner' of all these members. But the 'I' himself is not  
seen or found here at all. Thus, according to the axiom, "There can be nothing  
which I can call 'mine' where 'I' am not present", it is clear that the  
seventeen members of the subtle body cannot be 'me' or 'mine' at all.   
One could object to this axiom by asking, "King George the Vth is not present  
in Sholapur [city in Maharashtra], but does it mean that Sholapur is not under  
his ownership?" The answer is, "At least there is an individual called George  
the Vth, and even if he is living somewhere else, his ownership can exist in  
some other place even if he is not present there." This 'I', however, is a  
nonentity and yet, like Gomaji Ganesh of the city of Andheri â the empire of  
ignorance â he claims that he is the authority here. Thus the 'I' is  
evidently non-existent here, as it cannot be traced, so then how can the sense  
of 'mineness' sustain itself in the subtle body as well?   
The subtle body is like a subtle silken bundle of five principles, even if it  
more difficult to untie the silken knot by thought, still it becomes incumbent  
upon us to untie it with effort. Once the bundle is untied and left open, this  
body gets automatically renounced.   
The seed of birth and death is this subtle body, which is of the nature of  
desire. If that seed is roasted in the fire of Self-knowledge just once, it  
may appear unchanged, but there is no hope of it sprouting if it is ever sown.

A doubt may arise here that if both these gross and subtle bodies are  
renounced, and the attitude of pride â such as 'I' and and 'mine' â has  
has also disappeared, then the actions of that body may either come to a halt,  
or they might not be executed efficiently. The doubt may be removed by the  
following example. Suppose a man keeps a thing in a locker, as he is of the  
impression that it is made of gold. But if he discovers later on that it is  
only made of brass, he may either leave it in the locker or remove it and keep  
it outside. His attachment towards that thing may either vanish or become much  
less. This is a fact. In the same way, if the pride of possession of the body  
as "my own" gradually gets ignored, nothing much will be lost. If an aspirant  
reaches this level of conviction, then the attitude â "Having experienced  
the ecstasy of Brahmananda, one's own being, who cares for the body?" â  
arises in him. This is really praiseworthy.   
A dog once bit off a piece of flesh from Kabir's calf muscle, and Kabir, who  
was a great devotee, simply said, "Either the dog knows or the flesh knows  
that anything is possible!" On hearing these words from Kabir, what could have  
been the feeling of the people standing nearby? To what degree of renunciation  
Kabir must have reached â the aspirant could well imagine! But even if this  
happened to Kabir or to Tukaram when he lost his whole household, you might  
not get the ecstasy within yourselves, yet if with God's grace such an ecstasy  
overwhelms you, you might say, "What is this worth after all?", and you will  
never ask such pointless questions as, "Will my house run properly?" You will  
have developed such an indifferent attitude as to say, "Let whatever that has  
to happen, happen and let whatever has to go, go."   
However, if the aspirant understands intellectually, which is easier than  
experiencing the Self, he may raise the question, "After the knowledge of the  
Self is attained and the possessive pride of the body and mind has vanished,  
could worldly duties still be performed?" The Satguru, to console him answers,  
"Dear one, even after realising the utter uselessness of the body and mind,  
one can still establish a household and have children without bringing in the  
pride of the body and the mind. These both can be looked after very well. All  
the relevant duties one did earlier can still be diligently performed." How?  
Just see! Look at the behaviour of a hired nurse of an infant. She nurses the  
child, takes him around, consoles him if he cries, nurses him back to health  
if he gets sick, just exactly as if she were his mother. If she likes the  
child, she even kisses it lovingly. But while doing all this work, she does  
not even have the feeling that the child is not her own? In spite of all she  
does for the child, if the father of the child dismisses her, she at once  
packs up her things and leaves the house. At the moment she leaves, she is  
neither happy if the child has put on weight nor is she sad if the child were  
to die of some disease. The reason for this type of behaviour is that she has  
no sense of 'mineness' for the child, but it cannot be said that due to the  
absence of this 'mineness', she had not discharged her duty properly.   
Let us take another example. Take the case of a trustee who manages a minor's  
estate worth many lakhs of rupees. His sense of 'I' or 'mine' does not  
obstruct his duty, yet the trustee has been managing the estate of the ward  
very efficiently. If the duty is not discharged properly, the trustee becomes  
liable for punishment. The trustee does not get affected if the state  
increases in value, or if it is decided in a legal suit that the state does  
not belong to the minor, but to someone else. His duty is only to manage the  
estate carefully, so long as it is under his management.   
In short, in order that the duties be discharged properly, it is not necessary  
that one has the sense of ego, of 'I' or 'mine', while performing the duties.  
Exactly in the same way, the gross and subtle bodies form a bundle that belong  
to the five elements and are given as a 'keepsake' and a 'trust' to a human  
being. As a trustee, you must look after the bundle in the best possible way.  
If you shirk the responsibility, you will suffer the punishment in the form of  
loss of health of both the mind and the body. if the trustee manages the  
minor's estate efficiently and the nurse looks after the child very well, they  
both get their salaries in return. If you look after your body and mind well  
and keep them in a healthy condition, you also get joy in return. For  
Paramartha [attaining absolute Reality], a healthy body is useful. All this  
however, has to be achieved without the sense of 'mine'. With this attitude,  
even if the body becomes nourished and fat, thin, or it lives or dies, there  
is no elation or lament.   
The trustee of a minor's estate, in the case he establishes 'mineness' or  
ownership in it, and embezzles that estate, it will come to light and he will  
either have to commit suicide or go to jail. In this case, identification with  
the body means forgetting the Self or killing the Self. Getting bound to the  
idea of body being the Self, the hope of liberation will recede.   
From the above discussion, you might have understood that the usual  
obligations and actions of the body and mind should be fulfilled in a proper  
way and it is not necessary to establish 'ownership' or 'mineness' over both.  
The obligations of the trustee and the nurse, while acting such, have no sense  
of possession, and are carried out quite normally. In the same manner, the  
duties of a human being can be performed without entertaining the sense of  
'possession' or 'mineness'.

Causal body   
Suppose we lose the sense of possession in both the gross and subtle bodies,  
and we admit the fact that the bundle belongs to a stranger, but we still have  
to find out the answer to the question, "Who am I?", or "Where am I?" Now  
then, let us go to the causal body. But what is this? As soon as we step in  
here, there is just pitch darkness everywhere! Is it possible that this  
ignorance is the city of residence of this 'I'? It seems this is his main  
headquarters. This seems to be the main capital that belongs to him. There is  
certainly a hope of finding that 'I' here. Let us at least try and see. But if  
we move about like the blindfolded, sensing for it, that 'I' is not found  
anywhere here either. Here 'I' seems to have given up his sense of 'mine'.  
There seems to be nothing which can be called 'mine' in this place. Everything  
seems to be absolutely quiet. That 'I' who harshly cries aloud 'I', 'I', in  
both the gross and subtle bodies, seems to be totally silent here. He seems to  
be playing hide and seek, so that he may not be caught by one who is in search  
of 'I'. The 'I' seems to have dug a trench here, so that the one seeking him  
may fall into it and abandon his search.   
Dear aspirants, do not be afraid. The Satguru is standing behind you as well  
as in front of you and he will take you safely across the trenches of  
darkness. Many scholars and learned persons have turned their backs in fear at  
this very point and have abandoned their quest for Truth. For you however,  
there is no reason to be afraid like them. You have a guide here who is  
Samarth Satguru, a very capable Master.   
After getting stabilised in this darkness, and planting the feet firmly there  
for a long time, a voice is heard softly saying, "I am the witness of this  
ignorance." All of a sudden there springs some courage uttering the hope of  
catching the thief. It becomes stronger with the thought, "Oh! This thief is  
somewhere nearby witnessing the ignorance." Here, one must watch persistently,  
and how it is done will be discussed in the next lesson. That witnessing he is  
doing from beyond the trench of the causal body, taking a position in the  
super-causal body [Mahakarana]. This is understood quickly, and then 'I' is so  
overjoyed at having found himself! Who can describe that joy? In that joy, 'I'  
cries out "Prajnanam Brahma" ["Knowing the absolute Reality is the supreme  
Knowledge"] as well as, "Aham Brahmasmi" ["Who I really am, is that absolute  
Reality"].

**Brahman   
This one who says 'I' 'I', is really the all-witnessing Brahman, the one of  
the nature of the knowledge "I am". When the certitude is established, there  
arises wave after wave of bliss. When the bliss ebbs away, look at the miracle  
that happened! After deep thought, I started feeling that I am not even of the  
nature of knowledge, as I am covered with ignorance, in the same way I am  
covered with knowledge â not that I was born with ignorance or knowledge.  
Ignorance and knowledge came after 'I' became 'I' and this sequence seems to  
point towards me as their creator. Therefore, this knowledge is my child and  
'I' am his father, and 'I' as father am someone different from that knowledge.   
When this series of thought dawned within me, the "Aham Brahmasmi" in the  
Mahakarana body also started ebbing out, and even that got fully eradicated.  
Then I was suddenly naked of course. Now it cannot be described who that 'I'  
is and how that 'I' is! If you want the description of the 'I' who is found  
here, then you may utter any word found in any dictionary, I will have to  
express it as, "It is not this, not this", but it is the one who throws light  
on this. Again you utter words and sentences, and whatever meaning comes  
forth, take it as the description of 'I'. And if you do not understand, leave  
the words aside and just merge in deep silence and see who "I am".

During the search of 'I', we turned all the four bodies inside out, but we  
could not trace it here. It is true that 'I' went away without words beyond  
all the four bodies, where there is not even an idea of 'I' or 'you'. However,  
it will not do to just keep the mouth shut and go into deep silence.   
In this exposition which is done so far, the gross, subtle, causal and supra-  
causal bodies have been described superficially, and it is necessary to  
examine all the aspects of these four in detail. More so, unless these are  
understood very properly, and unless that understanding is made a part of  
one's nature, an aspirant will not be able to achieve deep silence. We will  
therefore examine in detail the aspects of these four bodies.   
Here it is necessary to remember that these four bodies are the four steps  
leading to the fifth and final rung of Silence [Nihshabda], where words become  
silent. If one goes step by step, one can surely reach the end of the journey,  
but if one step is skipped by putting one's foot on the following step, there  
is a greater possibility of losing balance and falling back. Thus when one  
body is fully understood, only then should the aspirant see what is in the  
next body. Without doing this, if one starts stepping on the steps hastily,  
there will be a lot of chaos. In all this chaos, then, as the state of  
conditioning is the same in ignorance as it is in samadhi, the actual  
difference will be lost, and the aspirant might mistake sleep for samadhi and  
ignorance for knowledge.   
A toy top, when it is steady and when it appears to be steady due to intense  
speed, is similar to total darkness and the blackout caused by intense light.  
Thus, although these appear similar from outside, there is a vast difference  
between the two states. Their unity is also different. If therefore one goes,  
step by step, there will be no chaos.   
Herein it will also be prudent to bring up one more subject to the notion of  
the aspirant. That subject is to convince the aspirant about the fact that  
there is no basis for any doubts that arise in the aspirant regarding the  
contradictions in the method adopted for the exposition of a point in the  
scriptures â we will therefore first examine the method adopted in the  
scriptures.   
*   
When a subject is to be explained to an aspirant, first a description of it is  
given to show its great importance, and then it is said that a great reward  
will ensue if it is understood. Once the aspirant understands the subject  
completely, before explaining the next subject, the method is first to bring  
home to the aspirant the futility of the subject that is already understood.  
Only after that, the great importance of the subject to be taught next is  
brought home to him. The reason for this method is that there is no tendency  
at all to turn to a subject unless its importance is brought out first,and  
also unless a reward is held out as a temptation. In the same way, the  
futility of a subject is brought home, and then the subject gets automatically  
renounced and the aspirant becomes eager to know the next subject.   
The Mother Shruti [the "Vedas"], taking into consideration the psychological  
background of an aspirant, first inspires him to work for food, telling him  
that food is Reality. Then she gives him some time to fondle the gross body,  
telling him that the gross body itself is Reality. Whatever experience of joy  
may come to the gross body is actually enjoyed by the subtle body. The gross  
body is merely a corpse, and a corpse can in no way enjoy anything if it does  
not contain the subtle body. Thus, the futility of the gross body is shown.

**Next, she tells him that the mind, intellect, senses, and the sheath that is  
made up of pranas [vital breath] are Reality. Thus, it is bigger. The Shruti  
[sacred scripture] thus gives importance to the subtle body. After that comes  
the causal body, which is steady and even bigger. It swallows the subtle body.  
So the causal body is now eulogised as Reality and advice is given to the  
aspirant â "You yourself have become the causal body." However, since this  
body is considered to be in ignorance and total darkness, this claim could not  
be made here. The aspirant is therefore compelled to search further in the  
supra-causal body, from where the voice saying "I am the witness" emanated.  
After this, the supra-causal body of Self-knowledge is studied thoroughly.  
Mother Shruti, after having rejected each body, asserts that That which  
remains is Reality. When she was confronted with the problem of explaining the  
steady Reality, she started professing ignorance and repeated the sentence,  
"Not this, not this!" That which is neither touched by ignorance nor knowledge  
is Reality. In such a negative way, the Shruti describes Reality as "That  
which is beyond all the four bodies."   
It's principle is as follows â when it said that one is bigger than the  
other, it does not mean that the one is more superior than the other. In  
comparison with the needle, the needle used for stitching jute bags is big,  
but it cannot be bigger than the iron rod used for digging. Therefore, the  
qualities like 'big' and 'small' are not inherent in a thing, but are imposed  
upon a thing by relating it or comparing it with another thing. The same rule  
applies here. After enunciating in sequence â food as Reality, gross body as  
Reality, subtle body as Reality, causal body as Reality, and finally the  
supra-causal body as Reality [the latter being greater than the others] â  
the intention is to give this instruction and enunciate the principle that out  
of all these, there is none which can be said to be Reality. Though the latter  
state is relatively higher than the previous one, yet it is still not Reality,  
which is absolutely unique.   
When remembering the above mentioned method of exposition, it is necessary to  
clearly understand what Reality could be described as being. Why should  
Reality be described at all? How far can one go to describe It as such? And  
why first describe It and then negate that description in the same breath? It  
is very necessary to understand all this correctly. To a person who is not a  
proper cook, the instruction is given to him as to how to cook rice â "Light  
fire below the cooking pot." After some time, an instruction is given again to  
the same person â "Now put out the fire." The person may wonder about the  
contradictory instructions, but his Guru explains to him, "Dear one, it is  
necessary to keep the fire under the cooking pot until the rice is cooked, and  
after it is cooked, the fire must be put out otherwise you will have to eat  
burned rice."   
This is the reason why any method that is practised, must be practised only  
until you reach the goal, otherwise if you don't stop at the end, it will only  
bring exhaustion and may even bring you nothing at all! Thus, when the subtle  
body is called Reality, once it is understood wherein lies the merit of the  
subtle body, it loses it's value as Reality and it becomes necessary for the  
aspirant to search for the next thing. It means therefore, that when we offer  
a price to something to achieve results, it may be that the price may not  
reflect the exact value of the thing. "If an occasion arises, you will have to  
address even a donkey as 'uncle'." In this example, honour is given to the  
donkey due to some calamity that has befallen you. In the same way, a human  
being is facing a great calamity due to the fact that he has forgotten his  
real nature. It is therefore necessary to liberated oneself from the calamity  
or obstruction in which he is caught. If you are caught by a crocodile, and if  
you could get out of it's grip by flattering it, telling the crocodile that  
her back is very smooth and soft, does it really mean that her back is as soft  
as a feather mattress? This question should be asked to the man who thus gets  
released from the crocodile. Similarly, to get out of the grip of a the four  
bodies, they are called Reality for some time until the true understanding of  
Reality dawns on the aspirant.

**Objective knowledge   
Men certainly reach Reality [Brahman] through devotion to the Self. All doubts  
are dispelled and all problems related to worldly life are resolved through  
Self-knowledge. This is my experience. The answer to "Who am I?" will reveal  
one's true nature. One who has the desire for his well-being, to be liberated  
from mental bondage, acquires the knowledge of the Self, sooner or later, and  
avoids birth and death. Man alone has the ability to think and to understand  
his true nature. To attain Self-realisation is to fulfil one's duty, which is  
to live as Reality while in a human form. The One who resides in each heart is  
Reality and He alone is real. He who takes refuge in the seen perishes, and he  
who takes refuge in Reality attains eternal peace.   
*   
All appearance is illusion and the witness is Reality. The seen is false  
because it is visible. The individual seer remains only as long as the objects  
are taken to truly exist. There is nothing apart from the seer and the seen in  
the world. Whatever is seen is an illusion created by the eyes. In a mirror a  
face is seen, but the fact is that there is only one 'you'. One who worships  
the Self will become the Self because you become whatever you worship. The  
mortal world is only dust, so why worship it?   
When objective knowledge comes to an end, the individual seer does not survive  
as a seer. At that moment, the pride of 'I' just melts away. As the individual  
being is conceptual, so also is the seer. If you call this city 'Bombay', it  
appears as Bombay; if you call it earth, it will appear as earth. It all  
depends upon the seer's concept. If you call an object a chair, it is a chair;  
if you call it wood, it is wood. If you call the all as Reality, then the all  
is Reality. If you call it the world, it is the world. Perception of objects  
depends on the concept of the seer. But Reality is beyond concept and no  
concept can capture It.   
There is a woman whom one man calls his 'wife', another calls his 'sister' and  
a third calls his 'daughter'. Actually she is nothing but a lump of flesh and  
bones. Whatever you give a name to comes to exist. All is conceptual and  
depends upon the concept of the seer. The world and the beings in it are  
conceptual. The 'seer' who takes the world to be real is the ego, and that ego  
has to be eradicated. If the ego vanishes, then only Reality remains.   
King Dhrutarashtra of the "Mahabharata"was blind. He gave birth to a hundred  
sons called Kauravas and had pride in them. The one who embraces the body as  
oneself is the blind Dhrutarashtra. He is also the one who is called Ravana, a  
demon in the mythological book"Ramayana". One should have a feeling that all  
the objects are untrue and Reality alone exists. All objects are demons and  
because you give them the status of the demons, you are King Ravana. Ravana is  
not the rightful king. He is not the Lord. Because you consider the objects as  
being true, you become Ravana. You have to get rid of this Ravana 'I'. The 'I'  
does not exist. Getting rid of the 'I' can be called a wishful death.   
*   
In the "Ramayana" it is stated that Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva  
and on the request of Ravana, Shiva gave him a boon of wishful death. Ravana  
rules over fourteen regencies [i.e. the fourteen senses: five each of  
knowledge and action, mind, intellect, consciousness and the ego]. When God  
rules over the earth, the demons go to the lower regions, and when the demons  
rule over the earth, God goes away and performs penance. If the objects are  
taken to be true, it means that the demons are ruling and God is not there.  
There is no trace of Him. But when God becomes victorious [i.e. when the  
determination or the feeling comes that all these objects are untrue], then  
the demon 'I' also disappears. When the ego is destroyed, then all is Reality.  
One has to practice that the 'I' and all objects are untrue. A Self-realised  
being feels that all is Reality. The food, the wooden plank on which one sits  
while taking meals, for him or her the spouse and water are all expressions of  
Reality. All is Reality. Your should study and practice this. Then it will be  
God's rule.   
Reality is without attributes: it is not colour, it is not music, it is not  
yellow or black, etc. The ghee [purified butter] which is liquid and the ghee  
which is solid are the same just as water and ice is the same. When a seed  
[form of earth] meets earth, there is a rise of consciousness. All that you  
see and perceive is nothing but the Reality. What you see is only the  
qualified consciousness just as you see that bangles or armlets are both made  
out of gold.   
You must stop insisting that good alone should happen to this body. You have  
become the gross body because only one body is the object of your concept.  
Servants and the attendants should be considered as God. There is no other  
Reality with or without quality. All is Govinda [God]. Because we categorise  
all objects, there is the ego. You perceive the wife as wife, the daughter as  
daughter, the horse as horse and the dog as dog. They are all Reality only.  
There is no need to change the form of the objects. Only the attitude of the  
seer must change. Reality is the same even when it is in a state with  
attributes. You should see Reality in whatever state He exists. Even the atoms  
and molecules of a chair are all Lord Krishna [Reality]. Once this attitude is  
taken, then you yourself are Reality. Even though one sleeps, awakens, or goes  
about, one has not slept, awakened, gone about or taken a meal. When all is  
Reality who is eating and sleeping? The one who is without quality and the one  
with quality who is speaking are both God. Whether a king is sitting on the  
throne or hunting, he is always a king. The one who is walking and talking is  
the idol of consciousness. One is a devotee when one gives names to different  
objects as well as to himself or herself and is a saint, or the supreme Self  
[Paramatman], when one looks upon the creation as supreme Reality  
[Parabrahman]. To forget the supreme Self while eating food is just turning  
the food into faeces. The silkworms are better, as the silk wear made from  
their cocoons are used by priests while worshipping God.

Those who desire hells can digest hell. Gods and demons are right here. Gods  
and the demons together churned the ocean of the world which produced nectar  
and wine. Lord Vishnu gave the nectar to the gods and the wine to the demons.  
To say "Vishnu did this" means the inner sense-consciousness did this. Both  
nectar and wine are right here. It is within our own hand to drink the nectar  
and to become immortal. One who 'awakes' will achieve Reality. All are God.  
May all be happy. If you practice this and take it to heart, then the  
realisation will be that "All is Reality." One has to water a plant until it  
grows roots, and then it will grow by itself. You should persist in your  
practice until you achieve Reality.   
REALITY   
Reality is One and only One, without any duality. Reality is only One, besides  
It, nothing else exists. Then why does It appear as a universe? There is only  
gold in various ornaments, nothing else. Later on, they are named as  
bracelets, bangles, necklaces, etc. They are all different but their base is  
just gold and nothing else. But then, what appears is untrue. Even if many  
shapes are given to gold by bending and twisting, it is nothing else but gold.  
The name and the form are nothing and are untrue. Why do we call someone  
Haralal [diamond]? Just to spot him out. He does not excrete diamonds. The  
world of name and form is untrue, but consciousness alone is true.   
If it is gold, the colour and the appearance are the same. Even if a camel is  
made of gold, it is gold and even if Lord Vishnu is made out of it, it is  
still gold. In all that, only the gold exists. Existence is all-pervading,  
even in inanimate objects like chairs. In a chair, it is only the wood that  
exists. Similarly in this world everything else is conceptual. There is  
nothing else other than Reality. One should see without categorising, then the  
'seer' is no more. 'I' must be uprooted. This is the purpose of the entire  
struggle in Vedanta. Because 'I' is like Rahu and Kehi, the two demons who  
swallow the entire sun. [In India when a solar eclipse occurs people say that  
the sun is swallowed by these two demons.] Fire itself never says that it  
comes from the house of an 'untouchable'. Even when you are effulgent like the  
sun, 'I', the Rahu, has come to obstruct you. The Self is forever shining but  
it is swallowed by the 'I'.   
When the ego-self disappears, that is the sign of the ultimate experience. Ego  
is not Reality, but appears as such. Everything is consciousness. It is not  
necessary to say, "I am Reality." Birth and death belong to this 'I'. The five  
elements, as well as consciousness, are just as they are, but the subtle body  
which calls itself 'I' and which is full of desire eventually succumbs to  
death. When someone tells us, "Wamanroa has expired", it means the name is  
dead. He came therefore he died. Eradicate from your mind that you are some  
particular 'I'. That is the sign of 'knowledge'. He who says, "I am the one  
who experiences" is swallowed by Rahu and still remains within the illusion.   
It is the hand that lifts, but you say "I lift". The eyes see but you say, "I  
see". The nose smells, but you say, "I smell". All this is the power of the  
Self and yet you say, "I did it". That power belongs to God. Who is this ego  
arrogating 'I'? He has no place in the palace, but once admitted inside, he  
overrules the king and affirms his own existence. But after some enquiry, this  
ego's existence is easily disproved. Then the king once again affirms, "I am  
Reality." There is one thing about this condition â there is bliss. If there  
are two, then there is pain. Where there is One, there is bliss.

An aspirant invariably faces the question, "Shall we continue to run our  
household or shall we leave it altogether?" Whether one runs a household or  
leaves it, it accounts to nothing. There is no sense in wearing a Holi bail  
leaf garland around the neck and yet having a rush of anger in the heart. If  
one is not attentive to one's inner Self, what is the use of the saffron  
coloured robe? The trees, tigers, beasts and birds do not run a household, but  
does this means that they have become saints? What is the use if one is not  
attentive to one's inner Self? One should be alert. The objective knowledge  
should prove to be untrue. All the affairs we are conducting in the world  
should prove themselves to be untrue and that which has been taken as untrue  
should be experienced as Truth.   
What is the use if one is not detached internally? The attitude must change.  
To know that all this [moving manifest mundane existence] is false is an act  
of great bravery. One should be detached within oneself. Once one learns how  
not to get involved or how to renounce, one then gets the experience. In  
whatever circumstances or state one is in, one should be detached. Live as you  
like but renounce internally.   
Objects are untrue. One must turn the attitude of the mind away from them and  
cultivate the attitude that the Self is Reality. Even if we consider the  
existing body of five elements as benign, still we know that they are  
dangerous. Even when one thinks that it is only the Self that can bring  
happiness, the great illusion [maya] tempts one and brings him or her back to  
the former condition. It is only when one becomes steady in Self with body,  
speech and mind can one achieve this knowledge. One can do anything, adorn  
oneself with gold, wear expensive garments, but the Guru's grace comes to him  
alone who considers all this as untrue. If one is not truly renounced, all the  
efforts become futile.   
One may wear gold, silver, a wire of brass or very expensive garments, yet  
there is no hope of experiencing joy in this life. A human being can never get  
peace from any of these. The Self only talks of the Truth and behaves the same  
way with its body, speech and mind. If one thinks "I am the body", then he  
will talk of the body alone. As is the flower, so is it's fragrance. Even when  
you are in this world, you should be as if you are not there. For Reality all  
are equal, whether it is a mundane existence or a forest. When you are not,  
how can the mundane existence be there? Live as you please but change your  
attitude. Then all is over. A true devotee of Lord Krishna named Chokamela was  
a butcher and used to live with a bone in his hand. You may eat good purified  
food, but what are you going to do with your mental modifications? You must  
become Reality and feel that all objects are untrue; your ego should not be  
there. Then truly you have become Reality.   
There is nothing else than Reality. Only one's attitude has to change. This is  
an indication of renunciation. In sleep when there is no world, a king and a  
pauper are equal. When you leave the world at night as in sleep, how much do  
you feel happy. On that side, you do not need a world, a house, a job or a  
wife. When alone, one is all bliss. When you think that you have a lot of  
thing to do, you become miserable. When we have nothing to do, what is there  
to worry about? So, be happy. One who has a duty to perform is a labourer.  
Even if he is a king or a god he has to labour.   
Saints must show compassion. One who is desireless is the God of all gods. Be  
desireless at least once. This can happen only when you ridicule this world  
and feel that it is untrue. Take your mind off this world and fix it on the  
Self. The objects are untrue and Reality is the Truth. When you make this  
attitude your own, you are through. Then you are at liberty to live as you  
will. One who cannot dance finds the ground uneven, but one who wants the  
knowledge of the Self will somehow get it.   
Prahlada, a great devotee of Lord Narayana, was ordered not to take the name  
of God by his father. Prahlada told his father, "You may be the owner of my  
body, yet you have no control over my mind." If you are very busy, identify  
your mind with Reality and perform the duty. Then the duty also becomes  
Reality. The intellect has to metamorphose. Mentally say, "I am Ram  
[consciousness]." Then whatever you do becomes consciousness. Reject the idea  
"I am so and so" and become the pervader of the whole universe.

**Supreme Self   
One who was without quality was recognised in His qualityless nature. One who  
was meaningful got His own meaning. After many days He met himself. He was the  
supreme Self, without qualities. He was taking his body as himself and had  
become miserable. He was released from birth and death after reaching Him to  
His original place, state. He was identified as He was originally. All the  
forms in the world is in his own Self. He is imminent in all, so He does not  
have the idea of difference. The curtain of difference was pulled away. At  
once he became the servant at his Master's Feet. To honour that supreme Self  
for whom all that effort, scriptures and purpose were practised, all those  
methods became full of meaning. By God's grace a birth in human species was  
acquired. If a man acts he can become God.   
That came to bear fruit today. One's own nature was attained. A golden day  
dawned. He was satiated with the drink of the nectar of immortality. Today I  
reached my own Home. All that labour was successful. We met ourselves after  
many, many years. We had missed each other. I was serving someone else taking  
him to be Myself. For millions of births we had missed ourselves. We were  
deluded. That delusion has gone away and He became the supreme Self.   
He was giving service and behaving as a donkey in the form of a body. Taking  
the body for the Self he was nursing it. In this way he wasted his whole  
birth. This is night in the form of ignorance â which is to labour for the  
donkey in the form of a body for one's whole life and then get born in the  
other various species. This ignorance is responsible for not allowing us to be  
aware of our true nature. This human birth is here to dissolve such ignorance.  
Poor fellow, he does not get any time during the night. This is itself the  
forgetting of one's own nature. Call it night or ignorance, that is the source  
of our misery.   
For example, some friends of a retarded man made him drink a lot of liquor,  
and seeing him completely intoxicated, the other friends, according to what  
they had decided before, started crying aloud and spoke to the intoxicated man  
thus:"What can we do when we see your condition, we feel so sad. Just a few  
minutes ago we had gone to your house when we saw that your wife had become a  
widow." As soon as he heard this the drunken man started howling and crying,  
and when other people asked him why he was crying, he told them that his wife  
had become a widow. "A mountain of misery has come down and is crushing me."  
Then they explained to him, "How can your wife become a widow while you are  
still alive? You being alive and your wife becoming a widow, are these two not  
contradictory things?" The drunkard, however, said, "No, no, you people do not  
understand anything. My friends recently had gone to my house, and they saw  
with their own eyes that my wife has become a widow."   
Then all his friends had a good laugh at his stupidity. This ridiculous scene  
is not presented only in the case of the drunkard but such a blatant mistake  
is made by every human being. Without making use of their brain they look  
through other people's eyes. Let others say anything. My Self is pure and  
changeless, It is the light of all lights. It is impossible that It perishes  
at any time. He is of the nature of existence-consciousness-bliss, and is the  
witness of all. Yet, even if this is so, we still ask in such a pitiable way,  
"How can we achieve happiness?" And we pray for God's mercy thinking that we  
are caught up in a big calamity. We rub our nose before God and slap our own  
face. We even blurt out the words: "We are mean insects."   
Yet this sort of situation is not at all proper. Find out the goal of your  
life and try to experience your Self. Remove that wrong feeling that you are  
mortal. You have created this false concept for yourself because you are  
intoxicated due to the drink called 'ignorance'. Stand up with confidence in  
Self. Turn within. Do not entertain any fear for anything. Eradicate  
completely the mental modification which goes out. Actually, if you think of  
your true nature by asking yourself "Who am I?", or "What am I?", you will  
realise that there is no one as great as you are. Have self-confidence. Make  
the thought, "I am the supreme Self", steady within yourself. You will surely  
never fail to cross the ocean of this mundane existence. See only through the  
sight of Self. Do not look through other people's eyes. All the relations are  
ready to fool you.   
Never mind the body while practising this, even if it goes to the gallows. "I  
am a witness of this body. Let the body stay or go, but my heart is at the  
feet of Panduranga [Master]." Go on contemplating this and intuitive  
perception is sure to come. When one is practising this there are many  
obstacles that appear on the way. For example, there are seventeen hundred  
difficulties for a girl with a flat nose who has to get married.

Ignorant corpses are only moving about in the whole world. Life in ignorance  
is like death. Who is eating? All this service is for whom? You do not know.  
He serves six ghosts [the five elements and the ego]. This body has to perform  
many kinds of service till its death and the whole life was wasted. After  
death, according to Hindu customs, the body and bones burn as a collection of  
wood and the hair burns as a bundle of grass. Those who were looking started  
weeping. This dead man asks, "Are you free from this fate, because you behave  
exactly as I did?" Even if the toilet is cleaned thoroughly, it is still a  
toilet. World means "living corpses", where there is no idea of one's own true  
nature. They serve this body, and take along with them a bundle of sins and  
virtues. This is worldly existence of an ignorant person. But when he knows  
Himself, and rejects all the pride that he is the body, then, immediately he  
meets Himself. Then all his actions have borne fruit.   
According to the Hindus, the ancestors keep waiting. The last of the seventy  
two generations has achieved, so they are happy. These mean thirty six  
ancestral generations of mother and thirty six of the father. One who has  
redeemed them was born to be one who knew his Self. That is the reason why,  
when a son is born they distribute sweets. It is impossible to describe the  
glory of Self-knowledge. Human life is meaningful because it is given with a  
purpose to achieve Self-knowledge. When that has been achieved it has indeed  
become fully meaningful. Its purpose has been served. For example, there are  
nine hundred thousand stars but it is only the moon that shines brightly. The  
sun rises, the rain falls, because there is only one who knows Reality. It is  
for the sake of that knower â therefore, there is no limit to his merit.  
Along with the position of the Immortal One he also gets a throne of Almighty.   
Now, let what happens just happen. Let whatever was going, go, the last doubt  
is eradicated. We have to live a few days. Let us pass the days playfully in  
joy, then let this body die on a bed or on the ground. Wherever the diamond is  
placed it is sure to shine. It may be in one's hand or on one's neck. This  
supreme Self in the form of Reality will likewise remain happy whatever the  
situation. The conviction should not shake. If the conviction is steadfast on  
Truth, then even on the path of knowledge, strength can be gained.   
That body, which has the knowledge of Self in it, will perforce emit light.  
But there should be that one strong conviction, "I am the Lord who exists, I  
am the Lord who pervades." All that ought to have been achieved, He has  
achieved.   
The world is as one looks at it. One who identified himself with the divine  
Self found all as Reality. If one becomes an ego [gross body] he finds the  
world accordingly: "For one who is good, the world is also good." The ignorant  
one finds the world full of different entities. For the realised person, "It  
is all One and there is no duality."   
The rise of the physical eyes happens due to two people. Therefore, duality is  
seen. Oneness appears to the Master's sons because they are born from One. The  
Master gives the third eye, The Eye of Knowledge. Duality moved away. The veil  
of the illusion was pulled away on one side. Nothing appears as anything but  
One. The vision could see no difference. The state of being became sans  
difference. All that entered inside from outside created difference. But  
whatever is Truth is without difference. The five ghosts [elements] ran away.  
The ghost was exorcised. The bad period of seven and a half years [due to the  
wrong positioning of saturn] has passed away. All the nine planets have also  
gone away. All ran away to their respective homes. The ego himself vanished. A  
veil of dirt had come over him due to delusion. "I am the body", "I am a  
brahmin" â these ideas deluded him. Then he realised himself as the supreme  
Self.   
This monkey who acts according to his mind was eating fruits and flowers in  
the jungle. But when he met his Master, he became God. He got that which  
belonged to him due to his Master's advice. All is divine Self. One who saw  
Himself, his birth and death vanished. To see God in all beings is the worship  
song for God. One who is in the heart of all is God. Otherwise, some people  
were caught up in customs of purity and impurity, or a rosary or repeating  
mantra. Thus Saint Kabir says, "Worship the ever existing God, then 8.4  
million births are evaded."
