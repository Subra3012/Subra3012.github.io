http://www.easwaran.org/page/64   
Eknath Easwaran (December, 1910 â October 26, 1999) is known as a spiritual  
teacher and the author of books on meditation and how to lead a fulfilling  
life, as well as a translator and interpreter of Indian literature.   
In 1961 Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation and Nilgiri  
Press, based in northern California. Nilgiri Press publishes over two dozen  
books he authored.   
Eknath Easwaran was influenced by Gandhi, whom Easwaran met when he was a  
young man. Easwaran developed a method of meditation â silent repetition in  
the mind of memorized inspirational passages from the world's great  
religionsâ which later came to be known as Passage Meditation.   
Eknath Easwaran was born in 1910 in a village in **Kerala**, British India.  
Eknath is his surname, Easwaran his given name. Brought up by his mother, and  
by his maternal grandmother whom he honored as his spiritual teacher, he was  
schooled in his native village until the age of sixteen, when he went to  
attend a Catholic college fifty miles away. Here he acquired a deep  
appreciation of the Christian tradition. He graduated at the University of  
Nagpur in English and law. He served as Professor of English literature at the  
University of Nagpur.   
In 1959, he came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar at the University  
of California, Berkeley.   
From 1960 he gave classes on meditation in the San Francisco Bay Area.   
 **His first major work was his 3-volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita**,   
the Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, the first volume of which was printed in  
1975 and the last in 1984. His book Meditation on the program of meditation  
and allied discplines that he developed first appeared in 1978.   
Essence of the Upanishads, originally entitled Dialogue with death: The  
spiritual psychology of the Katha Upanishad, and explains how the Katha  
Upanishad embraces the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of  
a powerful mythic quest â the story of a young hero who ventures into the  
land of death in search of immortality. "Essence of the Upanishads is a  
westerner's guide to this vitally important Indian text and its modern  
relevance to the Indian mindset and spirituality."   
The 3 volumes of the Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living are conceived as handbooks  
for applying the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita to lives today. End of Sorrow  
concentrates on the individual â how one can discover one's innermost  
nature, and transform one's life through self-realization, selfless service,  
and meditation. Like a Thousand Suns addresses relationships â how one can  
heal divisions in society, within one's relationships, and within oneself, and  
realize the unity governing all creation. To Love is To Know Me gives a global  
view, describing what individual readers can do to make a difference in the  
world today, and ends with a description of bhakti yoga, the path of devotion.   
Gandhi the Man traces how Mohandas Gandhi transformed himself into one of the  
world's great spiritual leaders.   
Easwaran's program for spiritual growth consists of eight points was  
introduced with his 1978 book Meditation. Each point had a dedicated chapter:  _Meditation: Silent repetition upon memorized inspirational passages from one  
of the world 's great religions. Practiced for one-half hour each morning.   
The Mantram: silent repetition of a mantram, holy name or hallowed phrase from  
one of the world's great religions.   
Slowing Down: set priorities to reduce stress and hurry   
One-Pointed Attention: give full concentration to whatever matter is currently  
at hand   
Training the Senses: enjoy simple pleasures in order to avoid craving for  
unhealthy excess   
Putting Others First: denounce selfishness and cultivating altruism   
Spiritual Companionship: practice meditation in the company of others   
Reading the Mystics: draw inspiration from the writings of the scriptures of  
all religions._

## Kanaka Dasa  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: August 31, 2010, 01:00:10 PM  
---  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanaka_Dasa   
Kanaka Dasa (1509â1609) **was a great poet, philosopher, musician and  
composer from Karnataka. He is known for his Kirtanes and Ugabhoga  
compositions in the Kannada language for Carnatic music.** Like some other  
dasas, he often used colloquial language for his compositions.   
Thimmappa Nayaka was his original name and he belonged to chieftain (Kuruba)  
family of Kaginele in Haveri district. He was born to the Kuruba gowda couple  
Biregowda and Beechamma at baad. Kanaka Nayaka being of the warrior community  
(Kuruba) his defeat in the field of battle, directed him to the path of  
devotion. He came to be called Kanaka Nayaka as he found a treasure-trove of  
gold (kanaka means gold in Kannada).   
Kanaka Dasa was well educated and capable of analyzing the society  
microscopically. Based on one of his compositions it is interpreted that after  
he severely got injured in a war and was miraculously saved, he gave up his  
profession as a warrior and devoted his life to composing music and literature  
with philosophy explained in common man's language.   
The deity he worshiped was Adhikeshava of Kaginele, presently in Haveri  
district of Karnataka. Kaginele, now a village, was a prosperous place and  
trading center in the Middle Ages. Out of the many of his compositions, about  
240 are fully accountable today. All his Karnataka Music compositions end with  
mudra (signature) Kaginele Adhikeshava.   
In addition to being a poet he worked as a social reformer by down playing  
dogmatic communities that were suppressing the disadvantaged communities.  
Kanakadasa made extreme effort in reforming the disadvantaged communities by  
convincing them to give-up their age old obsolete social practices and adapt  
to the changing world. He effectively used music to convey his philosophy. He  
lived at Tirupathi in his last days.   
He is one of the greatest musician, composer, poet, social reformer,  
philosopher and saints that India has ever seen.   
 **The following is the translation of Nee Mayeyolago:**   
Quote  
> Are you a creature of illusion? or illusion your creation?   
>   
> Are you a part of the body? Or is the body a part of you?   
>   
> Is space within the house? Or the house within space? Or are both space and  
> the house within the seeing eye?   
>   
> Is the eye within the mind? Or the mind within the eye? Or are both the eye  
> and the mind within you?   
>   
> Does sweetness lie in sugar, or sugar in sweetness? Or do both sweetness and  
> sugar lie in the tongue?   
>   
> Is the tongue within the mind? Or the mind within the tongue? Or are both  
> the tongue and the mind within you?   
>   
> Does fragrance lie in the flower? Or the flower in fragrance? Or do both the  
> flower and fragrance lie in the nostrils? I cannot say, O Lord Adikeshava of  
> Kaginele, O! peerless one, are all things within you alone?  
This was a famous phrase Kanakadaasa is quoted to have said in front of all  
vedantis, when asked who will attain Moksha. This question was asked by  
Vyasatirtha in a sabha, to actually bring light into Kanakadasara bhakti.  
Kanakadasa humbly but assertively tells that no one here will attain moksha.  
Only he can attain Moksha, on hearing this the pandits present there were  
taken aback and were very angry.   
Then Vyasatirtha asks Kanaka to exlpain what it means, then he goes ahead and  
explains the meaning, which actually meant w **ho has lost the Naanu (  
"Self"/"I") i.e.; ego will attain Moksha. **   
Kanakadasa has special association with Udupi and as he was the follower of  
Sri Vyasaraja Swamiji. On the advice of Vyasaraja Swamiji he had come to  
Udupi. He stood outside the matha and was lost in his prayers to Lord Krishna  
by singing songs in praise of the Lord and had darshan of the lord through a  
small window.   
All devotees who visit **Udupi Krishna Matha take a peek at Lord Krishna**  
through the small window, wishing to relive the ecstasy of Kanakadasa. It is  
also a memorial to Kanakadasa and a testimony to the eclectic Hindu belief  
that devotion, poetry and sainthood are above caste and creed and certainty  
above orthodoxy. In all Hindu temples the deity and the main door of the  
temple face the east, but in Udupi the deity faces the west. Kanakadasa once  
wanted to have a darshan (encounter) of the Lord Krishna in Udupi. He was not  
allowed into the shrine by castist priests as he was not a higher-caste by  
birth. Kanakadasa then started singing the praises of Shri Krishna and was  
lost to outside world in a corner outside the temple.   
Legend has it that the murti of Krishna, which had previously been facing  
east, turned around to face west, as the western wall collapsed so that  
Kanakadasa could have darshan. A small window was constructed at the breach  
later. The idol of Lord Krishna is still today worshipped through the window.  
This window came to be known as Kanakana kindi (Kanakaâs window). Historical  
evidence shows that there was indeed a small earthquake on that day which led  
to the collapse of the wall and turning of the statue of krishna to west. The  
memory of Kanakadasa was permanently etched in the temple of his beloved Lord  
Krishna. Today that window stands as a tribute to the unique saint of  
Karnataka.   
From that time onward, Kanakadasa could have the darshan of Sri Krishna with  
his physical eyes as well as his inner eye. To perpetuate this sacred memory,  
the tradition of looking at the icon of Sri Krishna through this window before  
entering the shrine started.

Dear prasanth,   
Very nice post on this day of Janmashtami. Kanaka Dasa was an   
outcaste and the brahmins of Udupi did not allow him to see or enter   
the sanctum sanctorum of Krishna. He simply stayed near the outerwall on the  
rear side of the sanctum and was praying to Krishna.   
Krishna turned 180 degrees and faced the wall and through the window the saint  
could have darshan of Krishna. The orthodox brahmins were bewildered and  
brought him inside. Even today, in Udupi, the darshan for everyone is through  
that window [called Kankana Kidikki], only since Krishna did not turn to the  
original position again!   
Kanakadasa was not well read and he knew only colloquial Kannada   
but he brought in sublime thoughts through that simple language.   
Coincidentally, in Sri Sankara TV, by about 5 am, this morning, they showed  
Udupi. We could see Krishna through the window.   
Krishna nee begene baro....   
Arunachala Siva.

Where there was Rama, there was Ravana, where there was Krishna there was  
Kamsa, where there was Prahallad, there was Hiranyakasipu, similarly even in  
our Sanathana Dharma, where we have had great knowledge, there have been such  
customs...   
It is true that in ancient India, Sati was practiced with full spirit, i.e.  
especially in the Rajput cult, the widow jumped into the fire without any  
hesitation or pain, they were able to do it with the spirit of union with  
their expired husbands.   
But people began imposing such acts on others as well to prove their  
pathivratham. It is only the half baked knowledge people who have created such  
bad practices, which spread like virus all over India.   
For example, nobody understood the real essence of untouchability; when yogis  
were practicing Raja Yoga, they emanated extreme energies in their bodies, and  
touching them proved disastrous for others, its like touching a electric wire!  
Do we ever go and touch a live wire? a person could even die or get paralyzed.  
Thats why through discrimination, this untouching the great yogis came about.   
But again, half bake knowledge people in ancient times began to impose it on  
others posing themselves as a great yogi, tapasvi, etc... which inturn became  
into a great Brahman, etc...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
I agree with you. Some of these practices had a noble purpose.   
But they were diluted and made compulsory due to human indifference to the  
purpose. The widowed women voluntarily should jump into the funeral pyre of  
her husband. Later they were forced to jump even when they were unwilling.  
Similarly, tonsuring of heads of widows. They definitely wanted to look bad  
in the eyes of other   
coveting men, so they tonsured their heads, removed kumkum, and started  
wearing white saris. But there could be some widows, who   
did not want to do all these and they thought their own mental control alone  
would be a safeguard against evil men. But even   
these women were forced to do these ugly acts.   
Yogis and Jnanis and great tapasvins similarly had a warmth and energy  
emission from their bodies. Perhaps the untouchability   
came from this sense. The devotees of Bhagavan Ramana had said   
that when He was standing close to them, they could feel that warmth and some  
devotees had seen the halo of glow around His   
head. One overcurious devotee touched His right chest and found   
three beats, period, and three beats like this. He was terrified and   
came back running!   
Any dilution of spiritual and social practices, missing the purpose behind  
them, is a great horror.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 **Your post as above regarding the origin of untouchabiity in India is a news to me and I have not so far come across such reasoning in any print media**. **Can you give some information about the source of your information and also when the practice of untouchability started in India and who started this practice first in India?** **.It looks like that untouchability was practiced during Bhagavan Adi Sankara 's period itself otherwise he would not have asked the Chandala (an outcaste)to move away from him and Bhagavan Shankara would not have composed the beautiful Maneesha Panchakam which talks about core principle advaita which talks of 'Ellam Onre"(All is one).**.In the very first sloka, Bhagavan asks Chandala to move away because he is an outcaste and not because the yogic power of Sri Adi Sankara will affect the Chandala. From Maneesha Panchkam,it is evident that untouchability was practised in full force during Shankara's period itself,otherwise he would not have composed Maneesha Panchakam after getting enlightenment from lord Siva..Whatever reason we may attribute for the origin of the untouchability, it is most cruel and barbaric practice to be thought of in the land of Advaita. Our scrpturure says that do not do to others what we do not want to be done to us. **What ever reason we may attribute for the origin of caste and untouchability, both are curse in our society and against the scriptures**. **I will be thankful if Mr.Subramanian or Mr.Nagaraj or any other member post Maneesha Panchakam with commentry in this forum for the benifit of Ramana devotees.**

Dear viswanathan,   
I have posted a few posts on Maneesha Panchakam, about 6 months   
back. I have covered each verse, as per Brahmasri Nochur   
Venkataraman's Satsangh. I do not readily have a hard copy on these   
posts. Kindly check up roughly from Feb 2010 onwards. I have also   
covered Siva Manasa Puja in the past. ramanaduli wanted this.   
In the beginning of Viveka Choodamani, Sri Sankara says that amongst other  
qualifications, a brahmin birth is essential. This clearly shows that  
casteism was rampant even during Sri Sankara's times. Bhagavan Ramana while  
rendering Tamizh prose, has omitted this brahmin birth and has merely said a  
human birth.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian garu and viswanathan garu,   
Once when a devotee complained about caste system and few key points bhagavan  
ramana said are below,   
\--> There are countries where there are no such distinctions of caste. Are  
they free from trouble? There are wars,internecine struggle, etc. Why do you  
not remedy the evils there?   
\--> Differences are always there. There are not only human beings, but also  
animals, plants, etc. The state of affairs cannot be helped.   
\--> A unity runs through the diversity. The Self is the same in all.   
\--> There are differences in the limbs of oneâs body. When the hand touches  
the foot the hand is not defiled. Each limb performs its function. Why do you  
object to differences?   
\--> **The only solution is for each man to realise his true nature.**

Dear prasanth,   
I agree with what Bhagavan Ramana has said. Bhagavan Ramana   
was not interested in any social reforms. He only said that one   
should reform oneself first and then to reform the other people.   
If one reforms onself, then he would understand that Atma is the only   
all pervading thing and all the differentiation is Maya's play.   
Bhagavan Ramana said that differences do occur in some other forms,   
in every nation or a group of beings. In America, we had till recently   
the segregation of black and white. John Kennedy tried to abolish   
it but could not succeed fully. It took several years and today Americans  
have an Afro-American as President.   
In the meantime, new differences are occurring in countries. Rich   
and poor divide is there till time immemorial. You know the hue and cry in  
Indian parliament whether census should contain a detail about the caste  
mention.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Mr.Prasanth,   
 This has reference to Bhagavan's reply on caste as above " There are countries where there are no such distinctions of caste. Are they free from trouble? There are wars,internecine struggle, etc. Why do you not remedy the evils there?Differences are always there. There are not only human beings, but also animals, plants, etc. The state of affairs cannot be helped.".I do not know in what contest Bhagavan has given above reply.Animals do not have individuality and they do not have caste.Any way, in the countries where there is no caste but still they have problems such as wars,hunger,poverty, disease,rich and poor etc, all these problems affects a person at the physical level and these sufferings can be overcome by way of food,shelter,money etc whereas the caste and untouchabilty affects a person at emotional level. **A physical pain can be overcome whereas emotional pain cannot be overcome with money, food,medicine etc.Hence we cannot take shelter by quoting other countries where there is no caste but they have other problem.Even in an affluent country like US, if an African American is called by his colour as Black,the person is taken into task and hence people are very careful not use the word.Even in our country,if a Scheduled caste person is called by caste name,the caller is arrested under non bailable arrest warrant.**Such stringent laws have been framed by law maker because such word causes immense emotional injury. **We can appreciate the emotion pain caused by untouchability if only we are in other man's shoes**.We have been conditioned for years about caste and untouchability and it may take years to eradicate from our minds.

Dear viswanathan garu,   
You are right sir but all is not going well in foreign countries sir.   
Still there are many britishers in UK who still think they are superior when  
compared to indians and have quite a low impression on us.   
So they themselves are also having lot of problems sir.   
But that does not mean that i am supporting caste by birth sir but i am saying  
let us leave it to the higher power as he knows what is best and how to handle  
any kind of situation.   
Our duty is to eradicate mental feeling of untouchability in our mind as far  
as possible.   
I donot know how this caste by birth started when in bhagavad gita clearly it  
mentions that varna is by guna and not by birth.

Dear Prasanth ji   
It is very difficult to eradicate the caste system any where in the world.  
Some may not mind the birth but they do believe in their   
life style or status. The differences came as soon as the mind develops.  
Everything is in mind only that is what Bhagavan teaches.   
When the mind dies there would not be caste or creed. Very few people only  
want to observe their mind and get rid of it.   
We cannot do anything on the otherhand to observe our mind only.   
In my childhood whenever the fourth class of people walk on the street people  
used to sprinkle water on the road. They were called THOTI. Due to Ghandhi ji  
this was eradicated. But in down south, in villages, still it can be seen like  
in tea shop they keep   
separate glasses. Now it is much better in cities. Young people may not know  
how our india was before independence. It was terrible. The independence what  
we have is not a real one. When people get independence from their mind (Anma  
viduthali)   
that is the real independence.   
If we ask ourselves this question also..... as Bhagavan says...... everyone is  
independed. All the differences are happening in our waking state. Is not it?

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
I want to know when Adhi Shankara sang the Maneesha panchakam. I gone through  
your post.   
Vyasa smiled at him. He then told Sankara: You are given another   
16 years of life, because there are many more work you have to   
undertake. First you go to Kasi and meet Kumarila Bhatta and   
Mandanamisrar. Sankara then prostrated before him and sang   
his Maneesha Panchakam once more.   
I read somewhere that after seeing the chandala roopam of Shiva, Shankara sang  
this panchakam. Could you please clarify this doubt.   
Thanking you,   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes. As per reliable Sankara Vijayam biographies, Maneesha Panchakam, was  
sung on the banks of Ganga, when Sankara met   
Chandala.   
The whole thing is a pageant or a drama. Does not Sankara know   
there is only one Atma. The great saint who sang Nirvanana Shaktam, as soon  
as Govinda Bhagavad Pada asked him: Who are You?, will he ask Chandala to  
stay away from his path? It is all a drama. To say Chandala is Siva himself  
who came with 4 dogs, which are 4 vedas, is again a pageant.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear viswanathan,   
I think the whole summary of this caste issue in India is somewhat   
like this: 1. No doubt, casteism developed right from Vedic times and there   
is no denying the fact that the so called lower castes people were   
subjugated to miseries and emotional pains right up to early 20th   
century in India.   
2\. But amongst these Vedic brahmins, or for that matter from any   
caste of life, if a person could attain Jnana, then these differences,   
from his point of view, were all imaginary, man-made and must   
be really loathed. They, after realizing the Ekatma tattvam, did not   
bother about the castes differences in the society. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY  
DID NOT TRY TO ENTER INTO AREAS OF REFORMS, because they had a better job of  
staying in the atmic bliss.   
We have stories of Tiru Jnana Sambandhar who had a friend a player   
of Yazh [a veena type instrument] who was an outcaste. When   
Sambandhar went to a brahmin's house on invitation, this Neelakanta Yazhpanar  
hesitated to enter the house with   
Samabandhar. Sambandhar took him and they sang some songs   
in that house and the other played his Yazh. It is said that the   
fire sacrifice which was burning in that brahmin's house, glowed   
more ebulliantly when Yazhpanar played his instrument.   
So also the case of Tirupanazhwar, one of the 12 Azhwars. He always moved  
with other Azhwars of higher caste and went into Vishnu temples and sang  
melodious songs.   
There was again one Narayana Guru. He was a spiritual person   
and also a reformer. He himself hailed from ezhava caste in Kerala. Because  
of his erudite Sankskrit knowledge and understanding Jnana   
marga, no one dared to oppose him. He had his maths in Kanchipuram and other  
places in Tamizh Nadu also. He met   
Bhagavan Ramana and both took food together. Narayana Guru   
sang the famous song Nirvritti Panchakam on Bhagavan. This   
man's 156th birth anniversary was celebrated in Kanchipuram and other places a  
few days back. Narayana Guru, no doubt worked against caste system, but had  
no ill-feelings towards brahmins and he spoke high of Bhagavan Ramana, because  
He was a Brahma Jnani.   
So the caste system was there and it was rampant. But those who realized the  
Self, found no difference in castes. And at the same time, they did not go  
into the society to reform the system.   
3. Today the caste system is removed by the Governments by law, but other types of 'castes' have sprung up. The removal of caste system went to the other extreme of continuous brahmin baiting,   
for no fault of the brahmins of today.   
Arunachala Siva.**
