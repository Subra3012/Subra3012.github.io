## Arunachala Visiri Samiyar

Extracts from http://www.arunachalasamudra.org/yogiram.html   
Visiri Saamiyar Sri Sri Yogi Ram Surat Kumar a true saint and our Father's  
devotee.   
Over to Visir Samiyar on Arunachala in his own words/of his life: He always acknowledged with reverence his huge debt to sacred Arunachala and  
Arunachaleswarar Temple, saying: 'This hill and this temple, they have saved  
this beggar,' and with the utmost gratitude for the sanctity of Mount  
Arunachala, he would later say: 'This beggar wandering here and there, tired of wandering but having no home -  
Arunachalesvara, in the form of this hill, had mercy on this miserable sinner.  
So he gives thanks, a thousand thanks, to this holy hill, this holy temple.  
Oh, the magnanimity of the Lord! He has given me shelter for twenty long  
years. Whereas others who come are enabled to stay only days or weeks. . .   
For thousands of years the hill has given shelter to so many dirty sinners  
like me - and Arunachala will give us shelter for thousand of years to come.'   
 When Yogi Ramsuratkumar used to walk around the Hill, out of humility, he would always walk in the opposite direction of all the other pilgrims.   
 Many times Yogi Ramsuratkumar would say: 'The mountain helps us.' He himself spent many years wandering on the mountain, taking shelter in its caves. Based on his own comments, his transformation seems to have been connected in part to his subtle relationship to the divine force within Arunachala.   
Where is the Fire?   
The Fire is there on the hill there.   
But I don't see it there.   
You can see it if you are really bent upon seeing it.   
Are you afraid of being engulfed by it?   
Then you can't see it   
Have courage, no fear   
You are sure to see it   
 Yogi Ramsuratkumar   
 The 'Fire' referred to by Yogi Ramsuratkumar (as poet) is the mystical Fire of Creation, the light that is perceived burning within Mount Arunachala as the embodiment of Shiva: 'This holy Fire burned at the core of the beggar's absolute certainty: his  
faith in a Power that governs everything, controls everything.'   
Yogi Ramsuratkumar

## staying at Arunachala Asramam  
Author: jozia               Date: January 05, 2007, 07:11:03 PM

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.

**OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA**   
Hello Krishnaji,   
How was the weather when you were there?   
I normally go during the end of August or early Sept and the weather is  
generally good- not too hot or wet.   
The last time I went in April and got fried!   
I shall be going end of July and wonder what the weather will be.

Dear Sir,   
The weather is now far better, there are heavy winds without rain and not  
storm like. In July it will further improve.   
I am a AC addict. But when I bear the heat in thiruvannamalai, it is a  
divine prasad, a burning brazer of our bad karma.   
Arunachalam.

dear sundaram sir,   
I saw in this forum private message that you have written to my gmail. But in  
office I could not open that mailbox. I am waiting for the weekend to open it  
as I am all the more eager and dont have internet connection at home.   
Will soon have the blessings to hear your voice sir.

Thanks Krishnaji for the information. I like your viewpoint about the  
Tiruvannamalai heat - so optimistic and positive! That's what they call  
"turning defeat into victory" and "turning pain into ectasy"!!

all said and done i wish to submit that whatever be the inherited whether  
conditions to be, say,even in acute summer, it is a fact one can not feel heat  
when one is in Ramanasramam and around in that sober, sacred, ambiance.
