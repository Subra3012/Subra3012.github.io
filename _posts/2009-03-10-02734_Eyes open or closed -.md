## Eyes open or closed ?

Practising Who am I? with eyes closed tends, for me, to bring more challenges  
in I-thoughts.   
Practising Who am I? with eyes open, for me, brings more rest of the sight and  
fewer I-thoughts..   
Is there any recommendation or instruction that is given as a general  
guideline ?

Hi Mikroth   
I believe that Sri Ramana practiced for many years with eyes closed, but in  
his later years with eyes open.   
(Not that I've read of any prescriptions, in this respect.)   
Best wishes   
Paul

Dear Mikrioth,   
Bhagawan always said Self is your Guru. As your Self is Bhagawan himself.  
Listen to your InnerSelf. It will always guide you correctly!   
Nagaraj

Dear milkroth and Nagaraj,   
For mature practisers, either way is okay. But for beginners,   
Bhagavan Ramana told, when an identical question was asked   
by Annamalai Swami: "Keeping eyes closed, is like hitting a ball, standing close to the   
wall. The ball will come back, with equal force and hit you back.   
You have to throw it to the wall from a distance, so that it may   
not rebound with much force. Similarly, beginners should practise   
meditation/self enquiry, with eyes open, because the mind will   
not disturb you with much force. With eyes closed, the mind's mischief/force  
will be more."   
 \- Annamalai Swami - Final Talks.   
The mind becomes more active, because the eyes are closed. This   
we experience, while going to bed for sleep. With lights off, and body   
at rest, the mind plays havoc, and one does not get sleep, unless   
one clears up the mind, from thoughts.   
Bhagavan Ramana kept His eyes closed in Patala Lingam, and other   
places, till He came to Virupaksha Cave, more because, He did not   
want to 'see' anyone. If any one sees His with eyes open, he will   
come and ask questions, and hence He avoided such disturbances   
by closing His eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.
