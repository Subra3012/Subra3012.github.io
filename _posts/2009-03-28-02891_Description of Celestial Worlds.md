Maitreya says- "O Brahmin! Kindly narrate now about the celestial worlds and  
the position of stars and planets   
there."   
Parashar says- At a height of 1,00,000 Yojans above the earth is the sphere of  
the Sun. 1,00,000 Yojans above it   
is the sphere of the Moon and 1,00,000 Yojans above it is the sphere of the  
stars.   
At a height of 2,00,000 Yojans above, the sphere of stars is Buddh (Mercury)  
and 2,00,000 Yojans above it is   
Shukra (Venus). Above Venus are Mangal (Mars), Brihaspati (Jupiter), and Shani  
(Saturn) at respective heights of   
2,00,000 Yojans each. 1,00,000 Yojans above the Saturn is Saptarishi and  
1,00,000 Yojans above it is the sphere   
of Dhruv. It appears as the centre of a bright ring.   
One crore Yojans above Dhruv is Maharloka where sages like Bhrigu etc. live.  
Two crore Yojans above   
Maharloka is Janaloka where BrahmaÂ’s sons Sanakaadi Kumars live. At a height  
of 8,00,00,000 Yojans above   
Janaloka is Tapaloka live deities named Vairaaj who are never consigned to  
flames. Twelve crore Yojans above   
Tapaloka is Satyaloka which is also known as Brahmaloka. Only immortal beings  
live there.   
\- Vishnu Purana

All 'lokas' in a sense are in our mind. Once Bhagavan Ramana was   
asked by a devotee: Whether there are Vaikunta, Brahmaloka, Kailasa etc.,  
Bhagavan said that all these were true and in every loka someone like that  
devotee was sitting before Him and He was answering a question like that!  
Then, He smiled and said: All these are in our minds.   
Arunachala Siva.
