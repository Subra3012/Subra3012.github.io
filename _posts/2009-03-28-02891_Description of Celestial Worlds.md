## Tiru ViLaiyadal Puranam

Once Abhisheka Pandya was ruling Madurai. He was a great Siva   
bhakta who was praying to Somasundara of Madurai, every day.   
On full moon days, he used to do pooja to Somesundara night long,   
with special flowers, rose water, sandal paste and camphor.   
On a night of Chitra Poornima, Indra came to Madurai for pooja to   
Somasundara. He had to wait for long since Pandya's pooja was   
not over. He hurriedly finished his pooja in the early morning and retruned  
to heavens. Varuna, the rain god saw Indra sitting on his   
throne in a sad state and he asked for the reason. Indra explained   
the reason. Varuna laughed at Indra and said: There are several Siva temples  
on the earth. Why should wait only at Madurai. Indra replied: In Pandya  
kingdom, Somasundara is the king of all temples. How can I go elsewhere?   
Varuna then asked: I am having severe incurable stomach pain. Even   
the physician of devas, Danvantri could not cure it. Can Somasundara cure my  
stomach pain?   
Indra replied: "Why not? What He needs is only true submission   
and devotion.   
But this fella, Varuna wanted to adopt a different method. He wanted  
Somasundara to appear before him and then confer the blessing. He asked the  
ocean to shower torrential rains on Madurai. The rains came and there were  
floods everywhere. The king was afraid of deluge since the sea was  
overflowing and screaming as if in Tsunami. He did not know how to protect his  
subjects from the calamity. He rushed to Somasundara Temple and prayed to  
Him.   
Siva wanted to grace the king and also punish Indra. He appeared before the  
Pandya and told him: Do not worry a bit. I am sending the clouds from my  
matted locks.   
The clouds from His matted locks swarmed the sky and descended on Madurai and  
sucked all the waters and also the sea in such a way the oceans on the East  
coast became half of its size! The king became very happy and did special  
poojas at the temple. The clouds from   
Siva's matted locks became four great city-walls and protected the city of  
Madurai from then on. Madurai also got a new name -- The   
City of Four Walls. Nan Mada Koodal. Varuna rushed to Siva and prostrated in  
shame and fear. Siva told him to go back and do penance on Him for curing his  
stomach pain.

## The four means of Moksha  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 01:55:27 PM

If the four sentinels that wait at the gates of Moksha (salvation) viz.,   
**Shanti (sweet patience or quiescence of mind),   
Vichara (Atmic enquiry),   
Santosha (contentment of mind) and   
Sadhu-Sanga (association with the wise) be befriended,  
then will there be any obstacle to the attainment of salvation ?

## The Advice of Yama  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 02:00:55 PM

This universe which arose through Karmas will perish through Karmas only. The  
weapons with   
which we can wield the destruction of the universe are the   
former Karmas. There fore try to take hold of those Karmas   
through which means you will be able to overpower them.

## Purpose of Holding Vedas  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 02:07:58 PM  
---  
Brahmaji is also shown as holding Vedas is one of his hands why? It is natural  
to be curious about it. Vedas are   
undoubtedly the most ancient scriptures in the word. Even the great deluge  
(Pralaya) could not destroy Vedas for   
almighty Brahma himself had taken incarnation to save Vedas during deluge.  
Hence Vedas have no beginning   
and no end. Besides Vedas also remind Brahmaji of the previous Kalpa (the  
grand period that includes all the four   
Yugas). Vedas also teach us that everything is destructible, only the truth  
can not be destroyed. Hence in the   
carnation of destructible body, never forget the indestructible, eternal,  
almighty Paramatma because every other   
thing in the world is bound to be destroyed one day.

Maitreya says- "O Brahmin! Kindly narrate now about the celestial worlds and  
the position of stars and planets   
there."   
Parashar says- At a height of 1,00,000 Yojans above the earth is the sphere of  
the Sun. 1,00,000 Yojans above it   
is the sphere of the Moon and 1,00,000 Yojans above it is the sphere of the  
stars.   
At a height of 2,00,000 Yojans above, the sphere of stars is Buddh (Mercury)  
and 2,00,000 Yojans above it is   
Shukra (Venus). Above Venus are Mangal (Mars), Brihaspati (Jupiter), and Shani  
(Saturn) at respective heights of   
2,00,000 Yojans each. 1,00,000 Yojans above the Saturn is Saptarishi and  
1,00,000 Yojans above it is the sphere   
of Dhruv. It appears as the centre of a bright ring.   
One crore Yojans above Dhruv is Maharloka where sages like Bhrigu etc. live.  
Two crore Yojans above   
Maharloka is Janaloka where Brahmas sons Sanakaadi Kumars live. At a height  
of 8,00,00,000 Yojans above   
Janaloka is Tapaloka live deities named Vairaaj who are never consigned to  
flames. Twelve crore Yojans above   
Tapaloka is Satyaloka which is also known as Brahmaloka. Only immortal beings  
live there.

All 'lokas' in a sense are in our mind. Once Bhagavan Ramana was   
asked by a devotee: Whether there are Vaikunta, Brahmaloka, Kailasa etc.,  
Bhagavan said that all these were true and in every loka someone like that  
devotee was sitting before Him and He was answering a question like that!  
Then, He smiled and said: All these are in our minds.
