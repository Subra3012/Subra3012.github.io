Dear sirs   
Please explain about these.   
Death......No life and no mind. What about the consiousness.   
deep sleep..........Life is there but no mind'   
coma.................Life is there but no mind and no consiousness? Is it?   
Unconsiousness.....Again life will be there but no mind.   
Those who will do sucide, what about their consiousness.   
or what is the different in between gyanai's death or agyanani's death.   
your comments please...   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Death - Both mind and prana, go away from body to catch   
another body, for a rebirth. There could be some time intervals.   
Sleep - Mind is under suspended animation. Breath is there.   
 (See Who am I?)   
Coma, unconsciousness - These are all like sleep only. No difference.  
Excepting that coma could be for a longer time.   
In all the cases, Consciousness is there. Even in dead body,   
the Self, consciousness is there. Like it is in atoms and electrons in a log  
of wood or stone. Because Consciousness   
is One without a second.   
A Jnani if He is a Jivan Mukta, like Bhagavan, the death is   
only leaving the world from the point of view of body only.   
His Spirit is everywhere, eternal. His mind and prana stand   
merged in Siva within already.   
Where is a Jnani who gets liberated at the time of death,   
his body leaves the world, his mind and prana merges   
in Siva at the time of death. The Spirit is of course, is eternal.   
An ajnani leaves the body, with mind and prana. The mind   
carries the knapsack of good and bad merits, depending upon   
which he takes a birth again.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is death only for the one who has a birth. What dies is what is born. So  
it is thoughts alone that is taking birth and dies for countless times. Are  
you born? first find out when you were born!   
God is always praised because of this natural law - what is born must die.  
this is what happens when you sleep. you are dead, i.e. you thoughts are dead.  
well we are not aware during our sleep because we don't know that we are  
consciousness. that awareness is present even during sleep. when we know that  
we are the consciousness, we would not even have the requirement of sleep. for  
there is no more birth or death (of thoughts) consciousness alone is.   
Coma is same as sleeping state - awareness is not present. no consciousness.  
therefore, it lays as a dead body.   
Unconsciousness is the state we are even at present !   
The death. what we know about death and birth is only what we see outside -  
when we saw a child being born we then thought - "oh so this is what is called  
as birth, and similarly, when we saw an old man die, the we thought - "oh this  
is what is called death" the fact is that one cannot find out his own Birth  
or Death. Try as much as you can, you can never trace your own birth - only so  
called others tell you when you are born - say you are born on 01/01/2001 at  
02:30 hours etc.... this also we only believe what others say! can you know  
where from you originated?   
The fact is you never originated! you are ever there, you have no death - for  
you are that awareness, that consciousness! Nothing dies or nothing is born!  
what dies is only the thoughts alone!

Dear ramanaduli, Nagaraj,   
What Nagaraj has said is quite correct. Except that even   
in coma state, the Awareness is still there, moribund. The   
patient may come back to life at any time. Some people   
have come back from coma state after 10 years.   
In Tamil, the states of wakefulness, dreaming and sleep,   
[that includes fainting, coma, etc.,] as Three wastelands,   
Mup-Pazh. For a Jnani all the three states are wastelands   
only, the Pazh=zero. Muruganar has composed a verse   
on this. Beyond this, is Turiya, the only Real state of   
staying in Brahman, even to call it as Fourth is incorrect,   
because that is the only Real and Permanent state. In   
Tamil verses like Tevaram and Tiruvachakam, one comes   
across this word, Muppazh. Saint Poet Tayumanavar sings: Muppzhkum appalai enru poven?   
When can I to "the beyond", that is really beyond the   
three states?   
Arunachala Siva.

Unconsciousness is the state we are even at present !   
Dear Nagaraj,   
This statement of yours is not correct. At present pure consciousness is here,  
mixed up with body, thoughts and self consciousness though, which is just a  
reflect of the first one. If it wasn´t so, any of these would exist nor even  
Bhagavan Sri Ramana could have been able of becoming pure consciousness. What  
He did was to focus attention on this pure consciousness which is here and now  
in all of us already, leaving the rest aside. And so He asks we all to do as  
well. How could we do it if our state were, as you say, a state of  
unconsciousness? Perhaps inattention would be a more correct term for our  
usual state at present?

Dear sir   
All comments are explained beautifully, The problems due to the vasanas, we  
forget in day to day life. That is why saints say   
VIZHITHRU. be awakened.

Dear Shadak,   
I feel what I have said is correct according to my understanding - If the  
consciousness is not permanent then, I can't help say that even even this  
moment, I am in some state of unconsciousness state. I am not in a position to  
acknowledge that I am in that BLISSFUL state. If at all the consciousness is  
awakened, I would not have any need to be here discussing and learning more  
from here!   
Consciousness is a state which is permanently being in the present moment.  
what ever we discuss here is only based on our past experiences. the mind  
lingers around this knowledge vasanas - to be in the present or the Turiya is  
to be even beyond knowledge!   
Pure Consciousness is ever present, there is no denying to that! But can we  
call it Pure Consciousness if it is mixed up with Body, Thoughts? What  
Bhagawan did was only to raise others up to consciousness who have so long  
been in an unconsciousness state!   
Please see this - only when you got in touch with Ramana was your  
consciousness brought into light, but until then? what can we say?  
Unconsciousness of our own self! thats what I meant! But you see our Vasanas  
are so strong that even after being shown light by Ramana about of true self -  
Consciousness, still we linger around this knowledge and needless discussions!

Dear shadak, ramanaduli and Nagaraj,   
Every one of you is correct in the way that you are explaining.   
Pure Consciousness = Brahman = Atma   
self-consciousness = only awareness of the body mind   
 complex, even though the Pure   
 Consciousness is ever present.   
 It is like a smoke around the fire.   
In the state of fainting, coma and sleep, the self consciousness   
is temporarily absent, but prana going and coming reveals   
that the body is not dead.   
In the state of Samadhi, Pure Consciousness alone is present.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
I couldn´t explain why being the presence of pure consciousness not a thought,  
nor an idea, nor a myth but a fact for me, I still need to go on learning and  
to have the support of sat sang with Bhagavan´s disciples. It only explains  
why Bhagavan´s teachings make so much sense to me, and why I look for this  
support and work in order to clarify the mind. But you are right: intellectual  
discussions based on knowledge are not helping, they make mind to become  
confuse and agitated instead of quiet, and only calmness and stillness can  
bring clarity up to it.   
Anyway, latest clarifications of Subramanian on ramanaduli´s question could  
be a good explanation. It is not the same to be only aware of the body mind  
complex that to have as well the unquestionable feeling of something else  
which is beyond it but supports and, somehow, generates it. I think that most  
of us are at this point and that it is not helping either to belittle this  
feeling as mere thought or intellectual knowledge just because mind is not  
fully enlightened. It is not my intention to convince anybody, but it was my  
responsibility to point to what is a very common mistake because belittling  
this felling, instead of making mind strong in inquiring, debilitates it.

Dear shadak,   
Yes, you are correct. Self enquiry is not an intellectual   
process. Bhagavan Ramana says,: Ask Who am I? This   
question is the only thought, which can be asked to oneself   
either one single time or a few times, whereafter, one should   
know His Self within and dive deep and merge with the Self.   
There is no point in asking Who am I? everyday for the   
whole life time, without comprehending that there is no   
answer for the question. Bhagavan Ramana says it should   
be used as a stick that stirs the funeral pyre. It is an   
instrument to burn the corpse in the fire fully and finally   
it is also thrown into the fire for its own destruction.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Until we get merged in the self, mind will wander and ask the question who I  
am? Till that time is not necessary to keep on asking the question?   
Already who are baked may not be asked no. of times. In my case questions are  
coming up. I unserstand the stick is not burned up.

Dear ramanaduli,   
Do not worry. We are all in the same boat. Bhagavan   
Ramana is an exceptional case. He asked the question,   
once, on the upstairs of his uncle's house in Chokkappa   
Naicker Street, and got the answer. He has said in one   
conversation, that the entire death experience, might have taken about 20  
minutes. He has infact, addeed that there   
was no element of time at all. He got the answer i.e merged   
in the Self never to come out of it. But it does not happen   
to everyone because of prarabdha. We may ask the question   
a number of times. That is why, as a matter of concession,   
He said: You keep one thought and stick to it, instead of   
several swarming thoughts, that makes a person and his   
mind weak. Arunachala Siva is one such great thought which   
has helped me in life. This is the Mahamantra for me. Namasivaya and other  
mantras need an initiation from a guru.   
This mantra, Ramana Guru has told me and everyone, in His   
Akshara Mana Malai. It is a mantra said by Him standing on   
the summit of the Hill. It is for everyone who can hear.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs,   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana said: ... the ego [our mind or primal thought I] has one and only one [relevant]  
characteristic. The ego functions as the knot between the Self[,] which is  
Pure Consciousness[,] and the physical body[,] which is. .. insentient. The  
ego is therefore called the chit-jada granthi [the knot between consciousness  
and the non-conscious]. In your investigation into the source of aham-vritti  
[the thought I], YOU TAKE THE ESSENTIAL CHIT [CONSCIOUSNESS] ASPECT OF THE  
EGO; and for this reason the enquiry must lead to the realization of the pure  
consciousness of the Self.   
So, it is not just a thought but something else what is the subject of  
enquiry, that´s why I call it a "feeling". One may start with the thought but,  
sooner or later, it becomes a feeling, something completly subjective that one  
doesn´t think that one is, but that one IS already.
