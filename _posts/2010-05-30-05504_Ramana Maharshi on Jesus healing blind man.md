Bhagavan was speaking once with a visiting pandit about the great merits of  
the Bhagavad Gita, when a devotee complained that it was difficult to keep all  
the seven hundred verses in mind and asked if there was not one verse that  
could be remembered as the quintessence of the Gita. **Bhagavan thereupon  
mentioned Chapter X, verse 20: I am the Self, Oh Gudakesa, dwelling in the  
Heart of every being; I am the beginning and the middle and also the end of  
all beings.** Later he selected forty-two verses that here follow (of which  
that quoted above comes fourth) and arranged them in an appropriate order to  
serve as guidance. He also prepared Tamil and Malayalam versions of these  
verses.   
Said Sanjaya: 1\. Despondent, overwhelmed with compassion (as he sat), his troubled eyes  
filled with tears, Krishna, the slayer of Madhu spoke to him. ii: 1   
Sri Bhagavan said: 2\. This body, O Son of Kunti,1 is known as the field; and he who is aware of  
it is called the Knower of the Field by the wise. xiii:1   
3\. And know that I am the Knower of the Field in all the fields, O Bharata.  
The knowledge of the field and the knower of that, in my opinion, is true  
knowledge. xiii:2   
4\. I am the Self, O Gudakesa, dwelling in the Hearts of all beings. I am the  
beginning and the middle and the end of all beings. x:20   
5\. For to him who is born death is indeed certain, and to him who dies birth  
is certain. Therefore you should not grieve for the inevitable. ii:27   
6\. That is not born, nor does It ever die; nor, having been,does It ever  
cease to be. That unborn, eternal, abiding, primeval Being is not slain when  
the body is slain. ii:20   
7\. Invulnerable He is, not to be burnt, not to be drenched or dried. He is  
eternal, all pervading, changeless, motionless, enduring. ii:24   
8\. Know that which pervades all this to be indestructible. That immutable  
none can destroy. ii:27   
9\. The unreal has no being, the Real no non-being. These two facts the Truth-  
seers perceive. ii:16   
10\. Just as the all pervading ether, being subtle, is not affected, (tainted  
or contaminated by anything), even so, the Self pervading the whole body is  
not tainted. xiii:33   
11\. Neither sun, nor moon, nor fire illumine this state on attaining which  
one does not return. And this is My supreme abode. xv:6   
12\. This Supreme State is called the Unmanifest Imperishable (avyakto  
akshara). That is My highest abode.   
For those who attain to It, there is no return. viii:21   
13\. The undeluded, those who are free from pride and ignorance, who have  
overcome the evil of attachment, who are ever devoted to the Self, who have  
turned away from desires and are entirely beyond the dualities of pleasure and  
pain, attain that imperishable state. xv:5   
14\. He who abandons the injunctions of the scriptures and behaves according  
to the impulses of his desires, attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor  
the highest state of salvation. xvi:23   
15\. He who sees the Supreme Lord, residing equally in all beings  the  
Imperishable One among the perishables  sees (truly). xiii:27   
16\. Only by unswerving devotion can I be known and truly seen in this form,  
Arjuna, and even be entered into, O tormentor of the foe. xi:54   
17\. The faith of everyone is according to his nature, O Bharata. Man is  
essentially endowed with faith. What his faith is, that indeed is he. xvii:3   
18\. One who has faith and concentration and has subdued his senses attains  
knowledge. Having gained knowledge he speedily attains Supreme Peace. iv:39   
19\. To them ever steadfast in loving worship, I give the yoga of  
understanding by which they attain to Me. x:10   
20\. Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their Heart,destroy the  
darkness born of ignorance with the effulgent light of knowledge. x:11   
21\. But in those whose unwisdom is destroyed by wisdom, that wisdom like the  
Sun, reveals the Supreme   
(Param). v:16   
22\. Mighty, they say, are the senses, mightier than these, the mind, mightier  
than that the intellect, but mightier still is He. iii:42   
23\. Thus knowing Him who is beyond the intellect,O mighty in arms, control  
your self by the Self and slay the enemy in the form of desire, hard though it  
may be. iii:43   
24\. As a well lit fire consumes its fuel, Arjuna, so does the fire of  
knowledge reduce all activity to ashes. iv:37   
25\. One whose undertakings are all free from desire and whose activity has  
been purified in the flame of wisdom is termed a sage by those who know. iv: 19   
26\. Brahma Nirvana lies around those who have freed themselves from anger and  
desire, who have subdued their minds and have known the Self. v:26   
27\. One should gradually, gradually attain quietude with the intellect  
(buddhi) held steadfast and the mind sunk in the Self, allowing no thought to  
arise. vi:25   
28\. To whatever side the restless, unsteady mind wanders away, one should  
check it and bring it back controlled to the Self. vi:26   
29\. With the senses, mind and intellect subdued, the saint who devoutly seeks  
liberation, without desire, fear or wrath  he is indeed ever liberated. v:28   
30\. One who is thus integrated in yoga (yoga yuktatma) sees all with an equal  
eye, seeing himself in all beings and all beings in himself. vi:29   
31\. To those, however, who dwell on Me in single minded worship I guarantee  
fulfilment of their needs and security. ix:22   
32\. The foremost of these is the wise one (jnani) who is ever steadfast and  
devoted to the One. Very dear am I to the wise man and he to Me. vii: 17   
33\. At the end of many births the man of wisdom comes to Me, realising that  
Vasudeva is all. Such a great soul is very rare to find. vii: 19   
34\. When a man casts out all desires of the mind, O son of Pritha, and is  
content in himself he is said to be steadfast in wisdom. ii:35   
35\. He attains peace who abandons all desires, acting without attachment,  
free from I and mine. ii:71   
36\. He by whom the world is not afflicted and who is not afflicted by the  
world, who is free from pleasure, anger, fear and anxiety  he is dear to Me.  
xii: 15   
37\. The same in honour and dishonour, towards friends and foes; he who  
abandons the initiative in all undertakings, is called one beyond qualities.  
xiv:25   
38\. For him, however, who rejoices only in the Self, is gratified with the  
Self and content with the Self, no action is incumbent. iii: 17   
39\. He has nothing to gain by actions done or to lose by those undone. He is  
not dependent on anyone for the achievement of any object. iii:18   
40\. Satisfied with what comes to him by chance, beyond the pairs of  
opposites, free from envy, equal in success and failure, he is not bound by  
his actions. iv:22   
41\. The Lord resides in the Hearts of all, O Arjuna,revolving all creatures  
by prakriti as if mounted on a machine. xviii:61   
42\. Surrender unto Him with all your heart, O Bharata.Through His grace you  
will attain Supreme peace and the perennial abode. xviii:62

## Ramana Maharshi on Jesus healing blind man

In the book Talks with Ramana Maharshi, Volume I, page 17, a person asks Sri  
Bhagavan   
"Jesus Christ cured people of their diseases. Is that only an occult   
power (siddhi)?" And Sri Bhagavan answers: " Was Jesus aware at the time that he was curing men of their diseases?   
He could not have been conscious of his powers. There is a story   
related as follows: Jesus had once cured a man of his blindness. The   
man turned wicked, in course of time. **Meeting him after some years,   
Jesus observed his wickedness and asked him why he was so. He   
replied saying that, when he was blind, he could not commit any   
sin. But after Jesus had cured him of blindness he grew wicked and   
Jesus was responsible for his wickedness."**   
I have tried to found this from the Bible but haven't found it. Is it really  
there?

Dear Japo,   
I am not sure. I have to check up my Bible copy. What Bhagavan   
Ramana meant was that such miracles had happened by the   
mere presence of Jesus. Only thing that was required was faith   
in him. Like Bhagavan Ramana, Jesus had no sankalpa, no wishes   
for anything. But his Presence was quite powerful. All miracles in   
Bhagavan Ramana's time and even today, are happening due to our   
faith only. This faith makes us, figuratively speaking, to carry a   
big vessel to take His everflowing grace.   
Christ himself has said on a few occasions, when some persons   
lacked faith in him. He had called them: O, Ye of little faith.   
In the presence of some lame persons, one man stood up when   
he asked them to stand. He was cured. The other few who had   
no faith in Jesus' powers did not stand up and accordingly were not   
cured.   
Arunachala Siva.

Okay thank you. I should had payed more attention to Sri Bhagavan's words  
which were: "there is a story related as follows", and **not** "in the bible  
there is a story".

Dear Japo,   
Perhaps you have read it right. I wanted to search my Bible copy   
but I could not succeed yesterday.   
Faith is the word. Jesus and Bhagavan Ramana cured people who   
had faith, subject to their prarabdha. There is no mention in   
the Bible about the prarabdha but Christ used the word God's   
Will or My father's Will.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is not a story related in the Bible, that is the canonized texts,  
neither, I am pretty sure, is it in the gnostic texts. It sounds to me like  
it could be one of the Jesus legends in Islam - Ramana could have heard it  
from one of the muslim devotees. One thing I'm sure of he didn't just make it  
up, although where he knew of it might not be easy, or even possible.   
What Amitall mentioned is right on the mark, in particular the story [Luke  
8:40-48] of a women who suffered from bleeding and had used much money with  
doctors to no avail - sure touches the hem of his cloak as he passes by  
thinking it will help her, she is healed on the spot and Jesus demands to know  
"who touched me" (the text explains that he felt power go from him).   
One Christian legend I love is the one that where he walked, flowers grew - it  
found its way into a song: "Angels serve the son of man / blessings flow from his hands / don't you know  
the truth so sweet / flowers grow where he rests his feet"   
Love - Being - Aware

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
You are back after quite some time. I am happy you have clarified   
the position, with your deep study of the Bible and other related   
texts.   
Arunachala Siva.
