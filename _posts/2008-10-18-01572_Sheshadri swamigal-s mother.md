Dear sir   
I heard that Sheshadri swamigal's mother when she was leaving her body, called  
swamigal tapped on his chest saying   
3 times Thruvannamalai thruvannamalai thruvannamalai. Then she died. This is  
the moola mantram which churned Him later on   
he became an Avadootha. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Seshadri Swamigal's mother passed away, when the Swamigal was   
in Kanchipuram, and as you said, she touched Swamigal's chest   
three times, saying Arunachala Siva, three times. This can be   
taken as a mantra given by Swamigal's mother to him. She was   
a greate devotee of Siva and Parvati.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear donkey,   
Seshadri Swamigal was a short personality, with unshaven beard   
and hair. He also used to continue with his tattered clothes unless,   
someone gave him new clothes. He never took bath. Sometimes   
he took several baths on the same day. He had a lot of siddhic powers. He  
was a worshipper of Kamakshi, the goddess of Kanchipuram. He saw every woman  
as Mother. Hence, if at all, he frequented a dancing girl's house, it could  
have been to oblige her   
invitation for lunch. He took lunch with almost all householders in   
Tiruvannamalai. He used to nibble the food served, throw some   
to the gods in eight directions and leave the place, without even   
washing his hands!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
i stayed at the Sheshadiri Ashram during my visit to Thirvannamalai. There is  
a sculpture of a snake in one corner of the ashram which happened to be just  
next to the room in which i stayed. i wonder what it signifies.   
best wishes

Dear vinita,   
Seshadri Swami's interrment in a Samadhi was during Bhagavan   
Ramana's time. At that time, only a Samadhi was built with a   
Siva lingam was installed. Later, many additions were made.   
One lady became His ardent devtoee and spread His message. Her   
photograph is also there near Samadhi. Subsequently, an idol   
of Sri Dakshinamoorthy was installed, and it is facing the Hills.   
A peepul tree was there, under which a Ganapati temple was   
constructed. Usually stone images of serpents are installed under   
peepul tree. There are now a number of such serpent idols near that   
spot. In the early 20th century, it was believed that childlessness   
of a couple was due to Naga dosha, the curse of the serpents. Such   
people used to instal serpent images under peepul trees and pray to those  
images. This could be the reason. Sehadri Swami performed a lot of miracles.  
He has cured snake bites.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for your reply. Since Nov. 2008 our com. was not working. we were in  
two mind whether to repair or not. But I was missing very badly.   
My husband was asking me whether I need or not. I could not decide it.  
Bhagavan"s visara marga was puting me in such a place, so ultimately I kept  
quite and left it in His hands. Reading discussing again and again do nt solve  
our THIRSHNA. But Bhagavan"s play came in the form of my younger daughter, She  
came down here and called the mechanic and got it repaired. So once again I am  
here. She says, how u can livewithout comp. I do not have answer for this  
question. On the other hand one of my friends gave me one bulk of books as she  
knows I read Bhagavan's books. It is called RAMANODHYAM in tamil. In some way  
He is showing His light. As soon as I got the connection I sent my post. It is  
His will   
once again I am here.

Dear sirs   
There is another interesting story about Sheshadri swamigal. One day while  
His mother was carrying Him one vendor was selling some   
toys. Seeing the small baby the vendor thought His mother may buy toys for her  
baby. So the vendor asked whether she wanted to buy.   
That time swamiji touched the toys with His hand. As it is not an ordinary  
hand, the vendor sold all the toys on the sameday before evening. He was so  
surprised and came to swamiji's mother and told/"Amma your son's hand was not  
an ordinary hands. It was golden hands ( THANGA KAI) So by birth He was a holi  
man. The same hands did lots of miracles in thruvannamalai

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Your story is correct. Seshadri Swamigal was living   
in Kanchipuram, before coming to Tiruvannamlai. I think,   
the house where he lived had been recently acquired by   
Seshadri Swamigal Ashram in Tiruvannamalai. He had   
golden hands. The toys which he touched, were blessed.   
The shopkeeper could sell all of them in no time. He came   
to Tiruvannamalai and whenever he touched the offerings   
of the devotees, by touching and eating a little bit, such   
devotees were blessed in life with many fortunes and good   
luck. Bhagavan Ramana is also called Thanga Kai, Golden   
Hand, because in Tiruchuzhi and Madurai, whatever He   
touched met with success. In foot ball team, His team   
mates would touch His hand and say: Venkatraman is to our   
team today. On all such occasions, His football team won   
the match.   
All Brahma Jnanis have golden hands. That is why, when   
they touched a devotee, it is called Hastha Deeksha. Even   
if one could touch their legs, it is Sparsa Deekasha. But   
Bhagavan Ramana discouraged this. Perhaps a few people   
like Annamalai Swami, Kavyakanta Ganaptati Muni, Murugnar had such blessings.   
Arunachala Siva.
