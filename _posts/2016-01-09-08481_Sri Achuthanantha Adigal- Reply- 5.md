It was the full moon day on which Dasar came to see the Sadguru. The  
disciples who had gathered there   
for prayer, on seeing the Sri Vaishnava markings on Dasar's forehead, were  
annoyed. Sensing that the   
Sadguru wanted him to leave, he walked down from the Kailasagiri hill and  
waited. Within a short while,   
the Sadguru came to him and took him to a hidden Vinayaka Temple at the foot  
of the hill. Then he asked,   
'My child, who are you? Where are you from? What brought you here?' Dasar  
replied, 'Dear father,   
I am near Polur. My name is Achuthan. Desirous of Self Knowledge, I have  
approached fifteen teachers,   
but no one accepted me. I was perplexed and did not know what to do. So when  
I came to know of   
you, I came immediately and when I saw how happy you are, I was relieved of  
all my worries.'   
He stood with his palms joined and prayed, 'Please disclose my true Self to me  
and ferry me across the   
ocean of rebirth.'   
His words melted the heart of the gracious Sadguru, who spoke lovingly to  
Dasar. He then made him   
sit before him, gave the requisite deeksha (initiation) by means of one of the  
four great statements of   
Vedanta (Mahavakyas). He also explained the real nature of the Self as being  
beyond all qualities and as   
therefore not one of the five types of sheaths (Panchakoshas), but that which  
witnesses the three states   
of awareness, namely waking, dream and deep sleep, and as of the nature of  
Existence, Consciousness   
and Bliss. On receiving this initiation from the Sadguru, it is said that  
Dasar, being blessed with a pure   
heart and with intense longing for the Self, instantly attained the state of  
Nirvikalpa Nishta (total absorption   
without any mental focus) and was anchored fast on the path towards Self  
Knowledge.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
