## Regarding permission for translation  
Author: Akira               Date: March 25, 2010, 06:58:12 AM

Ragarding permission for translation from Bhagavan and Ramanashram   
1\. Is it necessary to get permission from Ramanashram   
to upload your own translation of Ramanashram books,   
\- only books which is free to download \-   
on your own websites or blogs?   
I have been thinking of translating some of them into Japanese and Chinese.   
But I am not familiar with copyright rules.   
2\. One more thing I am concerned is   
Bhagavan sometimes did not allow devotees to publish English translations.   
Is it bad to translate materials without Bhagavan's permission?   
Strictly speaking, I think it is bad. Then what to do?

Dear Akira,   
Yes, there is a copyright rule for all books of Sri Ramanasramam and it  
requires prior   
permission to translate them and publish them in Japanese etc., The works  
cannot   
be given in full form in this Forum too. One can go only for a few excerpts  
here   
and there to make a point.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear riktam,   
Yes. There are many like Langford, who have written incorrect   
things about Bhagavan Ramana and Self Enquiry. They not only   
understand Bhagavan Ramana incorrectly, but also write out their   
own " rotten theories " about Him. One should be careful in   
reading such books. One another gentleman (see David Godman's   
blog, old posts, in www.davidgodman.org) said that since Bhagavan   
Ramana had no formal learning of scriptures, He must not have   
self realized! What to say?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Many like Langford, Echart Tolle have written about self   
enquiry and enlightenment, in their own words, and this   
is their understanding. Bhagavan Ramana is like an Elephant.   
Many blind people are describing the elephant, and saying   
that it is like a pillar, it is like a large fan, it is like a rock,   
etc., A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly and   
their understanding is in tune with the old stalwars who   
had spent decades [eg. Muruganar, WHO, Yogi Ramaiah,   
Munagala Venkatramaiah] with Bhagavan Ramana and have   
writeen or spoke about Him. Only people who have landed   
on the moon can describe the nature of the moon and not   
who see it through NASA telescopes.

Dear riktam,   
I agree with you.   
I am sad to see that some people distort Bhagavan's teaching like this.   
Langford confuses 'awareness' with 'mind'.   
His method 'awareness watching awareness' is, in fact, nothing but 'mind  
watching void', which leads you nowhere.   
Riktam, I understand you are not here in this forum anymore, seeing you have  
only one post, but I want to say I am happy to see your post.

Quote from: amiatall on June 04, 2009, 07:19:09 PM  
To my mind what he means by awareness watching awareness is abiding in self.  
It is not like watching an object but it is different word for just being.  
That's exactly what I think, @amiatall. ''Awareness watching awareness'' is a  
very powerful method. Unfortunately, most of the people don't try it.  
Nisargadatta Maharaj talks about it in ''I Am That'':  _Q: You use the words 'aware' and 'conscious'. Are they not the same?   
M: Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless, endless,  
uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. Consciousness is on  
contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of duality. There can be no  
consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without  
consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is absolute, consciousness is  
relative to its content; consciousness is always of something. Consciousness  
is partial and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And  
it is the common matrix of every experience.   
Q: How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?   
M: Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is awareness  
in every state of consciousness. Therefore **the very consciousness of being  
conscious is already a movement in awareness**. Interest in your stream of  
consciousness takes you to awareness. It is not a new state. It is at once  
recognised as the original, basic existence, which is life itself, and also  
love and joy.   
M: The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the background of  
awareness, which does not change. The mind must come to know the true self and  
respect it and cease covering it up, like the moon which obscures the sun  
during solar eclipse. Just realise that nothing observable, or experienceable  
is you, or binds you. Take no notice of what is not yourself.   
Q: To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.   
M: To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware anyhow, you  
need not try to be. **What you need is to be aware of being aware**. Be aware  
deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being  
conscious._

Quote from: amiatall on November 11, 2009, 11:22:03 AM  
He quotes a lot from Guru Vachaka Kovai where Murugnar writes exactly about  
Self-awareness and how it is important.   
I''ll give some examples for the people who don't know Sri Muruganar's book: ''432\. Is it not because you are knowledge [i.e. consciousness] itelf that  
you are able to know the world? If[instead of knowing the world] **you turn  
your attention, taking that Consciousness alone as your target,**   
It will Itself as the Guru reveal the Truth [i.e. Reality]. (page 119)   
638\. If, instead of seeing anything in front [of you] by the mind, **you see  
by the mind the one who sees**, all will be found to be oneself, the seer;  
then all objective knowledges will be found to be foolish. (page 181)   
647\. Do not look at this, do not look at that. If you simply remain without  
looking at anything, **then by that powerful look at [ones own] being [that  
is, by that powerful attention to Self, I am]**, you will become the   
supreme reality which has the outlook of the unlimited space of consciousness  
[chit-akasa]. (page 185)''   
The quotes are from GURU VACHAKA KOVAI, translated from the original Tamil by  
Sadhu Om and Michael James.

I am interested in the "albigen.com" site that has been mentioned.   
It seems like the author is very intent on providing clarity to the seeker,  
and this is why he is providing a number of different descriptions of a  
practice. From his history he feels that lack of clarity of the instructions  
caused much delay.   
It is good to have clarity, for something that is hard to explain.   
Some queries have been raised about whether the techniques at "albigen.com"  
are the same as Maharshi's or will lead in the same direction. It doesn't  
seem that way to me as it seems like when you are practicing you are guided to  
the direction.   
In any case there is far too much difficulty in finding the instructions to  
Life and I am happy that someone has them so clearly stated. I mean if the  
Bible really boils down to "I AM" then it would have taken me quite a few  
lifetimes to work it out.   
It would be good if all humans were directed to a page of simple instructions  
called "The Instructions to Life". No more long books !

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.

Quote  
This was WRITTEN  
 \-- and the first answer was WRITTEN in the SAND: The nature of knowledge is  
sat-chit-ananda [being-consciousness-bliss].   
Pillai copied it to his note book and added some explanatory comment. Ramana  
later approved Pillai's additions if the original answer was printed in bold.   
What's important for me is that the answer was **_written the sand_** \-- that  
just blows my mind out of the water!

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. It was writtten by Bhagavan Ramana to Sivaprakasam Pillai.   
In respect of ancient scriptures in Hindu theology, there were only   
spoken words. Vedas and Upanishads and Gita were also spoken   
These gave rise to various rescensions in later centuries. But   
Who am I? was different. Take for example, the Bhagavad Gita.   
It was taught among the battle noise. Arjuna would himself found   
it difficult to listen to it carefully. Then came the various rescensions   
and there could be many errors of commission and omission. Who   
am I? that way is blemishless.   
The Bible was written,for example in Hebrew. Then came the King   
James Version and then the New English Version. In translations,   
many times the original meaning and purport is lost. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, if people are afraid of trying ''the awareness watching awareness''  
method -I don't blame them: the world is full of false masters-, Ramana's  
Self-enquiry method is good enough because it leads to Self-awareness, through  
the agency of Self-attention. Sri Sadhu Om explains excellently Ramana's Self-  
enquiry in his book, ''The Path of Sri Ramana'': http://www.notthisnotthat.com/resources/The_Path_of_Sri_Ramana_Part_One.pdf   
I will give some quotes from his book (pages 137-138): ''Just as the correct meaning of the term meditation upon Brahman  
(brahmadhyanam) used by the sastras up till now is explained by Sri Bhagavan  
in the last two lines of the first benedictory verse of Ulladhu Narpadhu to  
be abiding in the Heart as it is (that is to say, abiding as Self is the  
correct way of meditating upon it), so also, the correct meaning of the term  
Self-enquiry (atma-vichara) is here rightly explained to be turning  
Selfwards (or attending to Self).''   
''In either of these two kinds of enquiry (Who am I? or Whence am I ?),  
since the attention of the aspirant is focused only on himself, nothing other  
than Self (atman), which is the true import of the word I, will be finally  
experienced.''   
''Therefore, whether done in the form Whence am I? or Who am I ?, what is  
absolutely essential is that Self-attention should be pursued till the very  
end.''   
P.S. Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal tirelessly practised Self-Enquiry in a remote house  
'Sri Arunachala Ramana Nilayam' in the interior of Thiruvannamalai for 30-odd  
years, and scrupulously wrote down the difficulties faced by him in Self-  
Enquiry and also the methods by which he overcame them.

understand Bhagavan Ramana incorrectly, but also write out their   
own " rotten theories " about Him. One should be careful in   
reading such books. One another gentleman (see David Godman's   
blog, old posts, in www.davidgodman.org) said that since Bhagavan   
Ramana had no formal learning of scriptures, He must not have   
self realized! What to say?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Many like Langford, Echart Tolle have written about self   
enquiry and enlightenment, in their own words, and this   
is their understanding. Bhagavan Ramana is like an Elephant.   
Many blind people are describing the elephant, and saying   
that it is like a pillar, it is like a large fan, it is like a rock,   
etc., A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly and   
their understanding is in tune with the old stalwars who   
had spent decades [eg. Muruganar, WHO, Yogi Ramaiah,   
Munagala Venkatramaiah] with Bhagavan Ramana and have   
writeen or spoke about Him. Only people who have landed   
on the moon can describe the nature of the moon and not   
who see it through NASA telescopes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear riktam,   
I agree with you.   
I am sad to see that some people distort Bhagavan's teaching like this.   
Langford confuses 'awareness' with 'mind'.   
His method 'awareness watching awareness' is, in fact, nothing but 'mind  
watching void', which leads you nowhere.   
Riktam, I understand you are not here in this forum anymore, seeing you have  
only one post, but I want to say I am happy to see your post.

To my mind what he means by awareness watching awareness is abiding in self.  
It is not like watching an object but it is different word for just being.  
That's exactly what I think, @amiatall. ''Awareness watching awareness'' is a  
very powerful method. Unfortunately, most of the people don't try it.  
Nisargadatta Maharaj talks about it in ''I Am That'':  _Q: You use the words 'aware' and 'conscious'. Are they not the same?   
M: Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless, endless,  
uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. Consciousness is on  
contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of duality. There can be no  
consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without  
consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is absolute, consciousness is  
relative to its content; consciousness is always of something. Consciousness  
is partial and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And  
it is the common matrix of every experience.   
Q: How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?   
M: Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is awareness  
in every state of consciousness. Therefore **the very consciousness of being  
conscious is already a movement in awareness**. Interest in your stream of  
consciousness takes you to awareness. It is not a new state. It is at once  
recognised as the original, basic existence, which is life itself, and also  
love and joy.   
M: The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the background of  
awareness, which does not change. The mind must come to know the true self and  
respect it and cease covering it up, like the moon which obscures the sun  
during solar eclipse. Just realise that nothing observable, or experienceable  
is you, or binds you. Take no notice of what is not yourself.   
Q: To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.   
M: To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware anyhow, you  
need not try to be. **What you need is to be aware of being aware**. Be aware  
deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being  
conscious._

He quotes a lot from Guru Vachaka Kovai where Murugnar writes exactly about  
Self-awareness and how it is important.   
I''ll give some examples for the people who don't know Sri Muruganar's book: ''432\. Is it not because you are knowledge [i.e. consciousness] itelf that  
you are able to know the world? If[instead of knowing the world] **you turn  
your attention, taking that Consciousness alone as your target,**   
It will Itself as the Guru reveal the Truth [i.e. Reality]. (page 119)   
638\. If, instead of seeing anything in front [of you] by the mind, **you see  
by the mind the one who sees**, all will be found to be oneself, the seer;  
then all objective knowledges will be found to be foolish. (page 181)   
647\. Do not look at this, do not look at that. If you simply remain without  
looking at anything, **then by that powerful look at [ones own] being [that  
is, by that powerful attention to Self, I am]**, you will become the   
supreme reality which has the outlook of the unlimited space of consciousness  
[chit-akasa]. (page 185)''   
The quotes are from GURU VACHAKA KOVAI, translated from the original Tamil by  
Sadhu Om and Michael James.

I am interested in the "albigen.com" site that has been mentioned.   
It seems like the author is very intent on providing clarity to the seeker,  
and this is why he is providing a number of different descriptions of a  
practice. From his history he feels that lack of clarity of the instructions  
caused much delay.   
It is good to have clarity, for something that is hard to explain.   
Some queries have been raised about whether the techniques at "albigen.com"  
are the same as Maharshi's or will lead in the same direction. It doesn't  
seem that way to me as it seems like when you are practicing you are guided to  
the direction.   
In any case there is far too much difficulty in finding the instructions to  
Life and I am happy that someone has them so clearly stated. I mean if the  
Bible really boils down to "I AM" then it would have taken me quite a few  
lifetimes to work it out.   
It would be good if all humans were directed to a page of simple instructions  
called "The Instructions to Life". No more long books !

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.   
Arunachala Siva.

This was WRITTEN  
 \-- and the first answer was WRITTEN in the SAND: The nature of knowledge is  
sat-chit-ananda [being-consciousness-bliss].   
Pillai copied it to his note book and added some explanatory comment. Ramana  
later approved Pillai's additions if the original answer was printed in bold.   
What's important for me is that the answer was **_written the sand_** \-- that  
just blows my mind out of the water!

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. It was writtten by Bhagavan Ramana to Sivaprakasam Pillai.   
In respect of ancient scriptures in Hindu theology, there were only   
spoken words. Vedas and Upanishads and Gita were also spoken   
These gave rise to various rescensions in later centuries. But   
Who am I? was different. Take for example, the Bhagavad Gita.   
It was taught among the battle noise. Arjuna would himself found   
it difficult to listen to it carefully. Then came the various rescensions   
and there could be many errors of commission and omission. Who   
am I? that way is blemishless.   
The Bible was written,for example in Hebrew. Then came the King   
James Version and then the New English Version. In translations,   
many times the original meaning and purport is lost. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, if people are afraid of trying ''the awareness watching awareness''  
method -I don't blame them: the world is full of false masters-, Ramana's  
Self-enquiry method is good enough because it leads to Self-awareness, through  
the agency of Self-attention. Sri Sadhu Om explains excellently Ramana's Self-  
enquiry in his book, ''The Path of Sri Ramana'': http://www.notthisnotthat.com/resources/The_Path_of_Sri_Ramana_Part_One.pdf   
I will give some quotes from his book (pages 137-138): ''Just as the correct meaning of the term meditation upon Brahman  
(brahmadhyanam) used by the sastras up till now is explained by Sri Bhagavan  
in the last two lines of the first benedictory verse of Ulladhu Narpadhu to  
be abiding in the Heart as it is (that is to say, abiding as Self is the  
correct way of meditating upon it), so also, the correct meaning of the term  
Self-enquiry (atma-vichara) is here rightly explained to be turning  
Selfwards (or attending to Self).''   
''In either of these two kinds of enquiry (Who am I? or Whence am I ?),  
since the attention of the aspirant is focused only on himself, nothing other  
than Self (atman), which is the true import of the word I, will be finally  
experienced.''   
''Therefore, whether done in the form Whence am I? or Who am I ?, what is  
absolutely essential is that Self-attention should be pursued till the very  
end.''   
P.S. Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal tirelessly practised Self-Enquiry in a remote house  
'Sri Arunachala Ramana Nilayam' in the interior of Thiruvannamalai for 30-odd  
years, and scrupulously wrote down the difficulties faced by him in Self-  
Enquiry and also the methods by which he overcame them.
