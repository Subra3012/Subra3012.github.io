Friends,   
Here we come to the point in this excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna,  
where Vijay Goswami asks the classic question, just like Arjuna does in The  
Bhagavad Gita: Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3,Verse 1:  **jyaayasi cet karmanas te mataa buddhir janaardana   
tat kim karmani ghore maam niyOjayasi kEsava** 1   
 _If it is held by you,O Janardana,that knowledge is superior to action,why  
then do you,O Kesava enjoin on me this terrible action?_ 1   
 **vyaamisrEnEva vaakyEna buddhim mOhasyasi va mE   
tad ekam vada nischitya yena srEyOham aapnuyaam** 2   
With these perplexing words,you are, as it were,confusing my  
comprehension.Tell me with certainty the path by pursuing which I may get at  
the Supreme. 2   
Lord Krishna answers:  **LokE smin dvividhaa nishtaa puraa prOktaa mayaa naGa   
jnAna yogEna samkhyaanaam karma yOgEna yoginaam** 3   
 _The two fold path was given by me,O sinless one,to the world in the  
Beginning-the path of Knowledge to the discerning,the path of work to the  
active_. 3   
\   
VIJAY: "If without destroying the 'I' a man cannot get rid of attachment to  
the world and consequently cannot experience samadhi, then it would be wise  
for him to follow the path of Brahmajnana to attain samadhi. If the 'I'  
persists in the path of devotion, then one should rather choose the path of  
knowledge."**   
 **The "servant I"**   
MASTER: " **It is true that one or two can get rid of the 'I' through samadhi;  
but these cases are very rare.** You may indulge in thousands of reasonings,  
but still the 'I' comes back. You may cut the peepal-tree to the very root  
today, but you will notice a sprout springing up tomorrow. Therefore if the  
'I' must remain, let the rascal remain as the 'servant I'. As long as you  
live, you should say, 'O God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.' The  
'I' that feels, 'I am the servant of God, I am His devotee' does not injure  
one. Sweet things cause acidity of the stomach, no doubt, but sugar candy is  
an exception.   
"The path of knowledge is very difficult. One cannot obtain Knowledge unless  
one gets rid of the feeling that one is the body. In the Kaliyuga the life of  
man is centred on food. He cannot get rid of the feeling that he is the body  
and the ego. Therefore the path of devotion is prescribed for this cycle. This  
is an easy path. **You will attain God if you sing His name and glories and  
pray to Him with a longing heart. There is not the least doubt about it**.   
"Suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick. The  
water appears to be divided into two parts; but the line doesn't remain for  
any length of time. _The 'servant I'or the 'devotee I' or the 'child I' is  
only a line drawn with the ego and is not real"_.   
continued....

Excerpt from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna - **The Master and Vijay Goswami**  
continued....   
 **The "ego of a devotee"**   
VIJAY (to the Master): **" Sir, you ask us to renounce the 'wicked I'. Is  
there any harm in the 'servant I'?"**   
MASTER: _" The 'servant I'-that is, the feeling, 'I am the servant of God, I  
am the devotee of God'-does not injure one. On the contrary, it helps one to  
realize God."_   
VIJAY: "Well, sir, what becomes of the lust, anger, and other passions of  
one who keeps the 'servant I'?"**   
MASTER: _" If a man truly feels like that, then he has only the semblance of  
lust, anger, and the like. If, after attaining God, he looks on himself as the  
servant or the devotee of God, then he cannot injure anyone. By touching the  
philosopher's stone a sword is turned into gold. It keeps the appearance of a  
sword but cannot injure_.   
"When the dry branch of a coconut palm drops to the ground, it leaves only a  
mark on the trunk indicating that once there was a branch at that place. In  
like manner, he who has attained God keeps only an appearance of ego; there  
remains in him only a semblance of anger and lust. He becomes like a child. A  
child has no attachment to the three gunas sattva, rajas, and tamas. He  
becomes as quickly detached from a thing as he becomes attached to it. You can  
cajole him out of a cloth worth five rupees with a doll worth an anna, though  
at first he may say with great determination: 'No, I won't give it to you. My  
daddy bought it for me.' Again, all persons are the same to a child. He has no  
feeling of high and low in regard to persons. So he doesn't discriminate about  
caste. If his mother tells him that a particular man should be regarded as an  
elder brother, the child will eat from the same plate with him, though the man  
may belong to the low caste of a blacksmith. The child doesn't know hate, or  
what is holy or unholy.   
"Even after attaining samadhi, some retain the 'servant ego' or the 'devotee  
ego'. The bhakta keeps this 'I-consciousness'. He says, 'O God, Thou art the  
Master and I am Thy servant; Thou art the Lord and I am Thy devotee.' He feels  
that way even after the realization of God. His 'I' is not completely effaced.  
**Again, by constantly practising this kind of 'Iconsciousness', one  
ultimately attains God. This is called bhaktiyoga**.   
" **One can attain the Knowledge of Brahman, too, by following the path of  
bhakti. God is all-powerful. He may give His devotee Brahmajnana also, if He  
so wills**. But the devotee generally doesn't seek the Knowledge of the  
Absolute. He would rather have the consciousness that God is the Master and he  
the servant, or that God is the Divine Mother and he the child."   
We next find Vijay asking the master another question like Arjuna-to ascertain  
that all paths lead to the same goal.   
continued...

Excerpt from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna - **The Master and Vijay Goswami**  
continued....   
VIJAY: **" But those who discriminate according to the Vedanta philosophy also  
realize Him in the end, don't they?"**   
 **Path of bhakti is easy**   
MASTER: " _Yes, one may reach Him by following the path of discrimination too: that is called Jnanayoga. But it is an extremely difficult path. I have told  
you already of the seven planes of consciousness. On reaching the seventh  
plane the mind goes into samadhi. If a man acquires the firm knowledge that  
Brahman alone is real and the world illusory, then his mind merges in  
samadhi._ But in the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends entirely on food. How  
can he have the consciousness that Brahman alone is real and the world  
illusory? In the Kaliyuga it is difficult to have the feeling, 'I am not the  
body, I am not the mind, I am not the twenty-four cosmic principles; I am  
beyond pleasure and pain, I am above disease and grief, old age and death.'  
_However you may reason and argue, the feeling that the body is identical with  
the soul will somehow crop up from an unexpected quarter_. _You may cut a  
peepal-tree to the ground and think it is dead to its very root, but the next  
morning you will find a new sprout shooting up from the dead stump. One cannot  
get rid of this identification with the body; therefore the path of bhakti is  
best for the people of the Kaliyuga_. It is an easy path.   
......................   
........................   
(Again now Vijay asks a counter question)   
VIJAY: **" Is bhakti alone sufficient for the attainment of God, for His  
vision?"**   
MASTER: _" Yes, one can see God through bhakti alone. **But it must be 'ripe'  
bhakti, premabhakti and raga-bhakti.** When one has that bhakti, one loves God  
even as the mother loves the child, the child the mother, or the wife the  
husband._   
"When one has such love and attachment for God, one doesn't feel the  
attraction of maya to wife, children, relatives, and friends. One retains only  
compassion for them. To such a man the world appears a strange land, a place  
where he has merely to perform his duties. **It is like a man 's having his  
real home in the country, but coming to Calcutta for work; he has to rent a  
house in Calcutta for the sake of his duties. When one develops love of God,  
one completely gets rid of one's attachment to the world and worldly wisdom**.   
"One cannot see God if one has even the slightest trace of worldliness. Match-  
sticks, if damp, won't strike fire though you rub a thousand of them against  
the match-box. You only waste a heap of sticks. The mind soaked in worldliness  
is such a damp match-stick. Once Sri Radha said to her friends that she saw  
Krishna everywhere-both within and without. The friends answered: 'Why, we  
don't see Him at all. Are you delirious?' Radha said, 'Friends, paint your  
eyes with the collyrium of divine love, and then you will see Him.'   
(To Vijay) "It is said in a song of your Brahmo Samaj: O Lord, is it ever possible to know Thee without love,   
However much one may perform worship and sacrifice?   
 _" If the devotee but once feels this attachment and ecstatic love for God,  
this mature devotion and longing, then he sees God in both His aspects, with  
form and without form._"   
continued......

Excerpt from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna - **The Master and Vijay Goswami**  
continued....   
 **Purity of heart**   
VIJAY: "How can one see God?"   
MASTER: " **One cannot see God without purity of heart**. Through attachment  
to 'woman and gold' the mind has become stained-covered with dirt, as it were.  
A magnet cannot attract a needle if the needle is covered with mud. Wash away  
the mud and the magnet will draw it. Likewise, the dirt of the mind can be  
washed away with the tears of our eyes. This stain is removed if one sheds  
tears of repentance and says, 'O God, I shall never again do such a thing.'  
Thereupon God, who is like the magnet, draws to Himself the mind, which is  
like the needle. Then the devotee goes into samadhi and obtains the vision of  
God.   
 **God 's grace is the ultimate help**   
"You may try thousands of times, but nothing can be achieved without God's  
grace. One cannot see God without His grace. **Is it an easy thing to receive  
the grace of God? One must altogether renounce egotism; one cannot see God as  
long as one feels, 'I am the doer.'**   
Suppose, in a family, a man has taken charge of the store-room; then if  
someone asks the master, 'Sir, will you yourself kindly give me something from  
the store-room?', the master says to him: 'There is already someone in the  
store-room. What can I do there?'**   
 _" God doesn't easily appear in the heart of a man who feels himself to be  
his own master. But God can be seen the moment His grace descends. He is the  
Sun of Knowledge. One single ray of His has illumined the world with the light  
of knowledge. That is how we are able to see one another and acquire varied  
knowledge. One can see God only if He turns His light toward His own  
face._(This is exactly what the upanishad says-That atman is realized by the  
atman alone-Ravi)   
"The police sergeant goes his rounds in the dark of night with a lantern in  
his hand. No one sees his face; but with the help of that light the sergeant  
sees everybody's face, and others, too, can see one another. If you want to  
see the sergeant, however, you must pray to him: 'Sir, please turn the light  
on your own face. Let me see you.' In the same way one must pray to God: 'O  
Lord, be gracious and turn the light of knowledge on Thyself, that I may see  
Thy face.'   
"A house without light indicates poverty. So one must light the lamp of  
Knowledge in one's heart. As it is said in a song: "Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart,   
Behold the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment."   
As Vijay had brought medicine with him, the Master asked a devotee to give him  
some water. He was indeed a fountain of infinite compassion. He had arranged  
for Vijay's boat fare, since the latter was too poor to pay it. Vijay,  
Balaram, M., and the other devotees left for Calcutta in a country boat.   
concluded.

drsundaram,   
you have asked about atma bodhendra samadhi.It is in a village called  
'vadavambalam' near vizhuppuram.Sri kAnchi mahAswAmi located it.Here is an  
extract: Quote  
> In the year 1926 while on padayatra Mahaperiyava was crossing Vizhupuram.  
> Periyava got a divine call and suddenly entered a Village called  
> ?Vadavambalam? along with his sishyas. Mahaperiyava then enquired the  
> elderly people in that village whether they know about any Sannyasi who  
> lived in that village? Unfortunately no one was aware of any such sannyasi.  
> However one old person in the crowd came forward and told Periyava that he

> Paramachrya realized that is the place, where the 58th Pontiff of Kanchi  
> Kama Koti Peetam Sri Atma Bodhendra Saraswati who was the Guru of Bhodendra  
> Saraswati Swamigal of Govindapuram, must have attained samadhi. He then  
> wandered the entire village and while crossing a plaintain field He sensed  
> some thing different and told one of his sishya who accompanied him to dig  
> one particular spot.   
> One Kumaramangalam Sambamoorthy Shastrigal was supervising the activity.  
> When the digging was in progress suddenly there was a huge crying voice from  
> Sambamoorthy Shastrigal ?Don?t Dig?. Don?t Dig? and fell unconscious on the  
> filed. The sishya who was was digging shocked and stopped digging. He then  
> gave water to Shastrigal who woke up to reality after a long gap. Shastrigal  
> then told the following which is breathtaking.  
I heard Sri Ganesa Sarma narrating this incident in his sapthaham talks on the  
Mahaswami's life.You may read the excerpt here: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=303973136329274&id=225328724193716

drsundaram/friends,   
Going back to the fundamental question-Atma vichara or Nama sankeertana-The  
fundamental objective of all sadhana is to turn the mind inwards and make it  
subside at the source.As long as this objective is met,the sadhana will be  
effective.   
I agree with what nagaraj has said- that Mumukshutva is the essential thing to  
pursue sadhana.What then constitutes maturity?The mind is said to be mature  
when one is steadfast and resolute in the sadhana,and the mind is forever  
oriented and fixed in the Divine.The mind is not assailed by any sort of doubt  
and is not distracted by anything else.It naturally flows towards the source  
in an uninterrupted fashion.Nothing in the world or its object can divert it  
from this inner orientation.   
For such a one,as Sri Bhagavan has said in his wonderful atma vidya kirtanam-  
Anma Viddhai athi sulabham,aiyyE anma Viddhai athi sulabham.   
Lo,Atma vidya is very easy,Lo,very easy indeed. **Even for the most infirm,so  
real is the Self** that compared with it the Amalak in One's hand appears a  
mere illusion.   
When something becomes our very nature,it becomes easy.The mind freed from  
worldliness automatically gravitates towards the Self.   
Sri Ramakrishna says: Quote  
> Reality is one and the same. The difference is only in name. He who is  
> Brahman is verily Atman, and again, He is the Bhagavan. He is Brahman to the  
> followers of the path of knowledge, Paramatman to the yogis, and Bhagavan to  
> the lovers of God.  
Namaskar

Dear sundram sir,   
Seems currently your doubts are cleared.   
i have one imp thing to say.   
Every Guru is very unique. We definitely cannot compare notes between two  
Gurus and try to see a unity. We may sometimes see a unity but we may not many  
times.   
Their teaching style, their stress etc. will vary in a large scale.   
One should have commitment to one Guru, one school of thought and proceed in  
that line only.   
Otherwise we will end up preparing a Kichadi with all flavours.   
Bodhedhral is a true saint of bhakthi school.   
Bhagavan Ramana was a true sage in same state as that of Sukha Brahmam.   
For us Ramana devotees, his words are the vedas. the booklet who am i is the  
upanishad.   
self enquiry and arunachala shiva devotion are the two wings with which we  
sadhakas fly.   
in Sri Ramana school of thought, there is no confusion at all.   
both japa and self enquiry are important.   
However bad we perform self enquiry, it is the earnestness that is important.
