**Volume 2, Practical Vedanta and other lectures   
THE WAY TO BLESSEDNESS**   
What is this Self? We have seen that It is even beyond the intellect. **We  
learn from the same Upanishad that this Self is eternal and omnipresent, that  
you and I and all of us are omnipresent beings, and that the Self is  
changeless.** Now this omnipresent Being can be only one. There cannot be two  
beings who are equally omnipresent  how could that be? **There cannot be two  
beings who are infinite, and the result is, there is really only one Self, and  
you, I, and the whole universe are but one, appearing as many. "As the one  
fire entering into the world manifests itself in various ways, even so that  
one Self, the Self of all, manifests Itself in every form."  
_But the question is: If this Self is perfect and pure, and the One Being of  
the universe, what becomes of It when It goes into the impure body, the wicked  
body, the good body, and so on? How can It remain perfect? "The one sun is the  
cause of vision in every eye, yet it is not touched by the defects in the eyes  
of any." If a man has jaundice he sees everything as yellow; the cause of his  
vision is the sun, but his seeing everything as yellow does not touch the  
sun._   
There the sun shines not, nor the stars, nor the lightning flashes, what to  
speak of fire? He shining, everything shines; through His light everything  
becomes effulgent. **When all the desires that trouble the heart cease, then  
the mortal becomes immortal, and here one attains Brahman.**   
 **This Is the one fundamental idea in the Vedas, that our search in the  
stars, the nebulae, the Milky Way, in the whole of this external universe  
leads to nothing, never solves the problem of life and death.** The wonderful  
mechanism inside had to be analysed, and it revealed to them the secret of the  
universe; nor star or sun could do it. Man had to be anatomised; not the body,  
but the soul of man. In that soul they found the answer. What was the answer  
they found? That behind the body, behind even the mind, there is the self-  
existent One.He dies not, nor is He born. The self-existent One it  
omnipresent, because He has no form. That which has no form or shape, that  
which is not limited by space or time, cannot live in a certain place. How can  
it? It is everywhere, omnipresent, equally present through all of us.   
 **Then the other great source of misery is fear.** Why does one man injure  
another? Because he fears he will not have enough enjoyment. One man fears  
that, perhaps, he will not have enough money, and that fear causes him to  
injure others and rob them. How can there be fear if there is only one  
existence? If a thunderbolt falls on my head, it was I who was the  
thunderbolt, because I am the only existence. If a plague comes, it is I; if a  
tiger comes, it is I. If death comes, it is I. I am both death and life. **We  
see that fear comes with the idea that there are two in the universe.**   
 **We have always heard it preached, "Love one another". What for? That  
doctrine was preached, but the explanation is here. Why should I love every  
one? Because they and I are one.** Why should I love my brother? Because he  
and I are one. There is this oneness; this solidarity of the whole universe.  
From the lowest worm that crawls under our feet to the highest beings that  
ever lived  all have various bodies, but are the one Soul. Through all  
mouths, you eat; through all hands, you work; through all eyes, you see. You  
enjoy health in millions of bodies, you are suffering from disease in millions  
of bodies. When this idea comes, and we realise it, see it, feel it, then will  
misery cease, and fear with it. How can I die? There is nothing beyond me.  
Fear ceases, and then alone comes perfect happiness and perfect love.   
That universal sympathy, universal love, universal bliss, that never changes,  
raises man above everything. It has no reactions and no misery can touch it;  
but this little eating and drinking of the world always brings a reaction.  
**The whole cause of it is this dualism, the idea that I am separate from the  
universe, separate from God. But as soon as we have realised that "I am He, I  
am the Self of the universe, I am eternally blessed, eternally free"  then  
will come real love, fear will vanish, and all misery cease.**

Bhagavan Ramana says: The world is imaginary. It is mental   
manifestations. When the whole world, or for that matter, the   
whole universe is imagination, how can these solve your problems?   
A dream thirst cannot be quenched, by taking water by getting up.   
The Self alone is the truth. Once the self is realized, still the world   
will appear, but then it will be all of Brahma Swarupam.   
Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam, Verse 5 says: He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you,   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Aruna Hill,   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.
