## Sayings of Nisargadatta Maharaj

\- Your mind is steeped in the habits of evaluation and acquisition, and will  
not admit that the incomparable and unobtainable are waiting timelessly within  
your own heart for recognition. All you have to do is to abandon all memories  
and expectations. Just keep yourself ready in utter nakedness and nothingness.   
\- The witness is that which says "I know". The person says "I do". Now, to  
say "I know" is not untrue, it is merely limited. But to say "I do" is  
altogether false, because there is nobody who does; all happens by itself,  
including the idea of being a doer. The universe is full of action, but there  
is no actor. There are numberless persons small and big and very big, who,  
through identification, imagine themselves as acting, but it does not change  
the fact that the world of action (mahadakash) is one single whole in which  
all depends on, and affects all. The stars affect us deeply and we affect the  
stars. Step back from action to consciousness, leave action to the body and  
the mind; it is their domain. Remain as pure witness, till even witnessing  
dissolves in the Supreme.   
\- It has nothing to do with effort. Just turn away, look between the  
thoughts, rather than at the thoughts. When you happen to walk in a crowd, you  
do not fight every man you meet, you just find your way between. When you  
fight, you invite a fight. But when you do not resist, you meet no resistance.  
When you refuse to play the game, you are out of it.   
\- Deepen and broaden your awareness of yourself and all the blessings will  
flow. You need not seek anything, all will come to you most naturally and  
effortlessly.   
\- Once you realize that the body depends on the mind, and the mind on  
consciousness, and consciousness on awareness, and not the other way round,  
your question about waiting for self-realization till you die is answered. It  
is not that you must be free from the "I-am-the-body" idea first, and then  
realize the self. It is definitely the other way round - you cling to the  
false because you do not know the true. Earnestness, not perfection, is a  
precondition to self-realization. Virtues and powers come with realization,  
not before.   
\- At present your being is mixed up with experiencing. All you need is to  
unravel being from the tangle of experiences. Once you have known pure being,  
without being this or that, you will discern it among experiences and you will  
no longer be misled by names and forms. Self-limitation is the very essence of  
personality.   
\- Experience, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very nature it  
comes and goes. Self-realization is not an acquisition. It is more of the  
nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost. On the other  
hand, consciousness is changeful, flowing, undergoing transformation from  
moment to moment. Do not hold on to consciousness and its contents.  
Consciousness held, ceases. To try to perpetuate a flash of insight, or a  
burst of happiness is destructive of what it wants to preserve. What comes  
must go. The permanent is beyond all comings and goings. Go to the root of all  
experience, to the sense of being. Beyond being and not-being lies the  
immensity of the real. Try and try again.

## Meditation  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 09, 2009, 11:24:32 AM

Meditation is a deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher states of  
consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of meditation is the art of  
shifting the focus of attention to ever subtler levels, without losing one's  
grip on the levels left behind. The final stage of meditation is reached when  
the sense of identity goes beyond the "I-am-so-and-so", beyond "so-I-am",  
beyond "I-am-the-witness-only", beyond "there-is", beyond all ideas into the  
impersonally personal pure being. But you must be energetic when you take to  
meditation. It is definitely not a part-time occupation. Limit your interests  
and activities to what is needed for you and your dependents' barest needs.  
Save all your energies and time for breaking the wall your mind had built  
around you. Believe me, you will not regret.   
\- Nisargadatta Maharaj

Quote  
...without losing one's grip on the levels left behind  
This would seem like a key element of what Nisargatta is saying here.   
The first thing that occured to me was the idea in Kabbala that the Crown  
(Keter) is in the Kingdom (Malhut).   
The second thing that occured to me was the Biblical injunction that one who  
seeks JHVH (Lord God) should look "with all your heart and all your soul"  
(Deut. 4:28:29). (I was told long ago by the then chief rabbi of Denmark that  
JHVH looks like a past present and future form of the verb, "to be" \--   
The third thing that occured to me is that, although I really don't know what  
I'm talking about, I find Nisargatta's words, what shall I say -- infectious?  
That is, they have a way of boring in to you.
