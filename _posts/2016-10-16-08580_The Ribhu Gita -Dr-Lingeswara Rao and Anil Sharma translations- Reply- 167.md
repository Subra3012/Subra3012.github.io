45. There is never any potency of ignorance. I am Brahman - there is no doubt of this. All is Brahman,   
the space of consciousness. That alone am I - there is no doubt.   
46. That alone am I. And, I am myself. The Beyond also am 'I', the supreme Lord. I am the possessor   
of knowledge (or, Vidyadhara, a class of celestial beings). There is nothing  
like knowledge and ignorance.   
47\. I am consciousness; I am the consciousness ever. I am the fourth state;  
cause of the fourth state;   
the supreme. All is Brahman only, only Brahman. All is Brahman, I am, -  
always.   
48. There is not a trifle other than me. And there is no Brahman anywhere outside me. Apart from me,   
there is nothing supreme. Apart from me there is no any state of  
consciousness.   
49. There is no state of reality apart from me. For me there is no state of consciousness outside me.   
There is no dwelling other than me. Apart from me there is no Brahman even.   
50. There is no cause apart from me. Apart from me there is not even an atom. Apart from me there is   
no serenity. Apart from me there is no purity.   
51. Apart from me there is no sanctity. Apart from me there is no word as 'that'. Neither there is   
righteousness apart from me nor there is everything.   
52. Anything apart from me here is only unreal. Anything outside me is only illusory. Anything and   
everything that shines other than me are like horns of hare.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
