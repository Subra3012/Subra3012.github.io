D: I have not yet learnt to control my mind so I intend to seek ekantavasam  
(life in solitude) in North India and want Sri Bhagavanâs grace.   
B: You have come all the way to Tiruvannamalai for ekantavasam, and that in  
the immediate presence and vicinity of Ramana Bhagavan, yet you do not appear  
to have obtained that mental quiet; you now want to go elsewhere and from  
there you will desire to go to some other place. At this rate there will be no  
end to your travels. **You do not realize that it is your mind that drives you  
in this manner. Control that first and you will be happy wherever you are. I  
do not know if you have read Swami Vivekanandaâs lectures.   
It is my impression that he has somewhere told the story of a man trying to  
bury his shadow and finding that over every sod of earth he put in the grave  
he had dug for it, it only appeared again, so that it could never be buried.  
Such is the case of a person who tries to bury his thoughts. One must  
therefore attempt to get at the very bottom from which thought springs and  
root out thought, mind and desire.**   
D: When I spent an hour or two on the hill yonder,I sometimes found even  
better peace than here, which suggests that a solitary place is after all more  
conducive to mind-control.   
B: True, but if you had stayed there for an hour longer,you would have found  
that place too not giving you the calm of which you speak. Control the mind  
and even Hell will be Heaven to you. All other talk of solitude, living in a  
forest etc., is mere prattle.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana also says this in His Gospel: Just as water in the pot reflects the enormous sun within the narrow limits of  
the pot, even so the vasanas or latent tendencies of the   
mind of the individual, acting as the reflecting medium, catch the   
all-pervading, infinite light of consciousness arising from the Heart   
and present in the form of a reflection, the phenomenon called the   
mind. Seeing only this reflection, the Ajnani is deluded into the belief that  
he is a finite being, the Jiva.   
If the mind becomes introverted through enquiry into the Source   
of aham-vritti [the I thought], the vasanas become extinct, and in the absence  
of the reflecting medium the phenomenon of reflection, the mind, also  
disappears being absorbed into the light of the one   
reality, the Heart.   
This is the sum and substance of all that an aspirant needs to know. What is  
imperatively required of him, is an earnest and one pointed enquiry into the  
Source of aham vritti.   
Arunachala Siva.
