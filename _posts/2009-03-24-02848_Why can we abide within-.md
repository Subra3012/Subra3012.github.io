## How can Krishna marry 16000 wives?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 23, 2009, 07:18:23 AM  
---  
We see in Bhagavatam that Krishna married 16,000 wives (Vallabacharya corrects  
the score as 16,110!) and also enjoyed   
Gopis some of whom were other men's wives. The qualified non-   
dualism has no answer for this. Advaita says that you are the Self.   
Every being is the Self. Then it is the Self touching the Self or   
marrying the Self, the One without a second. You are travelling   
in a bus. If you touch a woman's breast sitting nearby, you will   
be lynched. Suppose I touch my own chest, who will ask me or   
doubt me. This is the answer for Krishna marrying 16000 wives.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam, Tiru Padai Atchi: I shall not be able to see His eyes and rejoice!   
I shall be able to see the beautiful eyes of women and rejoice!   
I shall not be able to apply Holy Ashes on my forehead!   
I shall dance with women with breasts like champagne glases!   
How is it?   
Because I am the Self, I am Sivam. As Sivam, what if, if I do not   
wear holy ashes on my forehad? As Sivam, how I can see my eyes   
and rejoice? As Sivam, I can see beautiful eyes of women and   
rejoice, because there is no one other than Me. So is my dance with   
women with breasts like champagne glasses!   
This Sivanubhuti.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Miracles Do Happen  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 23, 2009, 07:54:33 AM

Swami Tatvabodhananda writes in Mountain Path, Jan-Mar 2009   
issue.   
I went to Sri Ramanasramam in early 1944.   
I was studying in a boarding school in Madikeri (Mercara). My father   
was a coffee estate owner in Ponnampet. Obviously we were quite   
rich. All of a sudden, even though I was studying in the 9th standard, I made  
up my mind to leave everything, go to Sri Ramana Maharshi   
and take sannyasa. I told my guardian in Madikeri to lend me Rs 100,   
collected another Rs 60, from our group savings of boys and went   
to Mysore by bus. From Mysore, I went to Bangalore by bus. From there by two  
trains to Tiruvannamalai, via Katpadi.   
I met Sarvadhikari and told him about me. Sarvadhikari was quite   
baffled. Nevertheless, he gave me room to stay for 3 days. I had   
no dhotis, so I went to the Hall to see the Maharshi, in gabardine   
pants and silk shirt. I saw Chadwick there. As soon as I saw Maharshi, I  
found Him looking at me intently. I sat for a long time,   
with legs crossed and went on weeping! Tears were flowing spontaneously and  
without end. Bhagavan Ramana continued to look at me intently. Now I  
controlled my tears and was weeping with out noise! At lunch, I sat near Him.  
They had served rice to Him. Bhagavan took a little of rice and placed it in  
my hand. I started eating happily.   
On the appointed day, Sarvadhikari sent me a Note inside the Hall   
which stated that I should catch the train to go to Katpadi. I kept quiet.  
Mouni Sadhu was sitting in the Hall. Someone whispered to   
me: Pesungo, Pesungo! (please talk, please talk). Then Bhagavan   
Ramana Maharshi Himself talked to me in Tamil: "Nee Sadhu aagappore Samayam  
varudu! Nee ippe pogalam! ( The time is   
approaching when you will become a sannyasi. Now you can go!).   
I could not say anything more. I went to the Asramam Office, bought   
Who am I and a biography in English. I donated Rs 30 to the Asramam.   
On arriving at Mysore, I bought ochre khadi dhoti and jubba. I went   
to the jungles of Madikeri and stayed there.*   
(* Later he was found out by his parents, brought home back, he studied for  
some more years in the boarding school and eventually with parents'  
permission, joined Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mysore.)

## Who is a Guru?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 24, 2009, 06:15:11 AM  
---  
In Sanskrit, three words are used to denote three different types   
of teachers. The first is Upadhyaya, the one who keeps the disciple   
near and tell him various scriptures. This gentleman is knowledgable   
but he is not himself realized. He should not collect fees from disciples.  
This gentleman can also teach other worldly knowledge too,   
like training a horse, elephant, dances, hunting with arrows, war-   
games etc., The second is Acharya, who teaches only about spiritual knowledge  
and various dharmas pertaining to it. He may be called a   
Spiritual Teacher in English. This gentleman is realized, he collects   
no fees and he teaches only dharma sasras but not way to realization.   
The final step is Guru. He is self realized. He may or may not himself  
follow dharma sastras, since he has transcended them. He does not go to  
king's court or a school and teaches. People intent on realization should go  
to him. He shall show the way to realization.   
If one follows his words, he will attain self realization. He does not even  
touch money or gold or offerings. He is sometimes called Sadguru also. One  
can call him as a Realized Teacher in English.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Why can we abide within?  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 24, 2009, 01:57:16 PM  
---  
Why are we not able to abide as within?   
The mind always tends to go outwards for bliss   
They say Self is absolute Bliss, still why are we looking outwards for Bliss   
Even to find out this Self, we always look for outwards   
Why cant I sit in the alloted chair of the Self and always looking for some  
other chair to sit?   
I also know that there is no outside, such outside is just an illusion.  
Everything is but Self   
Why am I always interested to be in dream?   
Why don't I like to wake up from this dream?   
Where from this foolishness has come up to me?   
It all only a dream. Even the dream is not apart from the Self   
Why am I still trying to abide as Self?   
I know whether I understand or realize the Self, I am always the Self   
But still I am in search of the Self which cannot be found at all!!   
Why Why Why?   
What is the problem are not my questions but my answers to the questions.   
In reality there are no questions at all.   
But each of my answers give rise to new answers and the list of answers in  
endless.   
How to stop this endless cycle?   
End of Education is character   
End of Knowledge is Wisdom   
End of Wisdom is Love   
Most of us are in the second stage... we are accumulating knowledge after  
knowledge, the result is that we are becoming wiser and wiser.   
When we need enough of this knowledge and wisdom we will be able to abide as  
Self!   
There is no end to Love   
I am that Love.... Anbe Sivam. .. Sat Chit Ananda   
Nagaraj

The art is to stop the search and be....   
and when we are graced this happens, naturally.....   
no one can do it, we can pray for it, we can sit for it, chant etc...but the  
switch from the desire to know the self to the self is beyond desire (it is  
the end of it)...no mind can do this...no effort or technique can do this as  
we all know   
self enquiry is a way to stop and be...and that is how we should understand  
it....as grace, not as practice   
I pray for us all, that bhagawan may grace us with the unfolding of our heart-  
lotus, with the peace of just sitting...   
I also dont know what to do
