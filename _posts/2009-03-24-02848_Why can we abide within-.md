Why are we not able to abide as within?   
The mind always tends to go outwards for bliss   
They say Self is absolute Bliss, still why are we looking outwards for Bliss   
Even to find out this Self, we always look for outwards   
Why cant I sit in the alloted chair of the Self and always looking for some  
other chair to sit?   
I also know that there is no outside, such outside is just an illusion.  
Everything is but Self   
Why am I always interested to be in dream?   
Why don't I like to wake up from this dream?   
Where from this foolishness has come up to me?   
It all only a dream. Even the dream is not apart from the Self   
Why am I still trying to abide as Self?   
I know whether I understand or realize the Self, I am always the Self   
But still I am in search of the Self which cannot be found at all!!   
Why Why Why?   
What is the problem are not my questions but my answers to the questions.   
In reality there are no questions at all.   
But each of my answers give rise to new answers and the list of answers in  
endless.   
How to stop this endless cycle?   
End of Education is character   
End of Knowledge is Wisdom   
End of Wisdom is Love   
Most of us are in the second stage... we are accumulating knowledge after  
knowledge, the result is that we are becoming wiser and wiser.   
When we need enough of this knowledge and wisdom we will be able to abide as  
Self!   
There is no end to Love   
I am that Love.... Anbe Sivam. .. Sat Chit Ananda   
Nagaraj

The art is to stop the search and be....   
and when we are graced this happens, naturally.....   
no one can do it, we can pray for it, we can sit for it, chant etc...but the  
switch from the desire to know the self to the self is beyond desire (it is  
the end of it)...no mind can do this...no effort or technique can do this as  
we all know   
self enquiry is a way to stop and be...and that is how we should understand  
it....as grace, not as practice   
I pray for us all, that bhagawan may grace us with the unfolding of our heart-  
lotus, with the peace of just sitting...   
I also dont know what to do
