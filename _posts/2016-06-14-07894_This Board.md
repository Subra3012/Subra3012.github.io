**_Q: How can one remain happy among so much suffering?   
M: One cannot help it -- the inner happiness is overwhelmingly real. Like   
the sun in the sky, its expressions may be clouded, but it is never absent.   
Q: If happiness is independent, why are we not always happy?   
M: As long as we believe that we need things to make us happy, we shall   
also believe that in their absence we must be miserable. Mind always shapes  
itself   
according to its beliefs. Hence the importance of convincing oneself that one  
need   
not be prodded into happiness; that, on the contrary, pleasure is a  
distraction and a   
nuisance, for it merely increases the false conviction that one needs to have  
and do   
things to be happy when in reality it is just the opposite.   
But why talk of happiness at all? You do not think of happiness except   
when you are unhappy. A man who says: 'Now I am happy', is between two sorrows   
\- past and future. This happiness is mere excitement caused by relief from  
pain.   
Real happiness is utterly unselfconscious. It is best expressed negatively as: 'there is   
nothing wrong with me. I have nothing to worry about'. After all, the ultimate   
purpose of all sadhana is to reach a point when this conviction, instead of  
being   
only verbal, is based on the actual and ever-present experience.   
Q: Emptiness and nothingness -- how dreadful!   
M: You face it most cheerfully, when you go to sleep! Find out for yourself   
the state of wakeful sleep and you will find it quite in harmony with your  
real   
nature. Words can only give you the idea and the idea is not the experience.  
All I   
can say is that true happiness has no cause and what has no cause is  
immovable.   
Which does not mean it is perceivable, as pleasure. What is perceivable is  
pain and   
pleasure; the state of freedom from sorrow can be described only negatively.  
To   
know it directly you must go beyond the mind addicted to causality and the  
tyranny   
of time.   
Q: What about witnessing?   
M: Witnessing is of the mind. The witness goes with the witnessed. In the   
state of non-duality all separation ceases.   
Q: What about you? Do you continue in awareness?   
M: The person, the 'I am this body, this mind, this chain of memories, this   
bundle of desires and fears' disappears, but something you may call identity,   
remains. It enables me to become a person when required. Love creates its own   
necessities, even of becoming a person.   
Q: What is the relation between reality and its expressions?   
M: No relation. In reality all is real and identical. As we put it, saguna and   
nirguna are one in Parabrahman. There is only the Supreme. In movement, it Is   
saguna. Motionless, it is nirguna. But it is only the mind that moves or does  
not   
move. The real is beyond. You are beyond. Once you have understood that  
nothing   
perceivable, or conceivable can be yourself, you are free of your  
imaginations. To   
see everything as imagination, born of desire, is necessary for self-  
realisation. We   
miss the real by lack of attention and create the unreal by excess of  
imagination.   
You have to give your heart and mind to these things and brood over them   
repeatedly. It is like cooking food. You must keep it on the fire for some  
time before   
it is ready.   
Q: Am I not under the sway of destiny, of my karma? What can I do   
against it? What I am and what I do is pre-determined. Even my so-called free   
choice is predetermined; only I am not aware of it and imagine myself to be  
free.   
M: Again, it all depends how you look at it. Ignorance is like a fever - it   
makes you see things which are not there. karma is the divinely prescribed   
treatment. Welcome it and follow the instructions faithfully and you will get  
well. A   
patient will leave the hospital after he recovers. To insist on immediate  
freedom of   
choice and action will merely postpone recovery. Accept your destiny and  
fulfil it -   
this is the shortest way to freedom from destiny, though not from love and its   
compulsions. To act from desire and fear is bondage; to act from love is  
freedom.

**_Q: What is the experience which comes nearest to the Supreme?   
M: Immense peace and boundless love. realise that whatever there is true,  
noble and beautiful in   
the universe, it all comes from you, that you yourself are at the source of  
it. The gods and   
goddesses that supervise the world may be most wonderful and glorious beings;  
yet they are like   
the gorgeously dressed servants who proclaim the power and the riches of their  
master.   
Q: How does one reach the Supreme State?   
M: By renouncing all lesser desires. As long as you are pleased with the  
lesser, you cannot have   
the highest. Whatever pleases you, keeps you back. Until you realise the  
unsatisfactoriness of   
everything, its transiency and limitation, and collect your energies in one  
great longing, even the first   
step is not made. On the other hand, the integrity of the desire for the  
Supreme is by itself a call   
from the Supreme. Nothing, physical or mental, can give you freedom. You are  
free once you   
understand that your bondage is of your own making and you cease forging the  
chains that bind   
you.   
Q: How does one find the faith in a Guru?   
M: To find the Guru and also the trust in him is rare luck. It does not happen  
often.   
Q: Is it destiny that ordains?   
M: Calling it destiny explains little. When it happens you cannot say why it  
happens and you merely   
cover up your ignorance by calling it karma or Grace, or the Will of God.   
Q: Krishnamurti says that Guru is not needed.   
M: Somebody must tell you about the Supreme Reality and the way that leads to  
it. Krishnamurti is   
doing nothing else. In a way he is right -- most of the so-called disciples do  
not trust their Gurus;   
they disobey them and finally abandon them. For such disciples it would have  
been infinitely better   
if they had no Guru at all and just looked within for guidance. to find a  
living Guru is a rare   
opportunity and a great responsibility. One should not treat these matters  
lightly. You people are out   
to buy yourself the heaven and you imagine that the Guru will supply it for a  
price. You seek to   
strike a bargain by offering little but asking much. You cheat nobody except  
yourselves.   
Q: You were told by your Guru that you are the Supreme and you trusted him and  
acted on it.   
What gave you this trust?   
M: Say, I was just reasonable. It would have been foolish to distrust him.  
What interest could he   
possibly have in misleading me?   
Q: You told a questioner that we are the same, that we are equals. I cannot  
believe it. Since I do   
not believe it, of what use is your statement to me?   
M: Your disbelief does not matter. My words are true and they will do their  
work. This is the beauty   
of noble company (satsang).   
Q: Just sitting near you can it be considered spiritual practice?   
M: Of course. The river of life is flowing. Some of its water is here, but so  
much of it has already   
reached its goal. You know only the present. I see much further into the past  
and future, into what   
you are and what you can be. I cannot but see you as myself. It is in the very  
nature of love to see   
no difference._**

Questioner: Must I not use effort to arrest the movements of the mind?   
Nisargadatta Maharaj: It has nothing to do with effort. Just turn away, look  
between the thoughts, rather than at the thoughts. When you happen to walk in  
a crowd, you do not fight every man you meet -- you just find your way  
between.   
Questioner: If I use my will to control the mind, it only strengthens the ego.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj: Of course. When you fight, you invite a fight. But when  
you do not resist, you meet with no resistance. When you refuse to play the  
game, you are out of it.   
~ from 'I Am That', chapter 72**

**_M: Within the prison of your world appears a man who tells you that the   
world of painful contradictions, which you have created, is neither continuous  
nor   
permanent and is based on a misapprehension. He pleads with you to get out of  
it,   
by the same way by which you got into it. You got into it by forgetting what  
you are   
and you will get out of it by knowing yourself as you are.   
Q: So all my questions, my search and study are of no use?   
M: These are but the stirrings of a man who is tired of sleeping. They are not   
the causes of awakening, but its early signs. But, you must not ask idle  
questions, to   
which you already know the answers.   
Q: How am I to get a true answer?   
M: By asking a true question -- non-verbally, but by daring to live according   
to your lights. A man willing to die for truth will get it.   
Q: The worry with me is that I am prone to denying existence to what I   
cannot imagine.   
M: You would be wiser to deny the existence of what you imagine. It is the   
imagined that is unreal.   
Q: Is all imaginable unreal?   
M: Imagination based on memories is unreal. The future is not entirely   
unreal.   
Q: Which part of the future is real and which is not?   
M: The unexpected and unpredictable is real. _**

**_M: A quiet mind, undistorted by desires and fears, free from ideas and   
opinions, clear on all the levels, is needed to reflect the reality. Be clear  
and quiet --   
alert and detached, all else will happen by itself.   
Q: You had to make your mind clear and quiet before you could realise the   
truth. How did you do it?   
M: I did nothing. It just happened. I lived my life, attending to my family's   
needs. Nor did my Guru do it. It just happened, as he said it will.   
Q: Things do not just happen. There must be a cause for everything.   
M: All that happens is the cause of all that happens. Causes are numberless;   
the idea of a sole cause is an illusion.   
Q: How does one gain self-control? I am so weak-minded!   
M: Understand first that you are not the person you believe yourself to be.   
What you think yourself to be is mere suggestion or imagination. You have no   
parents, you were not born, nor will you die.   
Either trust me when I tell you so, or arrive to it by study and  
investigation.   
The way of total faith is quick, the other is slow but steady. Both must be  
tested in   
action. Act on what you think is true -- this is the way to truth.   
Q: Will the understanding that I am not the body give me the strength of   
character needed for self-control?   
M: When you know that you are neither body nor mind, you will not be   
swayed by them. You will follow truth, wherever it takes you, and do what  
needs be   
done, whatever the price to pay.   
Q: Is action essential for self-realisation?   
M: For realisation, understanding is essential. Action is only incidental. A   
man of steady understanding will not refrain from action. Action is the test  
of truth.   
M: The foreseen and expected is rarely true.   
Q: How does the person come into being?   
M: Exactly as a shadow appears when light is intercepted by the body, so   
does the person arise when pure self-awareness is obstructed by the 'I-am-the-  
body'   
idea. And as the shadow changes shape and position according to the lay of the  
land,   
so does the person appear to rejoice and suffer, rest and toil, find and lose  
according   
to the pattern of destiny. When the body is no more, the person disappears   
completely without return, only the witness remains and the Great Unknown.   
The witness is that which says 'I know'. The person says 'I do'. Now, to say   
'I know' is not untrue -- it is merely limited. But to say 'I do' is  
altogether false,   
because there is nobody who does; all happens by itself, including the idea of  
being   
a doer.   
Q: Then what is action?   
M: The universe is full of action, but there is no actor. There are   
numberless persons small and big and very big, who, through identification,  
imagine   
themselves as acting, but it does not change the fact that the world of action   
(mahadakash) is one single whole in which all depends on, and affects all. The  
stars   
affect us deeply and we affect the stars. Step back from action to  
consciousness,   
leave action to the body and the mind; it is their domain. Remain as pure  
witness, till   
even witnessing dissolves in the Supreme. _**

Dear Subramanian Sir and Nagaraj   
Both of you have given different explanations for the word சதுரன. From one  
angle we can say God is very clever and from another angle the word சதுரன  
represents 4 and what 4 does it imply here ?   
Ramalinga Swamigal's poems are quite simple and straight forward but inside  
those simplicity he puts in **few words** that are rarely used or that have a  
very different meaning from what we normally associate with and we need to dig  
in deeply to understand what they mean. Like here சதுரன normally means clever  
but I feel here it can refer to the Number 4 but what 4 does he mean can vary  
eg is it the 4 Vedas, the 4th state - Turiya. Some even say here சதுரன  
refers to the 4 types of way we reform a person - saama, dana, bheda, dhanda  
. Let us see the views of others.

Dear atmavichar,   
I shall further clarify this from a Tiruvachakam verse, in Koil Triuppadigam,  
(Decad on Koil, that is Chidambaram).   
தந்தது உன் தன்னைக் கொண்டது என் தன்னைச்   
 சங்கரா யார் கொலோ சதுரர்   
அந்தம் ஒன்றில்லா ஆனந்தம் பெற்றேன்   
 யாது நீ பெற்றது ஒன்று என்பால்?   
சிந்தையே கோயில் கொண்ட எம் பெருமான்   
 திருப்பெருந்துறை உறை சிவனே   
எந்தையே ஈசா உடல் இடம் கொண்டாய்   
 யான் இதற்கு இலன் ஓர் கைம்மாறே.   
Chengalvaraya Pillai who is an expert in Tiruvachakam, translates this verse  
as: You have given Yourself to me. You have taken myself to You.   
O Sankara! Who is the CLEVERER than the two?   
I have attained limitless Bliss.   
What have You attained from me?   
O Lord who has taken my Heart as Abode,   
the Lord of Tiruperundurai.   
O Father! You have occupied my body.   
What recompense can I pay for You?   
Here the word Chaturar is translated as cleverer.   
The word Chaturar comes from the Sanskrit word Chaaturyam, which means  
cleverness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear friends,   
 _ **" One should not reason too much; it is enough if one loves the Lotus  
Feet of the Mother. Too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion. You get

Dear Subramaniam Sir   
Thanks for the verse of Thiruvachagam where a similar word is used. Saint  
Ramalinga Swamy had the greatest admiration of Thiruvachagam and some people  
even say that Thiruaruta is an elaboration of Thiruvachagam.   
One more thing with regard to Thiruarutpa and Saint Ramalinga Swamigal is that  
there are many Tamil fanatics who claim that Vallalar was anti sanskrit. It  
is true that Vallar rebelled against the Chdiambaram Dikshitars and in protest  
started his own Temple at Vadalur where he devised his own unique form of  
Light Worship that was devoid of the Vedic Rituals etc but Vallalar was not  
anti sanskrit and his poems did borrow many sanskrit terms. However he also  
proved that he could compose Poems free of sanskrit words and many of his  
poems have pure tamil in them but he was never anti sanskrit.   
One of his famous work is called Thiruvadi Pugachi and it is a devotional hymn  
to Lord and it has 3 parts and first part is highly Sanskritzed Tamil, Second  
Part is a mixture of Tami and Sanskrit and Third Part is pure Tamil showing  
that he loves both Sanskrit as well as Tamil.

Saw this post on the net and sharing the same. I guess that the below list of  
sins listed by Vallalar comes in his Prose Work **Manumurai kanda vasagam**.If

Dear atmavichar,   
Excellent. Saint Ramalinga Swami's "don'ts" are a set of noble truths. In  
Kali Yuga, all these things happen. What to do?   
It is better for us to keep away from such dangerously malign people.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Arutperunjothi Agaval - Saint Ramalinga Swamigal's Masterpiece - 1596 verses  
in Pure Tamil written by him on a single night and that book with his  
handwriing is still kept in Vadalur. What is Arunachala Akshara ManaMalai  
to Ramana Devotess, Arutperum Jyothi Aghaval is to Vallalar's devotees.   
A beuatiful rendering of this Arutperum Joythi Aghaval is given here but being  
1596 verses it is a very long song and takes nearly 2 hours for complete  
chanting.

**த ிருஅருட்பா \- திருவடிப் புகழ்ச்சியின் சிறப்பும் பெருமையும் \- கட்டுரை : கடலூர் \- தி.மா. இராமலிங்கம்)   
Source : http://www.vallalarspace.org/VallalarKudil/list/639   
உயிர்களுக்கெல்லாம் உறவானவர்களே, வணக்கம்!   
இவ்வுலகில் வாழும் நாம் ஒருவரை ஒருவர் புகழ்ந்து, தங்களுடைய காரியங்களை  
வெற்றிகரமாக முடித்துக்கொள்கிறோம் என்பது உண்மை. புகழ்ச்சிக்கு அடிமையாகாத  
மனிதர்கள் இல்லை எனலாம். உண்மையில் புகழுபவனுக்கு அப்புகழை ஏற்பவன்  
அடிமையாகிவிடுவான். அதனால் தான் புகழுபவனின் காரியங்கள் வெற்றியடைகின்றன.   
புலவர்கள் மன்னர்களை புகழ்ந்துப் பாடியதும், அமைச்சர்கள் யாவரும் முதலமைச்சரை  
புகழ்வதும், முதலமைச்சர்கள் பிரதம அமைச்சரை புகழ்வதும் எதற்காக என்றால் காரிய  
சித்தியடைவதற்காகவே ஆகும்.   
திருவள்ளுவரைக்கூட இந்த புகழ் விட்டு வைக்கவில்லை. அவர் இயற்றிய குறளை  
படியுங்கள்...   
"தோன்றின் புகழோடு தோன்றுக அஃதிலார்   
தோன்றலின் தோன்றாமை நன்று."   
இக்குறளுக்கு இதுவரை யாரும் சரியான விளக்கத்தைக் கொடுக்கவில்லை என்றே  
கருதுகிறேன். எனக்கும் இதுவரை புரியவில்லை,   
எழுதின் புரிதலோடு எழுதுக அஃதிலார்   
எழுதலின் எழுதாமை நன்று.   
இந்தக் குறளை பொறுத்தமட்டில், இதுதான் திருவள்ளுவருக்கு என்னுடைய புகழுரையாகும்.  
இறைவனும் இந்தப் புகழுக்கு அடிமையானவனே என்றால் அது பொய்யன்று. திருவள்ளுவர்  
இங்கே இதற்காக ஒரு சரியானக் குறளை கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்...   
"இருள்சேர் இருவினையும் சேரா இறைவன்   
பொருள்சேர் புகழ்புரிந்தார் மாட்டு"   
உயிர்கட்கு இருவினைத் தொடர்பு உண்டென்றும், அது நீங்குதற்கு அவன் திருவடியைப்  
புகழ்வதாகிய வினையே வேண்டுவது என்றும் திருவள்ளுவர் உரைக்கின்றார்.   
மேலும் இதற்குச் சாட்சியாக பல்லாயிரங்கணக்கான தமிழ் இலக்கிய / ஆன்மீக நூல்களை  
கூறலாம். அந்த வகையில் நமது வள்ளலார் தம் இறைவனை புகழ்ந்துப் பாடியதே இந்த  
திருவடிப் புகழ்ச்சியாகும்.   
வள்ளலார் இயற்றிய திருவடி புகழ்ச்சியின் சிறப்புகள்:-   
# இத் திருவடிப் புகழ்ச்சியில் வள்ளலார் மொத்தம் 114 இடங்களில் 'பதம்' என்கிற இறை  
பதத்தை உபயோகப் படுத்தியுள்ளார். இறுதியில் முடிக்கும் போது 'அழிவில் நின்று  
உதவுகின்ற பதமே' என்று முடித்துள்ளது சிறப்பாக அமைகிறது.   
# இந்த திருவடிப் புகழ்ச்சி 128 அடிகளைக்கொண்டதாக இருந்தாலும், உண்மையில் இது 4  
அடிகளைக்கொண்ட ஒரே பாடலாகும். எப்படியெனில் ஒவ்வொரு அடியும் 32 வரிகளைக் கொண்டது.  
(32*4=128).   
# இப்பாடல் 'கழிநெடிலடி ஆசிரிய விருத்தம்' என்னும் இலக்கண வகையைச் சார்ந்தது.  
'கழிநெடிலடி' என்பது ஐந்து சீர்களுக்கும் மிக வருவது. 'விருத்தம்' என்பது நான்கு  
அடிகளாக மட்டுமே அமைவது.   
# பரசிவம், தரமிகும், மரபுறு, இரவுறும் என்பன அடிதோறும் முதல் சீர்களாக வந்து  
எதுகை தொடையாக இருப்பதைக் கவனிக்கவும்.   
# வரி ஒன்றுக்கு 6 சீர்கள் என 32 வரிகளில் (ஒரு அடியில்) 192 சீர்களை இது  
கொண்டுள்ளது.   
# அருணகிரியாரின் திருப்புகழ் பாடல்களில் 50 க்கும் அதிகமான் சீர்களை உடையவை  
உள்ளன. ஆனால் 192 சீர்களைக் கொண்ட ஒரு தமிழ்ப் பாடல் உண்டு என்றால் அது தமிழ்  
இலக்கிய உலகில் வள்ளலார் இயற்றிய இந்த 'திருவடிப் புகழ்சி' ஒன்றே ஆகும்.

**Thiru Arutpa by Purasai E. Arunagiri  
My first introduction to Divine Hymns of Thiru Arutpa was through a Cassette  
on the same sung by Purusai Arunagiri and happy to see the same uploaded on  
youtube and the list of songs are given below. He has taken just a few verses  
from each song and compiled this wonderful album. A very devotional rendering  
of Thiru Arutpa and definitely after listening to the same many will be  
interested in listening to more songs of Thiru Arutpa.   
One thing about Thiru Arutpa is that Saint Vallar had song about most of Hindu  
Deities ( Ganesha, Subramanya, Nataraja, Ambal ) in his first 5 volumes  
and in the 6th Volume he addresses God as Divine Light "Arutperum Jyothi "   
Here is the link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlPeHVDoBh8   
00:10 Munnavane Yanai   
05:37 Petra Thaithanai   
13:53 Thaditha Or Maganai   
23:14 Aththa Naan Vendudal   
27:52 Arutjyothi Deivam   
31:21 Thaayagi Thandeyumai   
34:13 Kallaarkkum Katravarkkum   
38:46 Eeyebdru Naan Oruvar

I remembered Tiruch chuzhial Padigam of Sri Muruganar in Sri Ramana Sannidhi  
Murai. Here also   
the phrase naRRavaa comes. This is in the 6th Verse of that decad.   
சற்றும் ஆசைச் சழக்கிலாத   
 சரணியா உனைச் சார்ந்ததால்   
இற்றெனப் படல் இல்லாதோர் இன்பம்   
 எய்தினேன் ரமணேசனே   
பற்றறுத்தவர் பாடு சீர்ப் பழம்   
 பாண்டி வண்சுழியற் பதி   
நற்றவாவுனை நான் மறக்கினும்   
 நாச் சொலும் உன்றன் நாமமே.   
Arunachala Siva.

Prof. K. Swaminathan has translated that verse of Tiruchuzhiyal Padigam: Lord Ramana, rock of refuge wholly free   
From any taint or base desire,   
Because I came to you I have gained   
This Bliss ineffable.   
Lord of ancient Pandiyan Tiruchuzhi   
Of which the saints desire-less sing,   
Master of penance,   
I may perhaps sometimes forget you   
But my tongue shall for ever your Name utter.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Here is good explanation of the song of Saint Ramalinga Swamigal by another  
blogger that we were discussing before. **   
http://podhuppaattu.blogspot.in/2006/01/5.html   
 **5. நமச்சிவாயத்தை நான்மறவேனே!   
பெற்ற தாய்தனை மகமறந் தாலும்   
 பிள்ளை யைப்பெறும் தாய்மறந் தாலும்   
உற்ற தேகத்தை உயிர்மறந் தாலும்   
 உயிரை மேவிய உடல்மறந் தாலும்   
கற்ற நெஞ்சகம் கலைமறந் தாலும்   
 கண்கள் நின்றிமைப் பதுமறந் தாலும்   
நற்ற வத்தவர் உள்ளிருந் தோங்கும்   
 நமச்சி வாயத்தை நான்மற வேனே!   
 -இராமலிங்க அடிகளார்**   
ப ெற்ற தாய்தனை மகமறந் தாலும்**   
தந்தை என்ற சொந்தத்தை விட தாய்க்கு இன்னும் ஒருபடி அதிக இடமுண்டு நம் வாழ்வில்.  
ஏனென்றால் சுமந்து பெற்று, சீராட்டி வளர்த்தவள் அவள். அதனாலேயே, தன் தாயை  
அவமதித்தவன், அவளுக்கு துரோகம் செய்தவன் என்று தீயவை செய்து தாய்ச் சாபம்  
பெற்றவன் இவ்வுலகில் நல்வாழ்க்கையும், மறுவுலகில் முக்தியும் அடையவே முடியாது  
என்று நம் பெரியோர்கள் மிகக் கடுமையான தண்டனையைப் பற்றி எச்சரித்திருக்கிறார்கள்  
(மகவு என்றால் குழந்தை பொருள் வரும். எனக்கென்னமோ மகன் என்றே அர்த்தம் கொள்ளலாம்  
என்று தோன்றுகிறது. ஏனென்றால் பெற்றோருக்கு ஐம்பது வயது ஆண்மகனும் இன்னமும்  
குழந்தைதானே?). ஆனால், இம்மாதிரி தண்டனைகளுக்கு அஞ்சாமல் கூட தாயை  
மறப்பானெனினும்...   
ப ிள்ளை யைப்பெறும் தாய்மறந் தாலும்**   
முன்சொன்னதாவது நடக்கக்கூடிய ஒன்றானாலும், பெற்ற பிள்ளையை என்றாவது தாய்  
மறப்பாளா? மறக்கத்தான் முடியுமா? எப்பேர்ப்பட்ட கொடிய குணமுடைய பெண்மணிக்கும்  
தான் ஈன்ற பிள்ளையெனும் பொழுது, கருணை வரத்தான் செய்யும். அதனாலேயே முன்னால்  
கூறிய உதாரணம் நடப்பதும் அரிது. ஏனென்றால் ஒரு தாய் தன் பிள்ளையை, அவன் எவ்வளவு  
கொடுரமானவனாக இருந்தாலும், தனக்கு துன்பத்தையே இழைத்தாலும் சபிக்காமல் மன்னிக்கவே  
விரும்புவாள். ஆனாலும் இந்த மிகைப்படுத்தப்பட்ட உதாரணத்தை அடிகளார்  
பயன்படுத்துகிறார்.   
 **உ ற்ற தேகத்தை உயிர்மறந் தாலும்   
உயிரை மேவிய உடல்மறந் தாலும்**   
இந்த உடலும் உயிரும் சக்தியும் சிவமும் மாதிரி. திருவிளையாடல்ல சிவனும்  
பார்வதியும் நல்லா சண்டையெல்லாம் போட்டு, சிவாஜி தாம்தூம் இரத்தச் சிவப்பு  
கண்களோட ஆட்டமும் போட்டு; பாம்பு, நெருப்பு ராக்கெட்லாம் விட்டு.. கடசியா  
சமாதானமாப் போவாங்களே. 'சக்தியில்லையேல் சிவமில்லை. சிவமில்லையேல் சக்தியில்லை'.  
அந்த மாதிரி இந்த நம் உயிராகிய ஆத்மா என்பது உடலாகிய மெய்யிலிருந்து பிரிந்து  
இந்த மண்ணுலகில் வாழமுடியாது. அதேபோல், மெய்யாகிய உடலும் உயிராகிய ஆத்மா  
இல்லாவிட்டால் வெறும் பிணம் தான். இப்படி இரண்டும் ஒருவர்கொருவர் இல்லாமல் இருக்க  
முடியாது. அப்போது இரண்டில் ஒன்று மற்றொன்றை மறப்பது என்பது சாத்தியமா?  
மறந்தாலும், இழப்பு இருவருக்கும் தானே.   
க ற்ற நெஞ்சகம் கலைமறந் தாலும்**   
ஒரு கலையைக் கற்பது என்பது எவ்வளவு கஷ்டமான விஷயம்? ஜாலியா கத்துகிட்டா பத்து  
பதினைந்து ஆண்டுகள் தொடர்ந்து பயின்று வந்தால் சாதாரண கலைஞனாகலாம். அவங்களால  
எளிதா மறந்துட முடியும். நானே அதுக்கு நல்ல உதாரணம்.   
ஆனா அதிலேயே மூழ்கி, வழி தவறாமல் கடுமையாய் உழைத்தால் தான் ஒரு கலைஞனாகலாம்.  
அத்தகைய ஒரு கலைஞன், உதாரணத்துக்கு எம்.எஸ் என்று ஒரு பேச்சுக்கு  
வைத்துக்கொள்வோமே. ஐம்பது ஆண்டுகள் உயிரைக் கொடுத்து உழைத்துக் கற்ற கலையை  
திடிரென்று ஒரு நாள் மறக்க முடியுமா? மறக்க நினைத்தாலும் தான் முடியுமா?  
ஏனென்றால் நம் இரத்தத்திலேயே ஊறிவிட்டிருக்குமல்லவா? இதில் கலை என்பது சாஸ்திரம்,  
அறிவியல் என்னவேனா வச்சுக்கலாம். ஆனாலும், அந்த மாதிரி பலவாண்டுகள் கற்ற கலையை  
ஒரு கலைஞன் மறந்தாலும்...   
க ண்கள் நின்றிமைப் பதுமறந் தாலும்**   
நம் உடலில் நடக்கும் பல விஷயங்களை நாம் கட்டுப்படுத்த முடியாது.  
கட்டுப்படுத்தலாம். ஆனால் மிகவும் conscious ஆக முயற்சி எடுத்து செய்யவேண்டும்.  
மேலும், அவற்றை வீம்புக்காக தீவிரமாய் நிறுத்துவதால் பாதிப்புகளே உண்டாகும்.  
மூச்சு, இதயத்துடிப்பு என்ற வரிசையில் கண் இமைப்பதும் வரும். நாம் நினைக்காமலேயே  
நம் கண்கள் தாமாகவே இமைகளை மூடி திறப்பதன் மூலம் காற்றிலுள்ள தூசு போன்றவை நம்  
கண்களை உறுத்தாமல் காத்துக்கொள்கிறது. இரண்டு நிமிடம் இமைக்காமல் இருக்க முயன்று  
பாருங்கள். உடனே கண்ணீர் வரும். அதுவும் தற்காப்பு முயற்சியே. ப்ளஷ் செய்வது போல  
நம் கண்ணீர் சுரப்பிகள் வேலை செய்வதன் பயனே கண்ணீர். இது மாதிரி, கண்கள் இமைப்பது  
என்பது அக்கண்களின் பாதுகாப்பிற்கு இன்றியமையாத ஒன்று. அதைச் செய்ய கண்கள்  
மறந்தாலும்..   
 **ந ற்ற வத்தவர் உள்ளிருந் தோங்கும்**   
முனிவர்கள், கடவுளர்கள், தேவர்கள் போன்றவர்களை நற்றவத்தவர் என்கிறோம். ஏன்  
கடவுளர்கள்? பிரம்மா முதலிய பிற கடவுள்களும், இந்திராதி தேவர்களும் கூட  
பரம்பொருளை நோக்கி பல தவங்கள் செய்துள்ளதாக புராணங்கள் கூறுகின்றன. அம்மாதிரி  
பெரும் தவவலிமை உடையோரின் நெஞ்சத்தின், ஆத்மாவின் உள்ளே ஓங்கிஉயர நின்று  
ஒளிதரும்..   
ந மச்சிவாயத்தை நான்மறவேனே!**   
மேற்கூறிய கொடுரமான, மிகைப்படுத்தப்பட்ட செயல்கள் எல்லாம் இயற்கையாய் நடந்தாலும்,  
நமச்சிவாய மந்திரத்தை நான் என்றென்றும் மறவாமல் ஜபித்துக் கொண்டிருப்பேனே!

Subramaniam Sir   
JK in one of his talks with his close associate who asked him what difference  
does it make if one person is good and JK said that Goodness is contagious and  
it spreads far and wide creating ripples of positive energy. So here Sri Ravi  
while writing his commentary on Thiruppavai wrote about that song of Vallalar  
and I was curious about the word நற்ற வத்தவர் and posted my query here and a  
chain of verses and positive posts followed in this thread. So this is the  
ripple effect of sharing good and uplifting thoughts.   
Coming back to the word நற்ற வத்தவர் , on searching the net I found the above  
poem of Saint Ramalingam created a strong impulse in Marai Malai Adigal to  
start the Separate Tamil Movement i.e to free tamil from Sanskrit words and  
replace it by pure tamil words.   
Here is a link to how the above song of Vallalar kindled the spirit of  
தனித்தமிழ் Movement in மறைமலையடிகளார். **   
http://www.keetru.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13239%3A2011-02-26-17-59-28&catid=1274%3A10&Itemid=533   
தனித்தமிழ் இயக்கத் தந்தை   
எப்போதும் தமிழ்த்தொண்டு, சிவத்தொண்டு செய்து வருவதாகக் கூறுவார் மறைமலையடிகளார்.  
ஆயின் சிவத்தொண்டுக்கு முதன்மையளித்து வந்தார் என்பதே உண்மை. 1916இல் அந்த  
நிகழ்விற்குப் பின், தமிழ்த் தொண்டில் மறைமலையடியார்க்குக் கவனம் கூடியது எனலாம்.   
ஒருநாள் மாலைப் பொழுதில் சுவாமி வேதாசலனார் ( மறைமலையடிகளார்) தம் மகள்  
நீலாம்பிகையோடு தம் மாளிகைப் பூந்தோட்டத்தில் உலவிக்கொண்டிருந்தார். பண்ணிசைத்து  
வள்ளலார் இராமலிங்க அடிகளாரின் பாடலைப் பாடினார்.   
âபெற்ற தாய்தனை மகமறந் தாலும்   
பிள்ளை யைப்பெறு தாய்மறந் தாலும்   
உற்ற **த ேகத்தை** உயிர்மறந் தாலும்   
உயிரை மேவிய உடல்மறந் தாலும்   
கற்ற நெஞ்சகம் கலைமறந் தாலும்   
கண்கள் நின்றிமைப் பதுமறந் தாலும்   
நற்ற வந்தவர் உள்ளிருந் தோங்கும்   
நமச்சி வாயத்தை நான்மற வேனே.â   
இப்பாடலைப் பாடிமுடித்த வேதாசலனார், âநீலா! **இ ப்பாடலில் தேகம் என்றொரு  
வடசொல் வந்துள்ளது. அவ்வொன்றனையும் நீக்கி, அவ்விடத்தில் யாக்கை என்னும்  
தமிழ்ச்சொல் அமையப் பெற்றிருக்குமானால், இச்செய்யுளின் ஓசையின்பம் எவ்வளவோ  
மேம்பட்டதாக இருந்திருக்கும். **பிறமொழிச் சொற்கள் கலப்பதால் தமிழின் இனிமை  
குறைகின்றது. அன்றியும் நாளடைவில் தமிழில் கலந்த பிறமொழிச் சொற்கள் நிலைபெற்று,  
அச்சொற்களுக்கு நேரே வழங்கி வந்த நம் அருமைத் தமிழ்ச்சொற்கள்  
மறைந்துவிடுகின்றனâ என்றார். அதனைக் கேட்ட நீலாம்பிகையார் âஅப்படியானால்,  
நாம் அயல்மொழிச் சொற்களை விலக்கித் தனித்தமிழையே பேச்சிலும் எழுத்திலும்  
போற்றுதல் வேண்டும். அவற்றுக்கான முயற்சிகளைக் கைவிடுதல் ஆகாதுâ என்றார்.  
அப்படியே செய்வோம் என்று மகிழ்ந்தேற்றார் வேதாசலனார். இவ்வாறு இருவர் கூட்டால்  
எழுந்து தோன்றியது தனித்தமிழ் இயக்கம்! பேச்சு எழுத்து எல்லாம் தனித்தமிழிலேயே  
இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று முடிவெடுத்து அதன்படி ஒழுகலானார்.

Dear atmavichar,   
While Tani Tamizh is welcome, as centuries passed on, more and more words from  
other languages have become in use   
in Tamizh. Even Triuvalluvar, who wrote Tiruk KuRaL in 3rd Century AD, he  
could not avoid Sanskrit words. One Tamizh   
Saiva Saint says Ariyam (Sanskrit) and Tamizh are the two eyes of Siva.   
அகர முதல எழுத்தெல்லாம் ஆதி   
பகவன் முதற்றே உலகு   
The above is the invocatory verse in Tiruk KuRaL. Here, akaram, aadhi,  
bhagavan, ulaku are all Sanskrit words.   
The first three is clear. How about ulaku? Ulaku is not an original Tamizh  
word. It came from lokam, Sanskrit.   
lokam came from the dhatu luk. In English also we say look. The world  
appears because we look at it, says   
Bhagavan.   
Incidentally, in the name of MaRaimalai Adigal there is one old library in  
Mannady, Chennai. In my younger days,   
when I was working in Chennai, and when I was staying with my maternal uncle,  
I used to go to this library.   
It contains treasure of books in Tamizh, Sanskrit, and English. I am not sure  
whether this library is functioning even   
today.   
Arunachala Siva.

> Incidentally, in the name of MaRaimalai Adigal there is **one old library in  
> Mannady, Chennai**.  
Subramaniam Sir   
 Vallar keeps chasing us today. It was in that very building that the great  
poet and seer Vallalar Ramalinga Adigal, in the early 1830s had given his  
first public discourse at the age of 9.   
Maraimalai Adigal spent most of his income on buying books. Research on the  
readership of his book collections show that between 20 April 1923 to 10  
August 1930 a total of 1852 people had borrowed his books. The readership  
included people from Madras Presidency, Sri Lanka, Burma and Malaysia. Upon  
his death, on 15 September 1950,according to his will, the books were left for  
the people of Tamil Nadu and thus a library named after him was started in  
1958 by the then MD, Padmashri V.Subbiah Pillai of South India Saiva Siddhanta  
Works Publishing Society Ltd. at Linghi Street, Chennai. by adding more no of  
rare collection of Tamil books. The library was a repertoire of books and  
journals, some printed way back in 1779. In May 2008 Tamil Nadu Government  
helped by allocating a space at Connemara Public Library but the library  
management is still with the present MD Rajagopal Muthukumaraswamy M.A.,  
B.Lib.Sc., of South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society Ltd.(

**I have shared this below in another thread but again sharing in this thread  
exclusively devotes to Saint Ramalinga Swamy**   
 **I see lot of similarities between Ramalinga Swamigal and Bhagwan Ramana**   
1) Both never had a formal Guru   
2) Both never wore Ochre robes and were wearing white   
3) Both composed the best of their hyms in Classical Tamil.   
4) Both addressed God as their Father - Bhagwan Ramana called Father  
Arunachala and Ramalinga Swamigal called God as My father Arutperum Jyoti  
Andavar   
5) Both have similar Maha Mantras that are used as refrains in their poems.   
Bhagwan : Arunchala Siva Arunchala Siva   
 Arunchala Siva Arunachala   
Ramalinga Swamigal : Arutperum Jyothi Arutperum Jyothi   
 Thaniperum Karunai Arutperum Jyothi   
6) The Deepam on Arunachala is nothing but Arutperum Jyothi of Ramalinga  
Swamigal   
7) Both of them had high regard for Thiruvachagam, Manicka Vachagar, Jnana  
Sambandar   
so like that one can go on.   
But there are some differences also like**   
1)Bhagwan Ramana was a pure Advaita and Rama Linga Swamigal's Philosophy is  
something unqiue i.e neither adviata or saiva siddhantha but something in  
between them. I am really not sure what his real Philosophy is. Can anyone  
say what his Philosophy is ?   
2) Bhagwan Ramana had highest respect for Vedas and Vedic Chanting etc but  
Rama Linga Swamigal was quite anti Vedic, anti Brahmin and he had lot of  
problem with the Chidambaram Temple over the Vedic method of worship there and  
hence he decided to start his own Temple at Vadalur. The anti Vedic tone of  
some of Ramalinga Swamigal's songs are not directly against Vedas but against  
the behavior of Vedic Brahmins.   
3) Ramalinga Swamigal was a sort of Siddha and he believed in Transmuting the  
body from decaying. Bhagwan Ramana never believed in such sort of Body  
Immortality. But Ramalinga Swamigal was not a Yoga Siddha but a Jnana Siddha.

For those interested in understanding the life, teaching, mission and works  
of Saint Ramalinga Swamiga ( Vallalar ), I recommend the following book "The  
Universal Vision of Saint Ramalingam" which is an English Translation of the  
Original Tamil Book "Vallar Kanda Orumaipadu" by Dr.M.P.Sivagnanam   
This book received the 1966 "Sahithya Academy Award" in Tamil. This is one of  
the best books I have read on Saint Ramalinga Swamigal.   
For a free download of the PDF version of the english book follow the link

**த மிழ் உரைநடையின் தொடக்கப் புள்ளி வள்ளலார்**   
http://www.thinnai.com/index.php?module=displaystory&story_id=60810234&edition_id=20081023&format=html   
 **ம ுனைவர் மு. பழனியப்பன்**   
செய்யுள், உரைநடை என்ற இரு வடிவகங்கள் தமிழ்மொழிக்கு வளம் சேர்த்து வருகின்றன.  
செய்யுள் என்பது தமிழ் தனக்கே, தானே தன்மொழிப் படைப்பாளர்களால் உருவாக்கிக் கொண்ட  
வடிவம். அது இறுகிப்போய் குறளாகி, ஆசிரியமாகி, விருத்தமாகி-நீர்த்துப் போய்  
வசனகவிதையாகி, புதுக்கவிதையாகி எனப் பல்வேறு வடிவங்களை அடைந்து வளர்ந்து  
வருகின்றது.   
உரைநடை வடிவம் தமிழுக்கு வந்த வடிவம். ஆனால் எளிமையான மக்களையும் சென்றடையும்  
வல்லமை அதற்கு உண்டு. செய்தித்தாள்கள் முதல் நூல்கள் வரை தற்காலத்தில்  
பெரும்பாலும் உரைநடையில் சொல்லும் முறைமை வந்துவிட்டது. உரைநடையின் திறந்த  
மறைபொருளற்ற அகராதி தேடிப் பொருள் கண்டறியத் தேவையில்லாத நேர்வடிவம் மக்களிடம்  
அது எளிதில் சென்று அடைய வசதியாகிவிட்டது.   
தமிழுக்கு உரைநடை வந்தபோது செய்யுள் நடையில் எழுதியவர்கள் உரைநடையின் வடிவ எளிமை  
கண்டு அதிலும் படைப்புக்களை படைக்கத் துவங்கினர். இரு வடிவங்களின் சந்திப்புக்  
காலமான இக்காலம் குறிக்கத் தக்க காலமாகும். இக்காலப் புலவர்கள் செய்யுள்  
செய்வதிலும் தேர்ந்தவர்களாக இருந்தனர். உரைநடை வடிவிலும் திறம் பெற்றவர்களான  
விளங்கினர். இதற்கு அடுத்தகாலத்தில் கவிஞர்கள் என்ற தனிப்பிரிவும்,  
உரைநடையாளர்கள் என்ற தனிப்பிரிவும் ஏற்பட்டுவிட்டது. உரைநடையாளருக்குக் கவிதை  
பிடிபடாது. கவிஞர்க‌ளுக்கு உரைநடை ஒத்துவராது என்ற நிலை வந்துவிட்டது. கண்ணதாசன்  
போன்ற சிலருக்கு விதி விலக்கு உண்டு.   
வீரமாமுனிவர், மாயூரம் வேதநாயகம் பிள்ளை, வடலூர் வள்ளல் இராமலிங்க அடிகள்,  
பாரதியார் போன்றவர்கள் செய்யுள் படைப்புகளாலும், உரைநடை படைப்புகளாலும் உயர்ந்து  
நின்றவர்கள் ஆவர். தமிழின் இரு வடிவ நிலைகளிலும் வல்ல இவர்களால் இரண்டு  
வடிவங்களும் செழுமை பெற்றன.   
குறிப்பாக பதினெட்டாம் நூற்றாண்டில் நடைபெற்ற செய்யுள், உரைநடை சந்திப்புக்  
காலக்கட்டம் தமிழ் இலக்கிய வரலாற்றில் குறிக்கத் தக்க காலகட்டமாகும். இக்காலக்  
கட்டத்தில் உரைநடை செய்ய முனைந்த அறிஞ‌ர்களைக் கூர்ந்து கவனிக்க வேண்டி  
இருக்கிறது. இக்கட்டுரை வள்ளலாரின் உரைநடை ஆற்றல் என்னும் விரிந்த பரப்பினில் சில  
சொல்ல விழைகின்றது.   
வள்ளலார் எழுதிய உரைநடை ஆக்கங்கள் இரண்டு ஆகும். ஒன்று மனுமுறை கண்ட வாசகம்.  
மற்றொன்று ஜீவகாருண்ய ஒழுக்கம்.   
இவற்றுள் முன்னது பெரிய புராண ஈடுபாட்டால் அதனை ஒட்டி வள்ளல் பெருமானால் எழுதப்  
பெற்றது. முழுக்க முழுக்க புதிய உரைநடைப் படைப்பு என்ற நோக்கில் வள்ளல்  
பெருமானின் ஜீவகாருண்ய ஒழுக்கம் பெருமை பெறுவதாகின்றது. இவ்வுரைநடைப்  
படைப்புகளைப் படைக்கின்ற வள்ளலார் இதனை ஒட்டிப் பல நூல்களுக்கு உரைகளும்  
வரைந்துள்ளனர். அவ்வாறு அவர் வரைந்த உரைகள் இவரின் தனித்த உரைநடைக்கு வழி தருவன  
ஆயிற்று. எனவே வள்ளலார் கவிஞர், உரைநடையாளர், உரையாளர் போன்ற பல  
படைப்புத்திறன்களை உடையவராகின்றார்.   
ஆயிரத்து எண்ணூற்று அறுபத்தேழாம் ஆண்டின் வைகாசி மாதம் பதினொன்றாம் நாளன்று  
நிகழ்ந்த தருமச்சாலைத் தொடக்க விழாவில் ஜீவகாருண்ய ஒழுக்கம் என்ற உரைநடை நூல்  
அரங்கேற்றம் செய்யப் பெற்றுள்ளது. ஓரளவு எழுதி முடிக்கப் பெற்ற பகுதிகள் மட்டுமே  
மக்கள் முன்னிலையில் வாசிக்கப் பெற்றன. முழுவதும் அப்போது எழுதி முடிக்கப்  
படவில்லை. வாசிக்கப்படவும் இல்லை. இக்காலக் கட்டமே தமிழ்ச் செய்யுள் வடிவமும்,  
உரைநடை வடிவமும் சந்தித்த காலமாகும்.ஜீவ காருண்ய உரைநடைப் பகுதி மு்ன்று  
பிரிவுகளை உடையதாகும். மூன்றாவது பிரிவு முற்றுப்பெறாமல் உள்ளது. முதல் பகுதியின்  
சில பகுதிகளைத் திருப்பிச் சொல்லுவதாகவும் மூன்றாம் பகுதி தற்போது கிடைக்கிறது.  
வள்ளலார் இதனை ஏழுபிரிவாக எழுத எண்ணியிருந்திருக்கிறார். அதற்கான காலம் அமையப்  
பெறாமல் இவ்வுரைநடைப்பகுதி முற்றுப் பெற்று நின்றுவிட்டது.   
இருப்பினும் இம்முற்றுப்பெறா பகுதிகளைப் படிக்கும் பொழுது அது முற்றுப் பெறவில்லை  
என்ற எண்ணம் தோன்றுவதில்லை. ஏனெனில் ஜீவகாருண்யம் குறித்துத் தான் உலகிற்கு  
அறிவிக்க வேண்டிய செய்திகள் அனைத்தையும் தானே தடை, விடைகளை ஏற்படுத்திக் கொண்டு  
வள்ளல் பெருமான் இதற்குள் முழுமையாக உணர்த்தி விட்டதாகவே எண்ணமுடிகின்றது.  
இப்பகுதியைப் படிப்போர் ஐயம், திரிபின்றி, முரண்பாடு இன்றி ஜீவகாருண்யம் குறித்து  
அறிந்து கொள்ள இயலும்.   
மேலும் பத்தி என வரையறுக்கப் பெறும் ஒரு பொருள் பற்றியதான பகுதிக்கும் அடுத்த  
பகுதிக்கும் வள்ளலாரின் உரைநடையில் நல்ல ஒருங்கிணைப்பு காணப்படுகிறது. ஒரு  
பத்தியுடன், ஒரு பத்தி தொடர்ந்து செல்வதாக உள்ளது. இது உரைநடைக்கு உரிய உத்தி  
வடிவமாகும். பொருள் தொடர்நிலையாகும்.   
எளிமையான எடுத்துக்காட்டுகள், உவமைகள், தத்துவங்கள் நிகழ்வுகள் ஆங்காங்கே  
இவ்வுரைநடைப் பகுதியில் காணப்படுகின்றன. வடமொழிச் சொல்லாட்சிகளுக்கும் இதனுள்  
இடம் தரப் பெற்றுள்ளது.   
இதனால் வள்ளலாரின் கொள்கையை அறிந்து கொள்ள விரும்புகிற ஆரம்பநிலை சார்ந்த  
சன்மார்க்க கொள்கையாளர்கள் கற்க வேண்டிய முதல் நூல் அடிப்படை நூல் என்ற நிலையில்  
இந்நு}லைக் காட்டமுடிகின்றது. திருவருட்பாக்களைக் கற்று அறிந்து கொள்ளவேண்டிய  
செய்திகளைக் குறுகிய அளவில் இவ்வுரைநடை தனக்குள் புதைந்து வைத்துள்ளது.   
இவ்வகையில் சுவையான உரைநடைப் பகுதியாக ஜீவகாருண்ய ஒழுக்கம் என்ற உரைநடைப் பகுதி  
அமைந்திருக்கிறது என்றால் அது மிகையான கூற்று அல்ல.ஜீவ காருண்ய ஒழுக்கம் என்ற  
இந்த உரைநடைப் பகுதி மக்கள் அபர, பர ஞானம் பெற்று உயரிய வாழ்க்கை வாழ்வதற்கான  
முறைமைகளை எடுத்துரைக்கின்றது.   
உலகத்தில் மனிதப் பிறப்பைப் பெற்றுக் கொண்டவர்கள் இந்தப் பிறப்பினால் அடையத் தக்க  
ஆன்ம லாபத்தை காலமுள்ளபோதே அறிந்து அடைய வேண்டும் என்பது இவ்வுரைநடையின் தொடக்க  
வரிகளாகும். உலகம் எனத் தொடங்கியுள்ள இம்முறைமை உலக உயிர்களுக்கான பெருநெறி  
குறித்துச் சிந்திப்பதாக உள்ளது. மேலும் இதனுள் காட்டப் பெற்ற ஆன்ம லாபம் என்ற  
தொடர் அடுத்த பத்தியைத் தொடரச் செய்வதாக உள்ளது.   
அந்த ஆன்ம லாபம் எது என்று அறிய வேண்டில்‍ என்று தடையோடு அடுத்த பகுதி ஆரம்பமாகி  
அதன்பின் இவ்வினாவிற்கான விடை தொடர்கிறது. இவ்வாறு தடை விடையாக அமைந்துக்  
கற்பவரை, கேட்பவரை ஈர்க்கும் பொருள் சேர்க்கை உடையதாக இவ்வுரைநடைப் பகுதி அமைந்து  
சிறக்கின்றது.   
அருள் என்பது கடவுள் இயற்கை விளக்கம் அல்லது தயவு. ஜீவகாருண்யம் என்பது  
ஆன்மாக்களின் இயற்கை விளக்கம் அல்லது ஆன்மாக்களின் தயவு. இதனால் ஒருமைக் கரணமாகிய  
சிறிய விளக்கத்தைக் கொண்டு பெரிய விளக்கத்தைப் பெறுதலும் சிறிய தயவைக் கொண்டு  
பெரிய தயவைப் பெறுதலும் போலவென்றாய வேண்டும்(திருவருட்பா உரைநடைப் பகுதி ப. 138)  
என்ற இந்தப் பகுதி ஜீவ காருண்யத்தின் அடிப்படை குறித்து அறிவிக்கின்றது. அதுவே  
இறைவனைச் சென்று சேரவைக்கும் பாதை என்பதையும் இது எடுத்துரைப்பதாக உள்ளது.   
அதுபோல் வாடகை வீடு உவமை, செம்மண் உவமை, தாவரங்களை உண்பது உயிர் கொலையாகுமா  
முதலான பல சுவையான பகுதிகள் இவ்வுரைநடைப் பகுதியில் உண்டு.   
செம்மண் சந்தோஷித்தது, துக்கித்தது என்று சொல்லப் படாது அதுபோல் மனம்  
சந்தோஷித்தது, துக்கித்தது என்று சொல்லப்படாது. செம்மண்ணினால் தேக வாழ்க்கைக்கு  
வீடு கட்டிக் கொள்வது போல மனம் முதலான கரணேந்திரியங்களால் ஜீவவாழ்க்கைக்குக்  
கடவுளால் கட்டிக் கொடுக்கப்பட்ட தேகம் சிறிய வீடாகும். இன்ப துன்பங்களை  
வீட்டிலிருப்பவன் அனுபவிப்பானல்லது வீடு அனுபவிக்க மாட்டாது ( மேலுது ப.101) என்ற  
செய்தி சுவையான தேவையான செய்தியாகும். இந்த அளவிற்குக் கருத்து அழகும், சொல்  
சேர்க்கையும் கொண்டது வள்ளலாரின் உரைநடையாகும்.   
தமிழில் வள்ளல் பெருமானின் திருவருட்பா தந்த பெருமை, இலக்கிய வரலாற்று  
ஆசிரியர்களால் புகழ்ந்து உரைக்கப் படுவது போல தமிழ் உரைநடையைத் தொடங்கி வைத்தவர்  
வள்ளலார் என்ற நிலையில் அவரைக் காட்டுவதும் இன்றியமையாததாகும். வள்ளலார்  
கொள்கைகளை அறிய விரும்புவோர்க்கு எளிய சாதனாமாக ஜீவகாருண்ய ஒழுக்கம் அமைகிறது  
என்பதும் இங்குக் கருதத்தக்கது.

dear Atmavichar sir   
Thankyou very much for lot of information on sri ramalinga vallalar. your  
comparison with Sri Ramana is very beautiful. I think Sri Ramalinga  
vallalar's unique philosophy is intergrated approach that involved feeding  
food, pure melting devotion to Muruga,Shiva and Jyothi & jiva karunyam.   
His Thiruvartupa is unparalleled composition. The Kandha Kottam shrine near  
Madars High Court Parris corner is feast to the true devotees of Lord Muruga.   
He was a true jnani. his beautiful poems on shiva and muruga are very  
inspiring and melting in devotion.   
the current day so called followers of vallalar, not all, some of them have  
twisted everything. They want to look for 'orumaipaadu', 'samathuvam' and  
they simply use his poems as a tool. This I dont like   
even though one can appreciate tamil artisitic beauty in His poems, one should  
not forget that they are predominantly spiritual, devotional and jnana  
oriented where language do not exist.   
In this context, I dont agree on the interpretation on dhegam, yaakai etc.

The following is a piece from Thiruarutpa poem titled சண்முகக் கொம்மி   
 ஆனந்த மான அமுதனடி \- பர   
 மானந்த நாட்டுக் கரசனடி   
 தானந்த மில்லாச் சதுரனடி **- சிவ   
 சண்முகன் நம்குரு சாமியடி.   
I want to know the meaning of the following words அந்தமில்லாச் சதுரனடி? The  
word அந்தமில்லாச் means without any restrictions i.e wide spread extending in  
all directions but then again why does Vallar says சதுரன after using the word  
அந்தமில்லாச்   
Would request Sri Subramanian / Sri Ravi or any other member familiar with  
classical Tamil to throw light on this

Dear Atmavichar and friends,   
some musings on the subject...   
What Subramanian Sir has said is correct, in a general spirit, but how can  
Such a one who is eternal be clever? Chaturam is also commonly understood as a  
smart person. But literally, Chaturam is verily '4'   
In this verse, i understand that **" சதுரன"** to mean the 4th state - _**"  
Turiya"**_   
Only being as the 4th state, being the true nature, can one naturally be a  
Super Clever Person, who knows it all, and only Such a one is truly Smart and  
Clever! And only the _**" Turya"**_ is the Eternal, Endless - **"  
அந்தமில்லாச்-சதுரன"**   
Hope this insight is of some essence!

This song called Shanugar Kommi of Vallalar in the First Thirumurai is  
addressed to Lord Shanmuga ( Muruga ) and this song is similar to the  
KummiPattu in Ramana Stuti Panchakam. Once I find the Unicode version of  
Ramana 's song online, I will copy paste it here so that people can study both  
the songs. Only difference here is that Vallar has given it in 15 verses while  
the Ramana one is given it in 10 verses. But the Ramana stuti Panchakam was  
written by one Sri Satyamangalam Venkataramana Iyer on Bhagavan Ramana. **

Dear atmavichar100,   
Excellent comparison. The Kalai Paattu is a Tiruppalli Ezchucchi, waking the  
every eternal Sri Bhagavan or Muruga and Narayana   
and one can see such verses in Manikkavachagar and Tondarip podi Aazhwar.   
We humans wake up the God or Guru as if He were sleeping! The girls in the  
palaces used to wake up the kings in the   
morning with such songs and dances. In the same strain, the saints and poets  
wake up the God or Guru. It is also similar   
to the Suprabhatam for Gods in Sanskrit.   
Arunachala Siva.

Few Days back I had posted a poem from Saint Ramalingam asking for the  
explanation of a particular line given below :  **எ ட்டோடே இரண்டுசேர்த் தெண்ணவும் அறியீர்   
 எத்துணை கொள்கின்றீர் பித்துல கீரே.  
The words எட்டும் இரண்டும் is a mystical word that occurs in Tamil Scriptures  
and many take the literal meaning of 8,2 and derive only superficial meaning  
for the same. I have found a deeper explanation for the term எட்டும் இரண்டும்  
given below from an online blog : -   
 **எ ட்டும் இரண்டும்**   
http://suthasivam.blogspot.in/2010/10/blog-post_29.html   
 இதில் **8** என்பது அ என்பதை குறிக்கும்.  
அ \- அகராம் என்றால் உயிராகும்**. **2** என்பது தமிழ் எண் வடிவத்தில் ௨ என்பதாகும்.  
௨ \- உகாரம் உடலை குறிக்கும்.**   
" **எ ட்டும் இரண்டும் அறியாத என்னை   
எட்டும் இரண்டும் அறிவித்தான் என்நந்தி   
எட்டும் இரண்டும் அறிவால் அறிந்தபின்   
எட்டும் இரண்டும் இலிங்கமதாகும்"**   
 \- Thirumular's Thirumantiram   
உடலையும் உயிரையும் சேர்க்கும் முறையை அறிவினால் அறிந்தால் உடலும் உயிரும்  
லிங்கம் (சிவம்) ஆகும் என்பது இறவாநிலை ஆகும். உயிர் உடலை பிரியவிட்டால் இறப்பு  
வராது. இறப்பு வரவில்லை என்றால் பிறப்பு வராது.   
 **எ ட்டோடு இரண்டு சேர்த்து எண்ணவும் அறியீர்   
எத்துனை கொள்கில்லீர் பித்துலகீர்.** \- Vallalar in Thiruarutpa   
எட்டோடு இரண்டு சேர்த்து எண்ணினால் என்ன வரும். 10 வரும். நம் உடம்பில் ஒன்பது  
வாசல் உள்ளது இது எல்லாருக்கும் தெரியும். ஆனால் பத்தாவதாக ஒரு வாசல்  
இருக்கிறது. அந்த வாசல் திறந்தால் தான் இறைநிலை விளக்கம் கிடைக்கும்.   
 **எ ட்டு இரண்டும் என்ன என்று மயங்கிய வென்தனக்கே   
எட்டாத நிலையெல்லாம் மெட்டுவித்த குருவே  
இடது மூக்கு வழியாக செல்லும் காற்றுக்கு - இடக்கலை என்றும். வலது மூக்கு வழியாக  
செல்லும் காற்றுக்கு - வடகலை என்றும் சொல்லுவார்கள். மூலாதாரம் என்பது எல்லோரும்  
முதுகு தண்டின் அடிவோரத்தை சொல்லுவார்கள். ஆனால் உடம்பு எடுப்பதற்கு  
மூலகாரணமாகிய உயிர் ஆகிய ஆகாரமே மூலாதாரமாகும். **உ யிர் இருக்கும் இடமே சுழுமுனை  
(உத்திர ஞானசபை).   
**ஆ க எட்டு என்பது புலன்கள் ஐந்தும் ஆகாரம் ஒன்றும் இடகலை  
வடகலை இரண்டும் சேர்ந்த கூட்டுதொகை ஆகும்.** இந்த எட்டும் சேரும் போது சத்தம்(  
நாதம்) உண்டாகும். அந்த சத்தம் சங்கின் ஓசை ஆகும் அதில் பிரணவ ஒலியாகிய ஓம்  
என்று ஒலிக்கும் பின்னர் சத்தம் அடங்கி சத்தம் இல்லாத இடத்தில உகாரத்தில் என்ற  
உடம்பில் ஒடுங்கும். உடம்பு சித்தி பெரும்.   
 தேகம் ஞானமடி\- அகப்பை சித்தர் பாடல். ஞான வடிவம் பெற்றுகொள்ளலாம்.   
 இதனால் தான் சிறு ஒளி கண்டு ஏமாந்து விடாதீர். **அ தற்கு பின்னல் நாதம் ஒலிக்கும் அது அடங்கும் பின்னரே சும்மாஇருக்கும் சுகம் கிடைக்கும்.  
ஆடாதீர் அசையாதீர் வேறொன்றை நாடாதீர்   
பொய் உலகைநம்பாதீர்** என்கிறார் வள்ளலார்   
இது இறைவனாகிய அருட்பெரும்ஜோதி ஆண்டவர் மேல் அசையாத ஆடாத நம்பிக்கையுடன் மாறாத  
அன்புடன் இருந்தால் மட்டுமே விளங்கும்.   
 சும்மா இருந்தால்** சோத்துக்கு நஷ்டம் வரும். சும்மா இருந்தால் தானே சோத்துக்கு நஷ்டம் வரும். அப்போதுதான் சோற்றை மறந்து சுத்ததேகம் அடையலாம். ஆதலால் சும்மாயிருக்கும் வழி அறிந்து சும்மா இருக்க கற்போம்   
பெருமாள் கையில் சங்கு சக்கரம் எதற்கு நாமம் எதற்கு நாமத்தில் நடுகோடு சிவப்பு வர்ணம் ஏன். சிந்தியுங்கள்.**   
சங்கு \- நாதம்.   
சக்கரம் \- ஒளி   
நாமம் \- இடகலை, வடகலை. நடு \- ஆகாரம்(உயிர்) (பொன்னம்பலம்) (செவ்வொளி)  
செஞ்சுடர்.   
 இப்போது இறைநிலையை அடையும் வழியை நம் முன்னோர்கள் காட்டிய குறிபேடுகள் இப்போது விளக்கும்.   
என்றும் அன்புடன்,   
உயிர்.

Dear atmavichar sir,   
Ramalingaswamigal is an unparalleled enlightened master of 19th century.   
Even though he was also a advaita saint he has sung lot of beautiful  
devotional songs on Lord Muruga of Madras Kandha Kottam and Lord Chidambaram  
Shiva.   
His preachings and his whole life was very beautiful charita to be relished by  
one and all.   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharishee liked Ramalingaswamigal very much and quoted his  
thiruvarut pa in some places.   
Ofcourse one knows the Perumal Swami episode of writing few poems from  
Thiruvarutpa and showing to Bhagavan as his own.   
It is blessing to read his great works and a sadhana in itself.

Dear Kskat   
Saint Ramalinga Swamigal was not a pure advaitin and he is basically a  
combination of many things advaita, saiva siddhantha, bhakti, yoga etc. He  
did not confine himself to one specific line of thought and was an  
amalgamation of many things.   
But basically he kept this teachings simple i.e Universal Compassion is the  
key to God and best way to show is feeding the hungry and has written an  
excellent work in Prose called "Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam " i.e Path of  
Compassion that is also available in English Translation on the net freely.   
I was attracted to Saint Ramalingam only after reading that work.   
I could see lot of similarities between Him and Bhagavan Ramana and have  
already shared those similarities here in this forum.   
I found Ramalinga Swamigal's Tamil to be more simple and easily readable than  
Bhagavan's Tamil and since my knowledge of classical Tamil is not good I am  
taking the route of first understanding Ramalinga Swamigal /Subramanya  
Bharatiar poems etc as a base to build up my tamil before I approach Bhagavan  
Ramana's Tamil works.

Dear sir,   
that is nice to hear. you are taking pains to learn lot of works and  
scriptures.   
you know what -- i have a strange taste. whenever I read some tamil poetry,  
I want the meaning half revealed and half portion should be very difficult.  
this way it mesmerizes me.   
though i know good tamil and of high standard, i dont make attempts to read  
out the meaning of any poetic verse.   
somehow i have this notion that the meanings are manifold.   
i will start a separate thread on my approach over this mysitcal tamil.

**Deivamani Malai is a very popular song of Saint Ramalinga Swamigal that he  
sang at Chennai Sri Kandakottam, praising the main deity there Lord  
Subramanya. It is a poem of 30 big verses and I will share 1 verse at a time  
. I very much like this song and though many people have rendered it, I like  
the one rendered by Sirgazhi Govindarajan. The link to the same is given below

I am taking this piece of poem from Thiruvarutpa from Sri Ravi's Thread on  
Thiruppavai. This is a famous piece from Saint Ramalingam's work and my  
question is whether the word **ந ற்றவத்தவர்** has been used by any Saivite  
saints ( like Manickavachagar, Appar, Sundarar, Thirujnana  
Sambandar,Thayumanavar, Arunagirinathr ) etc who came before Saint Ramalingam  
.Also would like to know whether saints and poets like Bhagavan Ramana ,   
Muruganar, Subramanya Bharati, Kannadasan etc who came after Saint Ramalingam  
used it in any of their poems. This word **ந ற்றவத்தவர்** seems very unique  
to me.   
பெற்ற தாய் தனை மக மறந்தாலும்   
பிள்ளையைப் பெரும் தாய் மறந்தாலும்   
உற்ற தேகத்தை உயிர் மறந்தாலும்   
உயிரை மேவிய உடல் மறந்தாலும்   
கற்ற நெஞ்சகம் கலை மறந்தாலும்   
கண்கள் நின்றிமைப்பது மறந்தாலும்   
 **ந ற்றவத்தவர்** உள்ளிருந்தோங்கும்   
நமச்சிவாயத்தை நான் மறவேனே   
Petra thai thanai maga maranthalum   
Pillayaip perum thai maranthalum   
Utra degathai uyir maranthalum   
Uyirai meviya udal maranthalum   
Katra nenjagam kalai maranthalum   
Kangal Nindrimmaipathu maranthalum   
Natravathavar uLLirunthongum   
Namachivaayathai naan maravene   
Even if a child forgets its mother   
Even if the mother forgets the child   
Even if the soul forgets the body   
Even if the body forgets the soul   
Even if the mind forgets whatever is learnt   
Even if the eyes forget to blink   
Never shall I forget ever the divine âNama Shivayaâ   
which blazes from the heart of the Tapaswis(those in lofty penance).

Atmavichar,   
Yes,the word நற்றவத்தவர் figures in a Hymn by Sundarar and is also quoted by  
TGN along with the verse by vaLLalar in his talk in Tiruppavai.This is the  
song that T K Sundaresa Iyer sang before Sri Bhagavan when he first met  
him.Here is that excerpt from the wonderful book 'At the Feet of Bhagavan': IN 1908, when I was 12 years old, Bhagavan was still in Virupaksha Cave. My  
cousin, Krishnamurthy, used to go to Bhagavan every day and sing songs of  
devotion and worship before him. One day I asked him where he went daily. He  
told me: âThe Lord of the Hill Himself is sitting there in human form. Why  
donât you come with me?â I too climbed the hill and found Bhagavan sitting  
on a stone slab, with about ten devotees around him. Each would sing a song.  
Bhagavan turned to me and asked, âWell, wonât you sing a song?â One of  
Sundaramurthyâs songs came to my mind and I sang it. Itâs meaning was: âNo other support I have except Thy Holy Feet. By holding on to them, I  
shall win your grace. Great men sing your praise, Oh Lord. Grant that my  
tongue may repeat Thy Name even when my mind strays.â âYes, that is what  
must be done,â said Bhagavan, and I took it to be his teaching for me. From  
that time on I went to him regularly for several years, never missing a day.   
I will try to dig this song of sundarar and post it.   
Namaskar

Atmavichar/Friends,   
The word  
நற்றவத்தவர்  
is a combination of  
நல்ல+தவத்தவர்**   
The Tamizh sandhi transforms the combination of words nalla +thavaththavar as

Yes, I agree with you Graham. Today you can't believe "anyone and anything",  
ONLY to checked web sites, anti-virus software solutions, etc.   
There are too many fake anti-virus software, so you must wide open your eyes  
when you surf, download or install anything...
