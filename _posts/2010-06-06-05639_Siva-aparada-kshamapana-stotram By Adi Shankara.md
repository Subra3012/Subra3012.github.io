## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 12 And 13  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:53:46 AM

**Verse 12**   
Bhima roop dhari asur sanghare   
Ramachandra ke kaj sanvare   
**Verse 12 Meaning**   
With over-whelming might you destroyed the Asuras (demons) and performed all  
tasks assigned to you by Shri Ram with great skill.   
 **Verse 13**   
Laye Sanjivan Lakhan Jiyaye   
Shri Raghuvir Harashi ur laye   
**Verse 13 Meaning**   
 **You brought Sanjivan (A herb that revives life) and restored Lakshman back  
to life, Shri Raghuvir (Shri Ram) cheerfully embraced you with his heart full  
of joy.**   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 12 tulasidas tells that lord hanuman performs with great skill/zest  
all tasks assigned by Lord Shri Rama.   
God-Guru's grace is much required if we are to progress in this spiritual life  
and to eradicate ignorance in us.   
As known with ramakrishna paramahamsa's grace narendra has become swami  
vivekananda and has revived hinduism and can easily say that he is one of the  
most influential hindu saints in 20th century.   
When he asked his master ramakrishna whether he as seen god,master said in  
return "Is there anyone who has not seen god?" which impressed vivekananda and  
be became a great disciple of bhagavan ramakrishna.   
As guru ramana says,   
As a lion seen in a dream by an elephant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a  
sage, awakens the disciple from the dream of ignorance.The cause of all  
miseries is the impure vasana, the belief that holds the body to be I.   
The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you will only  
receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of the ocean;  
the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is entirely upto  
you.   
In Verse 13 tulasidas describes that Lord Hanuman has brought Sanjivan (A herb  
that revives life) and restored Lakshman back to life which made Lord Rama  
happy.   
Miracles do happen with guru's grace and we have seen many incidents in past  
regarding miracles.   
In Mahabharata war lord krishna saved arjuna and other pandavas manytimes with  
his miracles else pandavas would have lost the war.

1.   
 **Even before I saw the light of this world, my sins from previous births,   
Through which I passed because of desire for the fruits of my deeds;   
Punished me as I lay in my mother's womb.   
There I was boiled in the midst of unclean things.   
Who can describe the pain that afflicts the child in his mother's womb?   
Therefore, O Siva! O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.**   
2.   
In childhood my suffering never came to an end;   
My body was covered with filth and I craved for my mother's breasts.   
Over my body and limbs, I had no control;   
I was pursued by troublesome flies and mosquitoes;   
Day and night I cried with the pain of many an ailment,forgetting Thee, O  
Sankara!   
Therefore, O Siva! O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
3.   
 **In youth the venomous snakes of sound and sight, of taste and touch and  
smell,   
Fastened up my vitals and slew my discrimination;   
I was engrossed in the pleasure of wealth, and sons and a youthful wife;   
Alas! my heart, bereft of the thought of Siva,   
Swelled with arrogance and pride.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.**   
4.   
 **Now, in old age, my senses have lost the power of proper judging and  
acting;   
My body, though still not wholly bereft of life,   
Is weak and senile from many afflictions, from sins and illnesses, and  
bereavements;   
But even now my mind, instead of meditating on Siva,   
Runs after vain desires and hollow delusions.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.**   
5.   
The duties laid down in the Smrti - perilous and abstruse -- are now beyond  
me;   
How can I speak of the Vedic injunctions, for brahmins as means for attaining  
Brahman?   
Never yet have I rightly grasped, through discrimination,   
The meaning of hearing the scriptures from the guru and reasoning on his  
instructions;   
How, then, speak of reflecting on Truth without interruption?   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
6.   
Not even once have I finished my bath before sunrise and brought from the  
Ganga Water to bathe Thy holy image;   
Never, from the deep woods, have I brought the sacred bilwa leaves for Thy  
worship;   
Nor have I gathered full-blown lotuses from the lakes,   
Nor ever arranged the lights and the incenses for worshipping Thee.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
7.   
I have not bathed Thine image with milk and honey, with butter and other  
obalations;   
I have not decked it with fragrant sandal-paste;   
I have not worshipped Thee with golden flowers, with incense, with camphor  
flame and savoury offerings.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
8.   
I have not made rich gifts to the brahmins, cherishing in my heart,O Mahadeva!  
Thy hollowed form.   
I have not made, in the sacred fire, million obalations of butter,   
Repeating the holy mantra given me, by the guru.   
Never have I done penance along the Ganga with japa and study of the Vedas.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
9.   
I have not sat in the lotus-posture, nor have I ever controlled the Prana  
along the sushumna, repeating the syllable Aum;   
Never have I suppressed the turbulent waves of my mind,nor merged the self-  
effulgent Aum,   
In the ever-shining Witness-Consciuisness, whose nature is that of the highest  
Brahman;   
Nor have I, in Samadhi, meditated on Sankara, dwelling in every form as the  
Inner Guide;   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.   
10.   
 **Never, O Siva! have I seen Thee, the Pure the Unattached, the Naked One.   
Beyond the three gunas, free from delusion and darkness, absorbed in  
meditation.   
And ever aware of the true nature of the world;   
Nor, with a longing heart, have I meditated on Thine asupicious and sin-  
destroying form.   
Therefore, O Siva, O Mahadeva! O Sambhu! Forgive me, I pray for my  
transgressions.**   
11.   
 **O Mind, to gain Liberation, concentrate wholly on Siva,**   
Thy sole Reality underlying the worlds, the Giver of good;   
Whose head is illumined by he crescent moon and in whose hair the Ganga is  
hidden.   
Whose fire-darting eyes consumed the god of earthly love;   
whose throat and ears are decked with snakes;   
Whose upper garment is a comely elephant's skin,   
 **Of what avail are all these rituals?**   
12.   
 **O Mind, of what avail are wealth or horses, elephants or a kingdom?   
Of what avail is a son, the wife, a friend, cattle the body and the home?   
Know all these to be transitory, and quickly shun them;   
Worship Siva, as your guru instructs you, for the attaining of Self-  
Knowledge.**   
13\.   
**Day by day, a man comes near to death;   
His youth wears away; the day that is gone never returns;   
Time, the almighty, swallows up everything;   
Transient as the ripples on a stream is the goddess of fortune;   
Fickle as the lightning as life itself.   
O Siva! O Giver of shelter to those that come to Thee for refuge!   
Protect me, who has taken refuge at Thy feet.**   
14.   
I salute the self effulgent Guru of the gods, the Lord of Uma.   
I salute the Cause of the universe;   
I salute the Lord of beasts, adorned with snakes;   
I salute Siva, whose three eyes shine like the sun, the moon and fire.   
I salute the Beloved of Krishna; I salute Sankara, He who bestows boons on His  
devotees and gives them shelter;   
I salute the auspicious Siva.   
15.   
O Siva! white is Thy body, covered with ashes; white gleam They teeth when  
Thou smiles!   
White is the skull Thou holdest in Thy hand; white is Thy trident which  
threatens the wicked!   
White are the rings that hang from Thine ears; white is the bull on which Thou  
ridest!   
White appear Thy matted locks, flecked with the foam of the Ganga!   
White shines the moon on Thy forehead!   
May He, who is all white, all pure, bestow on me the treasures of forgiveness  
for my transgressions!   
16.   
O Siva! forgive all the sins that I have committed,   
With hands or feet, with ears, or eyes, with words or body,with mind or heart;   
Forgive my sins, those past and those that are yet to come.   
Victory unto Siva, the Ocean of Compassions, the Great God,the Abode of  
Blessedness!   
\-- By Swami Nikhilananda, Sri Ramakrishna Math

Shankara wrote this poem for us only. At his tender age he took sansyasa and  
became shiva himself.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. But as Ramanaduli said this sloka and the other one on Devi (Devi  
Kshaparadamana   
Stotram) is all for us only. Sri Sankara's true state of being, is known only  
from   
his Dasa Sloki, where he speaks about him to Govinda Bhagavadpada at the cave   
near Narmada river. When Govinda asked Who are you? ( a la Bhagavan Ramana),   
Sankara answered his state of being. The need of a Guru was only a formality.   
Arunachala Siva.

In south people say we should not bring anything from Shiva's temple. In tamil  
they say SHIVA SOTHTHU KULANASAM. i.e. we should not take away of shiva's  
belonging from the temple. But surprisingly, in each town   
there is a shiva temple covered with 4 roads. It is called Mada veedhi. In  
olden days, kings built the temple and donated the near by lands and built  
rest houses for the devotees to stay during the festivals of temple. It takes  
for 10days also. But slowly, after independence, there is no rest houses.  
People owned the lands and built houses guest houses, schools. The same people  
same people after puting vibudhi on their forehead, they put rest of vibudhi  
in temple only. When I asked they say shiva soththu kulanasam. I consider this  
vibudhi is prasad and to be taken home and give to the old people who cannot  
go to temple.   
For owning everything also we have to ask khama from shiva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are several such misconceptions. The Vibhuti, flowers and   
plantain fruits given by the priest or some distribution of prasad   
given by particular devotees, can be brought home. There is nothing   
wrong about it.   
A similar misconception is the Chandeswara Sannidhi. People clap   
their hands and leave a thread from their clothes. Both are not   
as per scriptures. Chandeswara is not deaf to ask for our clapping.   
Only, the palms must kept together and small taps should be given four times,  
to inform our departure from the temple. He is   
the guardian angel of Siva Temple. Siva's clothes, food and flowers, after His  
wearing, are given only to Chandeswara. Not even His   
sons Ganapati and Skanda are eligible for it. There beautiful Tamil verse on  
this in Periya Puranam. The thread is not given to him. One should show his  
upper cloth to see that he does not steal anything from Siva's temple. That  
is all. In the olden days, they had only dhoti and upper cloth. So this is  
shown. For women this rule is not there.   
Arunachala Siva.

My gratitude for putting up this wonderful piece of transalation on this  
Stotram.   
i have often heard this on tapes and cd but could never fathom the deep  
meanings involved.   
while going thru the same one does see some similarity and nuances of Bhaja  
Govindam too. .   
wonder if i am correct.   
The composition is powerful and i am lucky to have atleast understood  
something today of what the great philosopher expressed with   
clarity and direction   
OM Nama sivayya.
