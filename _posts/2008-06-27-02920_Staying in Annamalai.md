Guru Gita, is a dialogue between Siva and Parvati, highlighting the   
importance of meditation on Guru and the results from such a meditation. The  
book is of 352 verses and there are versions with a difference in   
number of verses. The Divine Life Society of Swami Sivananda, has   
come out with an English version and Sri Ramakrishna Math of   
Chennai has come out with a Tamil version. It is an excellent treatise   
on Advaita. Verse 92 says: "O Dear Parvati, Guru is Siva without   
three eyes. He is Hari with two hands. He is again Brahma without   
four faces." Verse 125 says: " Thus meditating on the Guru, one   
acquires real knowledge. One should then strongly feel, ' By the   
teachings of the Guru, I am liberated.' Arunachala Siva.

## Vichara Mani Mala and Bhagavan

Mahatma Nischaladas wrote the Hindi Vichara Sagara. This was   
translated into Tamil by name Vichara Sagaram by someone later.   
When one Arunachala Mudaliar, told Bhagavan that this Tamil   
version is too difficult to read, Bhagavan wrote a simpler extract   
called Vichara Mani Mala. Since the authorship was originally claimed   
by Arunachala Mudaliar. Since Bhagavan had no interest in authorship,   
He left it at that. The Tamil "Complete Works", upto 1997 edition,   
did not contain this extract. However, it is found in Arthur Osborne's   
2002 edition, in Bhagavan's name. Vichara Mani Mala, contains   
a good dialogue between Guru and disciple, regarding relative truth   
(vyavaharika satya; empirical truth) and personal truth (pratibhasika   
satya) which are experienced in waking state and dream state. (srkudai,   
please see this book). Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
There is one choultry run by Telugu people who are devotees of   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri. This is, I think, called Nayana House.   
It is somewhere on the Tiruvannamalai - Chennai road, but in the   
interior. There is also some lodging accommodation in Sri Seshadri   
Swami Ashram.   
Arunachala Siva.
