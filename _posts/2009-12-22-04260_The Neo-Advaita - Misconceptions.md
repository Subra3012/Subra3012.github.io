## The Neo-Advaita - Misconceptions

The break-down of the traditional family structure in Western   
societies since World War II, has produced two generations of   
love-starved middle class people. The amazing popularity of   
Ammaji, the 'hugging saint' testifies to this sad fact. It is not   
unreasonable that the sens of 'community' provided by a sanga   
explains the appeal of Neo-Advaita, nor its power to transform   
the mind or its teachings of enlightenment. Neo-advaita then,   
is actually a lifestyle dedicated to solving Western problems   
of alienation through providijng social contact, than a arudous   
legitimate sadhana. Neo advaita does not endorse sadhana,   
because the children of the modern age are conditiioned to the idea   
of instant gratification.   
The Neo Advaitic sayijng, 'No method, no path, no guru, no ego   
seems to echo the 'not this, not this' approach found it traditional   
Vedanta. Negate everything and the ever-free Self is realized by   
default! Here the apparent similarity ends.   
Perhaps the best way to approach Neo Advaita is not so much   
by what it teaches as by what it does not. The most obvious   
omission from the standpoint of traditional Vedanta is the notion   
of adhikari, the qualifications necessary for enlightenment. Neo   
Advaita is burdened with a democratic ethos, the idea being that   
anyone fresh off the street, can gain 'instant enlightenment'.   
Traditional Vedanta disagrees, insisting that a seeker should be   
discriminating, dispassionate, calm of mind, and endowed with a   
'burning desire' for liberation along with secondary qualifications   
like devotion,faith, perserverence and so on. In other words, it   
requires a mature adult not under the spell of is or her likes and   
dislikes, with a one-pointed desire to know the Truth. The reason   
for this insistence is the fact that the enlightenment takes place   
in the mind. An unprepared, immature mind, buffeted by the strong   
winds of fear and desire, is incapable of grasping and retaining the   
Knowledge, "I am limitless Awareness and not this body-mind."   
A Neo-Advaitic guru espousing this view would find it difficult   
indeed to find any disciple!   
It is impossible to underestimate the importance of karma yoga   
in the Vedic tradition. Karma Yoga is an attitude that one takes   
with respect to one's actions and the results of one's actions.   
The results of one's actions are not upto the doer, whatever   
result, positive or negative, comes, it should be gladly accepted   
as a 'gift' from God. But Karma Yoga is never taught in the   
Neo-Advaita world not only because it dismisses the idea of doership outright,  
but because the application of karma yoga   
attitude requires enormous patience and dilgience, qualities   
not in evidence in people seeking instant enlightenment.   
(to be continued)   
Arunachala Siva.

Any path might or might not lead you to enlightenment. It is difficult to say  
what would be successful.   
It seems to me that people are not on the path for the reasons they think they  
are. Certain kinds of conditioning will place you on the path, and certain  
kinds will place you off it. Thinking I am on the path for X reason, is  
probably false. .. you will only fully understand why you took the path when  
you reach the end of it and understand all your conditioning.   
The skepticism of the New-Advaita is useful, but clearly it can be used to  
mask no effort - as can anything.

Some years ago I did not know this 'neo-advaita' is a swear word. I thought  
this is just something new and fresh, that Bhagavan breathed new life in  
antient teachings and founded 'neo-advaita'. It were some funny situations  
while speaking to people who hates neo-advaita.
