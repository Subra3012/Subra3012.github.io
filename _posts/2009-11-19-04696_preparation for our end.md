## preparation for our end

Now we all know one day we have to leave our family and our home. In normal  
life when we travel, before the station"s arrival, we collect our things and  
go and stand near the door to get down from the train.   
Even it is the last destination we prepare ourselves. But in our life even  
though death is unknown we never do any preparations. Is it due to fear or  
ignorance? Suppose someone wants to do preparations. Can any one give good  
suggestions.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Death is like a return-ticket but date of travel is not decided   
by us. The date of this open ticket is confirmed only by God.   
So preparations should be life long preparations. Nishkamya   
Karmas, moderate eating, moderate sleeping, not speaking ill   
or good of others, humility, simplicity in our dress and habits,   
and more importantly developing a taste in God or Guru's name   
and doing ardent bhakti and surrender. After some maturity,   
starting self enquiry earnestly. This would enable anyone to   
take the death as it comes, smilingly. Saint Arunagiri Natha   
says: "I am having diseases, penury, little help from others,   
but if you give Jnana Sadasiva devotion, that alone shall save   
me." (Chidambaram Tirupugazh). The song starts as Eluppu   
Thol Narai Nadi kuzhaamidai......   
Arunachala Siva.

God takes care of everything.   
We should leave everthing up to God.

"Death is like sleep and forgetting," says Shakespeare. Everyday we   
are sleeping and are we afraid of death? Because, we are sure, we will   
wake up in the morning. Mostly it happens. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
death is also like a long sleep. As we carry our vasanas and thoughts   
jump out in the morning, in death too, the mind carries the vasanas and   
jump out to take another birth. In the case of Jnanis, who attain Nirvikalpa   
Samadhi, the death is invited with both the hands and it is the door for   
liberation. For a Jnani who is in Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi, like Bhagavan   
Ramana, the death has already been conquered. They just go through the   
motions of daily life and then attain the Videha Kaivalyam, the liberation   
without body.   
There is no use in getting afraid of death. Death comes whether you fear   
or not. It is envitable for any living beings. Only thing, we can do, is to   
quickly get the chiddashuddhi, the purification of mind and do the enquiry   
to be ready at the doorsteps of Liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.
