Verse 303: Divine silence, the fullness of the Self whose lofty nature is the Real,  
consciousness itself, is simply to be   
immersed in love. Other than by knowing consciousness through consciousness  
itself, the life that is the   
experience of love through divine silence, consciousness itself, will not come  
into being.   
Verse 307: The pure and noble nature of the Self can be perceived only through the gaze  
of Him who, abiding as   
'I am that', possesses the eye of grace. (Am kannan; the Fair Eyed One. An  
epithet to describe Siva as   
the bestower of grace. To Muruganar, there is no difference between Siva and  
Ramana). It is quite impossible for anyone to perceive and attain it through  
his own eyes, which are blind, being overspread by the distorting   
cataract (that creates the illusion) of worldly bondage.   
Verse 308: Whatever comes through knowledge gained by study, unless the reality that is  
unalloyed pure consciousness   
shines in one's heart, so that the whirl of deluded desire, the knowledge that  
is caught up in mental imagination, is ended, the non dual state of divine  
silence, the wondrous state of total knowledge,   
will not be attained.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
