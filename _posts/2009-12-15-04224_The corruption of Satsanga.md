## Depression, despair and hopelessness in sadhana  
Author: Graham              Date: December 15, 2009, 01:50:21 AM  
---  
Many devotees get feelings of depression/despair/hopelessness at an apparent  
lack of progress in their sadhana or meditation. They are often overcome by  
the trials and tribulations of life and become despondent.   
This is normal and to assist those who suffer from these problems I will  
relate a few incidents in my own life, to show that there is hope even in the  
darkest of moments.   
\   
I first came across Bhagavan in 1974 or 1975 after reading 'In Days of Great  
Peace' by Mouni Sadhu. This book changed my life completely and I became  
determined to attain Liberation in this lifetime.   
For the first few years I engaged in what can only be described as tepid  
efforts as I sought to understand what exactly it was I was supposed to be  
doing, during which time I purchased every book published in English by the  
ashram. I then decided to intensify my practice to the exclusion of all else,  
apart from that which is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of life.   
After two years of this intense sadhana I had many profound and powerful  
experiences, but none were permanent. Other things happened in my worldly life  
which at the time appeared to be extremely unhelpful, even disastrous. A  
period of despair and depression then followed coupled with intense meditation  
to try and lift it, so intense that I suffered from fits and other  
debilitating ailments. This continued for some time and throughout this  
difficult period I prayed intensely for a solution, but none came.   
Then one morning whilst in the deepest of depressions, I was pleading with  
Bhagavan, asking 'what kind of guru are you, that you desert your devotees and  
leave them helpless?', when suddenly out of the air a voice thundered: "You  
believe the illusion is real" and then became silent.   
Six words that removed the depression in an instant, all doubts dispelled. I  
spent the remainder of that day laughing at my past stupidity.   
This was not the end of sadhana by any means and I continued my practice of  
meditation but with less strain, not wanting to bring about more fits.   
\   
During the next few years my worldly life collapsed completely and I was left  
virtually destitute, to the point of having to go out at night to look for  
money that people might have dropped in the street, so that I could eat.   
After eleven years of this worldly struggle, with no apparent progress in  
meditation, I was again feeling helpless, but remained determined.   
At this time an invitation appeared in the post, to attend a concert in  
Leicester in the UK. I would not normally attend such things, but somehow felt  
drawn towards it. My daughter and her friend also wanted to go. So I borrowed  
a friend's car and set out for the concert in good time.   
Because of a error we arrived one hour later than the published start of the  
concert and feared the worst, but to our surprise the group was also late and  
had not arrived.   
Finally, when all was set, we sat down in the large empty venue and the  
concert began - no-one else came to the concert apart from the daughter of the  
organiser and a small child. The group played and sang a few songs, but the  
flute player was especially entrancing and I was told that he was a substitute  
who had suddenly appeared after the group's regular player had fallen ill just  
before leaving India.   
The concert over, we were all invited to one of the organiser's homes to eat  
before setting off for our destinations. After food we all shook hands, but  
when the flutist took my hand, it was like a powerful electric shock, the  
heart centre vibrated powerfully and opened. I was left in a daze and his  
radiant smile and slight nod of the head conveyed the reassurance that all was  
well and my torment was over.   
I then set off for home. The group who also left at the same time followed  
behind me in their minibus towards the motorway. Still in a daze, I became  
confused about which way to go, at which point the minibus stopped and the  
flutist leaned out of window and said - 'you go that way', pointing in the  
right direction.   
After arriving home safely I discovered that no-one else had any unusual  
experiences there.   
Years later I asked the organisers of the group if they remembered the  
flutist, but they say they cannot remember anything about the concert at all.   
\   
Many of the forum members will know of my work with relation to the  
restoration of Bhagavan's photos. This has been going on in one form or  
another for seventeen years and many devotees have obtained the restored  
versions from the ashram.   
It has been very hard work, often frustrating, requiring reworking countless  
times, because as technology advanced errors became apparent that were  
invisible before. In truth, I was never happy with the results, because badly  
damaged images required far too many changes to be made to remove the  
thousands of scratches.   
Obtaining accurate prints has also been a source of constant frustration and  
disappointment in India. So after fourteen years of problems we decided that  
the only way to get good prints would be to transfer the restored photos to  
negative and use those to produce consistent photographic prints.   
With this view in mind, six months ago I started restoring the photos again  
with fellow devotee Karthik Venkatasubramanian (the photographer) from  
Chennai. But this has proven to be something of a disaster for reasons that  
were beyond us to understand; everything we tried went wrong, including re-  
scanning the negatives and producing new negatives with various service  
providers across the world.   
To overcome the errors with negative production, we decided that the only way  
to do this properly would be to obtain an LVT Image Recorder (the machine that  
creates the negatives) and do the work ourselves, but there is only one of  
these machines in India and enquiries were made as to its availability. We  
also tried different scanning methods and still the results were not  
satisfactory.   
We were totally bemused by it all until a few days ago, when in a moment of  
despair an apparently crazy idea popped into Karthik's head, which forced him  
to try something that normally he would never contemplate.   
This resulted in the successful capturing of images from the original  
negatives by an unusual method, whereby the majority of scratches, fungus  
stains and blemishes on the negatives are almost completely removed without  
any retouching at all, producing sharp and clear images that look as if they  
were taken yesterday. Experimentation with this method continues.   
You can see the results **HERE** \- (I've called it a miracle because that is  
what it is).   
The owner of the LVT in India, also has a very professional instant print set-  
up and Karthik decided to send some of the digital images to him for test  
printing. The results from these are perfect, for the first time in fourteen  
years both photographs of Arunachala and the restored photographs of Bhagavan  
look exactly as they do on the screen. The owner is also considering the  
request for the LVT.   
There is lot more background to this story, most of it private details, but  
suffice to say that a very clear and precise thread can be seen throughout  
this whole sequence of events, that has drawn us inexorably to this point  
where years of problems are solved in a matter of a few days through what  
appeared at first sight to be disaster.   
As a consequence of this, the entire restoration project has to be started all  
over again from scratch and all previous work discarded.   
Do I regret it, no, of course not. We will simply continue, removing any  
residual blemishes that this method cannot remove automatically.   
Doing all of this work repeatedly over so many years, in addition to my  
earlier trials and tribulations, has taught me patience, tolerance and  
fortitude. Furnishing me with the certain knowledge that at the right time,  
everything comes right by God's grace, according to His plan, not ours.   
\   
The only advice I can give is 'never lose hope and never give in to despair in  
your efforts to Realize the Self. Meditate when sattva is predominant and when  
rajas and tamas are predominant, turn to prayer until they pass'.   
Above all else, have faith in God and in yourself and it will all come right  
in the end. Nothing is more certain than that.   
\   
The point of frustration at a lack of progress in meditation remains to be  
clarified.   
Throughout advaitic texts you will find the statement that 'all are already  
Realised' is repeated over and over again. You will also find the  
contradictory statements that 'no effort is required to Realise the Self' and  
'effort is required'. Both statements are true in the right context.   
Repeated and constant effort is required to turn the mind away from the world  
towards its source, the Self. But it cannot Realise the Self because Self is  
already Realised.   
To expect the mind to Realise the Self is like expecting the 'Role' played by  
an actor to Realise the actor, or the illusiory snake to Realise the rope. In  
these cases the actor and the rope are real, the Role the actor plays and  
snake are illusions.   
There are countless projections of ego/mind, but only one Self. The ego/mind  
is an illusion, it is only a thought, it cannot Realise the Self, it can only  
surrender to it and be consumed/negated by it. So all efforts to Realise an  
individual Self will end in frustration and failure, because it is the ego  
which is trying to become Self-realised, which it can never do - it can  
however become ego-realised, followed by a complete descent into tamas.   
Little more can be said on this point; you have to understand it yourself  
through practice and apply it.

Dear Graham   
I don't know if you remember me, but I was a member in this Forum for some  
time and then due to some reasons, I did not strike in chord here in this  
place and I had the urge to move out of this forum as I felt this is not a  
right place for discussions etc... but then still I used to check this forum  
each day several times and read all the articles posted by fellow devotees and  
I took my share of cake where ever I found it in various posts.   
But today, now, as usual I visited the forum to see updates in posts and I saw  
2 posts from you and I don't know why or for what reason, I again felt a  
strong urge within me to become part of this forum. I felt so strongly withing  
me the genuine-ity in your todays posts! some kind of chord struck within me  
and here I am!   
I went through all your struggle by reading couple minutes your posts.  
Sometimes what we believe as pains actually end up being our extreme  
contentment, but we just mistake the process as suffering. I cry in front of  
Sri Ramana Maharshi out of pain of not being able to have been during his  
physical presence. there will be a lot of pain in my heart, unbearable yet it  
is so pleasing, blissful. I want that pain again and again.   
I had decided I am never going to be part of any forums or discussions, but  
here I am without any agenda or with any views and with any intentions to  
posts various threads or to discuss or clarify doubts but simply present!   
I would like to show deep gratitude for your services. I have revolved around  
your room doors (websites) for long hours. you and your team gave me a doorway  
to everything of Sri Ramana Maharshi who is everything to me. Thank you.   
Nagaraj

Yes Nagaraj,   
I remember you and wondered where you had gone.   
Suffering is an intrinsic part of the process of spiritual maturity. Those who  
find the world pleasing do not give it up, so suffering is actually God's  
Grace helping us to turn away from it.   
Suffering is only the mind's refusal to accept the inevitable. If we are  
surrendered to God then there is no suffering, because we accept everything as  
it is.   
This is the most valuable lesson of my 60 years in this world.

## Re:[3]TAT TVAM ASI  Depression, despair and hopelessness in sadhana

Dear Graham,   
 That was a wonderful account.   
Ramana has this approach of "illustrating with example", I guess. We see it  
in Annamalai Swami's account so clearly. Ramana intentionally would ask  
Annamalai Swami to do something against the management decision and then ask  
him not to tell anyone abt it.   
Like the cowshed example. Ramana asked him to build a bigger cowshed and not  
tell Chinnaswami abt it.   
When such a thing is done, there is a conflict situtation... almost designed  
by Ramana with the intention of training the disciple, I guess.   
And then when despite all the hurdles, things happen as per Ramana's  
suggestion, it would increase the disciple's Faith and also make him  
understand that Surrender is the best approach.   
And that's perhaps the way Ramana teaches Self Surrender.   
Self Inquiry & Self Surrender these are the requirements for Liberation!   
When Depression, despair, hopelessness are seen. .. Inquire to whom they are  
and remain as consciousness. This is the best approach. Coz it is direct  
confrontation. Direct disobedience of the suggestion from mind that "this is  
hopeless situation". total disagreement.   
or pray and allow His Will to Prevail. .. thereby releasing oneself from the  
turmoil, there and then. .. this brings immediate peace. but one should be  
cautious not to get identified with the emotions.   
Love!   
Silence.

Dear Graham,   
You said that the heart centre vibrated and opened.   
I have never had this kind of blessed experience.   
Is the Heart centre you mentioned on(or in) the right side of the chest as  
Bhagavan explained?   
Once it opened, it is open permanently?

In Bhagavan's experience, He calls it Nadi-mathanam, where the nerves   
are all churned. You feel that everything is over and you are going to   
become a bag of rotten potatoes. If the sadhana is genuine, this ends   
up in a clear experience of the Absolute. Then you be still and "it is   
the birds that sing." This nerve racking is also called Siva Sakti Natanam,   
the dance of Sakti, before she takes you to Siva. This happens in Aham   
Sphurti. The I thought becomes I consciousness and then I-I. Aham-Aham.   
Arunachala Siva.

The heart-centre is the Self. It is not in the body, the body is an appearance  
in It, however there is a sensation, an appearance of it to the right of the  
chest, but not as you imagine it to be. The experience is without body, yet  
with it. Very hard to describe.   
But like so many experiences, and I have had many, it is just an experience.  
Self-realisation is the end of experiences.   
I will take this opportunity to clarify a profound mistake in publications.  
Bhagavan 'never' told anyone to concentrate on the right side of the chest, on  
the contrary, he told Annamalai Swami that he would never realise the self by  
doing that.   
This mistake was created by a group of influential people in the 1950's here  
in Tiruvannamalai, who were unclear about what Bhagavan meant by concentrate  
on the heart and they decided that he meant concentrate on the right side of  
the chest - completely wrong!   
Simple logic should clarify this - in order to concentrate on the right side  
of the chest there has to be a body as the starting point, the body is a  
projection of the mind which arises from consciousness, body-consciousness is  
the obstacle, so how can the obstacle overcome the obstacle. It is a vicious  
circle.   
The heart centre is both the seat of dark ignorance and the Self - two sides  
of the same coin.

Nagaraj/Silentgreen/Friends,   
I thought of posting it in the Rough Note Book Thread but then decided that i  
will post it here.This is to emphasize that Prayer and devotional  
singing,chanting the Divine name with Faith and Devotion -all these have  
tremendous potency and cannot be overlooked by any devotee however  
advanced.For the simple, childlike soul,nothing more is needed.Whatever has to  
unfold will happen.   
Quote

Yes indeed.This is the Natural Progression or deepening that Sri Bhagavan has  
expounded in the Upadesa saram.Unfortunately it is misinterpreted by some-as  
if those are preparatory or auxiliary,indirect means- involving subject and  
Object and that only self-enquiry is the perfect Nondual approach and so on  
and so forth.I do not subscribe to this later view.I view it as a progressive  
inward turning of the mind,becoming subtler and subtler as it sheds its Gross  
aspect,until the attention is folded back towards the source of the 'i'  
thought,where the 'i' is disassociated from objects-Like what sri Bhagavan has  
mentioned as tracing the scent of the Master.This Scent is known and yet  
unknown!If it is totally unknown,one cannot seek it and find it;if it is  
totally known one need not seek it in the first place!   
coming to what Nagaraj has mentioned in the above quote regarding singing a  
song and continuin enquiry,this is how Sri Ramakrishna explains it,as usual in  
his inimitable way.An excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> "What Brahman is cannot be described. Speech stops there. In the kirtan the  
> singers at first sing: 'My Nitai dances like a mata hati.' As they become  
> more and more ecstatic, they can hardly utter the whole sentence. They sing  
> only: 'Hati! Hati!' As their mood deepens they sing only: 'Ha! Ha!' At last  
> they cannot sing even that; they become completely unconscious."   
> As the Master spoke these words, he himself became transfixed in samadhi. He  
> was standing.   
> Regaining consciousness of the world, he said, "That which is beyond both  
> kshara and akshara cannot be described."   
> The devotees sat in silence.  
Yes,I agree as silentgreen has rightly mentioned that Contemplating on Sri  
Ramakrishna(his life) is just the right thing to do to imbibe the spirit of  
that simple yet potent Prayer.This is the reason why we chant the Hymns of the  
Great ones.It carries the spirit and power of the Great one who composed it.We  
have Lord Jesus 'Lord's Prayer'.The simpler the Prayer,the easier it is for us  
to tune ourselves.   
Namaskar.

Initially when i came across advaita vedanta, my search continued even after  
reading Ramana's works. In time, and also in comparing other teachers to  
Bhagavan, i was drawn back into his teaching. Most others simply do not  
compare. "Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong." This is the best advice i have heard in  
regards to finding a realized teacher.

Dear Adam,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan is the yardstick for measurement of other teachers. I find  
most of them do not even come up to His waist. A few months back, I came  
across an advertisement in news paper.   
"Self Realization in two days. Join immediately." I could not help   
laughing. I am also sympathizing with the people who rush for   
such courses.

Today Satsang Culture is a reflection of what people are. You get the Gurus  
that reflect your inner nature.

Today's Gurus are no doubt Good speakers but there is less Dharma in their own  
day to day life but then again it comes back to people i.e how many people  
live Dharmic life ? Gurus emerge only from those set of people.

You pay to listen to talks on silence

Association of the wise is highly recommended by almost every spiritual source  
I've read. The problem is here in the West where is it to be found?   
I don't know how good an idea it is to attend just anything that calls itself  
"Satsang". And even beyond that I had thought of attending,say, a Greek  
Orthodox mass just to be silent and in the company of more spiritually minded  
people rather than worldly people, but that was unsuccessful on many levels. I  
live near Portland Oregon in the US and it has many MANY eastern spiritual  
groups to choose from, even relatively smaller groups (for here) like Meher  
Baba or Radha Soami, but there is no group for Ramana which strikes me as odd.  
Anyway, I would be curious as to any advice on "keeping the company of the  
wise" in the western world. It is very difficult.

Thank you Latha, but I am in Portland Oregon, so a little far away for a drive  
to Chicago.

Nisargadatta addresses this in I AM THAT, the question and answer format is  
informative and speaks on many levels. If I remember right, He says as long  
as the devotee is earnest, the devotee may find another guru which can be like  
a mile marker who points the way. There are other examples also--devotees not  
earnest enough, moving from one guru to another, etc., to make one blanket  
statement for all seems to be foolhardy, although Reality is One, mankind is  
varied, along with the needs.

I just came back here to mention that I did discover there is one closer to  
me. I had recently done a massive google search looking for places close by  
for possible satsang, but the keywords I used were "satsang", "Hinduism",  
"Advaita" and so on. But once I used the exact term "Chinmaya mission" I found  
there was one (60 miles away, but definitely closer than Chicago!) ;-)   
Anyway, thanks again.
