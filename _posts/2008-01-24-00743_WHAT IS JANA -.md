Dear Hemaharish, if you know Tamil, you are twice blessed.   
Buy Ramana Nool Thirattu (Complete Works of Bhagavan) and   
start with Naan Yaar (Who am I?)

When the self cannot interfere even with the implementation the constitution  
of cycle of deeds and fruits, can it create, rule and destroy this universe?  
These incidents also convey that God other than self can only interfere in  
this cycle and cure the diseases and therefore such God only can be believed  
to be the creator, ruler and destroyer. Therefore, such God can be only  
Brahman and not the self. If you are giving importance to the large quantity  
of the messages and commentaries given by those preachers and if you are not  
worried about these minor incidents, it clear means that you are in the  
majority of school students and you are not in the minority of the research  
students.   
[/quote]   
According to Sri Ramana and advaitin jnanis there IS no universe \- nothing  
created, nothing destroyed. Your 'God' according to Vedanta is only as real as  
this universe - non existent. In stating something is not God, you are  
limiting your own God's omniscience - therefore your God cannot be  
eternal/infinite.   
By your talk and harsh criticism of advaita, you obviously consider yourself  
to be "the minority' of the research students - hahahaha

Hello Sri Datta Swami-ji!   
Please, can You explain who is who.....? Sri Ramana is follower of Sri  
Shankara, who is incarnation of the Lord Shiva, who is incarnation of the Lord  
Datta, who is presently icarnated in Your body, if I have understand You  
properly...!?   
Does it mean that You were present in Sri Shankaras body at that time!?   
With Blessings & Love   
Vijnana

Dear Sankar, Yes. Self enquiry and Atma Samarpana lead   
to self realization. Self realized Jnanis, have surrendered   
their individual soul and have merged into the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

The realisation that our essential nature is self is jnana.As it is already  
existing there is no need to attain it.

Dear Sankar, it is Jnana and not Jana. As Raju said, Jnana is   
ever there, but it will shine only when we remove our 'ajnana'   
that is, non real, objective awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.
