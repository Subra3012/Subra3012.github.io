Dear friends,   
I have read in some places the above words and understand that they have a  
deep significance.   
Would learned members throw some light on the above term and the detailed  
meaning.   
Thanks,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Anand Sundaram,   
I really appreciate your question very much. A good question is such that it  
will invoke the pure Ganges of knowledge. Moreover, it has really become a  
rare aspect even in this forum that we really had a good discussion.   
**_Consciousness is indivisible_** \- This you need to first look into the  
source of this reflection, why and how is consciousness indivisible and by  
referring it as indivisible, what is really meant?   
There can be no better example to refer than that of Arjuna's plight. Please  
read the Chapter 1 carefully and become Arjuna and feel the plight and  
experience the pain and fear of Arjuna, only then will you truly be able to  
digest the essence of the reflection - "  
_Consciousness is indivisible_** "   
Spirituality never works out well for a curious mind, but if the fervor is  
deep and genuine, only then can we really be able to digest the essence of the  
words of Rishis.   
When you see and understand the Arjuna in chapter 1, and relate the same to  
your own self in your world and recognise the invalidity of the various  
experiences that we experience that cause us to experience repeated pains and  
pleasures, sukha and dukha and so on, the dualities, only then Sri Krishna  
appears to you in the form of Jnana and bestows upon you the divine knowledge.   
What Arjuna experienced before the war, or rather when we experience in the  
world, full of pain and pleasures, sukha and dukha, we can say that  
_**Consciousness is divisible**_ a sense of incompleteness, dissatisfaction,  
depression and so on and what Lord Krishna clarifies there upon is that he  
simply clears the misunderstanding, and shows to us that the consciousness is  
indivisible. He says to Arjuna, (to you, to us - Who art fed up of the world  
of samsara _and none other, not for the curious lot_ )   
श्रीभगवानुवाच: कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् ।   
अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥   
śrībhagavānuvāca: kutastvā kaśmalamidaṃ viṣame samupasthitam,   
anāryajuṣṭamasvargyamakīrtikaramarjuna.   
The Blessed Lord said: Whence has come to thee this dejection, this stain and  
darkness of the soul in the hour of difficulty and peril, O Arjuna? This is  
not the way cherished by the Aryan man: this mood came not from heaven nor can  
it lead to heaven, and on earth it is the forfeiting of glory.   
क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते ।   
क्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परंतप ॥   
klaibyaṃ mā sma gamaḥ pārtha naitattvayyupapadyate,   
kṣudraṃ hṛdayadaurbalyaṃ tyaktvottiṣṭha paraṃtapa.   
Fall not from the virility of the fighter and the hero, O Partha! it is not  
fitting in thee. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness and arise, O scourge  
of thine enemy!   
Arjuna goes on to further enhance his argument of feeling depressed, the  
divisible nature of Consciousness but the Lord is not at all impressed and he  
admonishes Arjuna for his so called wise words as though full of wisdom and  
begins to enlighten Arjuna of the indivisible nature of Consciousness.   
What is the indivisible nature of consciousness? Krishna says that the birth  
and death, pleasures and pains of life, are not for you, and you as that real  
Self are untouched! The pains and pleasures, the birth and death, the actions  
of karmas all do not affect the real you. Like body undergoes through various  
stages of childhood, youth-hood, adulthood and old age, you remain unchanged  
all through.   
This is the only message of our Bhagavan's life - that we are that pure  
Consciousness alone that is absolutely indivisible.   
Lord Krishna says: यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुष्ऽअर्षभ ।   
समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥   
yaṃ hi na vyathayantyete puruṣaṃ puruṣ'arṣabha,   
samaduḥkhasukhaṃ dhīraṃ so'mṛtatvāya kalpate.   
The man whom these do not trouble nor pain O lion-hearted among men, the firm  
and wise who is equal in pleasure and suffering, makes himself apt for  
immortality.   
Though, I can go on explaining in detail, it would be only good that you go  
through the Chapter 2 very carefully and revert back when you further get more  
questions. I would like to conclude by presenting the following 2 verses that  
perfectly convey the indivisible nature of Consciousness: नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।   
उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ॥   
nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ,   
ubhayorapi dṛṣṭo'ntastvanayostattvadarśibhiḥ.   
That which really is, cannot go out of existence, just as that which is non-  
existent cannot come into being. The end of this opposition of 'is' and 'is  
not' has been perceived by the seers of essential truths.   
अविनाशि तु तद्विद्धि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ।   
विनाशमव्ययस्यास्य न कश्चित्कर्तुमर्हति ॥   
avināśi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamidaṃ tatam,   
vināśamavyayasyāsya na kaścitkartumarhati.   
Know that to be imperishable by which all this is extended. Who can slay the  
immortal spirit?   
Reflect the divisible nature of the world, this life of ours is very precious,  
we ought to make the best use of it. Please see the divisible nature of the  
world and reflect more and more on it. Below, I present 5 shlokas supposedly  
composed by Adi Shankara: जन्म दुःखं जरा धुःखं जाया दुःखं पुनः पुनः ।   
संसारसागरं दुःखं तस्मात्-जाग्रत जाग्रत ॥   
Janma dukham, jara dukham, jayadukham punah punah   
Samsara sagaram dukham, tasmaj Jagrata, Jagrata.   
Birth is full of pains, old age is full of miseries, woman is again and again  
the source of all miseries and pains. This ocean of samsara is full of grief.  
Therefore, wake up! wake up!   
Life is full of miseries, old age is painful, having a lot of property or  
money is full of sorrow, in fact anything that is available in this world will  
give us only pain or dukham. Therefore, be careful.   
कामः क्रोधश्च लोभश्च देहे तिष्ठन्ति तस्करः ।   
ज्णानरत्नापहाराय तस्मात्-जाग्रत जाग्रत ॥   
Kama krodhascha lobhascha, dehe tishtanthi taskarah   
Jnana ratnapa haaraya, tasmat jagrata, jagrata.   
There lurk thieves in the frame, namely lust, anger and greed to steal the  
jewel of your wisdom. Therefore, wake up! wake up!   
The known, but at the same time, unknown enemies of any human are kama,  
krodha, lobha, moha, mada, matsarya, ahamkara, etc. The moment   
they appear, jnanam just flys away from the system. We need to have   
control over them to lead a life of a Real Human Being. So, be   
careful.   
माता नास्ति पिता नास्ति नास्ति बन्धुः सहोदरः ।   
अर्थं नास्ति ग्रुहं नास्ति तस्मात्-जाग्रत जाग्रत ॥   
Mata naasti pita naasti, naasti bandhuh sahadarah   
artho naasti graham naasti, tasmat jagrata, jagrata.   
You have no mother, no father, no relatives, no brothers, no wealth, no house  
(nothing will remain forever, nothing will follow you after death. Therefore  
wake up! wake up!   
When death strikes, no other person or assets (like name and fame or   
power or wealth or any mundane aspect) goes with us. We have to go   
alone. So, be careful.   
आशया बध्यते लोके कर्मणा बहुचिन्तया ।   
आयुः क्षीणं न जानाति तस्मात्-जाग्रत जाग्रत ॥   
Aashaya baddhate loke, karmane bahu chintaya   
Aayuh ksheenam najanati, tasmat jagrata, jagrata.   
You are bound in this world by desires, actions and manifold anxieties.  
Therefore you do not know that life is slowly decaying and is wasted away.  
Therefore wake up! wake up!   
Desires resulting in thoughts to act in several ways are binding us to this  
world, but we are so deluded that we forgot that in this rat race, our age is  
decreasing. So be careful, be careful.   
संपदः स्वप्न संदेशः, यव्वनं कुसुमोपमं ।   
विद्युत्-चंचलं आयुश्यं, तस्मत् जाग्रत जाग्रत ॥   
Sampadah swapna sandeshah, youvanam kusumopamam   
Vidyut chanchalam aayushyam, tasmat jagrata jagrata.   
Assets are temporary and youth is impermanent. Like light life flashes out out  
in no time. Therefore, wake up! wake up!   
Health and wealth like dreams, wither away like flowers at the sight of  
scorching Sun. Day-by-day, we are nearing to the last days of this body. We  
have to be careful, so that we will not waste this life.

Dear Sadhak, that was a beautiful post on JK. I felt you could post his  
interesting talks in a separate thread if you are inspired to do so. Some of  
his talks are surely very enlightening and immensely beneficial.

Here are a couple of excerpts from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna where the  
master explains the indivisible nature of pure consciousness: 1." _The worldly man 's ego, the 'ignorant ego', the 'unripe ego', is like a  
thick stick. It divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda.  
But the 'servant ego', the 'child ego', the 'ego of Knowledge', is like a line  
on the water. One clearly sees that there is only one expanse of water. the  
dividing line makes it appear that the water has two parts, **but one clearly  
sees that in reality there is only one expanse of water**_.   
2.It was evening and the street was jammed as before with people and vehicles.  
He said: "Let us get out of the carriage. It can go by a back street."  
Proceeding on foot, he found that a betel-leaf seller had opened his stall in  
front of a small room that looked like a hole. One could not possibly enter it  
without bending one's head. The Master said: "How painful it is to be shut in  
such a small space! That is the way of worldly people. And they are happy in  
such a life."   
3." _The Incarnations of God belong to the class of the Isvarakotis. They roam  
about in the open spaces. They are never imprisoned in the world, never  
entangled by it. Their ego is not the 'thick ego' of worldly people. The ego,  
the 'I-consciousness', of worldly people is like four walls and a roof: the  
man inside them cannot see anything outside. The ego of the Incarnations and  
other Isvarakotis is a 'thin ego': through it they have an uninterrupted  
vision of God. Take the case of a man who stands by a wall on both sides of  
which there are meadows stretching to infinity. If there is a hole in the  
wall, through it he can see everything on the other side. If the hole is a big  
one, he can even pass through it. The ego of the Incarnations and other  
Isvarakotis is like the wall with a hole. Though they remain on this side of  
the wall, still they can see the endless meadow on the other side. That is to  
say, though they have a human body, they are always united with God. Again, if  
they will, they can pass through the big hole to the other side and remain in  
samadhi. And if the hole is big enough, they can go through it and come back  
again. That is to say, though established in samadhi, they can again descend  
to the worldly plane._"   
What Sri Ramakrishna has said is the same as what JK had said....with this  
difference that he expresses it in a simple way that one can have an intuitive  
feel of what is said....This is why he is one of the great communicators of  
all times.

I will post a couple of excerpts from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna to bring  
out this aspect-as to how the Master was never satisfied with 'words' but  
wished to give an 'intuitive feel' of what he conveyed: 1.Sri Ramakrishna lay down on a mat and whispered to M.   
MASTER: "Yes, God can be seen. X- has had a vision of God. But don't tell  
anyone about it. Tell me, which do you like better, God with form, or the  
formless Realitv?"   
M: "Sir, nowadays I like to think of God without form. But I am also beginning  
to understand that it is God alone who manifests Himself through different  
forms."   
MASTER: " _Will you take me in a carriage someday to Mati Seal 's garden house  
at Belgharia? When you throw puffed rice into the lake there, the fish come to  
the surface and eat it. Ah! I feel so happy to see them sport in the water.  
That will awaken your spiritual consciousness too. You will feel as if the  
fish of the human soul were playing in the Ocean of Satchidananda. In the same  
manner, I go into an ecstatic mood when I stand in a big meadow. I feel like a  
fish released from a bowl into a lake_."   
.............and this is what happens on another day..................   
2.Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by the devotees, took a carriage to return to  
Dakshineswar. They were going to pass the temple garden of Mati Seal on the  
way. For a long time the Master had been asking M. to take him to the  
reservoir in the garden in order that he might teach him how to meditate on  
the formless God. There were tame fish in the reservoir. Nobody harmed them.  
Visitors threw puffed rice and other bits of food into the water, and the big  
fish came in swarms to eat the food. Fearlessly the fish swam in the water and  
sported there joyously.   
 _Coming to the reservoir, the Master said to M.: "Look at the fish.  
Meditating on the formless God is like swimming joyfully like these fish, in  
the Ocean of Bliss and Consciousness."_   
Indivisible means that the Infinite can never become Finite....It is ever the  
Infinite although it apparently becomes 'Finite' and 'Limited' through the  
'dividing stick of 'I' and 'Mine'....in Reality it is ever the undivided  
infinite.

Sri Ravi, none can explain the Truth as simple as Sri Ramakrishna!!   
What happens as we keep the company of the Master as we read the Gospel is  
that slowly we are made so simple and humble, verily we are stripped slowly  
and surely of all the koshas.   
It is a journey that one has to go through reading the Gospel. It is not  
enough to read some pages in between. We have to live with the Master in  
reading slowly and surely.   
Sime times i feel Gospel could be read as a Bhagawata or Ramayana like a  
Saptaham or 9 days or so. As the great shloka goes on Ramayana: Charitam Raghunaath?asya shatakoti pravistaram   
Ekaikamaksharam pumsaam mahaa paataka nashakam   
?The story of Rama extends to a hundred crore couplets. Every single letter of  
this massive book destroys the biggest sins of those who read it.?

Nagaraj,   
Quote  
> Sometimes i feel Gospel could be read as a Bhagawata or Ramayana like a  
> Saptaham or 9 days or so.  
Undoubtedly.....The Beauty of the Kathamrita is that one can dip anywhere into  
it, even at random and derive the inspiration and benefit.   
In the Gospel,the master says: A holy man had a book. When asked what it contained, he opened it and showed  
that on all the pages were written the words 'Om Rama', and nothing else.   
In a sense,this is true of The Gospel...in all pages it communicates the  
message:'God alone is Real....To love God is the only purpose of Human life'   
Yes,it is indeed excellent sadhana if one can regularly read the complete  
gospel on a regular basis.....in as much as it provides excellent satsangha  
with the master. ...and the contagious influence that it casts on the  
fortunate reader.   
It is also a good idea to contemplate on some of the 'passages' and 'moments'  
from it as 'M' himself used to do- for himself and also for the devotees.   
In every which way one approaches it,it never fails to inspire and guide.Truly  
a treasure trove.   
I have already shared in the Rough-notebook thread as to how the book came to  
be written and its unique charm and appeal for all seekers,irrespective of  
their path....I shall share more of it in the rough-note book thread.   
Namaskar

"It is difficult for people in the world to understand what spiritual life is.  
People cannot be saved, nor can their bad karmas be removed by performing  
special pujas or ceremonies. Good and bad karmas will ripen and bring their  
rewards and punishments. Nobody can cancel or change that. No one can give  
moksha to another. It is for this reason that people have difficulty  
identifying who a Jnani is and who is not. Everybody has to carry his own

a good experience. One can become very quiet and still and think, 'I am  
having a good meditation. If I carry on like this I will surely realise the

ON SPIRITUAL MATURITY BY Saradamma   
Saradamma: People look at Swamy ( Sri Lakshmana Swamy ) and me and think that  
realization must be relatively easy to achieve because we both realized the  
Self in a short time. However, we are exceptions. It is rare for someone to  
have the determination and dispassion that Swamy had during his sadhana, and  
it is equally rare for a devotee to be as God-intoxicated as I was.Complete  
surrender or earnest self-enquiry can only be effectively practiced by  
advanced devotees. Even Ramana Maharshi sometimes said that self-enquiry was  
for ripe souls only. Most people need a long period of purification to get  
their minds pure enough for total surrender or effective self-enquiry.  
Devotees ask for grace to realize the Self, but most devotees are nowhere near  
ready for realization; if they were given a large amount of grace the shock  
would kill them. For most people a preliminary period of mind purification,  
such as can be produced by japa or pranayama will be most useful.

**Does Distance Matter?**   
AFTER the devotee departed, Bhagavan turned towards us and said: ?People  
imagine that the devotees crowding around a Jnani get special favors from him.  
If a guru shows partiality, how can he be a Jnani? Is he so foolish as to be  
flattered by people?s attendance on him and the service they do? Does distance  
matter? The guru is pleased with him only who gives himself up entirely, who  
abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken care of wherever he may be. He  
need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The frog lives by the side of the  
fragrant lotus, but it is the bee who gets the honey.? - Shantammal

அகங்காரத்தை வேரோடு அறுப்பாய்.

(a) Arunachala! Thou dost root out the ego of those who meditate on Thee in  
the heart, Oh Arunachala!   
(b) Arunachala! Thou dost root out the ego of those who dwell on their

Dear Vinod, where ever we may be, its upto us how we live: uddhared atmanatmanam   
natmanam avasadayet   
atmaiva hy atmano bandhur   
atmaiva ripur atmanah   
A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is  
the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.   
Wishing you the best.

Wish you all the best Vinod.   
I found another ibstance by chance.   
 Given below   
As a European Countess was leaving for Europe tonight she requested him to  
bless her and her family. M.: You do not go anywhere away from the  
Presence as you imagine. The Presence is everywhere. The body moves  
from place to place; yet it does not leave the one Presence. So no  
one can be out of sight of the Supreme Presence. Since you identify one  
body with Sri Bhagavan and another body with yourself, you find two  
separate entities and speak of going away from here. Wherever you  
may be, you cannot leave ME. To illustrate it: The pictures move on the  
screen in a cinema show; but does the screen itself move? No. The  
Presence is the screen: you, I, and others are the pictures. The  
individuals may move but not the Self.

Dear Vinod, I don't think it is a foolish idea at all. It is a good way to  
bring Arunachala to mind. I take solace in the following:  _ **Lord Siva said: What cannot be acquired without great pains, the true  
import of Vedanta (Self-Realization) can be attained by anyone who looks at  
this hill from where it is visible, or even mentally thinks of it from afar.   
**_   
_It is taken from Arunachala Mahatmyam (Skanda Purana)_**   
Your mountain in Canada is enabling you to think of Arunachala from afar.   
I think it is a good thing.   
From Paul.

**Does Distance Matter?**   
AFTER the devotee departed, Bhagavan turned towards us and said: ?People  
imagine that the devotees crowding around a Jnani get special favors from him.  
If a guru shows partiality, how can he be a Jnani? Is he so foolish as to be  
flattered by people?s attendance on him and the service they do? Does distance  
matter? The guru is pleased with him only who gives himself up entirely, who  
abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken care of wherever he may be. He  
need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The frog lives by the side of the  
fragrant lotus, but it is the bee who gets the honey.? - Shantammal

vinod   
I have experienced such things...in a totally alien place like Canada we will  
feel very dry and home sick....we will definitely miss arunachala. but that  
is the virago bhavam as described in the Ashtapadhi where Radha and Gopis long  
for Krishna.   
This Viraga bhavam is the supreme state of devotion. it is the nectar of  
devotion which great sages also look forward.   
so we only have to make best use of this situation and increase our devotion  
in this state of separation.
