Verse 8: உறவு பேய்க்கண முண்பது வெண்தலை   
உறைவ தீமம் உடலிலோர் பெண்கொடி   
துறைக ளார்கடல் தோணி புரத்துறை   
இறைவ னார்க்கிவ ளென்கண்டன் பாவதே.   
His relations are groups of ghosts, the vessel from which he eats is white  
skull. The place where he resides is the cremation ground. He has in his  
body a lady who is as tender as a creeper. What did this girl find in the  
Lord who resides in Tōṇipuram, which has a sea where there are many ghats, to  
fall in love with? All the things mentioned are against falling in love with  
the Lord.   
Arunachala Siva.
