## On being serious

It is said that a sadhak should look happy and carefree and that is the real  
sign that he is on the right path and progressing and not deceiving himself.  
If he is tensed, it means he is not either ready for it or else he is on the  
wrong path. My question is: would not all of us be tensed when we first turn  
to spirituality as it is a totally new path compared to the life we had led  
till then? I tend to be very serious and has had major problems with my  
relatives as they felt there is something very wrong with me. At least to hide  
our aspirations from our "near and dear" we should appear normal outside but  
that would be playing a double life.   
Most household sadhaks has this predicament of having their feet in two boats  
- one in the world and one in sadhana. True, as Sri Ramakrishna said, we  
should keep our hands in society and head in God and that all work is to be  
treated as sadhana etc etc, but at least initially would we not need a  
dedicated conducive atmosphere to blossom? Your thoughts are most welcome.   
Mohan

Dear mmohan,   
Yes. Initially it is difficult, because your people say,   
you are mad, you are different. It becomes natural   
after a while. But a Brahma Jnani need not be ever   
serious. Once Sadhana is over, He is once again among   
the poeple, not caring a bit. Initially it is difficult to   
wear a codpiece, people look at you with suspicion.   
Thereafter, they get used to your codpiece, because   
they are happy you are at least wearing a codpiece,   
and not roam around naked. Sadasiva Brahmendra   
went around naked. One Sultan, went behind him and   
cut his hand, because he was walking near the harem.   
Sadasiva picked up the severed hand and fixed it as if it   
was a wrist watch!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear mmohan ji   
Yes we have to hide sometime from people who are not like us. Especially  
people do not pray or go to temple. They say, their work is worship   
But after their work (in late night in IT field) they are not happy. I like to  
ask them if their work does not give them happy, how it can be called a  
worship.   
Sometimes they ask me why I am doing puja? They ask when nothing is  
materialised what is the point of wasting the time. There is no answer to   
these youngesters. I think it is my habit that I am worshiping.

The grinding happens, continues, and then finally, this phase has to vanish. I  
think it is inevitable. Yes it's tough to strike a balance between both. It  
means dispassion has arisen. its a position of neither here nor there.  
Eventually, through discrimination, dispassionate ones will permanently settle  
on the banks of the Self and will remain in Bliss as Blissful one among the  
mad world.   
As long as one is putting effort (False Face) to show a happy face to near and  
dear ones, it means that we have not yet riped, hence we are facing this  
strife. But once we really cross the ocean we will no more require to show a  
happy face, for we are Happiness - Bliss!   
Sri Ramana

Dear Mohan,   
i too am a very serious person. seriousness is associated with gravity.  
gravity is associated with pulling one down. one of my initial issues with  
spirituality was that everyone talked of bliss, a feeling of lightness,  
freedom...whereas i felt very much tied down and far from bliss. ( i still  
feel the same way often)   
this could have something to do with our limitations and how we deal with  
them. if ramakrishna said that let our hands be in this world but our head be  
with god, it is something to be practiced. we have to be a part of this world,  
doing actions, being involved in our duties. at the same time we should be  
able to rise above all this (have our head with god) while performing actions.  
there has to be total involvement and yet non-involvement. seriousness comes  
when we are involved and yet not non-involved. maybe i am not making sense.  
but what i wanted to say is that from consciousness of seriousness we can  
perhaps proceed towards bliss...   
yes, seriously, self enquiry and sadhana is the key.   
love,   
vinita

Dear all, thanks for all your insights. They are a great help. I feel that at  
the beginning stages of our spiritual journey we all tend to be a little bit  
serious,it is good that way, as the path is new and also we have a lot of our  
own mental blocks to overcome. But as we progress, the gravity should lighten,  
like when a airplane takes off, it moves slow at first and then once it zooms  
to the heights it can affort to cruise without much effort. The same way we  
can judge our progress by how much mentally lighter we are becoming and less  
dependant on the circumstances and people around us. As it is said the  
spiritual journey can be likened to train entering a tunnel and coming out  
into the open. The initial period would be full of confusion and fear and more  
darkness than before but if you persist, then we can all come out into the  
light and then the journey would be pleasurable.

Dear mmohan,   
These are four lines of a poem of Alexander Pope.   
A little learning is a dangerous thing,   
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring,   
The initial dozes intoxicate the brain,   
The succeding ones sober us again!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
I respect your views that one will be serious when all thoughts   
cease. But a thoughtless state need not be a serious state.   
There are several Jnanis like Bhagavan Ramana, Sri Chandra-   
sekara Saraswati of Kanchi, and Seshdri Swami, whose   
photographs reveal that they have got a smiling and joyous   
countenance. Bhagavan Ramana's famous Welling Bust   
photograph show that He is quite joyful and is smiling.   
Arunachala Siva.

I don't understand what is being Serious? what is a serious state? If we are  
discussing some state, then its just some state, if its a sate, then its  
nature is only experiencing. why should we want to experience some state? I  
have seen, read people sharing their spiritual experiences and experiences of  
Samadhi, Bliss, etc... they don't realize that its false, its not real,  
whatever we experience is not real.   
That which is beyond experience alone is real. Its all Mind play, Ego playing,  
Mind is still active trying to achieve its agenda of achieving some state,  
samadhi etc...   
There is no Experience at all in "That" ('state' \- I don't want to use this  
word here, but its inevitable for purposes of communication) To experience  
there should be 2, experiencer and experienced. If there is experience then  
there is duality and mind is feeding itself.   
Detach from association with experience. Get back to the source and abide as  
Self. constant practice will relieve one from this. Mistaken Identity.   
This is Thoughtless state. Experience is possible only when the mind is  
operating. If mind is operating its again a mistaken identity. and then one  
experiences various state. Spiritual, Non Spiritual, etc...

Dear Nagaraj,   
I was also thinking about this "experiencer" and the "experienced", for a long  
time. This implies duality --   
was my stand also. We have heard and read that the   
Self is Is. The Self is one without second and the self   
does not move, expereince etc., etc., Once during my   
visit to Tiruvannamalai, I asked about this to one of the   
permament inmates. He immediately asked me to go   
through the Invocatory Verse of Sri Ramana Ashottaram.   
The Ashottaram has got one invocatory verse in Sanskrit   
and two more Sanskrit verses as Benediction. The latter   
two have been made into Tamil by Bhagavan Himself.   
The Invocatory Verse reads: Arunachala hruthspoorthi swarupanugramatmane   
Namo Bhagavate dhrashtre ramanaya nirantharam.   
"Namaskarams to Sri Bhagavan Ramana, who is the Witness   
for everything, in my heart continually, to Him, to who   
is the Effulgence of Arunachala in Heart, as His nature   
and grace.   
Nature and Grace.... Grace is from His compassion. Compassion is the nature  
of the Self. The Self is the natural state of   
Bhagavan Ramana who showers compassion. I think here,   
the compassion/grace is "the experienced." The Self is   
the "experiencer." Both are in Heart. It is also called   
Sannidhi, Presence. People say that Sugar cannot itself   
taste its sweetness. This is the Advaita bala pata. But   
here the Sugar's Presence emits grace. It is like Sun and   
its shining rays.   
There is one name in Ashottaram. Om Sri Rachitala Tandavaya   
Namah. Rachit means movement, dance. How can Achalam,   
non-moving can move or dance? Viswanatha Swami says: Achalam is poornam without anything outside. Its dance   
is the anubhava sphuranam of the poornam. This is   
Swabanubhuti. Viswanatha Swami categorically adds: Here there is no duality of experiencer and experienced.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Very beautiful post, Excellent recollection of Ashtothara Namams, it is so  
full of meaning and ecstasy. Bhagawan Ramana is the pure Consciousness within  
us as our own Conscioussnes, This itself is the Witness of everything. That  
Pure Consciousness alone - Sri Ramana.   
The lesser ego, on realising its own non existence, prays to this pure  
Consciousness - Sri Ramana who is the Effulgence of Arunachala like the Sun in  
the Heart, which is showering its grace.   
Grace is his Nature and Nature is Grace itself. How beautiful. Similarly, we  
can say that the experienced and Experiencer and Experience is all one and the  
same.   
Sugar cannot taste its own sweetness, as it itself is Taste as well! The Grace  
is seen by the ego once it realises its own false state. The Life force, the  
Consciousness is dancing in its own sweetness, taste, its own experience,  
experienced, experience even though there is no movement - no tasting, no  
experience, no experienced - Achalam   
That which is experienced without Experience, That which is sweetening without  
tasting the sweetness, that which is full of Life-Force without   
Life is Arunachala - The Eternal Consciousnes Awareness Witness etc. Movement  
without Movement.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thank you. There is another verse, benedictory. Bhagavan   
Ramana is like what? He is like a large deep ocean of milk.   
All the worldly activities around Him are like little waves on   
the ocean's shore. Aparasatchit sukavari...... He is non-moving,   
deep delving, calm, waveless ocean of milk. Ocean of Sat   
Chit Ananda. Ananda is His nature. Chit, Self Knowledge is   
His Power. He is the One, Sat, without the second. The entire   
world, people running around with all sorts of egoistic problems, challenges,  
doubts, fears, unstable happiness, miseries, anger and hate are like  
waves. Without bothering about the waves,   
if one goes into the ocean, he can dive deep into that Paramananda Sagara.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Arunachala Siva
