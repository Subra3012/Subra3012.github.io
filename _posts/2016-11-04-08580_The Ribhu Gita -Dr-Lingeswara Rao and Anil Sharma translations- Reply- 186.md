Chapter 21: 1\. Ribhu: I shall tell you a great secret which is more confidential than  
the Vedas,   
by listening of which one becomes Brahman oneself.   
2. I am just Being Consciousness- Bliss. All is impregnated with Existence Awareness. By the cognition of That only as Brahman, one becomes Brahman oneself.   
3. I am Brahman. This is Brahman. Plurality is Brahman. There is no doubt about this. Truth is Brahman, ever Brahman. I too am Brahman alone.   
4. The Guru is Brahman. Quality is Brahman. All is the supreme Brahman, that   
I am Brahman. All is the supreme Brahman, that I am.   
5\. The supreme Brahman is to be cognized through the Vedas. Brahman is  
especially   
known through knowledge. The Self is Brahman. I am Brahman. The beginning and  
the end is Brahman. I am He.   
6\. Truth is Brahman, ever Brahman, nothing different; ever the supreme. I  
am Brahman. I am non existent; not bound by egoism.   
7\. I am Brahma. This is non existent. This Self is ever the great. Brahman-  
Self is to be realized though the Vedas. The trivial is like the horns of a  
hare.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
