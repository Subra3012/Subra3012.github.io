## Sri Sankara's Period  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 18, 2009, 03:26:58 PM

There are many views about Sri Sankara's period of avatara in   
this world. Max Mueller has fixed it around 700 AD. But there   
are varying theories. Sri R.K. Math also accepts 700 AD. But   
the Sri Sankara Maths say that he was born about 2400 years   
back, just a century or so, after Buddha. Sri Sankara himself   
gives no clue about his period in his writings. There is no   
mention even about Kaladi, his supposed birth place. He refers   
only Kasi, Sringeri, Kanchipuram, Ujjain and Ayodhya and Mathura   
in his works.   
There was a symposium about Sri Sankara's kala nirnaya. The   
period of Sri Sankara. It was in Palakkad and Nochur Venkataraman   
was asked to preside. An unenviable job indeed. There were   
hot debates. Finally Nochur Venkartaraman had to give his verdict.   
What can he say? He simply said: Sri Sankara was never born!   
He is Guru tattvam. Here was a man who said that there was   
no creation of the world at all, then how cculd he have been born? How could  
he have died or attained salvation? Sri Sankara   
Guru tattvam, is like Sri Ramana Guru tattvam. It is only the   
Presence. He said only one Truth, which is ever present, a total   
consistent theology, beyond time and space. Like Bhagavan Ramana said the  
same thing in 1950 also, what He told to Sivaprakasam Pillai in 1901--02.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Bhagavad Gita and Management  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 18, 2009, 03:33:10 PM

Srimad Bhagavad Gita is used for all sorts of purposes. There   
is a course, Bhagavad Gita and Management, there are courses   
like Bhagavad Gita for Personality Devlopment, Bhagavad Gita   
for living with your wife etc., All are dilutions, missing the real   
purpose. The Gita itself was not anything new. Sri Krishna says   
that it was once told to Ishvaku, Vivaswan and others. The   
Real Gita is Atma Vidya. It is for attaining the Impersonality,   
and not for any development of personality. It is Truth and the   
only truths. You cannot borrow it for explaining untruths.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Consecration of Ascetism  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 19, 2009, 09:03:46 AM

In formal methods, the Guru consecrates the asectism of a disciple.   
There is something called Viraja Homam, where the disciple   
performs his own rituals for his death. This is the death of worldly   
life only. Then the Guru gives a name to the disciple, Swami so and so....  
This is called Diksha Name. Then the Guru gives him,   
in secrecy, a Diksha Mantra. A holy word or phrase to be constantly chanted  
by the disciple even after attaining sannyasa.   
For Ati-varnasrama ascetics like Bhagavan Ramana, there were   
no such things. He had no mantra, excepting the famous Who   
am I? and no name, but for the one given by Kavyakanta Ganapati   
Muni. Bhagavan Ramana embraced asectism on His own accord,   
without any formal rituals. There was no Guru, even though He   
had mentioned Arunachala Himself as His Guru.   
Diksha Name is only naming of the aham-sphurti, the inner-   
completeness. Diksha mantra is only description of this   
inner completeness.   
Rama Tirtha used to say to any one: Rama is the name of your   
Self.   
There are two aspects of a person. Lakshyartam, the goal. This   
is only I AM feeling of any person. But in this world, we give a person, a  
name to specifically identity him. Suppose there is a   
person named Mr. White. If his friend calls: Mr. White, he would   
turn back and see. Here, the White does not mean any colour,   
but the person. But for a Jnani, both are the same. I AM is the   
name. But for worldly purposes, we give names. After the   
maha nirvana of a Jnani, his worldly name and his realization   
become one and the same. He becomes merely a Presence. That   
is why in Advaita and other schools, after internment of the   
Jnani's mortal remains, people keep a Siva Linga or a Tulsi plant   
over the samadhi. No separate identity.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam,   
Did you mean by  
Quote  
He had no mantra, excepting the famous Who   
am I?  
that this was the closest to what one might call a mantra, that is, not a  
mantra in the usual sense?

Dear Chuck Clff,   
Yes. The question Who am I? was the avyakta mantra for   
Bhagavan Ramana. The hidden mantra within. The death   
experience took about 15 minutes. The mantra had been   
answered. He had no other question to ask. He had no other   
mantra to chant in future. He has given the same mantra to   
Sivaprakasam Pillai in 1901, i.e. after about 5 or 6 years.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself had said on many occasions that   
I, I, I is the mantra, which is more potent than the HIndu   
Om.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, we must have differing opinions on what constitutes a  
mantra, since I come from a western background I assume yours should be the  
more correct.   
Still, the english translation of Sadhu Om's "The path of Sri Ramana.." it is  
Pillai who asks the question: Quote  
The first question asked by Sri Sivaprakasam Pillai   
was, Nan yar? (Who am I?), to which Sri Bhagavan   
replied, Arive nan, which means knowledge alone is I,   
Knowledge itself is I or Knowledge indeed is I, the, Tamil   
word arivu being approximately equivalent to the Sanskrit   
word jnana or the English word knowledge.  
(Appendix I page 181)   
This is followed by the second question: Quote  
Sivaprakasam   
Pillai then asked, What is the nature of (this) knowledge?,   
and Sri Bhagavan answered, Arivin swarupam sat-chitanandam   
(The nature of this knowledge is existenceconsciousness-   
bliss).  
 I'm sorry if this seems argumenative, but I don't want to be confused about  
what seems to be the core of Ramana's teaching.   
Love-Being-Aware

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I understand your point. Who am I? appears as a question   
and not as a holy word (mantra). The reply is: After negating   
everything, what remains as Real, which is Knowledge, which   
is in the form of Sat-Chit-Ananda, Existence-Knowledge and Bliss.   
Now people may ask that it is a question, which does not have   
any positive answer but only removal of all negative replies.   
Yes. It is true. But this question leads to the Real, the One   
without a second and that is the goal.   
Normally a mantra or a holy word, like Siva, Siva or Rama, Rama   
is constantly repeated to get into the goal. But here, the question   
or the holy word is asked a few times or many times, depending   
upon the maturity of the seeker. The answer which is the goal,   
is Real.   
In the case of Siva, Siva or Rama, Rama, the mantra is repeated   
even after the goal is reached. Sri Tyagraja, a musician and a   
great devotee of Sri Rama, is said to have repeated the mantra   
a hundred million times in his life time. But here, the mantra   
is stopped once the goal is reached.   
I believe that I have made the point somewhat clearer. I am not sure.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said that Who am I? is not a mantra, in the  
ordinary sense of the words.   
Arunachala Siva.
