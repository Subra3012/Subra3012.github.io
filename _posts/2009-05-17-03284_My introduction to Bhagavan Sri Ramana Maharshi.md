## My introduction to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi

I want to tell you people about my introduction to Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi in other words his great introduction to me (God is with us and God  
is within us)   
Firstly, I apologize to the forum members if this hurts in some way or the  
other   
When I was 17 or 18 yrs i saw photos of a old man, my mother's younger sister  
used to show me the Tamil weekly magazine in which the photos appear, tell me  
to take his darshan and say he is the great Ramana Maharshi, but my thoughts  
were not so focused.   
Around 23 yrs till then i have not heard of the Arunachala, we had decided to  
visit the temple, just a week or say few days before the planned trip, I was  
traveling in a bus suddenly the bus stopped due to heavy traffic jam. I just  
turned my head looking outside the window of the bus, i saw the road in which  
our bus was traveling had a road sign with a name.   
The name read 'Ramana Maharshi Road'   
At that moment i taught this must be some Jain saint name and shown angry on  
it.   
Now at 26, its all history.   
thanks   
Arunachala Ramana

Dear karthikeyan.M,   
I am happy to see your introduction to Bhagavan Ramana.   
It happens in different ways to different people. I was   
given a book Talks (in Tamil, it is called Bhagavad Vachanmurtham) by Sri A.R.  
Natarajan when I went to his   
office/bookshop on seeing the board while returning from   
the office. He was a great person, a total devotee of Bhagavan   
and he readily gave me this book. Then I used to see him   
once in 15 days and he gave me almost 20 books on Bhagavan   
Ramana. I attended his seminar in March every year, where   
special speakers discourse on Bhagavan. Then came my first   
visit to Tiruvannamalai.   
Saint Tayumanavar says: "Like catching a deer, with a deer"   
Hunters keep a deer tied to a post and another deer comes to   
see it. The second deer is also caught. Like this Bhagavan   
gives His name, His photgraph or His book and nets people.   
Arunachala Siva.
