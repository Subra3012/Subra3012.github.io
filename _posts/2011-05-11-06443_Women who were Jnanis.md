Dear Jyoti,   
There were. Avvaiyar, Karaikal Amma, Mangaiyarkarasi the Pandyan   
Queen mentioned in Periya Puranam, Chudalai of Yoga Vasishtam, Meera Bai of  
Bhakta Vijayam - are a few examples that come to me.   
You can include Sharadamma in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jyoti,   
You may include in the list the following persons also: 1\. Punitavathi - the spinster sister of Tirunavukkarasar, in Periya   
Puranam.   
2\. Akka Mahadevi, the 17th century saint poetess, who lived in   
Northern Karnataka and meditating on Siva, she attained Jnanam   
She was also a spinster and is said to have attained maha nirvanam   
at the age of 30.   
3\. I remember one from Bengal. I do not know her name readily.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Mr. Subramanian,   
Thank you very much for the names you gave.   
Quote  
> 3\. I remember one from Bengal. I do not know her name readily.  
Could this be Sri Anandamayi Ma?

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
I think it is not Punithavathi. Punithavathi is Karaikkal ammaiyar. And  
Thrunavukkarasar's sister is Thilagavathi. Am I right?   
Dear Joti ji,   
There are many women saints.   
Avudai akka is a brahma jnani who lived in southern India.   
Mother Sharadhamoni wife of Sri Ramakrishna   
Mother Pondichery Mira   
Sakku bai,   
Jnana bai both were from Maharashra   
Jnaneswar's sister Mukta bai from Maharashra   
Aandal from south India

Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes. You are correct. She is Tilakavati and not Punitavati. Punitavati   
is Karaikkal Amma.

I've always had a crush on the 14th century Kashmir saint, Lalla, from the  
first time I heard of her   
http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/L/Lalla/index.htm   
Here is one her poems in Coleman Barks translation: Quote  
> I searched for my Self   
> until I grew weary,   
>   
> but no one, I know now,   
> reaches the hidden knowledge   
> by means of effort.   
>   
> Then, absorbed in Thou art This,   
> I found the place of Wine.   
>   
> There all the jars are filled,   
> but no one is left to drink.   
>

Dear sirs,   
There are many women saints. Very few are recoganized through their poems.  
Few were just lived in silence and left this world. There was a muslim saint   
"Ma Hazrat Babajan who was intiated the famous Mehar Baba. Here samadhi is in  
Pune.   
She never wrote any poems, so many do not know about her. In this way there  
are many.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I have not heard about that Kashmiri Saint.   
Dear Ramanaduli,   
I have heard about that Ma Harzat in some stories.   
As you say, there could be many more, and since many of them   
lived in silence, we do not come to know about them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs,   
The true realised people never come and say that I got it. Like Bhagavan. They  
are known by others who come accross them. There are some people who do not  
know anything about self, realisation but they keep on doing their work  
without any expectation. I have seen them in villages, their life was so  
simple, whatever they faced in their life, they used to say 'ELLAM AVAN  
SAYAL". They never tried to achieve for better comfort life. In recent times  
only, every one talks, about spiritualism, this path that path, Let it go,  
self realisation and karma theory. It looks whole society focus into  
spiritualism. At the same time, it is difficult who got realisation.

Dear Subramaniam R.,   
I first heard of her in a collection of poems I saw many years ago called  
"Speaking of Shiva" that had some material attributed to her. I've read that  
she is one of the few things that Muslim and Hindu can agree on in the  
Kashmir. I found a link to 9th century Vaishnava saint, Andal (Antal)  
http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/alvars/andal/ which I don't think has been  
mentioned in this thread.   
Of course, one can discuss whether this one or that one is really jnani. - a  
fruitless pursuit   
Poems, songs and tidbits of stories about their lives are like crumbs fallen  
from the table, giving us a taste of the Reality they knew/know, whetting our  
appetite for more.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I am happy you have heard and read about Akka Mahadevi [she   
sang in Kannada language and she is mentioned in Speaking of   
Siva, by A.K. Ramanujan, former Professor of Chicago University]   
and Andal.   
Andal is considered an avatara [re-incarnation] of Bhooma Devi,   
the Mother Earth, who is one of the two wives of Vishnu. Hence   
she is not considered a Jnani in the normal parlance. She has written about  
140 poems and she merged with Vishnu in Sri   
Rangam Temple in Tamizh Nadu. Her foster father was Vishnu   
Siddhar, who was also one of the twelve great Saints of Sri   
Vaishnava lineage.   
Arunachala Siva.
