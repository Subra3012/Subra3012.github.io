Dear DRPVSSN Raju, When one 'looks' outside, one dreams.   
The dreams are: The world (Jagat), the individual soul (Jiva),   
and the personal god (Isvara), are all dreams. Bhagavan says: "What is Real is Atma-Swarupa. Jagat,Jeeva and Isvara are   
imaginations." (Who am I? - 1902). When one 'looks' inside,   
one is Real, the Brahman.   
Arunachala Siva.
