## Sincerity

I have been thinking about sincerity recently. It feels like if you are  
sincere then you are a holy person, and that most people just do not stop to  
think about their lives and are living unsincerely. Being holy is not about  
any particular beliefs or practices, it is just a question of sincerity.   
I feel like a lot of things happening in the world and around me are not  
sincere. .. but inside I always felt sincere.

Dear rideforever,   
I shall put it as "Sincerity with a purpose". The purpose here   
is only a purpose towards Truth. Then such a sincerity really   
takes one to the Goal.   
Arunachala Siva.
