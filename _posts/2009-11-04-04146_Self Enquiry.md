## Self Enquiry  
Author: viswanathan         Date: November 04, 2009, 01:39:31 AM  
---  
I am a devotee of Bhagavan Ramana and i am practicing self enquiry for many  
years.In my sadhana,.I had certain doubts and I referred my doubts to  
Mr.David Godman who was kind enough to clarify my doubts..I thought of  
sharing my experience as under with the members of this forum.   
 1.In the practice self enquiry, whenever self attention is disrupted by the  
appearance of a thought, Bhagavan has suggested the devotees to question to  
whom the thought appears and the answer will be to 'me' or 'I'. Then, he wants  
us to watch who is this 'me' or 'I' or where from the 'I' comes and then  
the thought will disappear due to the mind merging in its source.After many  
years of practice by me as suggested by Bhagavan, nowadays I find that this  
process of questioning mentally involves some effort on my part and is  
straining me and instead I find it easier to straight away go back to  
awareness of 'I', bypassing the method given by Bhagavan. I wanted Mr.David  
Godman's views on this and his reply is given in italics.   
 _The important thing is to revert to the awareness of 'I'. If you can do this  
by bypassing the verbalisation process that Bhagavan often recommends, then  
this is fine. The important thing is holding on to the 'I', not the process by  
which that self-attention is accomplished.   
_   
2.When i turn my attention in wards,some times I have sudden urge to have a  
deep breath and then I take adeep breath and continue my sadhna..I wanted  
Mr.David Godman's views on this and his answer is as follows (given in  
italics).   
 _I think this is a common phenomenon. It occasionally happens to me, and I  
know it happens to other people. The mind and the breath are connected,  
according to Bhagavan. When the mind is slowed, the breath often becomes  
shallower as well. However, while one can exist without few or no thoughts,  
one cannot exist without breathing, so occasionally one has to take a deep  
breath to make up the oxygen deficit.   
_   
I hope above information will be of use to sadhakas practicing self enquiry.   
Best regards   
A.Viswanathan

Dear viswanathan,   
Thanks for sharing these information in the forum. It helps to know many  
people's views.   
With respect to the first point mentioned by you I would also like to add what  
Bhagavan has said in answer to the very first question on how to do self-  
enquiry:  _Therefore, making the corpse body remain as a corpse, and not even uttering  
the word "I", one should enquire keenly thus: "Now, what is it that rises as  
"I"?_   
So Bhagavan refers to here as: _not even uttering the word "I"_.   
Thus verbalization is not required for self-enquiry.   
It may be due to some questioner's request to explain the process in more  
step-by-step manner that verbalization has also been accomodated.

Thanks a lot for passing on the expert comments of David Godman.I am also  
reaching the source without verbalisation.Simultaneously, I also hear the  
whistle sound-Pranava Oli. In my earlier years of practice, when I felt my  
body very light, a fear used to grip me, as if I am going to collapse. All  
that ceased. Now, if I do the self enquiry for half an hour in a day- a  
happiness in the form of "I don't care a damn " persists and that day passes  
very pleasantly without stress in office or elsewhere.That much is my  
progress.I want to see light within-aham sphurana.   
In fact I asked Sri Annamalai Swami during his lifetime, when I will be able  
to perceive Atma in the form of Light. He said that Sun rises when it is not  
pitch dark like midnight,but in the twilight of morning.Similarly when Papa  
and Punya balances, one will be ready for the dawn of Self in its radiance.  
This simple explanation from the Sage,was very convincing.   
We have to keep on practising more and more till it becomes natural and 24  
hours routine affair.Defenitly, we will derive the benefits. After all it is  
the Path and Goal

Dear viswantahan,   
Thanks for the helpful comments/solutions of David Godman for your  
difficulties in Self enquiry. The posts of arcsekar and   
silentgreen are also quite useful. In my case, two things were   
predominant. The first is the fear, the fear of losing the ego   
or the mind. The second is the question 'For whom is this thought?' I  
decided on my own, to come to one silent chanting   
to replace my jungle of thoughts. Arunachala Siva. This helped   
me quite well. Bhagavan Ramana has also said that one good   
or divine thought would help to ward off other thoughts. This   
happened in my case. Thank you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
As desired by you, I write about my meeting with Annamalai Swamigal. I came  
across the book Living by the words of Bhagavan by David Godman which is a  
biography on Swamigal. I was excited to read an interesting incident in that  
book about consturction of Mathrubutheswar temple in the campus of Sri  
Ramanashram. Utsava murthy-a bronze idol of Yogambika was to be made for that  
temple. Inspite of long hours of heating,the blacksmith could not melt the  
metal to cast the idol. At last Bhagavan's help was sought.He came and gazed  
over the crucibles in which the metals was heated. Lo, the metal melted like  
wax, soon it was cast in the mould and a beautiful idol was formed.   
In my meeting with Swamigal, I mentioned about the book and the above  
incident narrated therein.Swamigal, in his own words, narrated the episode  
which I quote herunder.   
We used big bellows to blast heat and melt the metal. The radiation was so  
oppressive. We found it difficult to go near the work spot. Even with so much  
heat generated, the metal remained solid and did not melt. Auspicioius time-  
Muhurtham fixed for making out the idol was running out and Sarvadhikari-  
Chinnaswami was shouting at us. In such a helpless situation, we requested  
Bhagavan to intervene. He reluctantly came with us and cast his powerful  
glance over it. What we could not succeed with great efforts, Bhagavan finshed  
with just a glance.   
I was thrilled to hear the full anectode, straight from the horse's mouth. I  
touched the holy feet of Swamigal,overcoming the general restriction/rule, to  
which Swamigal did not object. In fact in the book it is mentioned that  
Swamigal touched the holy feet of Maha Periyaval of Kanchi Mutt,much to the  
objection of attenders surrounding him. But, Maha Periyaval pacified " Doesn't  
matter. After all he is a Brahmachari-bachelor". I took a cue from this and  
picked up courage to indulge in similar gesture.   
Later on some other occasion, Swamigal gave me a picture of him. Ilayaraja,  
the Music Director, printed pictures of Swamigal and that was being  
distributed to visitors. I was also fortunate to get one which is now adoring  
my Pooja Shelf.

Dear arcsekar,   
Nice anecdote. Kanchi Sri Chandrasekara Saraswati directed   
Annamalai Swami to Bhagavan Ramana. He has done this in   
the case of Paul Brunton also. Many were devotees of Kanchi   
Sri Chandrasekara Saraswati and Bhagavan Ramana, simultaneously. There were  
no conflicts. T.R. Kanakammal was   
one such person. While Bhagavan Ramana was the champion   
of Jnana, Chandrasekara was the champion of Dharma. (to   
quote David Godman).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arcsekar,   
 That is a nice episode.   
Can you please tell me more about Annamalai Swami?   
how he moved, how he talked, his style. .. any specific suggestions he gave   
did he tell more about Ramana ?   
Did you feel the peace that Ramana devotees felt when they sat with Ramana ?  
Did you feel that silence and peace ?   
Love!   
Silence

Thank you viswanathan. I pursue the enquiry of tracing the origin of thought  
(Where is the origin of thought?). When thoughts arise I turn my attention to  
the source from which they arise. I also find verbalisation not useful.  
After withdrawal of thoughts I feel a slight tension which I relax and remain  
like thin air. But this continues only for a few seconds. _Vasanas_ pull me  
out.

To overcome the tension, you chant one of the mantras mentioned   
by Bhagavan Ramana, Siva, Siva, or Arunachala Siva or Rama,   
Rama. I try this method.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear S Subramanian,   
 By the time you recognized the presence of the thought. .. the thought is already gone! the only entity you are perhaps able to "Catch" is the "I-thought", which creates a sense of "apparent" continuity & elongates thoughts!   
Love!
