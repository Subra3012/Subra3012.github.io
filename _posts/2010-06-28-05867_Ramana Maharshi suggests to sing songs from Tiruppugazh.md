SHRI BHAGAVANS GRACE By Gouriammal   
One instance of his grace to his devotees is his recommendation of two songs  
from Tiruppugazh to help them get their daughters married. The devotees of  
Bhagavan believed firmly that it was enough to sing the two songs from  
Tiruppugazh before Bhagavan to have the marriage arranged in the best way  
possible. There is another song in Tiruppugazh in which God is invited to come  
to the house as a newborn child. When anyone approached Bhagavan praying for a  
child he would tell them to sing that song.

This Tiruppugazh song recommended by Bhagavan Ramana to Gauriamamal is quite  
famous. This was earnestly sung by some   
devotees who had difficulties in getting their daughters married,   
and in some cases, even the would-be-brides themselves took it   
up in all faith and sang these songs.   
One such song is given in full by Sri Devaraja Mudaliar in his book,   
"Thaayum neeye, thanthaiyum neeye" [You are the Mother and You   
are the Father.]   
The song reads as under: On the peacock that resembles,   
the blueness of the rain clouds,   
I saw your coming and I seek You,   
I, this poor me, am mad with love for You,   
Please give me your bridal garland and grace me!   
O the Courageous, who shot the Javelin on the Krouncha hill,   
The very god of death to the demons, are You!   
You are the purport of all the four Vedas.   
"I -I" \- you beat your chest to devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.
