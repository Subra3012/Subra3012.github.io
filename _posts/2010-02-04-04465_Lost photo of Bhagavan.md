## Re:[1] Who am I - an enquiry by a Saint  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: February 04, 2010, 08:41:14 PM

I began the meditation with mental prostrations to Swami Vidyananda, Swami  
Suryananda, Swami Sivananda, Swami Yogeshwarananda, Ramana Maharshi,  
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vyasa Maharshi, Hanumanji and Bhagawan Rama. Then I  
plunged into the profound thought that Energy is God. The thought process went  
as follows: Everything is Energy. This body is energy. We get energy on this  
earth from sun. Only a fraction of Suns energy reaches the earth, the rest is  
reflected back or absorbed by the atmospheric belts, stratosphere, ionosphere  
etc. A fraction falls on green plants and get converted into matter as  
carbohydrates, according to the reaction: 6CO2+6H2O hv C6H12O6+6O2   
According to this reaction, six molecules of Carbondioxide (CO2) from air  
combine with six molecules of water(H2O) in green plants in the presence of  
sun light (hv) to produce one molecule of Carbohydrate (C6H12O6) and six  
molecules of Oxygen (O2). The process is known as Photosynthesis.   
Conversely, matter can be converted back to energy according to mass-energy  
equation: E=mC2   
Where E is energy in ergs, m is mass in grams and C is the velocity of light  
in centimetres per second.   
Thus Brahma, symboled as Om manifesting as energy in the form of photon,  
identifies with object and takes birh in matter. This is how the samsara  
(material world) began. Then after many evolutionary transformations the same  
photon of energy has come to human stage.   
This body of mine is only a condensed form of energy. All the solid matter is  
energy, so is all the liquid, including the vast expanse of water in the ocean  
and also the gaseous matter. Liquid and gases are less condensed than solids.  
They are all energy, only appearing in different forms, sizes, shapes and  
colours to sense organs. Actually the sense organs are creating this  
confusion, in reality there is absolutely no difference between different  
objects. They are all Brahma. This body of mine, vayu, agni, apa and Prithvi,  
is indeed energy, that is Brahma.   
This body made up of inert, complex, chemical substances, which in reality is  
a form or mere energy, cannot be the consciousness I. Because in sleep and  
in swoon it loses awareness, an in death loses consciousness and becomes  
lifeless eternally and reverts back to nature in the form or ether, air, fire,  
water and earth (the pancha Bhootas). The consciousness I must be different  
from the aggregate of organic matter. So I cannot be the body. Then who am  
I? What entity is meant by the term I and who is it that has the feelings  
and possessiveness f the body and asserts I, I always? I must know the  
I, who dwells in the insentient body and is beset with feelings. The  
physical world being formless energy in reality, its physical appearances is  
nothing but an illusion created by sense organs.   
As I got deeply engrossed in the thought, unaware of anything external, I  
becoming the pure thought, just the thought and nothing else, I was confronted  
with the most formidable question, for the first time in my life.   
The question was: Who is this I?   
No, I had no answer, nor could I grasp. I reflected on what Swami Vidyananda  
had said earlier in the day. I know, I am not doing this, I am not talking,  
the body is doing it. The body is going on like a tape recorder, I dont  
think, it just goes on by itself.   
I continued my cogitation; who was the I that the sage meant? So there must  
be an I which is different from the body. Who is that I?   
I had no answer, but had the question in my grapple firmly. I would not let it  
go until I had the answer. I went deeper still and another round of  
recollection, and reflection f the two above equations, in more detail.   
The whole body is energy. There is nothing but energy in the Universe.  
Everything is Brahma, nothing but Brahma, then who is this individual I?   
Still no answer in sight. There was only one thought, just the thought alone,  
unaware of the body and everything else.   
Who is this I? I went several rounds, back and forth: Everything is Energy,  
everything is Brahma, then who is this I?   
The I which was so obviously perspicuous, which never needed even a moments  
thought to know till now, appeared illusively enigmatic, the most concealed  
and perplexing secret. A thing which was so far clearly the knower and the  
subject, now suddenly turned an unknown object to be known, and the most  
difficult one. I was fully engrossed with this single thought, with so deep a  
concentration that I never knew before, for quite some time.   
Then in one spark, the answer flashed. I is: SHOONYA   
I is nothing, it is naught, a cipher. A non-entity. It does not exist. I  
is a mere non existent ego. It has no existence, no place on earth.   
That was it.   
I was still in the unfathomable depths of my thought without of course the old  
I. Everything was clear. Earlier Swami Vidyananda had said: there is nothing. ....... there is nothing. It is a wonder to find that there  
is nothing. Buddha had found that everything was shoonya. One must give up I  
and mine to realise it.... Everything is Brahma. ... there is only Energy  
.....   
These statements, unintelligible mere words till now, became perfectly clear.  
Waking state is indeed a dream.   
Again the question came: who is this I?   
The answer flashed instantly: there is no I. Out of ignorance you thought  
I, because you were dreaming. Now the dream is over. You have woken up from  
the dream, so now there is no I.   
The body was in perfect padmasana eyes closed, totally unaware of the body,  
the breathing and the world around; not sleeping or dreaming, but fully aware,  
within deep Samadhi.   
It was peaceful. Then out of the calm, in that abysmal Samadhi, a vision of  
thick jungle appeared, and in it a ferocious tiger, advancing closer to me.   
No, there is no tiger there, I only thought it was tiger, out of ignorance.  
That which appears as a tiger is but an image. It was I who erroneously  
thought it real.   
Sure enough, as the real tiger approached closer, it turned into an empty  
colourful skin, hollow inside, which instantly evaporated to nothingness.   
Again the question popped up: What was this I who thought the tiger real?   
No, this I also has no reality, it too has evaporated to nothingness as did  
the tiger. There is nothing at all anywhere, only Brahma everywhere.   
It is so simple.   
Yes, indeed, it is so simple.   
Why, then did Istruggle so hard?   
Because I was dreaming, I took dream to be real.   
Who is this I again?   
There is n I, there is nothing at all.   
Yes it is an error. It is doubly clear now.   
But it is s easy, so simple. Anybody can realise this much, it is not  
difficult at all.   
Yes, very much so.   
This is joy. This is bliss the real happiness. I should get up from  
meditation and jump in delight and dance in ecstasy and sing the glory of the  
Lord.   
Who is this I again that wants to jump and dance in ecstasy?   
Yes, of course, I is shoonya.So there is nothing to jump and dance.   
The Sages words flashed One has to continuously dwell in Brahma, only then  
the I will dissolve. Till then you have to continue your sadhana. Attainment  
is not complete until you reach that state of Sahaja Samadhi.   
I is cipher. Then how can I say  aham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman)?   
No. You cannot. You said that while you were dreaming. At that time I  
existed. It did not know its non-entity-ness then. Now there is no aham, no I.  
So there remains only the Brahma. Just remember that. And also remember that  
the waking is a dream.   
Yes, it is clear now.   
The bell rang at the end of ninety minute meditation, the Samadhi abated, the  
awareness of surroundings crept in, and I came out a changed, altogether  
different person, with the old I annihilated, and may be baby born n a new  
horizon.   
Shoonya or nothingness should not be construed as absolute nothing. Only the  
I, the ego is shoonya or cypher, not the consciousness. If the ego in me is  
false, all other individual egos in other beings are also false. This means  
that all names and forms (nama, roopa) are false, which in turn means that the  
manifest world is also false. They are mere appearances, as the appearances in  
dream. Just as the dream world appears real during the dream, but disappears  
and becomes false, the moment you wake up, so does the waking world become  
false and non-existent, the moment you arise from the waking. This waking up  
is called the Turiya or the fourth state, where you recognise that all the  
other states and the phenomenal world are imagery of the ego, and are false.   
When the world becomes false what remains is only the REAL I, the  
illuminator of the false the false ego. It is the consciousness, the Brahma.  
It is not shoonya, not false. It is REAL. It illumines the ego which has no  
consciousness of its own and with this borrowed consciousness the ego creates  
imagery and thinks itself real. When the ego itself is unreal, how can its  
creation be real?

Really nice post.   
Is it written by Swami Virajeshwara ?   
I read his autobiography "Scientist's Search for Truth".   
His ashram is a really nice and silent place. Quite remote.   
Full of natural vibrations and spiritual quietude.

Dear I,   
Yes, you are right, it is Swami Virajeshwara. His Ashramam is near to Hosur,  
in a small village called Kelamanglam. I believe his ashramam has absolutely  
no contact phone. The only way of communication is by way of post alone.  
clarity reflects like a crystal in his writings.

Dear munagala,   
There are mantras in Hindu system to get the lost item. But I do not know. I  
only use Arunachala Siva, which is the cure-all. Some   
members may laugh at the occasions on which I use this.   
1\. When there is an unscheduled power cut and when I am eager   
to see the Forum web and seek restoration of power.   
2\. When there is voltage fluctuation and the typed message does not get past.   
3\. When I misplace something.   
4\. When my wife misplaces her spectacles just before proceeding to bhajan  
classes.   
5\. When I get back ache and wants cure without applying Tiger balm.   
Kindly use this Maha mantra, and make intensive search in house,   
you are sure to get it.   
About 15 years back, I wrote a Tamil poem, which was published   
in a literary magazine. It reads somewhat,   
When I get tooth ache and suffer in pain,   
When I don't get my bus for office,   
When my young daugher runs a fever of 103 deg.F   
And I wait at the doctor where the queue is long,   
When I buy a ticket and await for results in lottery,   
And search for the number in the newspaper,   
Sri Rama Jayam, Sri Rama Jayam, Sri Rama Jayam,   
On all other occasions,   
I am the Victor, I am the Victor, I am the Victor!   
Arunachala Siva.

I will narrate one recent incident. It was on 1st Jan 2010, Bhagavan's  
Jayanti Day and Kanakammal's Liberation Day.   
The morning breakfast was served in the Asramam, around 7.00   
A.M. The crowd was already heavy. There were batches in the   
Dining Hall and also on the pandal erected between Old Hall   
and Cow's Samadhi. The crowds were swelling every hour. The   
lunch time was preponed to 11.00 AM because of the heavy crowds.   
Dr. Srinivasamurthy and his assistants were managing the crowds   
very efficiently without giving room for even the slightest anger   
or sulking. It was decided to permit people, first the womenfolk   
and children. My wife was permitted around 12 Noon in the second   
batch. But men were asked to wait. The Samadhi Hall shutters   
were put and there were already about 1000 people inside and another 800  
people outside. I was outside the shutters. I did not know what to do. To  
take food after 5 hours gap usually gives   
me some giddiness. I was feeling giddy. Nevertheless I wanted to stay inside  
the Asramam, and take food, because I had to leave   
by 3 PM on that day, and I did not want to miss the Jayanti prasadam. I  
started chanting Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... The group outside was  
allowed into the Hall, around 1 PM. I sat inside before Bhagavan Ramana  
chanting Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... I knew I was getting more and  
more giddy and I was just taking some water from the water bag in small  
quantities. I and others were permitted to the Pandal around 1.30 PM. The  
food was served very quickly and I had the prasadam of Bhagavan Ramana, to my  
heart's content. My wife came in between and asked: How are you? How are  
you? I said, I am not okay but I can manage.   
I did manage with Bhagavan Ramana's grace and with chanting   
of Maha Mantra.   
Arunachala Siva.

an even more recent incident   
I had sleepproblems for 5 days now...you see since one month I began to have  
sleeping problems 2 or 3 days a week, I had this before but it  
stopped...anyway it came again...   
this night was the 5th night without good sleep, I wasnt agnry or feeling to  
bad because of my sadhana...but anyway this night I felt very angry about the  
situation...not hatred but anger...   
and hten I remmebered this post, and your story dear subrmanian, (how you  
started with the maha mantra)   
and I prayed for sleep to bhagawan, and I started to chant the mantra...   
the sleep was not perfect but I felt very good in the morning...   
I know that mantras for sleep are somesort of last refuge because they may  
change hte unconcious processes that prevent from sleeping..and delay the  
solving of hte real problem...anyway I wanted sleep and with the grace of  
bhagawan I got it

Dear matthias,   
I am very happy to see your post. The idea, is whether it is hunger,   
or sleeplessness or pain or some dhukkam, sorrow, the mind flies   
in its full throttle with thoughts..thoughts...thoughts... This thought  
process over a hundred things can be curtailed only when one sticks to one  
thought. I use this Arunachala Siva, for many purposes.   
It has worked for me. It should work for you also. What is needed   
is faith and conviction in God or Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
I had serious problem, in finance and health, due to my "rather   
prematured" voluntary retirement of job. The savings I had   
lasted only for 2 years and my only son's higher education was   
not over. I had to rely on credit card borrowings, for another 2   
years and finally my son got an overseas appointment. Between   
2004-2006, I had suffered mental anguish and anxiety due to   
my pressing problems. I was slowly taking more more of sedatives   
even during day time. I was althrough reading Bhagavan Ramana,   
though not in great detail. Oneday I prayed to Him intently to   
tell me the way out. He told me in a dream, the Mahamantra   
and also said to me: If you trust me, I shall totally take control   
of you. But you should not take medicines more than prescribedd   
by the doctor! Use this Mahamantra for ALL your problems.   
I decided to go with Him. The medicines came down. I had peace.   
My son started sending money and cleared the credit card liabilities   
of about Rs 7 lacs and an interest of Rs 3 lacs in one year. Things   
became normal. I came into Bhagavan's fold permanently. The   
annual visits to T' malai became more frequent. I made 3 trips   
in 2008, 4 in 2009 and 1 in 2010 already. He is the Medicine of   
medicines.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Your post. Bhagavan Ramana's help is sure to come. It is our   
prarabdha that we suffer a little less or a little more. But one   
should never lose perseverence. You said you are reading Tiruppugazh songs.  
It is good. Bhagavan Himself has prescribed   
some Tiruppugazh songs to devotees. Is He not Skanda's avatara?   
Apart from Mahamantra, you may read the Seerpada Vaguppu,   
Devendra Sanga Vaguppu and Vel Vaguppu, which are called   
Mani-mantra-oushadam. The gem, mantra and medicine. Vallimalai   
Swamigal, the devotee of Bhagavan Ramana has prescribed this   
for devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.

There are six Skanda Sashti Kavacham, each for one Abode of   
Murugan. What is popularly read today is the one on Tiruchendur.   
What is said in that poem itself is as follows:-   
1\. Acharathutan angam thulakki.... One should read it after purification of  
body and applying Vibhuti etc.,   
2\. Nesamudan ore ninaivathu aagi... One should chant that with   
a lot of love for Murugan, without distraction, as a single thought.   
That is all. Do not worry about the inbuilt mantra elements. So long as your  
heart is pure and body is clean, there is no need to worry about other things.  
Total devotion alone would do. It will   
deliver results. The medicine for head ache, even you take it,   
without knowing its pharmaceutical ingredients will cure you, is it not?   
Incidentally there are certain other Tirupugazh songs: 1\. Neelankol megathin mayil meethe..... for unwed girls to get married to a  
good groom. This has been told by Bhagavan Himself.   
2\. Eluppu thol narai naadi kuzhamidai.... Chidambaram Tiruppugazh.   
This is for curing various illnesses.   
3\. Skandar Anubhuti - 51 songs for non attachment and liberation.   
4\. TiruveLaikaran Vaguppu - to overcome the fear of enemies,   
general disenchantment in life with a lot of boredom.   
Arunachala Siva.
