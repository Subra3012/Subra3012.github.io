## Topic: Regarding making some token voluntary contributions to support this site  
Author: atmavichar100       Date: December 28, 2012, 10:24:11 AM

Dear Members   
We have all been enjoying using this forum in one way or another and in this  
process we forget the main Man, Graham who is working behind silently in  
hosting this site and also maintaining it to be free from Ads, Spammers and  
Trolls.   
I feel we must also help contribute a bit to help Graham in maintaining this  
site. **This is adfree site and setup purely on a Non Commerical Basis and I  
feel all of us must contribute at least a token amount annually to Graham to  
help him with the webhositing and maintenance charges. **   
I am open to this. Others can also share their views on the same. **We need  
not consider this as paying to Graham but as a sort of simple Guru Dakshina to  
Bahgwan Ramana and Arunachala for connecting us. **   
 **I do not know how Graham is supporting this site** but I do feel that we  
must make at least a token contribution **voluntarily** in supporting this  
site. **Absolute no pressure on those who are not interested or who cant make  
it. So no guilt feelings here. **. This is a proposal just to show our  
respect/ support to Graham for helping us connect with Bhagwan Ramana and  
Arunachala.   
 **I do not know whether Graham will be open to this but on my part I feel I  
must open this topic and I request other members to also share their views.   
How we can do this we can debate later but would like others views also on the  
same   
Om Peace

Dear atmavichar100,   
If Graham Boyd agrees to this proposal, I can also join others in voluntary  
contribution.   
Arunachala Siva.

Good that both of you are also willing for this proposal along with me. Let us

Atmavichar/Graham/Friends,   
I appreciate the sensitivity and earnestness of our friend  
Krishna(Atmavichar)&others here in perceiving a possible need and offering  
help and support.   
Quote  
> The cost of this is actually very little these days and my family and  
> friends already take care of everything.

> However should the need arise then I will openly ask for help  
May this need never arise!May Sri Bhagavan's blessings be ever with Graham and  
his family.   
I saw this post by our friend Krishna and did not respond earlier,as I  
anticipated Graham's response.   
I fully appreciate the spirit of reaching out of our Friend Krishna-and I am  
sharing this tip in a general sense,not just with reference to this specific  
post-It is best to ascertain the need first before canvassing for such  
support-One will then be able to give the actual picture of the challenges  
that are faced,not just monetary but Technical and other forms of help as  
well-This way the help can be extended accordingly-Those who have money can  
contribute monetarily,those who have time can volunteer their service,those  
who have Specialist Technical ability can give their advice and help,etc.I  
have found that 'Monetary Help' is the easiest to muster in comparison with  
the other forms of service.   
In a lighter vein-'Guru Dakshina to Bhagavan'!Non starter!   
Wish you all the Very Best.   
Namaskar.

Sri Ravi,   
This reminded me a conversation in Ramayana, where Rama is so deeply moved at  
the selfless service of Hanuman, that he says to him that he never get an  
opportunity to repay the debt he owes to him, meaning may never an instance  
arise for Hanuman, that he may require his help.   
i have expressed not very lucidly, but i guess the essence is clear. i shall  
try and trace this particular conversation from the Ramayana.   
Wonderful. yes, May any such need never arise.   
ॐ

Just reproducing very wise words of Sri Graham from the Interactive page as  
regards to Forum, which I felt is important to remember once again.   
 _The purpose of this forum is to help those who need information to find it  
with ease. To assist those who seek genuine enlightenment to overcome their  
concerns and perceived difficulties through the knowledge of other members.   
However, like every other forum, there will be useful as well as not-so-useful  
content. I recommend visitors to be cautious about applying anything they read  
on the forum to their lives, unless it is also clearly stated in the Vedas, as  
these are the final authority._   
Thank you,   
With prayers,   
ॐ
