Every time I had a question in my mind as how to approach or deal with  
relating to Sri Ramana to   
Advaitic philosophy, I would drive to the Asramam and, sit in Sri Ramana's  
shrine or on the slopes   
of Arunachala, and contemplate. I was given nine months with which to  
complete the book and   
thus I was extremely focused during that time.   
In the beginning I had the thought that Sri Ramana had called me to write the  
book. After it was   
completed, I understood that Sri Ramana did not need another book written  
about Him and that   
it was really Arunachala that was calling me, not by book.   
Since 1973, my sister, Farion, had made numerous trips to Sathya Sai Baba. She  
would fly into Bangalore,   
taxi to Puttaparthi, and / or Whitefield, and then fly out of Bangalore back  
to California. This visit   
she asked me if I would take her to Tiruvannamalai.   
After spending a few days in Puttaparthi, my sister and I drove together to  
Chennai. Along the drive   
we had a rather deep discussion about the nature of Reality and whether  
Advaita presented an accurate   
description of It. There are most definitely any number of philosophical  
theories. All are true and all are false.   
There are those who say, 'Take the one that most appeals to you.'   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
