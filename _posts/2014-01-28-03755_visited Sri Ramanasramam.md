Dear devotees   
It brings joy to visit Sri Ramansramam and then it brings joy to discuss the  
visit in this forum in a reminiscent mood.   
After a long gap of 10 months, I visited Thiruvannamalai Arunachala and Sri  
Ramasramam. I took a volvo and landed at the holy place early morning 4 AM on  
last Saturday and checked in a hotel. Throughout the bus journey from  
Bangalore, I slept only a bit.   
I slept in the hotel room for 2 hours and woke up at 6:30 AM. I got ready and  
ate Tiffin at Seshadhri Swamigal ashram after first visiting his samadhi  
shrine.   
From hotel, when I took the auto to Seshadri Swamigal Ashram, through the Auto  
windows I had the first view of my Lord Arunachala and prayed to him. After  
long waiting it was a happy joining again.   
When I entered the Sri Ramasramam gate, it was all emotion and in my mind  
there was the image of Bhagavan slowly walking in the ashram compound. Through  
the cold morning breeze, in the air was floated the akshara mana malai sung  
nicely by a group. The divine chorus sound was emanating from the new samadhi  
hall of Maharshi and the image of young Bhagavn 21 years photo resonated with  
that rhythm in my mind.   
I slowly entered the samadhi hall and sat in my usual place silently telling  
Bhagavan all that happened to me in Mumbai and how it was a long period of  
separation.   
When it was 8 AM for the veda parayana, the ashram clerk came and politely  
told one of the chorus singer in his ears that it was time for vedic chanting.  
They have not yet finished the chanting of Akshara Mana malai. They finished  
fast and prostrated and left.   
Veda parayana started at 8:05 AM.   
After aarthi at 9 AM, I went straight to the new Library complex where Nochur  
Sri Venkataraman was giving discourse on Arunachala Akshara mana malai.   
When he entered the library hall, through the entrance, I was standing by the  
side. He was playing with a child, spending some time standing down the  
entrance near the tree shade. I looked at him for a long time and he suddenly  
turned his gaze at me for few seconds and again continued playing with the  
child.   
At the end of the beautiful discourse that lasted for 1.5 hours, I wanted to  
have a conversation with him but found that few people were surrounding him.   
I gathered courage and went slowly near him and suddenly broke my silence  
saying, asking my question.   
The Nochur Acharya replied but the sentences were not complete gramatically.  
It was cryptic, scattered words that rushed forth with speed from his mouth.  
It was almost like a splutter but it had the aura of authority and holiness.   
Me: "I have lot of desires, not able to overcome, any works or sadhana from  
Bhagavan can you kindly tell for me"   
Nochur Sri Venkataraman: Eka nama japa, one nama. Do you chant any such?   
Me: mathru sri sarada, daughter of Lakshmana swamy   
Nochur acharya listened attentively slightly nodding his head.   
Me: also Arunachala Shiva.   
Nochur: Do you chant Arunachala Shiva? That will . .............(I dont  
remember what he finished the sentence with)   
Me: Blessings   
Nochur: nodded the head   
I slowly withdrew while some westeners started conversing....   
After this wonderful satsang, I went to Virupaksha Cave and Skandashrama.   
This time I spent lot of time near the Videha Mukthi room of Mother Azhagammal  
concentrating on her photo and worshipping her.   
It was all filled with Bhagavan and Mother Azhagamal in Skandashramam and  
Virupaksha cave.   
After coming back and resting for 2 hours evening time fully for my Father  
Arunachaleshwara.   
I was in his hall surrounding the sanctum sanctorum and spent 1.5 hours near  
the Nataraja Sannidhi where the powerful form of Lord Shiva smiles and dances.   
I asked him why he sent me away for longer time and pleaded to be with him  
frequently in future.   
I went to Holy Mother Apeethakuchamba sannidhi later.   
Next day my bus was at 12:30 PM again Volvo bus as roads are not good.   
I went to Sri Ramanasrmam and skipped that day's lecture of Nochur Acharya as  
I spent that time sitting in old meditation hall.   
I came back turning my head back into the ashram premises frequently in a mood  
of not having the inclination to leave it.   
While in Bus it was all happy memory.   
I should say I did not want to come back to world at all.   
Vasanas were subdued there and I wish I continued there forever in my Father's  
loving embrace eternally.   
\-- Krishna

Dear Ravi sir   
Thankyou very much. It was a peaceful holy trip.   
Dear Nagaraj,   
Your smiley could not be understood. Sometimes these chat smileys are so  
confusing
