## True Bhakthi

What is true bhakthi? Does it come on its own? Or we should cultivate? Does it  
come like a samskara?   
For some people it is like a passion. If so is it good? Then it would not be a  
true bhakthi? Does true bhakthi expect any thing like to mingle with God?   
(All from the mind come up.... )

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No doubt samskara plays a part. But the efforts are also necessary.   
Bhagavan Ramana tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: The one who sacrifices himself to the Swarupam inside and remains   
ever as Atma Nishtaparan is a true bhakata. The problem is our lack of  
efforts towards sacrificing our ego to the Swarupam within.   
Sirthuondar and Kannappar only displayed this highest bhakti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the same Who am I?, Bhagavan tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: " Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since   
the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we,   
without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry with thoughts   
as to what should be done and how and what should not be done   
and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after   
getting on it, why should we carry our small luggage on our head,   
to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at  
ease?"   
This attitude is true bhakti. ELLAM AVAN SEYAL.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Yes. We should have full surrender and faith on God. It may be lots of  
vasanas, and expecting always good result.   
At starting point first we surrender and put all the things on train and sit.  
Some times the train meet an accident and only our compartment will get  
derailed. It is hard to accept our destiny. All philosophy, atma vicharam will  
drown for some times. It is like snake and ladder game. That shows there is  
lack of true bhakti and surrender.   
To have such type of bhakti, we need His grace.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: Grace is always there. There is no   
niggardliness in Grace. But you should have no niggardliness in   
the vessel that you bring. The vessel means devotion. Our devotion should be  
large enough [or intense enough] to obtain the full   
Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. Human body is a blessing, no doubt. But one should not take   
more than necessary care towards the body. Bhagavan Ramana   
is, as you have said, Gold Standard. He never wore any sandals   
in His 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai. He never accepted garlands. No  
one must have seen a photograph of Bhagavan Ramana with a garland at anytime.  
He was wearing only a codpiece and in some rare cold days in winter, He used  
to have a shawl around His chest. There was one priest in Asramam doing pujas  
for   
Ramaneswara Maha Lingam. He fell sick and had a serious problem   
on his feet and that made him immobile. When Sri Ganesan came   
to see him and regretted why should Bhagavan Ramana give him   
such an immobility, the priest answered: "Do not worry. I am okay. Only one  
quarter is bad. Three quarters are good." This is   
the extent, one should have consideration for the body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, Thats true. We should take care of body only that much to  
keep it healthy. And,what is very important,without atachment. When i said  
body is a blessing i ment that everything God gave us is a blessing. With body  
or not we exsist. We are part of something beautiful. And thats only metters.  
That doasnt mean one should be concerned to much with body. It is only just  
the way to realise the Self.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. That is the correct approach. Saint Tirumoolar says in his   
Tirumandiram: After realizing that Siva is in me, I start taking   
care of my body. Thus I take care of the body only to take care   
of my God. In another song, Tirumoolar says that: "This ULLam,   
[Heart] is a great Temple. This body made of flesh and bones and   
blood is also His Temple. Whatever I drink or eat, is the abulations for Siva  
in me. My five senses are the five lamps for Him!"   
He says in another song: I am doing Agni Karyam i.e., fire sacrifices daily.  
What is the fire sacrifice? What are the items   
that I put on the fire? [In the olden days, they used to put   
ghee, oil, sandal wood, dried cow dung, wood pieces etc.,].   
I am putting good food, good water and breathe in good air,   
to make this fire glow for ever!   
Tirumoolar was a Siva Raja Yogi. He is said to have lived for 3000 years. He  
took care of his body for the sake of Sivam inside.   
Arunachala Siva.
