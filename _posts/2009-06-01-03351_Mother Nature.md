Dear Friends,   
couple of years back, of inspiration from the Bright & glorious Nature, I  
wrote this out of love for nature... wanted to share it with you all.   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you Mother   
O Playful Wind   
Your soft touch nourishes me every moment;   
You fill my heart with love,   
You are the life giver   
Your cool breeze calms my mind all the time   
Salutations to you O great God of wind!   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you Mother   
O Unending Ether   
You indeed pervade the entire Universe,   
Your presence is a fruit to my inspiration   
You are the playground for the soul   
O Great God, my salutations to you   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you Mother   
O Mighty water   
The sound of the beautiful river springs love in my heart   
The still water unites me with you,   
You cleanse me off all the dirt and sins   
You quench my thirst of desires   
O God what else can I say? My salutations to you!   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you Mother   
O Destroyer of Darkness, Sun   
You are the reason for me enjoying the beauty around me   
You are the source of my living   
You are my father, mother, God   
You raise my intellect intelligence and bhakti   
O Great God, my salutations to you   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you O Mother   
How beautiful indeed you are O nature! Salutations to you O Mother   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj ji   
From where does the poem come. Is it from the so called Mind. One mind writes  
the poem and another mind is reading. When we do such things   
where does the heart go? If Bhagavan sees the nature, what will he say.   
When the the whold world is maya, this nature also Maya. Is not it?   
I am confused.....   
Any way your poem is very nice. During this summer in chennai, it gives cool  
moments to some extent.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Definitely, the poem has sprung from Ego only. According to me, Ego as two  
faces, one is a Good Face and the other is a Bad face. Nourishing the good ego  
implies to nourishing Satvic qualities whereas nourishing Bad Ego implies to  
nourishing Tamasic and Rajasic qualities.   
All the great works on God and His glories have sprung from this Satvic Ego  
which is actually good and encouraged by the scriptures. Once when this Satvic  
Ego is completely established, it becomes easier for one to realise the Truth.   
The True Self is not even bothered about all these, but as Subramanian has  
pointed in several posts about the concept of Shuddha Manas, many Sages have  
for the sake of posterity have produced so many wondrous works.   
The heart does not go anywhere, The Heart remains. Infact its the same eternal  
I which is covered with the various Blanket of Ego does various actions. Ego  
is not different from you, you are that Ego also, but you (Consciousness) are  
covered by Satvic, Rajasic and Tamasic blankets. Just remove these blankets  
one by one till you remain with only Satvic Blanket and then finally remove  
the Satvic blankey.   
Nature and Bhagawan are one and the same. Nature is Bhagawan, Bhagawan is  
nature, the Seer and the Seen are one and the same. Bhagawan would not at all  
have "Seen" nature. He see's only himself in everything. But for us Mumukshu's  
we still linger around the Seer and the Seen. This is what is called Maya.  
When the Seer and the Seen are one and the same, perceiving them as different  
is Maya, i.e. thinking that Nature is different from you (I) Infact you don't  
see anything. You see only yourself everywhere, I am THAT, I am Bahman,  
TatvaMasi, etc... You are that, that is not different from you, is the voice  
of Vedanta.   
Therefore Nature is misunderstood as Maya Nature is You, You are that Nature,  
You don't see Nature for you are Nature, You don't see anything in reality.   
Infact, the subtle confusion can be summed up with this statement   
_Thinking/Assuming Maya as _Maya_ is the Biggest Maya. Maya is illusion.  
_**   
So don't give it any image. If we say Maya, why do we give it a picture like  
Nature, world, etc... ? If you say something as Maya, it means and implies  
that What I am calling as Maya is only illusion, but at the same time we are  
subconsciously still seeing it as it is. Seer and Seen. there is no ' _Seen  
'_.

Dear Nagaraj ji   
Yes. Mr. Subramanian ji has written about the suddha manas long time ago. You  
have written from the suddha manas so it gives you happyness.   
It is the mistake of us that we never remain with suddha manas always. That is  
why we cannot enjoy the purity of the nature. If we have the   
purity we see the nature, ourselves and god all are same.

Yes. As Nagaraj said the biggest illusion [Maya] is to   
think about Maya. It is all mind's game. When the mind   
thinks about only good things from Nature, such pure   
mind gives happiness and gives rise to poetry.   
Arunachala Siva.
