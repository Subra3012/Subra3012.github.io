In our times large parts of nature are destroyed.   
What would happen if anytime in the future some crazy government decides to  
sell Arunachala mountain to a company that removes the mountain and uses the  
material gained to build something?   
In China the government built a monstrous dam that destroyed three gorges, so  
we can see what human are capable of doing in the hope to gain monay.

Dear Jyoti,   
Arunachala can never be destroyed. The world will be destroyed   
before that. It is the axis of the world. The other axix is in Pacchu   
Mountains near Peru. Both the axes will get dissolved only after the   
world is totally annihilated.   
Arunachala Siva.
