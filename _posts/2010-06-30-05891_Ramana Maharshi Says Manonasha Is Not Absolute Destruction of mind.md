**D: That means the manonasha or the ahamkara nasha. The destruction of the  
mind or of the ego you speak of is then not an absolute destruction.   
M: Yes. The mind gets clear of impurities and become pure enough to reflect  
the truth, the real Self.This is impossible when the ego is active and  
assertive.**

Dear prasanth,   
This aspect of mano nasa or ahankara nasa has been discussed   
at various points of time, in the Forum. Once the Adminsitrator,   
Graham Boyd also intervened and said that it means only ego   
destruction and not mind destruction, as many would construe.   
He quoted from Crumbs from the Table - by Sri Ramananda Swarnagiri.   
I shall give some verses from Guru Vachaka Kovai:-   
Verse 383: The impure mind that is frightened and perplexed,   
as if it has been intoxicated by drinking alcohol, is alone the Jivatma  
[individual self], that is mentally confused and confounded, believing that it  
is really bound by the bond of karma. If the mind without desiring and  
revelling in sense objects perceived through suttarivu [objective  
consciousness], abides in the Self state without slipping from it, then that  
extremely pure mind alone will be   
Paramatma [Supreme Self] that shines, in a clarified state, as the attribute  
free consciousness.   
Verse 384: The mind should discontinue its habit of perpetually moving  
outwards in an unlimited way, pointlessly enquiring 'Who are you?' and 'Who is  
he?'. It should turn within, holding itself as the object of attention and  
without interruption zealously   
enquire 'Who am I?'. This alone will confer the ultimate benefit.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away, and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. This pure [Suddha] state of daylight that then shines forever is  
Sivaratri [the night of Siva].   
Verse 265: The pure state [suddha nilai] exists and shines as unceasing pure  
being in the Heart [ULLam] after the other thoughts that rise from oneself  
[vikshepa] and Self forgetfulness [avarana] that is the basis of their rising  
are fully destroyed.   
Verse 842: When you are separated from the Self-state, the thought that  
associates with you as 'my mind' and 'your mind' is itself the binding  
entanglement. You should know that the Pure Mind is only one, existing ever  
as the same, as it is, as the the Chit-sakti [the power of consciousness] that  
remains merged non dually with the Supreme Self, which is the extremely clear  
pure being.   
It should be remembered here that -   
1\. Bhagavan Ramana answered and explained the facts, depending upon the state  
of the questioner.   
2. He spoke at different levels depending upon the maturity of the seeker.   
3. The apparently different statements about the destruction of the mind or the destruction of the ego should be read keeping in mind the above items (1) and (2).   
The state of Suddha manas, Suddha Nilai and Suddha arivu should be understood  
in the above contexts.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
I felt writing this additional reply for some reasons. Regarding   
Bhagavan Ramana's original teachings, one should go only to: 1\. Nan Yar or Who am I?   
2\. Upadesa Saram and ULLadu Narpadu.   
3\. His prose translation of Vivekachoodamani and versification   
 of Atma Bodham.   
4. Maharshi's Gospel to some extent.   
5. Guru Vachaka Kovai, since every verse and comments of   
 Muruganar, has been thoroughly verified and corrected whenever   
 necessary by Bhagavan Ramana.   
As regards, Talks, Day by Day and Letters, though some of them   
have been seen and corrected by Bhagavan Ramana, these are all   
conversations which He had with a variety of visitors, devotees and   
sincere seekers. It was in the habit of Bhagavan not to smother   
the devotees, but to go in their own line and give suitable replies.   
Here the replies VARIED depending upon the maturity of the seekers. Though  
recorders have done a honest duty, these replies   
have been given taking the devotees's state of mind into consideration.   
So, when He says, something, the replies should be cross checked with Bhagavan  
Ramana's own teachings in the books mentioned   
above. This will help us to clear many many doubts regarding the   
mind, ego, destruction of mind, destruction of ego, chitta vritti,   
ahandakara vritti and other such numerous concepts.   
To illustrate how Bhagavan Ramana varied His recommendations to a sadhak: Dilip Kumar Roy is an excellent singer of devotional songs. When   
he asked Bhagavan, whether such devotional, heart melting singing, thinking  
about God would confer him liberation, Bhagavan   
Ramana answered "Yes. Pursue that course!" When later, Devaraja Mudaliar  
asked Bhagavan, whether he could also sing Tirupugazh   
songs and attain mukti, Bhagavan Ramana categorically said: "No. That path is not for you. You surrender, if you cannot do self enquiry!"   
Arunachala Siva.

To my understanding, destruction of Ego is destruction of Mind itself. Ego is  
nothing but the 'I' thought, upon the rise of 'I' thought, Mind comes into  
picture, when the ego is naught, there is no mind at all.   
Therefore Jnani does not have a mind. _**" There is no Jnani, there is only  
Jnanam" **_   
It is only through the mind one surrenders, and when there is complete  
Surrender, there is no more mind or ego.   
Mind is Ego.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

well said nagraj garu.   
Yes destruction of ego is required.   
Once udai garu and raju garu and subramanian garu discussed regarding this in  
the forum   
Mind has two faculties [or read it thoughts are of two types] : ahamkara  
Vritti, idamkara vritti.   
Ahamkara Vritti means "I" thought and related modifications.Ahamkara vritti is  
identification with a particular notion in mind.   
 **Ahamkara vritti 's non presence is required. but idamkara vritti is basic  
necessity for us to function, talk, speak etc.**   
Pure Ahamkara Vritti is there even in Jnanis (suddha manas) because,idamkara  
vritti is not possible without Ahamkara vritti.   
Ramana Maharshi says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind. (Day by Day with  
Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

Dear Nagaraj and prasanth,   
When the mind is replaced by ego, then there is no problem.   
We are able to understand better and we feel more comfortable.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I? : "Mind is a wondrous power residing in  
Atma. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such  
thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the   
nature of the mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent   
entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts and there is no  
world."   
Bhagavan Ramana also says in the next paragraph: That which   
rises as 'I' in this body is the mind. If one inquries as to where in the  
body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises   
in the Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Mind and ego are different one. When the mind is a thought, how the ego takes  
birth and from where? Can you explain by giving example.   
In normal life we need mind. We would say he/she is very sharp in grasping  
things and does very well in her/his class. Here can we say this type of mind  
is good or suddha manas.   
It is my understanding... I may be wrong. After doing the work, if he/she  
expects praises or popularity from others   
it is ego? which is bad. At the end for name and fame he/she may go to any  
extent where he/she accumulates karmas which becomes destiny. . ........ I may  
be wrong.So I request you to explain.   
Thanking you,   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mind, if you accept that concept, has not any form, but it is a wondrous  
power, in Atma. But when mind produces thoughts and the first thought is  
always I-thought. This I-thought is the ego. Only   
this ego has to be conquered, if one has the view that there is no mind at  
all.   
Arunachala Siva.
