## Saiva Siddhanta Concept Texts  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 03, 2009, 09:55:41 AM  
---  
I wrote sometime back, that Kovilur Math which is managing Isanya   
Jnana Desikar's Samadhi, in Tiruvannamalai, has approved 16   
conceptual texts of Vedanta, for their Veda Patasala. Kovilur Math   
has also brought out 12 of these 16 Vedantic texts in Tamil in three   
volumes. Kovilur Math is one of the few Maths in Tamil Nadu, which has  
adopted Advaita Vedanta for their students. But most of other   
Saiva Siddhanta Maths in Tamil Nadu, have adopted Saiva Siddhantam   
as their conceptual framework for their students. There are some   
differences between Advaita Vedanta and Saiva Siddhanta and Bhagavan Ramana  
Himself has spoken about it on one or two occasions. In fact, Muruganar was  
steeped in Saiva Siddhantam when he had come to Bhagavan Ramana and he was  
well versed   
in Saiva Siddhanta Stotrams like Tevaram and Tiruvachakam, and   
also in their conceptual framework.   
There are 14 Saiva Siddhanta texts on conceptual framework. The authors are  
called Santana Munis. These are: 1\. Tiru Undiyar \- Tiruviyalur Uyyavantha Deva Nayanar.   
2\. Tiru KaLitru Padiyar - Tirukadvaur Uyyavantha Deva Nayanar.   
3\. Siva Jnana Bodham - Tiruvennai Nallur Meikandar.   
4\. Siva Jnana Siddhi - AruL Nandi Sivam.   
5\. Iru Pa Iru Pahdu - AruL Nandi Sivam.   
6\. UNmai ViLakkam - Manavachagam Kadanthar   
7\. Siva Prakasam - Umapati Sivam.   
8\. Tiru AruL Payan - Umapati Sivam   
9\. Vina VeNba - Umapati Sivam   
10\. Potri Pahrodai - Umapati Sivam   
11.Kodi Kavi - Umapati Sivam   
12\. Nenju Vidu Dhoothu - Umapati Sivam   
13\. UNmai NeRi ViLakkam - Umapati Sivam   
14\. Sankalpa Nirakaranam - Umapati Sivam   
There are some English renderings available, through Annamalai University,  
Chidambaram and Tamizh Univresity, Thanjavur.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think Annamalai university and few other universities also have a 2 year  
correspondence course on Saiva Siddhanta.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. Very true in everyone's life. There were days when I did not   
have even Rs 1000 in my bank account. I was worried. Today,   
thanks to my son, I have got at least Rs 2 lacs in my savings account   
at any time. However, when the balance comes below Rs 2 lacs, without any  
further funds from my son, I am worried. What gain   
the lack of money or money gave in my life? Only worries! Saint   
Tayumanavar says: Even Siva gives the whole world to one devotee,   
he will be worried as to why the oceans have not been given to him!   
Arunachala Siva.

...not happy with what we have   
...anything we get only makes us happy for a short while   
...always needing more, more, more   
Krishnamurti's words always stuck with me: intelligence isn't indulgence, and  
intelligence isn't renunciation, intelligence is understanding, and in that  
understanding material possessions will fall into the right balance in your  
life where they won't hinder you.   
Too little material possessions can hinder you too (e.g., lack of basic  
necessities).

Dear Matthew,   
Yes. Moderation is the keyword in life. Whether food, water or sleep,   
moderation helps us a lot. More food upsets one's stomach. No food   
makes his stomach burn in hunger. Moderate food makes one happy.   
So is the case with money, sleep etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

moderation, yes Subramanian.R, good word, sums it up mostly in a single word.   
moderation is hard when it comes to women. you guys should help me. maybe i  
should just get off thought and then there will be no question of anything to  
desire or fear.

Dear Matthew,   
You are correct. Srimad Bhagavatam says that lust for women is the toughest  
thing to conquer. Because, the individual is born out of lust ( of parents )  
and it is the last thing to go, in one's life. Devaraja   
Mudaliar sings one old Tamil song in front of Bhagavan: " I have left the  
desire for lands, I have left the desire for gold, I have left the desires for  
food and sleep, but I have not been able to leave the desire for women with  
well formed breasts!" The great Sage Viswamitra lost all his fruits of  
penance, when he saw Menaka the celestial girl (who was sent by Indra to  
render Viswamitra's penance become useless.) The Sage united with Menaka and  
started raising a family! What to do? One has to constantly make effort.  
Pray to   
Siva the Yogeeswara, who conquered that desire. He burnt god of love, when he  
made attempts to disturb Siva's equipoise. You know Skanda was born out of  
Siva's third eye. Ganapati was born out of Uma's turmeric paste, which she  
was having for bath and from which she created her son! No children were born  
out of Siva Uma union!   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a well-known saying which goes like: If you give your mind to the world, the world will destroy it.   
But if you give it to God, God will fulfill it.   
When God/Self is meditated upon with devotion and self-enquiry for a long  
time,   
lust starts getting sublimated naturally and its place is taken up by the joy  
of the Divine.   
Om Shanti. ..

Forgive me, I am not trying to find a view that tallies with my own and is  
thus to my liking.   
But I have to wonder...   
In this incarnation we have (and this incarnation I have now is the only one  
that interests me)... the food-body only lasts so long...   
So are we to live in harsh denial of the things of life and the senses...   
Don't get me wrong -- I understand fully the flaws of devoting one's self to  
the objective world and sensory experiences...   
But the question is, is renunciation/denial the true way out?   
How can you understand something you turn from?   
If I desire to do something, WHY SHOULD I TRY AND CHANGE MYSELF IN ANY WAY,  
SHAPE, OR FORM?   
Should I not just "be as I am".   
Like Krishnamurti would often say, if you are violent, then that violence is  
the reality, and the second you speak of non-violence you're speaking of non-  
reality.   
So the fact is, simply, I desire women, among many other things I desire,  
including money, fame, etc.   
Intellectually I am aware of how these desires will never bring me what I long  
for (happiness/transcendence). Yet they still pop up.   
So if they are still popping up, then they must be calling for my attention.   
But I'm so inattentive.   
So what I am left with? My desires, my inattention, and my lack of  
seriousness.   
And I can't ask all of you: help me to be serious! A serious person wouldn't  
ask like that. A serious person would already start giving their heart fully  
to the matter. So don't tell me what to do -- what is the use?   
But I like being around this place. Just the company here helps push me in  
the one direction, the only direction, that most people in my day to day life  
try and pull me away from (unintentionally, but nonetheless).   
And can I give up one thing at a time? Someone pointed out above --  
understand who/what is subject to the desire.   
Am I the only one who feels insane sometimes because I intellectually realize  
the value of all this stuff we talk about here but I lack the  
conviction/seriousness to go deep into it?

Dear Matthew and munagala,   
Both of you are correct in your points of view. What is more important, is  
not to pretend but to accept our present position   
and then improve with our efforts and God's grace. Pretension   
is a dangerous thing. Bhagavan Ramana told Ramanatha Brahmachari to take up  
sannyasa and tonsure his head and remove the thread,   
when the latter came and asked Him. To another person, who came   
with a tonsured head, Bhagavan Ramana chastised him and send: What I told for Ramanatha is for him and not for you.   
Because, one was genuine and was fit for ascetic life. The other was   
pretending and wanted to become an ascetic. The rules and games   
are different. Only our efforts coupled with God's grace will find   
the solution.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthew and munagala,   
Both of you are correct in your points of view. What is more important, is  
not to pretend but to accept our present position   
and then improve with our efforts and God's grace. Pretension   
is a dangerous thing. Bhagavan Ramana told Ramanatha Brahmachari to take up  
sannyasa and tonsure his head and remove the thread,   
when the latter came and asked Him. To another person, who came   
with a tonsured head, Bhagavan Ramana chastised him and send: What I told for Ramanatha is for him and not for you.   
Because, one was genuine and was fit for ascetic life. The other was   
pretending and wanted to become an ascetic. The rules and games   
are different. Only our efforts coupled with God's grace will find   
the solution.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
I am not a software professional. But I know a friend of mine,   
who is running some computer peripherals sales & service centre,   
and is making a profit of Rs 25000 per month. He is expanding.   
He does not run any internet browsing outfit. He merely helps people to copy  
Word documents, burn CDs, sells CDs, small value printers   
and UPS systems. He also runs a xerox machine for xeroxing work.   
He has recently added a courier centre, where he receives couriers   
intended for various places and put them across to Professional couriers and  
the like, and gets a commission. He helps through   
advisory capacity to buy new computers, laptops, I-Pods, printers,   
high value cell phones etc., A good combination. He has got just one   
assistant under him. For a five lac investment you can make a similar outfit  
and earn Rs 25000/- per month, which comes to Rs 3 lacs   
and this is 60% return!   
Arunachala Siva.

There are many small business forums on the internet. I suggest you find one  
of those; likely many people there will have more knowledge/experience that  
will help with what you want to do.   
Here, we will say, of what use to you is anything?   
Don't get me wrong. I'm in the same boat as you -- I'm trying to start a  
small biz so I can get out of the rat race. But here, you will get very bad  
business advice. The advice will good for your Self, but bad for business.
