Dear everyone,   
I read the caution post on copyright laws from the,   
Mr. Graham Boyd. When I asked for his clarification, he explained   
in a post that writing the full details in a book of Sri Ramansramam,   
is infringing the copy rights. I told him, "Sorry!" Hence, I shall not   
be able to continue, Guru Ramana Vachana Mala or from any other   
book of Asram, in full or in a large part.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
I request you to please continue your dedicated service. Actually, there are  
many people who do not know how many books are there written by Bhagavan,  
written by others in english and tamil. Very few people only know english,  
tamil and sanskrit. As you know languages and understand how to explain, we  
are fortunate to read and learn these poems and meanings. There are so many  
sites which has few books only. Some of them can be down loaded not others.  
Even if I down load, I cannot get the full meaning. It is just like a study  
circle where I am learning lot. Bhagavan has to shower His grace to  
continue.this work Srk udai wrote Astavakra Geetha. There is no body claim  
anything..... What to say...   
As he says we just have to observe. .   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mr. Graham Boyd, is the of this Forum. There are   
copyright laws and there are his instructions. I have to abide by   
them, once I know my mistakes. I am not in a position to continue   
any full text or a large of part of any of Sri Ramansramam publications.   
Please read the book if available or get it from Sri Ramansramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai   
I understand what you are saying.   
But, I will try to clarify my situation as best I can. At a point in  
September, I was doing quiet well. Probably the best I've been in a long time,  
in many aspects of worldly and spiritual pursuits. Things -studying, cooking,  
activities- were happening almost effortlessly.   
Three weeks ago, some baggage was being felt, reaching a high point of a week  
ago.   
As you can see this is not about any discouraging thoughts and what not, this  
seems to be issues at a deeper level.   
I have resolved to drinking alcohol on a few nights this week, though I  
haven't for many months before.   
Anyway, its almost 5.30am here. I will be going to sleep soon.   
I don't know if this is a mind game that I'm playing with myself.   
Take care   
Laith

Dear Arunachala Siva   
My wish is not to abandon the duties expected, but the opposite.   
This seems to be difficult. Especially now.   
Laith   
P.S. I've read the poem you posted and it's inspiring.   
What I go through has been gone through and it is God's plan.   
I guess there is a feeling of guilt also inside of me, due to many unfulfilled  
expectations imposed on myself.

Dear Laith,   
Yes. .. it is a game your mind is playing with you.   
Need to come out of it.   
Please sleep early... avoid alcohol... and do your duties.   
Not doing these has nothing to do with spirituality or spiritual evolution.   
Above all... Know your thoughts and understand your inner lanscape. .. how  
thoughts/feelings/sensations are driving you... need to see them within.   
This is my advise as a friend... not someone here to criticize. .. but someone  
ever with you to support and help if sought.   
Love!   
Silence

I pray for your peace, and that you may return to the point in your middle  
soon...   
ken Wilber said: in the eye of the hurricane you are safe...   
It is very important to do the work you should do, you will feel much better  
if you are in tune with the plan of god (this means working, studding and  
whatever is happening in your life as a worldy duty)...   
No Alcohol Sir, Meditaiton and Drugs are two different worlds.....   
I guess you sit alot, so please go jogging..... and make some hatha yoga, a  
healthy body is easier to transcend   
drink alot of water to purify you, sometimes we do not have much energy  
because we do not drink water....this can make us frustrated and angry   
2 glass of water before every meal and 1 glass afterwards   
I wish you peace
