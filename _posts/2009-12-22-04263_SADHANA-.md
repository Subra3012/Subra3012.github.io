Dear I,   
It is best to ask this question yourself. Whatever anybody tells your here, it  
is going to be absolutely their own experience and evolution. The best person  
to ask this question is yourself (I) and only 'I' can show light on this.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear friend,   
As Nagaraj has said, I shall not venture to tell you my view.   
But I shall tell you what Manikkavachagar, the great Saiva saint   
said: Avan aruLale avan thaaL vanangi..... I am praying to your   
golden feet, due to your grace. In other words, the Sadhana or   
even Sadhana suitable for a particular person, is decided by God   
and His Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.
