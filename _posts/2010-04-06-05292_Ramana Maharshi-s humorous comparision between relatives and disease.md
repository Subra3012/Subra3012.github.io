**20th January, 1946**   
When the personal attendants of Bhagavan were advised by doctors to give him  
food containing vitamins to relieve the pain in the legs they began doing so  
and were also massaging his legs with some special ointment. They were thus  
serving him to the best of their ability. **Bhagavan used to say humorously,  
A guest comes to your house. If you are indifferent towards him he will go  
away early, but if you show great respect towards him, and are very attentive  
he will never go. So is disease. If you attend to the disease in the manner  
you are doing now, why should it go? If you take no notice of it, it will  
disappear of its own accord.**   
Sometime ago, a young man set up an establishment about a mile from the  
Ashram, on the road round the hill,saying he would cure diseases by giving  
vibhuti. People get mad over such things, dont they? People who were  
diseased,possessed and the like started going in crowds to see that Vibhuti  
Swami, and on their way, they used to come to our Ashram also. What is there  
at this Ashram? No vibhuti! No magic lockets! They used to have darshan and  
then go away.On such occasions, if any attendants happened to be massaging his  
legs with medicated oil, Bhagavan used to say in a lighter vein, **Excellent,  
this is also good in a way. When these people see me thus, they would say,  
this Swami himself is suffering from pains in the legs and is getting  
massaged by others. What can he do for us? and go away without coming  
anywhere near me. So far so good.**   
 _Two or three years back when Bhagavan had jaundice,he could not relish his  
food and felt a great dislike for food.For about a week or ten days he ate  
only popcorns and the like. As Echamma and Mudaliar Patti have a vow that they  
will not eat until Bhagavan takes at least a morsel of food cooked by them he  
used to take a few grains from the rice brought by these ladies and mixing  
them with popcorn,used somehow swallow that food so that their vratam or  
deeksha might remain unimpaired._   
Months passed by; the jaundice persisted. A reputed doctor from Madras was  
called. The result was the same. After all had come and gone, and after all  
medicines had been tried without success, **he cured himself of jaundice in no  
time with sonti (dry ginger),pippalu (ipecac) and other Ayurvedic herbal  
medicines. Let any one venture to ask him how the disease was cured!**

Dear prasanth,   
Bhagavan Ramana's rheumatic pain was always acute. Whenever   
He gets up, He used to massage His legs with His hands and then   
only could stand and walk. Once someone came and there was   
some discussion. His stroll in the Hill was a little bit delayed.   
The attendant was ready with His walking stick and kamandalu,   
water pot. Bhagavan then told the devotee: See, "the monkey   
owner is ready with his stick. It is now time for the monkey   
to stand and dance, so I have to go!" He laughed and quickly   
massaged His legs and stood up for the afternoon stroll on the   
Hill!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
What you say is correct. But we are not Bhagavan. So the pain and   
disease really bother us. But at the same time, one cannot be   
hypochondriac, taking a saridon the moment there is a mild headache.   
One should avoid this and take medicines only when the disease and   
pain become unmanageable. In T'malai, I had serious knee pain because walking  
back and forth inside the Asramam, climbing the stairs in dining hall and  
walking a long distance inside the temple.   
Knees are my weakest portions in my body. However, I decided not   
to take any Tiger Balm, which I had carried and managed to overcome the pain  
after the day's sleep.   
Arunachala Siva.
