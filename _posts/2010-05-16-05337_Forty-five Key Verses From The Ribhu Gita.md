**Preface**   
The ego or separate soul is a concept(idea). God, the world, the mind  
desires,action, sorrow and all other things are all concepts.   
 **Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi**, a famous Sage of modern India, attributed  
unique value to this lucid exposition of Supreme Truth. He often referred to  
it in his talks with devotees and seekers, and he is reported to have said  
that is one **repeatedly read Chapter 26 of the Ribhu Gita one could pass  
spontaneously into samadhi, or the natural state of Self-realization.**   
The Ribhu Gita, literally Ribhus Song, is Part Six of the Shiva Rahasya,a  
legendary mystical text of India. **The whole of the Ribhu Gita is said to  
represent the teaching given to the Sage Ribhu by God himself in the form of  
Lord Shiva**, the formless aspect of the Divine activity, in whom all beings  
and things are always already absorbed. The Sage in turn gave the teaching to  
his reluctant disciple Nidagha.   
 **The Heart of the Ribhu Gita**   
1\. I shall now expound to you the method of inhering in the All-inclusive and  
undifferentiated Reality. This teaching is secret and difficult to understand  
even with the help of the various Scriptures. Even celestial beings and  
practitioners of spiritual discipline who hold it dear acquire it only with  
great difficulty. Follow what I say and, inhering in Reality,be happy.   
2\. My son! **Realized sages say that absolute inherence in Reality means  
becoming one with the immutable, tranquil, non-dual Absolute Supreme Being  
which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and the Self of all, and making the  
wandering mind one with it like the proverbial milk and water, absolutely free  
from all concepts.**   
3\. When one scrutinizes this variety of manifestation one realizes that it  
does not really exist and that everything is the undifferentiated Absolute  
Supreme Being which is not different from the Self and oneself. Let this  
knowledge become firm with you by constant practice. Then,discarding  
everything, become one with the Supreme Absolute Reality and, remaining as  
that, be happy.   
4\. Abide as That which does not, when scrutinized, show any duality in the  
form of these various objects or the least trace of cause and effect, That in  
which, when the mind is absorbed in It, there is not fear of duality at all   
and be always happy, unshakable and free the fear arising from duality.   
5\. Abide as That in which there are neither thoughts nor fancies, neither  
peace nor self-control, neither the mind nor the intellect, neither confusion  
nor certainly, neither being nor non-being, and no perception of duality  and  
be always happy, unshakable and absolutely free from the fear arising from  
duality.   
 _6\. Abide as That in which there is neither any defect nor good  
quality,neither pleasure nor pain, neither thought nor silence, neither misery  
nor austerities practiced for getting rid of misery, no I-am-the-body idea,  
no objects of perception whatsoever  and be always happy, free from all  
traces of thought._   
7\. Abide as That in which there is no work, physical, mental, verbal or of  
any other kind, neither sin nor virtue, neither attachment nor its  
consequences  and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
8\. Abide as That in which there are neither thoughts nor a thinker, neither  
the arising nor the preservation nor the dissolution of the world,nothing  
whatsoever at any time  and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
9\. Abide as That in which there is neither the Self-limiting Power of  
Illusion nor its effects, neither knowledge nor ignorance, neither separate  
soul nor Lord of Creation, neither being nor non-being,neither world nor God   
and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
10\. Abide as That in which there are no gods and their worship, none of the  
three Divine aspects of Creator, Preserver and Destroyer or meditation on them  
no Supreme Formless God nor meditation on Him  and be always happy, without  
the least trace of thought.   
11\. Abide as That in which there is neither maturing bondage to the way of  
good works nor searching devotion to the Divine nor self-knowing wisdom, no  
fruit of action to be enjoyed, no supreme state separate from it, no means of  
attainment or object to be attained and be always happy, free from all traces  
of though.   
12\. Abide as That in which there is neither body nor senses nor vital  
forces,neither mind nor intellect nor fancy, neither ego nor ignorance, nor  
anyone who identifies himself with them, neither the macrocosm nor the  
microcosm and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
 **13\. Abide as That in which there is neither desire nor anger, neither  
greed nor delusion, neither ill-will nor pride, no impurities of mind and no  
false notions of bondage and liberation  and be always happy, free from all  
traces of thought.**   
14\. Abide as That in which there is no beginning or end, no top or bottom or  
middle, no holy place or god, no gifts or pious acts, no time or space,no  
objects of perception  and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
15\. Abide as That in which there is no discrimination between the real and  
the unreal, no absence of desire, no possession of virtues, o yearning for  
liberation, no competent Master or disciple, no steady knowledge,no realized  
stage, no liberation while alive or after death, nothing whatsoever at any  
time  and be always happy free from all traces of thought.   
 **16\. Abide as That in which there are no Holy Scriptures or sacred books,no  
one who thinks, no objection or answer to it, no theory to be established, no  
theory to be rejected, nothing other than one Self  and be always happy, free  
from the least trace of thought.**   
17\. Abide as That in which there is no debate, no success or failure, no word  
or its meaning, no speech, no difference between the soul and the Supreme  
Being, none of the manifold causes and consequences  and be always happy,  
without the least trace of thought.   
18\. Abide as That in which there is no need for listening, reflecting and  
practicing, no meditation to be practiced, no differences of  
sameness,otherness or internal contradictions, no words or their meanings   
and be always happy, free from the least trace of thought.   
19\. Abide as That in which there are no fears of hell, no joys of heaven, no  
worlds of the Creator God or the other Gods, nor any object to be gained from  
them, no other world, no universe of any kind  and be always happy, without  
the least trace of thought.   
20\. Abide as That in which there is nothing of the elements nor even an iota  
of their derivatives, no sense of I or mind, no fantasies of the mind, no  
blemish of attachment, no concept whatsoever  and be always happy, without  
the least trace of the thought.   
21\. Abide as That in which there are none of the three kinds of bodies (gross  
physical, subtle internal, or formless and most subtle), dreaming and  
sleeping), none of the three kinds of souls (those who are fully prepared to  
advance spiritually, those who are not fully prepared, and those who are not  
prepared at all), none of the three kinds afflictions (those of the body,  
those caused by the elements, and those caused by subtle beings and powers),  
none of the five functional layers of being (gross physical, vital, emotional-  
psychic, mental, and that of formless bliss), no one to identify himself with  
them  and be always happy,without the least trace of thought.   
22\. Abide as That in which there is no sentient object, no power to hide  
Reality, no difference of any kind, no power of projecting unreal objects, no  
power of any other kind, no false notion about the world  and be always  
happy, without the least trace of thought.   
23\. Abide as That in which there are no sense organs or anyone to use  
the,That in which transcendent bliss is experienced, That which is absolutely  
immediate, That by realizing and attaining which one becomes immortal, That by  
becoming which one does not return to this cycle of births and deaths  and be  
always happy, without the least trace of thought.   
24\. Abide as That, on realizing and experiencing the bliss of which, all joys  
appear to be the joys of That, That which, when clearly known to be oneself,  
shows there is nothing apart from oneself, and, knowing which,all kinds of  
separate souls become liberated  and be always happy,without the least trace  
of thought.   
25\. Abide as That, on realizing which to be oneself, there is nothing else to  
be known, everything becomes already known and every purpose accomplished   
and be always happy, without the least trace of thought.   
 **26\. Abide as That which is attained easily when one is convinced that one  
is not different from the Supreme Absolute, That which results, when that  
conviction becomes firm, in the experience of the Supreme Bliss of the Real,  
That which produces a sense of incomparable and complete satisfaction when the  
mind is absorbed in It  and be always happy,without the least trace of  
thought.   
27\. Abide as That which leads to the complete cessation of misery when the  
mind is absorbed in It, and the extinction of all ideas of I, you and  
another, and the disappearance of al differences  and be always happy,  
without the least trace of thought.**   
28\. Abide as That in which, when the mind is absorbed in It, one remains  
without a second, nothing other than oneself is seen to exist and incomparable  
bliss is experienced  and be always happy, without the least trace of  
thought.   
29\. Abide as That which is undifferentiated Existence, undifferentiated  
Consciousness, undifferentiated Bliss, absolutely non-dual, the  
undifferentiated Absolute Reality  and with the firm conviction that you are  
That, be always happy.   
30\. Abide as That which is I as well as you as well as everyone else, is  
the basis of all, is one without anything else whatsoever, is extremely pure,  
the undifferentiated Whole  and with the firmconviction that you are That, be  
always happy.   
 **31\. Abide as That in which there are no concepts or anything else  
whatsoever, the ego ceases to exist, all desires disappear, the mind becomes  
extinct and all confusions come to an end  and with the firm conviction that  
you are That, be always happy.**   
32\. Abide as That in which there is no awareness of the body, or the various  
functions of manifest existence, no perception of objects, That in which the  
mind is dead, the soul become one with the Reality,thoughts dissolved and even  
ones convictions no longer hold  and with the firm conviction that you are  
That, be always happy.   
33\. Abide as That in which there is no longer any meditative spiritual  
practice or ignorance or knowledge or activities of any kind, that which is  
the Supreme Reality  and with the firm conviction that you are That, be  
always happy.   
34\. Abide as That in which, when one is completely merged with It, one  
experiences pure bliss, never experiences misery, sees nothing, does not take  
birth again, never thinks oneself to be a separate individual,becomes the  
Supreme Being and with the conviction that you are That,be always happy.   
35\. Abide as That which is truly the Supreme Absolute Reality, the Supreme  
Formless God, the absolutely pure Being, the Supreme State, Absolute  
Consciousness, the Supreme Truth  and with the conviction that you are That,  
be always happy.   
36\. Abide as That which is the absolutely pure Supreme Being, absolute Bliss,  
the supremely subtle Being, the Self-Effulgent, non-dual and undifferentiated  
One  and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.   
37\. Abide as That which is absolute Truth, supreme Tranquility, eternal  
Being, absolutely attributeless, the Self, the absolutely undifferentiated  
Supreme Being  and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.   
38\. Abide as That which is everything from the experiential point of view and  
nothing from the absolute point of view, Existence Consciousness-Bliss,  
always tranquil, with nothing separate from It, the self-existent Being and  
with the conviction that you are That be always happy.   
39\. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to you the state of being one  
with the Supreme Being. By constantly thinking that you are the  
undifferentiated Supreme Being you can attain that state and enjoy constant  
bliss. There after, having become the Supreme Absolute Reality, you will never  
experience the misery that comes from   
identification with birth and death.   
40\. Everything is the Supreme Being, which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss,  
and I am That By constantly cultivating this pure thought, get rid of impure  
thoughts. Then, my son, discarding even that thought and always inhering in  
the State of Fullness, you will become the non-dual and undifferentiated  
Supreme Being and attain liberation.   
 **41\. Pure and impure thoughts are a feature of the mind. There are no  
wandering thoughts in the Supreme Being. Therefore, abide as That and, free  
from the pure and impure thoughts of the mind, remain still like a stone or a  
log of wood. You will then be always happy.   
42\. By constantly thinking of the undifferentiated Supreme Being and  
forgetting thereby all thoughts, including the thought of the Supreme Being,  
you will become the all-comprehensive Supreme Being. Even a great sinner who  
hears and understands this teaching will get rid of all his sins and become  
the undifferentiated Supreme Being.**   
43\. The endless textbooks of spiritual instruction have already prescribed  
meditation for attaining purity of mind. In order that those who have become  
pure in mind may easily attain liberation and, realizing that they are  
absolute and boundless Bliss, remain still like a stone in the  
undifferentiated and all-comprehensive Supreme Formless God, the nature of  
this immaculate state has been expounded by me.   
 **44\. Therefore, attaining purity of mind by constantly thinking that  
everything that is known is the Supreme Being and that Supreme Being is  
oneself, and thereafter abiding in the state of complete identity with the  
Absolute Reality, liberation can be attained here and now. I have spoken the  
truth. In this manner, Sage Ribhu expounded the true and full state of being  
to Nidagha.   
45\. When one is convinced that one is always That which is Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss and abides as That in a state of complete identity,one  
casts off the unreal bondage of identification with birth and death and  
attains liberation. This is the significance of the highly blissful mood and  
dance of our Supreme and undifferentiated God.**

## Re:[1] Forty-five Key Verses From The Ribhu Gita

Dear prasanth,   
Glad to read about Ribhu Gita and its important 45 verses. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to recommend Ribhu Gita to many devotees, and one   
kitchen worker was done so. She said that she did not understand   
head or tail. However, Bhagavan persuaded her to read it even if   
nothing is understood. Mere reading is sufficient.   
Normally devotees read Chapter 26 of Ribhu Gita, perhaps by   
the recommendations of Bhagavan Ramana. I think yours is that   
26th Chapter, which speaks about Abheda Nishta in Advaita Swarupam.   
N.R. Krishnamurty Iyer has selected 101 verses from Ribhu Gita   
and this has come as Sri Ramanasramam Publication. This is   
in English. Occasionally, I read the Tamil version of the Ribhu   
Gita. The book on this entire Tamil version is also from Sri Ramanasramam.   
Dr. H. Ramamurty and Nome have done an excellent English versification, based  
on the Tamil version. This is from West.   
Lingeswara Rao has also done a Sanskrit - English version.   
srkudai used to mention about this often. The entire Tamil version   
is available as audio in Asramam's official website. The Tamil   
versification has done by Tiruvidaimaruthu Bhikshu Sastrigal alias   
Ulaganatha Swamigal. He has also done Tamil Vivekachoodamani   
in verses.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Forty-five Key Verses From The Ribhu Gita  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: May 16, 2010, 09:31:02 AM  
---  
**Preface**   
âThe ego or separate soul is a concept(idea). God, the world, the mind  
desires,action, sorrow and all other things are all conceptsâ.   
 **Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi**, a famous Sage of modern India, attributed  
unique value to this lucid exposition of Supreme Truth. He often referred to  
it in his talks with devotees and seekers, and he is reported to have said  
that is one **repeatedly read Chapter 26 of the Ribhu Gita one could pass  
spontaneously into samadhi, or the natural state of Self-realization.**   
The Ribhu Gita, literally âRibhuâs Songâ, is Part Six of the Shiva  
Rahasya,a legendary mystical text of India. **The whole of the Ribhu Gita is  
said to represent the teaching given to the Sage Ribhu by God himself in the  
form of Lord Shiva**, the formless aspect of the Divine activity, in whom all  
beings and things are always already absorbed. The Sage in turn gave the  
teaching to his reluctant disciple Nidagha.   
 **The Heart of the Ribhu Gita**   
1\. I shall now expound to you the method of inhering in the All-inclusive and  
undifferentiated Reality. This teaching is secret and difficult to understand  
even with the help of the various Scriptures. Even celestial beings and  
practitioners of spiritual discipline who hold it dear acquire it only with  
great difficulty. Follow what I say and, inhering in Reality,be happy.   
2\. My son! **Realized sages say that absolute inherence in Reality means  
becoming one with the immutable, tranquil, non-dual Absolute Supreme Being  
which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and the Self of all, and making the  
wandering mind one with it like the proverbial milk and water, absolutely free  
from all concepts.**   
3\. When one scrutinizes this variety of manifestation one realizes that it  
does not really exist and that everything is the undifferentiated Absolute  
Supreme Being which is not different from the Self and oneself. Let this  
knowledge become firm with you by constant practice. Then,discarding  
everything, become one with the Supreme Absolute Reality and, remaining as  
that, be happy.   
4\. Abide as That which does not, when scrutinized, show any duality in the  
form of these various objects or the least trace of cause and effect, That in  
which, when the mind is absorbed in It, there is not fear of duality at all  
â and be always happy, unshakable and free the fear arising from duality.   
5\. Abide as That in which there are neither thoughts nor fancies, neither  
peace nor self-control, neither the mind nor the intellect, neither confusion  
nor certainly, neither being nor non-being, and no perception of duality â  
and be always happy, unshakable and absolutely free from the fear arising from  
duality.   
 _6\. Abide as That in which there is neither any defect nor good  
quality,neither pleasure nor pain, neither thought nor silence, neither misery  
nor austerities practiced for getting rid of misery, no âI-am-the-bodyâ  
idea, no objects of perception whatsoever â and be always happy, free from  
all traces of thought._

any other kind, neither sin nor virtue, neither attachment nor its  
consequences â and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.

the arising nor the preservation nor the dissolution of the world,nothing  
whatsoever at any time â and be always happy, free from all traces of

Illusion nor its effects, neither knowledge nor ignorance, neither separate  
soul nor Lord of Creation, neither being nor non-being,neither world nor God  
â and be always happy, free from all traces of thought.   
10\. Abide as That in which there are no gods and their worship, none of the  
three Divine aspects of Creator, Preserver and Destroyer or meditation on them  
no Supreme Formless God nor meditation on Him â and be always happy, without  
the least trace of thought.   
11\. Abide as That in which there is neither maturing bondage to the way of  
good works nor searching devotion to the Divine nor self-knowing wisdom, no  
fruit of action to be enjoyed, no supreme state separate from it, no means of  
attainment or object to be attained and be always happy, free from all traces  
of though.

forces,neither mind nor intellect nor fancy, neither ego nor ignorance, nor  
anyone who identifies himself with them, neither the macrocosm nor the

greed nor delusion, neither ill-will nor pride, no impurities of mind and no  
false notions of bondage and liberation â and be always happy, free from all

objects of perception â and be always happy, free from all traces of

practice or ignorance or knowledge or activities of any kind, that which is  
the Supreme Reality â and with the firm conviction that you are That, be  
always happy.   
34\. Abide as That in which, when one is completely merged with It, one  
experiences pure bliss, never experiences misery, sees nothing, does not take  
birth again, never thinks oneself to be a separate individual,becomes the  
Supreme Being and with the conviction that you are That,be always happy.   
35\. Abide as That which is truly the Supreme Absolute Reality, the Supreme  
Formless God, the absolutely pure Being, the Supreme State, Absolute  
Consciousness, the Supreme Truth â and with the conviction that you are  
That, be always happy.   
36\. Abide as That which is the absolutely pure Supreme Being, absolute Bliss,  
the supremely subtle Being, the Self-Effulgent, non-dual and undifferentiated  
One â and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.   
37\. Abide as That which is absolute Truth, supreme Tranquility, eternal  
Being, absolutely attributeless, the Self, the absolutely undifferentiated  
Supreme Being â and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.   
38\. Abide as That which is everything from the experiential point of view and  
nothing from the absolute point of view, Existence âConsciousness-Bliss,  
always tranquil, with nothing separate from It, the self-existent Being âand  
with the conviction that you are That be always happy.   
39\. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to you the state of being one  
with the Supreme Being. By constantly thinking that you are the  
undifferentiated Supreme Being you can attain that state and enjoy constant  
bliss. There after, having become the Supreme Absolute Reality, you will never  
experience the misery that comes from   
identification with birth and death.   
40\. âEverything is the Supreme Being, which is Existence-Consciousness-  
Bliss, and I am Thatâ By constantly cultivating this pure thought, get rid  
of impure thoughts. Then, my son, discarding even that thought and always  
inhering in the State of Fullness, you will become the non-dual and  
undifferentiated Supreme Being and attain liberation.   
 **41\. Pure and impure thoughts are a feature of the mind. There are no  
wandering thoughts in the Supreme Being. Therefore, abide as That and, free  
from the pure and impure thoughts of the mind, remain still like a stone or a  
log of wood. You will then be always happy.   
42\. By constantly thinking of the undifferentiated Supreme Being and  
forgetting thereby all thoughts, including the thought of the Supreme Being,  
you will become the all-comprehensive Supreme Being. Even a great sinner who  
hears and understands this teaching will get rid of all his sins and become  
the undifferentiated Supreme Being.**   
43\. The endless textbooks of spiritual instruction have already prescribed  
meditation for attaining purity of mind. In order that those who have become  
pure in mind may easily attain liberation and, realizing that they are  
absolute and boundless Bliss, remain still like a stone in the  
undifferentiated and all-comprehensive Supreme Formless God, the nature of  
this immaculate state has been expounded by me.   
 **44\. Therefore, attaining purity of mind by constantly thinking that  
everything that is known is the Supreme Being and that Supreme Being is  
oneself, and thereafter abiding in the state of complete identity with the  
Absolute Reality, liberation can be attained here and now. I have spoken the  
truth. In this manner, Sage Ribhu expounded the true and full state of being  
to Nidagha.   
45\. When one is convinced that one is always That which is Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss and abides as That in a state of complete identity,one  
casts off the unreal bondage of identification with birth and death and  
attains liberation. This is the significance of the highly blissful mood and  
dance of our Supreme and undifferentiated God.**

## Re:[1] Forty-five Key Verses From The Ribhu Gita

Dear prasanth,   
Glad to read about Ribhu Gita and its important 45 verses. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to recommend Ribhu Gita to many devotees, and one   
kitchen worker was done so. She said that she did not understand   
head or tail. However, Bhagavan persuaded her to read it even if   
nothing is understood. Mere reading is sufficient.   
Normally devotees read Chapter 26 of Ribhu Gita, perhaps by   
the recommendations of Bhagavan Ramana. I think yours is that   
26th Chapter, which speaks about Abheda Nishta in Advaita Swarupam.   
N.R. Krishnamurty Iyer has selected 101 verses from Ribhu Gita   
and this has come as Sri Ramanasramam Publication. This is   
in English. Occasionally, I read the Tamil version of the Ribhu   
Gita. The book on this entire Tamil version is also from Sri Ramanasramam.   
Dr. H. Ramamurty and Nome have done an excellent English versification, based  
on the Tamil version. This is from West.   
Lingeswara Rao has also done a Sanskrit - English version.   
srkudai used to mention about this often. The entire Tamil version   
is available as audio in Asramam's official website. The Tamil   
versification has done by Tiruvidaimaruthu Bhikshu Sastrigal alias   
Ulaganatha Swamigal. He has also done Tamil Vivekachoodamani   
in verses.   
Arunachala Siva.
