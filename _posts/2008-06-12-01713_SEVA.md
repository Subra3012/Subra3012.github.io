## Samdahi of Seshadri Swami and Ram Surat Kumar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 31, 2008, 06:50:44 AM

Dear SDBC,   
The "Samadhi" means a state of liberation and also a place where   
the body of the liberated Jnani is interred and a small temple or tomb   
is erected with Siva Lingam. There are such temples for two other   
great men in Tiruvannamalai, one for Seshadri Swami, who was   
with Bhagavan Ramana and who got liberated earlier. For the   
functions connected with the internment of Seshadri Swami,   
Bhagavan Ramana was present. Another one is that of Ram Surat   
Kumar, who got liberated after 2000 AD. He was a good friend   
of Asram people and he had come to Asram many times during his   
lifetime. These two Samadhis are very near to Sri Ramansramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

"i" am 51 years old and have had two western "teachers". These teachers  
honored all the "Wisdom" teachings as do i. i have photos of the most recent  
Indian gurus,saints on my home altar. Though the photo of Ramana stuns this  
consciousness into that silent stillness as do his sayings put forth by David  
Godman, etc. & in "Thus Spake Ramana Maharshi". i consider "my" body a tube of  
flesh seemingly used by consciousness for reasons personally unknown, although  
Ramana, Nisargadatta,& Meher Baba give thorough explanations as to this  
seeming "play" of consciousness. i also see no difference between jnana or  
bhakti since both respected Yogas have helped this personal self in it's  
emptying and erasure. This said, i feel a present urge to stay at or near  
Aranachala for an extended period of time if not even possibly the rest of  
this dream life as did Ramana. i am not trying to escape an unpleasant life as  
i have always seemed to live a grace filled existence, mostly because of  
seeing solutions rather than problems and of course surrender in the personal  
sense has been key to a less ego filled life and therefore less suffering. i  
live in a small simple rental on a beautiful 5 acre fruit farm away from any  
city on the island of Maui in Hawaii and earn an average income. i would have  
to save some capital in order to stay an extended period, although i would be  
able to get there if there were possibilities of staying for seva. i am in  
exellent physical health and have always been called on first for seva since  
cooking and cleaning and any seva has always come natural to this "i".Please i  
would sweetly welcome any input or advice. Thank You, Namaste, knowone

You can definitely stay in Tiruvannamalai, for a lifetime, if Ramana   
Wills. As an initial one time expenditure, you may have to buy a   
small apartment, in Tiruvannamalai (You cannot stay for ever inside   
the Ashram), for Rs 0.50 million (approx. US$ 12000.00).   
2\. You may have to get acclimitized to the tropic weather -   
ranging between 35 to 45 degrees celsius.   
3\. You may have to get used to tropical South Indian rice food, hot   
but tasty and water which is not sensitized.   
3\. Clothing is your choice, but Indian cotton clothes are the best   
suited, no suits, overcoats, woolen sweaters and shoes.   
All these will happen to you, if there is Ramana's Will. In fact,   
I saw recently many many "foreigners" who are thoroughly   
enjoying the stay in that divine place. The touring westerners and   
staying westerners are increasing in numbers every day.   
Arunachala Siva.

To Arunachala Siva,   
 Thank you for your timely response! As i live on a tropical island i am a little acclimated to humid weather though not quite as humid as my many friends who have traveled to and lived in India have mentioned. As to hot or even Indian food i have enjoyed both for almost four decades.Concerning purchasing an apartment or some type of residence there do you personally know of any or know someone who does. i did contact Indiaproperty.com and got on there list, i believe i found them on a site about Arunachala. Also i was recently told of the Indian government confiscating property of foreign nationals? Do you know anything about that? i have in-joyed reading your other posts. When i do come to Arunachala, Ramana willing, it would be so nice to meet such knowledgeable persons as yourself. Thank You again, knowone

Dear knowone, as far as I know there is no Indian law, confiscating   
property bought by foreigners, but there is a need to get prior   
approval for any non-resident Indian to buy property in India. This   
is not difficult for any genuine NRI buyer. But, since Tiruvannamalai   
is attracting western seekers in large numbers, the property in   
Tiruvannamalai is sought after very much. This has given rise to a   
good number of unreliable agents who dupe the foreign nationals.   
Hence, one has to be very careful. Please seek the advices of   
Ramansramam, who can guide you, not through this Forum, but   
through their separate e mail address: ashram@ramana-maharshi.org.   
With best wishes, Arunachala Siva.

Hi!   
First off: I'm sorry that I'm replying to such an old topic, and by the  
following NO OFFENCE IS INTENDED AT ALL, I'm just trying to clarify, for  
myself, Ramana's teachings. Ramana Maharshi is the being i respect the most.   
Why wouldn't it be Ramana's will? And isn't it in 'conflict' (in lack of a  
better word) with Ramana simple, beautiful and direct teachings, to  
concentrate on matters not concerned with attaining liberation, such as  
believing that he have a will after his physical death, and that, if he had,  
that it would change future events? Or believing the opposite, that it isn't  
possible, as well?   
Again, this is not a criticism. I have only read "Who am I?", but I'm planing  
to print his collected works from sriramanamaharshi.org and to read it.   
May all have 'luck' in their path towards liberation!

Dear knowone,   
Why do you want to go to Arunachala ? Why dont you practise at your own place.  
In truth, there is really no place where Ramana is not there.   
If you are sincere and a devotee... you should rather spend time on prayer or  
Practise rather than changing your place of stay.   
Changing your place of stay wont change you the person. .. change the  
person... so that you can see Ramana's presence here and now - where ever you  
are.   
So, observe your thoughts and feelings and become independent of them, soon.   
Practise the rememberance of yourself as Self and get liberated. The Self is  
Ramana... it is nearer to you than anything else. Even your body is farther  
from you than Ramana.   
What a futile exercise it would be to try to go to an alien land and buy a  
house there, stay there etc. Stay where you are... and find Ramana there  
itself. .. he is there as much as here.   
This is my advice.   
Love!   
Silence
