## Changes to the Rules relating to tourist visas

I am sure that most of the frequent travellers to India will be aware of the  
new restrictions applying to tourist visas.   
They state that there must be a minimum 2 month gap between visits - there are  
exceptions and these can be found at this link on the Ministry of Home Affairs  
website: http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/FAQ-TVisa210510.pdf   
The story online and in the newspapers a few months ago, was that this  
restriction was triggered by the activities of David C. Headley, a USA citizen  
who allegedly scouted for the terrorists who attacked Mumbai.   
However, after reading the information on the MHA website, it is clear that  
the real trigger for this action was the abuse of tourist visas by foreign  
nationals who simply left the country for one day and then returned with a new  
visa. Most of whom have no interest whatsoever in anything spiritual.   
I have to say that I agree with the restriction, even though it has affected  
me and will cause distress to many sincere devotees.   
What has not been reported, is that this restriction applies to new 'visa  
applications' also. There has to be at least a two months gap between the  
expiration of one visa and an application for a new one.   
I recommend that everyone reads the above PDF file.   
It is a shame that devotees and genuine spiritual seekers have to be  
restricted in this way, especially as frequent visa applications might even  
lead to the individual being refused entry altogether.   
Perhaps the Indian government might find a way to aid spiritual seekers and  
block the undesirable elements, especially as India is considered to be the  
spiritual heart of the world.   
I would add here that genuine seekers tend to spend a lot more than casual  
tourists and vastly more than the undesirable elements.
