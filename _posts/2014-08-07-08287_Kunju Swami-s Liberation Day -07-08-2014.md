Kunju Swami, Sri Bhagavan's one of the earliest devotees, attained Liberation  
on this day, at a ripe age of 90 plus,.   
Kunju Swami served as one of the Maharshi's attendants from 1920 to 1932. He  
was having a guru by name Kuppaandi   
Swami in Kerala, who told him about Sri Bhagavan. Sometime in 1920, he left  
his home in Kerala with great eagerness   
to have Sri Ramana darshan.   
When he reached the Skandasramam, he felt a thrill on seeing Sri Bhagavan. He  
narrated about his boyhood to Sri   
Bhagavan in Malayalam. And how he has been doing Japa etc., Sri Bhagavan  
listened to him with a smile.   
Later Sri Bhagavan said: 'First you know who you are. See from where thoughts  
arise. Turn your mind inwards and see   
in the Heart.   
As they sat silently, Sri Bhagavan's Gracious look was fixed on him. At that  
moment, all his confusions ceased and he   
experienced a peace and bliss that he had never experienced before.   
He worked as His attendant for 12 years. Whenever he looked into His eyes for  
any length of time, he saw a bright   
effulgence. He was also filled with a strange peace and bliss. After each  
experience he would come back to his normal   
physical state with a shudder.   
On several days Bhagavan's body would disappear in a flash and disperse into  
its component atoms. A little later,   
a smoke like form would appear and atoms would come together in a form that  
resembled particles of dust. Finally   
the body would reappear in its normal form.   
At Skandasramam, sometimes he never saw Sri Bhagavan lying on the bed fully  
stretched out on his back on his side.   
In 1932, after serving Sri Bhagavan as attendant, he felt an urge to devote  
himself entirely to sadhana. As he entered   
the Hall, he heard Bhagavan saying to others there that real service to Him  
did not mean merely attending to His   
physical needs, it means following the essence of His teachings, that is,  
concentrating on realizing the Self. This cleared   
his doubts and he shifted to a room in Palakottu to continue with his self  
inquiry and at the same time remaining close   
and regular contact with Sri Bhagavan.   
He continued to stay but inside the Asramam, after Sri Bhagavan's Maha  
Nirvana. He continued his sadhana till his ripe   
age of 90 plus and attained self realization. Thanks to Ganesan, his old age  
requirements were taken care of.   
He has written his reminiscences only during his last years, called Enathu  
NinaivugaL.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan has referred to Kunju Swamigal as ?Another son has come?. It is truly  
a very special blessing. Read from Swamigals? reminiscences   
I thought a great deal about how I should prostrate, how I should conduct  
myself before Sri Bhagavan. I decided to accept whatever he said first as his  
upadesa. When I reached Skandasram and saw Sri Bhagavan, I was thrilled. At  
that time my friend, Ramakrishnaswami, Perumalswami and Akhandananda  
prostrated before Sri Bhagavan. I did likewise. Ramakrishnaswami was  
pleasantly surprised to see me. He said to Sri Bhagavan, "He is from my  
village. He has been a sadhu from a very early age. It was he who sent me  
here." Sri Bhagavan nodded his head. Then Ramakrishnaswami said to me, "Please  
stay here. We shall be back soon." I learned later that Annamalaiswami, an  
attendant of Sri Bhagavan, had died of the plague and they were going for  
making arrangements for his burial. I heard someone weeping in the adjoining  
small room. An old woman cried, ?A gem of a fellow has been snatched away.  
What a tragedy!" Someone was sitting beside her. Turning towards them Sri  
Bhagavan said pointing to me, "Why are you all so upset? Another son has come  
here to fill his place."   
Guru's Command is Upadesa   
After a little while, there was no one in the place except me and Sri  
Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan had not spoken a single word to me. He took some flour  
from a small tin and put it in a vessel and poured water from his kamandalu  
and stirred it and put the vessel on the charcoal stove. I thought he was  
making some elixir and looked forward to it in silence. It was actually some  
gruel. He poured a little of it on a plate, got up and lifted a basket. Four  
pups came out with joy to the plate to drink the gruel. Sri Bhagavan tried to  
restrain them as he thought the gruel might be too hot for them. Sri Bhagavan,  
who had not spoken to me till then, said, "Catch the four." Immediately I  
caught hold of the four pups. After the gruel had cooled, he said, "Release  
them one by one." According to my earlier resolution, I decided to accept his  
first utterance as the first upadesa. "Catch hold of the four great  
utterances." I released the pups one by one, feeling that I should also give  
up my attachments. The pups with their stomachs full tottered along. One of  
them passed urine. Sri Bhagavan got up, washed the spot with water and wiped  
it with an old gunny bag. I had an urge to help him. I refrained from doing  
so, as I thought that I should not do anything without his permission. Sri  
Bhagavan came back after cleaning up the place. Then another pup fouled up the  
place, and seeing me restless, Sri Bhagavan said, "Clean it." I cleaned up the  
place. "Wipe the mind and keep it clean" I considered this his third upadesa.  
I experienced great happiness and peace.
