We cannot loose awareness but we can forget it.The literal meaning of   
sin is forgetfulness of one's own nature which is awareness.It is not   
permanently lost by conditioning but it is clouded and hidden underneath   
the conditioning which is commonly called the ego.Others help you to   
decondition yourself from the conditioning.Conditioning is a necessary   
phase in spiritual growth.   
Personality is a necessary part of growth. It is like if you catch hold of a  
fish in the sea and you throw it on the shore; the fish jumps back into the  
sea. Now for the first time it will know that it has always lived in the sea;  
for the first time it will know that, "The sea is my life." Up to now, before  
it was caught and thrown on the shore, it may not ever have thought of the sea  
at all; it may have been utterly oblivious of the sea. To know something,  
first you have to lose it.   
To be aware of paradise, first you have to lose it. Unless it is lost and  
regained you will not understand the beauty of it.   
Adam and eve story in Bible is significant,it is not a historical story but   
a story with psychological insight.They talk about snake bite there   
which means accumulating relative knowledge and because of that   
heaviness of relative knowledge one forgets his own natiure.This is not only  
original sin but also the only sin that is existing.Snake bite is   
provided by the society,school,university,teachers,parents,priests,   
politicians,fb friends.In this way there is apparent distancing of ourselves  
from our source of being.Then unable to bear that   
predicament involved in conditioning and personality one starts   
pondering what is my real nature,am i the personality,is it my essential   
being and in that way Self-inquiry starts which shows us the way   
to our source of being which is Self.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
I am in agreement with you. During the examination time, I have   
always experienced that about 15 to 20 minutes before the start   
of the examination are most cruel. I suddenly feel I have forgotten   
many formulae (I am a Chemistry student) and many experiments.   
At that time, there is no point also in seeing once again the whole thing. I  
become nervous. As the bell rings for entering the hall,   
I enter the hall with sweat and blue, which lasts till the question   
paper is quickly seen once. Once you read the question paper and   
start answering the answers come of their own accord, no forgetting,   
no lapse. This is exactly true in the case of realizing the I amness also.  
We forget or we think we have forgotten, but it is always there. Only our  
delusion [this is due to the world, as you have correctly said - the wrong  
conditioning by the objective world]   
is the sin and our forgetfulness of the Self is the sin. Once we   
come out of it and enter the great hall of self enquiry, we remember  
everything. Nothing is lost, nothing is forgotten, only a temporary lapse,  
thanks to this world of objective reality.   
Arunachala Siva.
