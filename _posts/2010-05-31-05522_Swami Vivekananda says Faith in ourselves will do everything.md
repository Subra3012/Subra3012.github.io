**Practical Religion: Breathing And Meditation (Delivered in San Francisco,  
April 5, 1900)**   
 **Another condition [for success in Yoga] is chastity. It is the corner-stone  
of all practice. Married or unmarried  perfect chastity.** It is a long  
subject, of course, but I want to tell you: Public discussions of this subject  
are not to the taste of this country. _These Western countries are full of the  
most degraded beings in the shape of teachers who teach men and women that if  
they are chaste they will be hurt. How do they gather all this?. .. People  
come to me  thousands come every year  with this one question. Someone has  
told them that if they are chaste and pure they will be hurt physically....  
How do these teachers know it? Have they been chaste? Those unchaste, impure  
fools, lustful creatures, want to drag the whole world down to their [level]!  
..._   
Nothing is gained except by sacrifice.... The holiest function of our human  
consciousness, the noblest, do not make it unclean! Do not degrade it to the  
level of the brutes.... **Make yourselves decent men!. .. Be chaste and  
pure!**. .. There is no other way. Did Christ find any other way?. .. If you  
can conserve and use the energy properly, it leads you to God. Inverted, it is  
hell itself. ...   
 **It is much easier to do anything upon the external plane, but the greatest  
conqueror in the world finds himself a mere child when he tries to control his  
own mind.** This is the world he has to conquer  the greater and more  
difficult world to conquer. Do not despair! Awake, arise, and stop not until  
the goal is reached!...

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says attempt to throw the blame upon others only weakens us  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 31, 2010, 04:28:47 PM

**Volume 2, Jnana-Yoga   
CHAPTER XII THE COSMOS The Microcosm (Delivered in New York, 26th January  
1896)**   
 **We do not look at our own faults; the eyes do not see themselves, they see  
the eyes of everybody else.** We human beings are very slow to recognise our  
own weakness, our own faults, so long as we can lay the blame upon somebody  
else. Men in general lay all the blame of life on their fellow-men, or,  
failing that, on God, or they conjure up a ghost, and say it is fate. Where is  
fate, and who is fate? **We reap what we sow.** We are the makers of our own  
fate. None else has the blame, none has the praise. The wind is blowing; those  
vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, and go forward on their way, but  
those which have their sails furled do not catch the wind. Is that the fault  
of the wind? Is it the fault of the merciful Father, whose wind of mercy is  
blowing without ceasing, day and night, whose mercy knows no decay, is it His  
fault that some of us are happy and some unhappy?   
**We make our own destiny. His sun shines for the weak as well as for the  
strong. His wind blows for saint and sinner alike. He is the Lord of all, the  
Father of all, merciful, and impartial.** Do you mean to say that He, the Lord  
of creation, looks upon the petty things of our life in the same light as we  
do? What a degenerate idea of God that would be! We are like little puppies,  
making life-and-death struggles here, and foolishly thinking that even God  
Himself will take it as seriously as we do. He knows what the puppies' play  
means.Our attempts to lay the blame on Him, making Him the punisher, and the  
rewarder, are only foolish. He neither punishes, nor rewards any. His infinite  
mercy is open to every one, at all times, in all places, under all conditions,  
unfailing, unswerving. Upon us depends how we use it. Upon us depends how we  
utilise it. Blame neither man, nor God, nor anyone in the world. **When you  
find yourselves suffering, blame yourselves, and try to do better.**   
This is the only solution of the problem. Those that blame others  and, alas!  
the number of them is increasing every day  are generally miserable with  
helpless brains; they have brought themselves to that pass through their own  
mistakes and blame others, but this does not alter their position. It does not  
serve them in any way. **This attempt to throw the blame upon others only  
weakens them the more. Therefore, blame none for your own faults, stand upon  
your own feet, and take the whole responsibility upon yourselves.**   
Say, "This misery that I am suffering is of my own doing, and that very thing  
proves that it will have to be undone by me alone." That which I created, I  
can demolish; that which is created by some one else I shall never be able to  
destroy. Therefore, stand up, be bold, be strong. **Take the whole  
responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of  
your own destiny. All the strength and succour you want is within  
yourselves.** Therefore, make your own future. "Let the dead past bury its  
dead." The infinite future is before you, and you must always remember that  
each word, thought, and deed, lays up a store for you and that as the bad  
thoughts and bad works are ready to spring upon you like tigers, so also there  
is the inspiring hope that the good thoughts and good deeds are ready with the  
power of a hundred thousand angels to defend you always and for ever.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says Faith in ourselves will do everything

**PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART I (Delivered in London, 10th November 1896)   
Faith in ourselves will do everything.  
I have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so; and as I grow  
older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. **He is an atheist who  
does not believe in himself.** The old religions said that he was an atheist  
who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is the atheist who  
does not believe in himself. **But it is not selfish faith because the  
Vedanta, again, is the doctrine of oneness. It means faith in all, because you  
are all.** Love for yourselves means love for all, love for animals, love for  
everything, for you are all one. It is the great faith which will make the  
world better. I am sure of that. He is the highest man who can say with truth,  
"I know all about myself." Do you know how much energy, how many powers, how  
many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? What scientist has  
known all that is in man?   
That One is manifesting Himself as many, as matter, spirit, mind, thought, and  
everything else. It is that One, manifesting Himself as many. Therefore the  
first step for us to take is to teach the truth to ourselves and to others.   
The whole idea of ethics is that it does not depend on anything unknowable, it  
does not teach anything unknown, but in the language of the Upanishad, "The  
God whom you worship as an unknown God, the same I preach unto thee." **It is  
through the Self that you know anything. I see the chair; but to see the  
chair, I have first to perceive myself and then the chair. It is in and  
through the Self that the chair is perceived. It is in and through the Self  
that you are known to me, that the whole world is known to me; and therefore  
to say this Self is unknown is sheer nonsense. Take off the Self and the whole  
universe vanishes.** In and through the Self all knowledge comes. Therefore it  
is the best known of all. It is yourself, that which you call I.

The Self perceives everything. The Self does everything. The   
Self is one without second. But this realization is hard to come   
unless one has faith within and realizes the Self.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was looking at Arunachala intently.   
Then He turned towards the devotees. One devotee asked: "Bhagavan! Are you looking at Arunachala?" Bhagavan Ramana   
replied: "I am looking at Atma."   
Arunachala Siva.
