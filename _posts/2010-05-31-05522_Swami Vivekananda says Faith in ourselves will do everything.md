**PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART I (Delivered in London, 10th November 1896)   
Faith in ourselves will do everything.  
I have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so; and as I grow  
older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. **He is an atheist who  
does not believe in himself.** The old religions said that he was an atheist  
who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is the atheist who  
does not believe in himself. **But it is not selfish faith because the  
Vedanta, again, is the doctrine of oneness. It means faith in all, because you  
are all.** Love for yourselves means love for all, love for animals, love for  
everything, for you are all one. It is the great faith which will make the  
world better. I am sure of that. He is the highest man who can say with truth,  
"I know all about myself." Do you know how much energy, how many powers, how  
many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? What scientist has  
known all that is in man?   
That One is manifesting Himself as many, as matter, spirit, mind, thought, and  
everything else. It is that One, manifesting Himself as many. Therefore the  
first step for us to take is to teach the truth to ourselves and to others.   
The whole idea of ethics is that it does not depend on anything unknowable, it  
does not teach anything unknown, but in the language of the Upanishad, "The  
God whom you worship as an unknown God, the same I preach unto thee." **It is  
through the Self that you know anything. I see the chair; but to see the  
chair, I have first to perceive myself and then the chair. It is in and  
through the Self that the chair is perceived. It is in and through the Self  
that you are known to me, that the whole world is known to me; and therefore  
to say this Self is unknown is sheer nonsense. Take off the Self and the whole  
universe vanishes.** In and through the Self all knowledge comes. Therefore it  
is the best known of all. It is yourself, that which you call I.

The Self perceives everything. The Self does everything. The   
Self is one without second. But this realization is hard to come   
unless one has faith within and realizes the Self.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was looking at Arunachala intently.   
Then He turned towards the devotees. One devotee asked: "Bhagavan! Are you looking at Arunachala?" Bhagavan Ramana   
replied: "I am looking at Atma."   
Arunachala Siva.
