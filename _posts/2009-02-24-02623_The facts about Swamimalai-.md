Swamimalai, is a village about 8 kms from Kumbakonam, past the   
river Kaveri. It is the fourth Abode of Muruga. In this place and in   
Pazhani, Muruga stays as a bhikshatana, wearing a codpiece and holding a  
staff. He is without his two consorts. The Hill is a small   
one, actually there is no natural hill, the hill is man-made, with 60 steps.  
On this, Muruga stays in the manner stated above. The innermost prakara is  
quite small, about 100 kms covering all the four sides. When you come down,  
thirty steps out of sixty, there is a plain area with one more prakara, in the  
open. When you come down all the sixty steps, you can find the temple of Siva  
and Parvati, as Sundareswara and Meenkashi. There is a big marriage hall  
here, where weddings take place.   
The hill must be quite ancient. Saint Nakkirar sings about it in his   
Tiru Murgatrupadai, which is dated 2nd century AD. There he says,   
that Brahmins chant Vedas all the time, and they remain in wet clothes after  
bath and chant mantras, and they remain youthful for   
48 years of age and then only marry! Arunagiri Natha sings about this place,  
in Tiruppugazh and he gives the same idea of brahmins chanting Vedas all the  
time in the temple.   
There is a Ganapati temple, about 500 metres away on the ground level, after  
crossing the Kaveri once again. Here the Kaveri for a change, goes round with  
a right turn, encircling the temple. Right turn in Tamil is Valanchuzhi.  
Ganapati in this temple, is having his trunk turned right side! This Ganapati  
is famous, he is made of sea-foam, no stones, no sands, no metals. Just  
condensed sea-foam.   
In order to protect this form, there is a stone window, with small holes made  
in an orderly fashion, so that the strong wind will not blow on the image.  
The image does not have any abulations, or flower decking. You have to see  
him, through the stone window only. Perhaps once in a way, they open the  
window and clean up the inner sanctorum. The image if just about 1 foot high.   
In the olden days, the sculptors before undertaking any construction of  
temple, will give in writing to the king, that they would do any difficult  
architecture, but not the stone of window of Tiru Valanchuzhi, the pillars of  
Tiru Perundurai and spherical 4 tonne   
stone in the Big Temple atop the tower, in Thanjavur.   
Swamimalai Murugan is incidentally, my family deity.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri sings in Sri Ramana Gita, "He is not in Tirupati,  
(Tirupati Venkateswara is considered Murugan image by archaeologists), not in  
Tiruttani, not in Swamimalai, but in Arunachala."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
The Tirupati Venkateswara is shrouded in mystery. Saint Arunagiri   
Natha in his song on Tiruvenkatam, says it is Muruga only. But   
Arunagiri Natha is famous for calling every god as Muruga. Even   
Siva is Murugan for him, the six-faced Siva! There are certain other   
factors too. Sri Venkateswara is adorned with bhilva leaves and not   
with Tulsi leaves. As you said, there is said to be long hair behind the head  
of the image. They say, "the conversion" took place during   
Ramanuja's period. But Azhwars like Nammazhwar who lived much before Ramanuja  
sings Venkateswara as Vishnu only. It is a historical mystery and religion is  
not for excavation. All gods are   
one and we have to leave at that. One of the first three Azhwars,   
I do not who, amongst Poyhai Azhwar, Bhutazhwar and Peyazhwar,   
sings: "My father has got fire and hand-drum, He has got conch shell and  
disc. He has matted locks and long flowing hair. Both are fit for Him!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian and Munagala,   
I have read that Sri Adi Shankaracharya has inscribed a Dhana Aakarshana  
Yantram just before the Lord of Tirupathi. Itseems When he came here, he found  
the temple in very bad state and without money even for lighting a lamp and  
since then, the temple has attracted so much riches.   
Also, I have heard that Siddhar Boghar has made another statue with Nava  
Bhushana which is hidden somewhere in Pazhani Malai. No body has been able to  
find this. But recently, about 3 years back there was some news that this  
statue has been found but is secretly kept safely by the Government. not sure  
about all these news and all.   
Last year I along with my family visited several temples in central and  
southern Tamizh Naadu. I found so many old great temples being ignored, with  
literally not even a penny to buy oil to light lamps in the temple. I became  
so worried by seeing so many temples ignored. My Heart sank. I was also not  
capable to help them. some deditcated Archakars somehow are managing the  
temple. very pitiable state of those great temples. all those temples have  
great historical and mythological significances. The state of temples in  
Tamizh Naadu is worrysome.
