44. Surely one will instantly attain the Brahman-state. The rare one, just by listening to this, will   
attain instant emancipation.   
45. This is rare to obtain in this world, rare indeed in all the three three worlds. 'I am Brahman -   
there is no doubt' \- thus alone one must contemplate strongly. Then  
renouncing everything, one   
must happily abide in quiescence.   
46. Taking recourse to the yoga of meditation supported by its limbs just as Yama (moral restraint)   
and niyama (physical restraints); realizing the illusive nexus between the  
physical world and   
the transcendental expanse of heart, smearing the body with sweet pleasure the  
holy ashes, having   
renounced the craving for sensual delights and the fettering sheaths, their  
joyous hearts seeking the   
Supreme, the votaries of Siva are transformed into Siva themselves.   
Thus concluded chapter 17, a dialogue between Ribhu and Nidagha entitled  
'Topic of the compendium   
of all systems of philosophy' in the sixth amsa called Sankara of Sri Siva  
Rahastyam.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
