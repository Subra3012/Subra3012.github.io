Hey, some mindfulness teachers nowadays teach "do-nothing-meditation". In it  
one really just doesn't do anything. It doesn't include enquirie (like who am  
I) but is it same as the meditation that sri Bhagavan thaught?

Dear Japo,   
Doing nothing helps if a person can truly do nothing inwardly. No thought  
should be pursued which rises but "released" in the inner space. This quickly  
leads to an absorption. During self-enquiry a person is keenly trying to  
inwardly observe from where the sense of "I" rises. The more a person abides  
in the deeper self, the more he is approaching a stage where he is doing  
nothing because of "immersion" in pure consciousness. The doing nothing of a  
saint should not be confused with idleness of an idler. Whether "doing  
nothing" meditation is same as self-enquiry depends on where the "doing-  
nothing" practitioner's attention is during the meditation.

As long there is one to whom this idea as to 'doing nothing' exists, so long  
there is a division here. Enquire who am I to whom this question/thoughts are  
arising.   
Doing nothing should not become an effort, if what you say is truth, it is  
Samadhi, effortless, Sahaja Samadhi. if there is effort, then there is vritti.   
Meditation is recommended to the one who has not realized his true self.   
The paradox is that,   
1\. One who wants to realise does all kinds of Sadhana.   
2\. One who has reslised his true Self does no sadhana, He just Is.

what is do nothing?   
Do you have such a choice?   
You automatically get dragged into things... into "doing". ..   
There is no choice there. .. thoughts do not ask our permission to come...  
they come. .. and before one notices, one is already into the things!   
What is meant by do nothing?

What is really meant by "doing nothing". Is it not doing work?   
Is it not doing speech? Is it not doing thinking. Can one really   
be in the state of doing nothing and do, doing nothing meditation?   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sad Darsanam, Verse 26: If 'I' rises   
or if 'ego' rises, everything happens. This ego or Naan is the   
pradama vikaram, the primary disturbance to the equilibrium of   
the Self. This ego can be killed only when one enquires from   
where this ego rises. This is in Sad Darsanam, Verse 28. How to   
enquire? With total attention, as one diver searches for a   
lost vessel or a ring that has fallen into the well. If one could   
do such an enquiry with the total attention of a diver into the well, then  
only one can know the ego and vanquish it.   
In between Verse 26 and 28 of Sad Darsanam, Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 27: The state in which the "I" or the "ego" does   
not rise, is really the state of the Self.   
I am not sure whether "doing nothing meditation" says all this.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan gave the same instructions as every other REAL Jnani - effort is  
required to realise the Self.   
Effort is even required to be effortless until the Sahaja state is known.   
You do nothing is deep sleep, fainting, etc. these states are NOT Self-  
realisation. Just sitting around is NOT meditation.   
The only thing that these so-called teachers are teaching, is how to  
effortlessly empty other people's pockets so that they can effortlessly enjoy  
their vices at your expense.

Dear Mr.Japo   
I hope that the the following article from "Day By Day With Bhagavan" by Sri  
Devaraja Mudaliar will be of some help to you on the subject.   
 _   
11-1-46 Afternoon   
A young man from Colombo asked Bhagavan,   
J. Krishnamurti teaches the method of effortless and choiceless   
awareness as distinct from that of deliberate concentration.   
Would Sri Bhagavan be pleased to explain how best to practise   
meditation and what form the object of meditation should take?   
Bhagavan: Effortless and choiceless awareness is our real   
nature. If we can attain it or be in that state, it is all right. But   
one cannot reach it without effort, the effort of deliberate   
meditation. All the age-long vasanas carry the mind outward   
and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts have to be   
given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is necessary   
for most people. Of course everybody, every book says,"SUMMA IRU   
i.e., Be quiet or still. But it is not easy. That is why all   
this effort is necessary. Even if we find one who has at once   
achieved the mauna or Supreme state indicated by SUMMA IRU,   
you may take it that the effort necessary has already been   
finished in a previous life. So that, effortless and choiceless   
awareness is reached only after deliberate meditation. That   
meditation can take any form which appeals to you best. See   
what helps you to keep away all other thoughts and adopt that   
method for your meditation.

The ultimate essence or aim of any meditation is to just focus on one thought  
and not let the mind outwards and remain inwards abiding as the Self. If one  
goes to describe this abidance, its nature, its state, it is going to be a  
futile exercise. Instead of analysing all and seeking answers and  
confirmations to all these queries, simply enquire the doubter. Like Ramana  
says, enquire who the doubter is and the doubter will vanish, there is no  
point in doubting, the doubter and his source has to be enquired upon.

Dear Nagaraj,   
In Mahayoga there is a comment that is made. .. where the author mentions that  
there are certain doubts that need to be clarified and certain others for  
which inquiry is best.   
The second kind of doubts include things like "how does a jnani help the  
world", "is sanskrit the best language" etc. The first kind of doubts are  
doubts related to one's nature. .. and confusions that are related to that.   
For example when someone thinks he is affected by thoughts. .. an explanation  
is needed. .. inquiry is after the explanation. Coz one who thinks thoughts  
affect him. .. will not be able to inquire either. such a person first needs  
to be explained how thoughts do not affect and then shown how he is not the  
Self. ..   
in other words. .. such a person needs an illustration of inquiry!   
Love!

Dear I,   
Yes, thats true, in Rig Veda, it is said - Ekam Sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanti.  
Truth is one, but ways are many. What I have realised is that, the differences  
etc... what each person perceives, the various ways or sadhanas one performs  
leads one to the ultimate Truth. Like all the way upwards in a mountain will  
lead only to the peak alone and no where else - all will reach at that peak in  
which ever way they come from. What happens is that when two or more people  
meet in one such junction of that journey, and when they speak and exchange  
views, it appears that one is going in one way and the other is going in  
another way, but when wisdom dawns to them, they will simply continue with  
their journeys without any doubt that both are going to reach the same Truth  
and are not different people as well.   
I have realised that contradictions and difference of views etc... are all  
correct, there is nothing wrong at all, infact there is no right or wrong,  
this way or that way. Truth is such that it is absolutely attribute-less.   
Both are correct. Therefore what ever we describe or talk, we are just talking  
about the Ultimate Truth alone. The Self is Unlimited. Even if a person is  
talking against the truth vehemently, it is still happening at the grace of  
the Self alone, and even if a person is talking about the beauty of the Self,  
it is still happening at the grace of the Self alone.   
It is all the manifestation of the Self alone. There are so many instances,  
where Bhagavan himself has given completely different answers to same question  
to different devotees. On one hand, He cleared so many doubts and questions of  
so many devotees and on the other hand he has also said, "all doubts will  
cease only when the doubter and his source have been found. Seek for the  
source of the doubter, and you will find he is does not exist"   
The Truth is such a Truth that everything points only to truth alone, even if  
one abuses, even if one praises, what ever.... there is just truth alone.  
anything and everything is truth. Such is the conviction.   
Ekam Sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanti

At this moment, I have the conviction to say that even sufferings and pains  
are also the Self. It is just when we see them as rivulsive that we think we  
are separate from the Self and that we need to get Self Realised. Are we  
separate from Self At any point of time? Infact the recognition of even those  
moments when we feel separate from Self is also Self is the Truth, the  
feelings of Separateness is also only the feeling of the Self alone. These  
pains and sufferings are not different from Self. When we begin to recognise  
this and accept these sufferings and pains as Self completely, there will not  
be any separateness. Self alone is.   
Sufferings, Pains, Happiness, Joy are all just the same energy or  
manifestation of the same Self. Like scientifically, one cannot know the  
temperature by touching extreme Heat and Extreme Cold, like they appear as  
just the same, similarly these sufferings and pains are the same..   
And when such a recognition happens, we would stop hating others and getting  
angry on others for their so called mistakes, etc...

Dear Nagaraj,   
Saying that suffering is also Self . .. how can mithya be SAT?   
Mithya does not exist. .. Suffering does not exist. There is only SAT. This is  
realization.   
The snake is also rope ? no. .. Snake is not there. .. only rope is!   
The mirage is also water? no Mirage is not there. .. only Water IS!   
There is no question of "suffering" being a "part" of Self. .. coz Self is  
Akandah. .. partless! one cannot divide it into parts!   
Love!

Dear I,   
By saying Mithya does not exist - are we not giving existence to mithya?   
BY saying there is no question of "Suffering" being "part" of Self - are we  
not giving existence to a suffering?   
That which is not there, why do we need to affirm that it is no there? which  
is why everything is Self alone.

Nagaraj,   
 There are three...   
SAT, ASAT, MITHYA.   
SAT is Self.   
ASAT is what is not there and does not appear to be present.   
MITHYa is what is ASAT but appears to be real.   
now your question "why we have to assert it is not there?", coz it appears to  
be there. it appears as if present!   
One cannot say i do not see all this... its seen. Like a mirage. its seen. so  
one has to assert that it is not present.   
But regarding flower floating in space. .. or the son of a barren women. ..  
there is no need to assert coz its not seen and not present !   
No choice here !   
The Statement "Everything is Self" means there are many things then?   
So. .. Self Alone IS! Those many things are not Self... they are non-existent!   
Love!

Atleast Shinzen Young gives these instructions to this meditation: "Examples of things that you can **stop doing** are: \- Intentionally thinking (as opposed to thinking that just happens to you)   
\- Trying to focus on a certain thing   
\- Trying to have equanimity   
\- Trying to keep track of whatsgoing on   
\- Trying to meditate"

Dear friend,   
Yes. You are correct. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says   
the same things as Shinzen Young. Deliberate thinking - he   
calls it as "thinking". Thoughts that come and go on their own -   
he calls it "thoughting". Thoughting comes due to our vasanas.   
This will go away in course of time. Deliberate thinking only   
should be avoided as far as possible.   
Arunachala Siva.

I read the article that snow posted. In it Shinzen Young says that other  
practices that can lead to same goal as do-nothing-technique is self enquiry.  
Now, of course there are many variations of self-enquiry and it has been  
founded in many cultures and it is used in many spiritual pahts. So I don't  
know if he means Bhagavan's self-enquiry. But still wouldn't this do-nothing  
meditation be the same as Surrender?

Once Annamalai Swami had intense sexual thoughts and he started   
feeling guilty within. He wanted to reprimand these thoughts by   
not eating for about three days. He did not sleep also because   
these thoughts were replayed in his mind. Finally, he came to   
Bhagavan Ramana and asked Him for a solution. Bhagavan Ramana   
said: "Okay, sexual thoughts had come. You were feeling guilty.   
Now by doing something like not eating etc., why do you want   
to perpetuate that thought? You are not the body. You are not   
the mind. You are the Self. Meditate on It.   
"The doing nothing", is nothing but avoiding doing something,   
be it good or bad.   
ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 39 says: Only when you THIHNK you   
are in bondage, the thoughts of bondage, and liberation, will   
keep coming. Now find out who is in bondage. You will find   
that you are ever free and such thoughts on bondage will   
go away. There will also be no thoughts about freedom too!   
Arunachala Siva.

watch whence they arise from. And the Source for these is the same. And in do-  
nothing approach, you don't do neither, but you just Surrender to the Source  
and wait It to get you!   
I have found that self-enquiry is more powerful method than doing nothing, but  
this comes from my very limited perception.   
Edit: Altough now this differentiation feels quite imaginary

Dear snow,   
I also thought about doing-nothing meditation is only total   
surrender. Bhagavan Ramana says two things: Nin ishtam, en ishtam, (Your wish is my wish)   
Be still and go by the way that guru/god directs you to go.   
The first is total surrender, and this must be equal to doing nothing   
meditation. The second is self enquiry, with occasional actions   
as per guru's guidance.   
Arunachala Siva.

I agree with you about the surrender part, but I feel like atma-vichara is  
rather seeking the source of the 'I-thought' than being still.

Hey, some mindfulness teachers nowadays teach "do-nothing-meditation". In it  
one really just doesn't do anything. It doesn't include enquirie (like who am  
I) but is it same as the meditation that sri Bhagavan thaught?

Dear Japo,   
Doing nothing helps if a person can truly do nothing inwardly. No thought  
should be pursued which rises but "released" in the inner space. This quickly  
leads to an absorption. During self-enquiry a person is keenly trying to  
inwardly observe from where the sense of "I" rises. The more a person abides  
in the deeper self, the more he is approaching a stage where he is doing  
nothing because of "immersion" in pure consciousness. The doing nothing of a  
saint should not be confused with idleness of an idler. Whether "doing  
nothing" meditation is same as self-enquiry depends on where the "doing-  
nothing" practitioner's attention is during the meditation.

As long there is one to whom this idea as to 'doing nothing' exists, so long  
there is a division here. Enquire who am I to whom this question/thoughts are  
arising.   
Doing nothing should not become an effort, if what you say is truth, it is  
Samadhi, effortless, Sahaja Samadhi. if there is effort, then there is vritti.   
Meditation is recommended to the one who has not realized his true self.   
The paradox is that,   
1\. One who wants to realise does all kinds of Sadhana.   
2\. One who has reslised his true Self does no sadhana, He just Is.

what is do nothing?   
Do you have such a choice?   
You automatically get dragged into things... into "doing". ..   
There is no choice there. .. thoughts do not ask our permission to come...  
they come. .. and before one notices, one is already into the things!

What is really meant by "doing nothing". Is it not doing work?   
Is it not doing speech? Is it not doing thinking. Can one really   
be in the state of doing nothing and do, doing nothing meditation?   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sad Darsanam, Verse 26: If 'I' rises   
or if 'ego' rises, everything happens. This ego or Naan is the   
pradama vikaram, the primary disturbance to the equilibrium of   
the Self. This ego can be killed only when one enquires from   
where this ego rises. This is in Sad Darsanam, Verse 28. How to   
enquire? With total attention, as one diver searches for a   
lost vessel or a ring that has fallen into the well. If one could   
do such an enquiry with the total attention of a diver into the well, then  
only one can know the ego and vanquish it.   
In between Verse 26 and 28 of Sad Darsanam, Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 27: The state in which the "I" or the "ego" does   
not rise, is really the state of the Self.   
I am not sure whether "doing nothing meditation" says all this.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan gave the same instructions as every other REAL Jnani - effort is  
required to realise the Self.   
Effort is even required to be effortless until the Sahaja state is known.   
You do nothing is deep sleep, fainting, etc. these states are NOT Self-  
realisation. Just sitting around is NOT meditation.   
The only thing that these so-called teachers are teaching, is how to  
effortlessly empty other people's pockets so that they can effortlessly enjoy  
their vices at your expense.

Dear Mr.Japo   
I hope that the the following article from "Day By Day With Bhagavan" by Sri  
Devaraja Mudaliar will be of some help to you on the subject.   
 _   
11-1-46 Afternoon   
A young man from Colombo asked Bhagavan,   
J. Krishnamurti teaches the method of effortless and choiceless   
awareness as distinct from that of deliberate concentration.   
Would Sri Bhagavan be pleased to explain how best to practise   
meditation and what form the object of meditation should take?   
Bhagavan: Effortless and choiceless awareness is our real   
nature. If we can attain it or be in that state, it is all right. But   
one cannot reach it without effort, the effort of deliberate   
meditation. All the age-long vasanas carry the mind outward   
and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts have to be   
given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is necessary   
for most people. Of course everybody, every book says,"SUMMA IRU   
i.e., Be quiet or still. But it is not easy. That is why all   
this effort is necessary. Even if we find one who has at once   
achieved the mauna or Supreme state indicated by SUMMA IRU,   
you may take it that the effort necessary has already been   
finished in a previous life. So that, effortless and choiceless   
awareness is reached only after deliberate meditation. That   
meditation can take any form which appeals to you best. See   
what helps you to keep away all other thoughts and adopt that   
method for your meditation.

The ultimate essence or aim of any meditation is to just focus on one thought  
and not let the mind outwards and remain inwards abiding as the Self. If one  
goes to describe this abidance, its nature, its state, it is going to be a  
futile exercise. Instead of analysing all and seeking answers and  
confirmations to all these queries, simply enquire the doubter. Like Ramana  
says, enquire who the doubter is and the doubter will vanish, there is no  
point in doubting, the doubter and his source has to be enquired upon.

Dear Nagaraj,   
In Mahayoga there is a comment that is made. .. where the author mentions that  
there are certain doubts that need to be clarified and certain others for  
which inquiry is best.   
The second kind of doubts include things like "how does a jnani help the  
world", "is sanskrit the best language" etc. The first kind of doubts are  
doubts related to one's nature. .. and confusions that are related to that.   
For example when someone thinks he is affected by thoughts. .. an explanation  
is needed. .. inquiry is after the explanation. Coz one who thinks thoughts  
affect him. .. will not be able to inquire either. such a person first needs  
to be explained how thoughts do not affect and then shown how he is not the  
Self. ..   
in other words. .. such a person needs an illustration of inquiry!   
Love!

Dear I,   
Yes, thats true, in Rig Veda, it is said - Ekam Sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanti.  
Truth is one, but ways are many. What I have realised is that, the differences  
etc... what each person perceives, the various ways or sadhanas one performs  
leads one to the ultimate Truth. Like all the way upwards in a mountain will  
lead only to the peak alone and no where else - all will reach at that peak in  
which ever way they come from. What happens is that when two or more people  
meet in one such junction of that journey, and when they speak and exchange  
views, it appears that one is going in one way and the other is going in  
another way, but when wisdom dawns to them, they will simply continue with  
their journeys without any doubt that both are going to reach the same Truth  
and are not different people as well.   
I have realised that contradictions and difference of views etc... are all  
correct, there is nothing wrong at all, infact there is no right or wrong,  
this way or that way. Truth is such that it is absolutely attribute-less.   
Both are correct. Therefore what ever we describe or talk, we are just talking  
about the Ultimate Truth alone. The Self is Unlimited. Even if a person is  
talking against the truth vehemently, it is still happening at the grace of  
the Self alone, and even if a person is talking about the beauty of the Self,  
it is still happening at the grace of the Self alone.   
It is all the manifestation of the Self alone. There are so many instances,  
where Bhagavan himself has given completely different answers to same question  
to different devotees. On one hand, He cleared so many doubts and questions of  
so many devotees and on the other hand he has also said, "all doubts will  
cease only when the doubter and his source have been found. Seek for the  
source of the doubter, and you will find he is does not exist"   
The Truth is such a Truth that everything points only to truth alone, even if  
one abuses, even if one praises, what ever.... there is just truth alone.  
anything and everything is truth. Such is the conviction.   
Ekam Sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanti

At this moment, I have the conviction to say that even sufferings and pains  
are also the Self. It is just when we see them as rivulsive that we think we  
are separate from the Self and that we need to get Self Realised. Are we  
separate from Self At any point of time? Infact the recognition of even those  
moments when we feel separate from Self is also Self is the Truth, the  
feelings of Separateness is also only the feeling of the Self alone. These  
pains and sufferings are not different from Self. When we begin to recognise  
this and accept these sufferings and pains as Self completely, there will not  
be any separateness. Self alone is.   
Sufferings, Pains, Happiness, Joy are all just the same energy or  
manifestation of the same Self. Like scientifically, one cannot know the  
temperature by touching extreme Heat and Extreme Cold, like they appear as  
just the same, similarly these sufferings and pains are the same..   
And when such a recognition happens, we would stop hating others and getting  
angry on others for their so called mistakes, etc...

Mithya does not exist. .. Suffering does not exist. There is only SAT. This is

By saying Mithya does not exist - are we not giving existence to mithya?   
BY saying there is no question of "Suffering" being "part" of Self - are we  
not giving existence to a suffering?

Nagaraj,   
 There are three...   
SAT, ASAT, MITHYA.   
SAT is Self.   
ASAT is what is not there and does not appear to be present.   
MITHYa is what is ASAT but appears to be real.   
now your question "why we have to assert it is not there?", coz it appears to  
be there. it appears as if present!   
One cannot say i do not see all this... its seen. Like a mirage. its seen. so  
one has to assert that it is not present.   
But regarding flower floating in space. .. or the son of a barren women. ..  
there is no need to assert coz its not seen and not present !   
No choice here !   
The Statement "Everything is Self" means there are many things then?   
So. .. Self Alone IS! Those many things are not Self... they are non-existent!   
Love!

\- Trying to focus on a certain thing   
\- Trying to have equanimity   
\- Trying to keep track of whatsgoing on   
\- Trying to meditate"

Dear friend,   
Yes. You are correct. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says   
the same things as Shinzen Young. Deliberate thinking - he   
calls it as "thinking". Thoughts that come and go on their own -   
he calls it "thoughting". Thoughting comes due to our vasanas.   
This will go away in course of time. Deliberate thinking only   
should be avoided as far as possible.   
Arunachala Siva.

I read the article that snow posted. In it Shinzen Young says that other  
practices that can lead to same goal as do-nothing-technique is self enquiry.  
Now, of course there are many variations of self-enquiry and it has been  
founded in many cultures and it is used in many spiritual pahts. So I don't  
know if he means Bhagavan's self-enquiry. But still wouldn't this do-nothing  
meditation be the same as Surrender?

Once Annamalai Swami had intense sexual thoughts and he started   
feeling guilty within. He wanted to reprimand these thoughts by   
not eating for about three days. He did not sleep also because   
these thoughts were replayed in his mind. Finally, he came to   
Bhagavan Ramana and asked Him for a solution. Bhagavan Ramana   
said: "Okay, sexual thoughts had come. You were feeling guilty.   
Now by doing something like not eating etc., why do you want   
to perpetuate that thought? You are not the body. You are not   
the mind. You are the Self. Meditate on It.   
"The doing nothing", is nothing but avoiding doing something,   
be it good or bad.   
ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 39 says: Only when you THIHNK you   
are in bondage, the thoughts of bondage, and liberation, will   
keep coming. Now find out who is in bondage. You will find   
that you are ever free and such thoughts on bondage will   
go away. There will also be no thoughts about freedom too!   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote from: Japo on May 22, 2010, 08:55:14 AM  
I read the article that snow posted. In it Shinzen Young says that other  
practices that can lead to same goal as do-nothing-technique is self enquiry.  
Now, of course there are many variations of self-enquiry and it has been  
founded in many cultures and it is used in many spiritual pahts. So I don't  
know if he means Bhagavan's self-enquiry. But still wouldn't this do-nothing  
meditation be the same as Surrender?   
Yes, I believe this is correct interpretation. In one video Shinzen Young  
talks about the symmetry of buddhist mindfulness practice and Self-enquiry. He  
says that in mindfulness you watch where things vanish and in Self-enquiry you  
watch whence they arise from. And the Source for these is the same. And in do-  
nothing approach, you don't do neither, but you just Surrender to the Source  
and wait It to get you!   
I have found that self-enquiry is more powerful method than doing nothing, but  
this comes from my very limited perception.   
Edit: Altough now this differentiation feels quite imaginary

Dear snow,   
I also thought about doing-nothing meditation is only total   
surrender. Bhagavan Ramana says two things: Nin ishtam, en ishtam, (Your wish is my wish)   
Be still and go by the way that guru/god directs you to go.   
The first is total surrender, and this must be equal to doing nothing   
meditation. The second is self enquiry, with occasional actions   
as per guru's guidance.   
Arunachala Siva.

I agree with you about the surrender part, but I feel like atma-vichara is  
rather seeking the source of the 'I-thought' than being still.
