People say all hidden desires only, are coming in our dreams. But enlightened  
people never get dreams because they never sleep like us.   
On the other hand our body is geting energy only in sleep that what doctors  
say. and we all should sleep at least 6 hours. If we sleep   
it is natural to get dreams. How enlighted people lived without sleep

Dear ramanaduli,   
Dreams are on many occasions responses to unfulfilled desires.   
But not in all cases. Many dreams are meaningless. When Bhagavan Ramana was  
asked whether He did have dreams, He had said that He used to see some temples  
in His dreams.   
Body does NOT require sleep. Body needs only rest. It is the   
mischievous mind that needs sleep. Because, in rest,   
the mind is not rested. It should be smothered and made   
quiet by sleep only. Thoughts, even after one goes to bed   
torment a person, whether he is rich, poor, healthy or sickly.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramniyan ji   
you say body does not need sleep but the mind. OK but after few hours sleep  
again the mind starts chatering. That time the inner "I" says, it is the time   
to take rest, still the mind talks, in few mts. there is no mind no dream,  
People say if u do dhyanam there would not be mind. But without doing dyanam'  
while sleeping also some time there is no mind.   
In waking state, during the day, I follow the advice of Bhagavan like giving  
grass to the bull. There is a funny state, hands do the routine work, mouth  
does some manthram, mind jumps here and there. i am seeing all it is  
happening,...what to do....just watching the mind, does not give any progress.   
comments please

Dear ramanaduli,   
Most of us are in the same boat. Perseverence is the only   
way. Mind does not chatter in deep sleep. It chaps un-   
inturruptedly while one is awake or in dreams. Western   
philosophers and psycho analaysts like Freud, did some   
research only about wakeful state and dream state. They   
were trying to give some sleeping tablets for sleep. It is   
Gaudapada who attacked the problem in his famous Gaudapada   
Karika and his commentary on Mandukya Upanishad. He is   
the man who had gone much more beyond the Western   
psychologists and told about the inter-relationship between   
Jagrat, Swapna and Sushupti states.   
Perseverence is the only way. One suggestion that Bhagavan   
had said: If you cannot control your thoughts, please hold   
on to one thought. One nama of god. This is the only other   
way to control our thoughts.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks. It is the way to control our mind to hold one thought. It is easy  
while siting and doing japa. But during the day time we have to do lots of  
work that time   
we have to apply our this same mind. That time also mind chats lot. Anyway we  
have to follow the same question Who I Am and to whom it occurs.   
In some birth it could be succeeded. Can you post more about Gowdapada.

Dear ramanaduli,   
It is said that dreams are useful because our mind can clarify and deal with  
some stuffs we faced during day which remain unsolved by the conscious mind;  
it is said as well that we would die without having those moments of contact  
with the Self in deep sleep, out of mind´s movements and thoughts. Don´t know  
if this is so, though.

Dear shadak,   
Thoughtless state is the Brahman. At the time of death,   
when innumerable thoughts are bound to spring up, it   
is a Himalayan task to keep oneself in thoughtless state.   
One Azhwar sings, "O Narayana, I may not be able to   
say your name at the time of death. So I am telling   
many many times now itself!" Unless one is in thoughtless   
state or in one thought of god's name in most part of his   
life, it would be difficult for him to stay thoughtless or   
with one thought of god at the time of death. Hence practice   
is essential from now on.   
Dear ramanaduli,   
Gaudapada is Sankara's guru's guru. Govinda Bhagavadpada   
is Sankara' s guru and Gaudapada is Govinda's guru. So he   
is the parama guru of Sankara. Gaudapada is quite well known   
for his famous 200 verses karika [commentary] on the 12 verse   
Mandukaya Upanishad. There Gaudapada had explored the three states of waking,  
dream and sleep states and analyzed   
the presence of Brahman in all the three states and beyond.   
Sankara has written a further commentaray covering both   
the Upanishad and Karikas. The entire work is tough and it reveals, almost  
all the areas of Bhagavan Ramana's teachings.   
Gaudapada lived immediately after Buddha sometime around   
3rd Century BC. There is one publication by Sri Ramakrishna   
Math, giving a nice English translation with further notes on   
MU and Karika. This is by Swami Nikhilananda. It should   
be available in SRK Math, Chennai.   
Arunachala Siva.
