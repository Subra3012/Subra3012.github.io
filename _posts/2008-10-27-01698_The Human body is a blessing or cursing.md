## The Human body is a blessing or cursing

Dear sirs.   
We all human beings got body. Take it commonly, irrespective of the sex. We  
know common man how he would take this body. We need not go to his views. But  
some sages they say it a obstacle for liberation, Bhagavan also says it is a  
curse, birth place for all disease having a body itself is a disease. On the  
otherhand many sages praise God for giving such a nice body. where they can  
see Him, talk sing and dance His glory. Can others give their own views.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 The human body is both. It is a curse because it is subjected to sufferings like old age, death etc.   
It is a blessing because it allows us to gain moksha.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Human body is the vehicle for a person to attain liberation. As   
Gangajal said, it is a blessing. At the same time, if you understand   
the stages of a human being, birth, growth, disease, senility, and   
decay, then it is a curse. It is left to us to convert the curse into   
blessing.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Human body gives an opportunity for us to do spiritual practice.With Jnanendriyas we can perceive Lord's manifestation.   
With karmendriyas we can adore the Lord.This body and mind is not ours,it is  
his property, so we must utilise it for his service only.   
Then the body is a benediction rather than a curse.

Dear prasanth,   
Human body is necessary to attain Sadhana. But if one tries to   
attain liberation, with the body, and for this sake he tries to keep   
the body with great care, then it is like trying to cross the ocean   
on a crocodiles' back! ULLadu Narpadu, Supplement, Verse 12.

Who is it a blessing or curse for?   
Find out who then see. Such would be Ramana's answer.

Sri Sadhu om swamigal in "Path Of Ramana",says that only human beings can  
attain moksha since they alone have the capacity to experience all three  
states,ie waking state (Jagrat), dream state(Swapna) and deep sleep  
state(sushupthi). Aftere realising that that these three states are not real,  
they can realize the fourth state, that is Turiya or Samadhi state which is  
a state of realization..In the case of Deavas, they can experience only  
waking state, In the case of animals, they can experience only sleep state  
whereas plants can experience states only between waking and sleep state  
.If Devas, animal and plants have to attain moksha, they also have to born  
as human beings. **Hence of all the births, to be born as human being is a  
great blessing.**

Dear Subramanian,   
 You are right that human body is necessary to attain moksha.However,If you want to practice sadhana, you have to take care of the body.If the body is afflicted with disease and suffers from pain due to disease, then in that state it is very difficult to practice sadhana..Not only we have to keep our body healthy but we should have healthy mind.As Swami Suddhananda says, if we are in the state of agitation from morning to evening and if we sit for meditation in the evening, then instead of meditation, we will get only agitation.If a person is struggling to get even one meal a day, and suffers due want of food,then any amount of preaching about spirituality to a starving person will not go into his ears.I am able to practice sadhana, because i am reasonably healthy and there is no need for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing etc.In this context, it will be of interest to read the philosophy Mr.Hugo Meier, a staunch devotee of Bhagavan who started Shantimalai Trust which is doing a yeomen service to people around Tiruvannamalai.When he saw poor people around TVMalai, his heart melted and his first task was to raise the standard of living of poor people around TVMalai by imparting skills,providing Cows for livelihood, starting schools and providing health care which are all necessary to keep the body healthy..After meeting their basic needs, he started preaching spirituality and the people accepted his teachings since their basic needs have been met.   
I am convinced that if I am not healthy and hungry, I cannot receive  
spiritual instructions because the pain to my body due to hunger and disease  
will not allow me to turnto spirituality

Dear viswanthan   
You are correct. That is why I had stated "body with great care".   
Perhaps the phrase "body with more than necessary care" might   
have been better. Bhagavan Ramana used herbal medicines and   
English medicines to the extent necessary. To take more than   
necessary care, like inessential vitamins, face lifting measures   
like cosmetics, or costly soaps and hair oils, daily shave to look   
more handsome \-- He did not do all these things.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes body care is very much required but it should not be the sole motive of  
our life.   
I find Sri Sadhu Om example as described earlier very apt.   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4466.0   
Without 'I am the doer' attitude Charity is very necessary and even bhagavan  
ramana used to feed poor people and he never used to take food before sadhu's  
are feed properly.   
Somehow whenever i recollect these type of incidents i really get frustation  
why is that i never got a chance to meet our bhagavan.   
Just a glimpse of his physical appearance once is enough for me please god  
please...   
Glory to Guru Ramana.

Dear viswanathan,   
Of all births a human birth is the most essential to work out attainment of  
moksha. I agree. But there are a few rare examples   
in the history of civilization, like cactus bush which was given mokshsa by  
Umapati Sivam, and Cow Lakshmi, VaLLi, the deer,   
Jackie the dog and a crow by Bhagavan Ramana. Some great saints   
had to take one more birth as living beings but not as humans, like  
Jadabharata, who had to take birth as a deer.   
Arunachala Siva.

Mana Eva Manushyaanaam Kaaranam Bandha Mokshaha.   
Mind alone is the cause for Bondage as well as Freedom.   
The mind is body as well.

Dear Subramanian,   
 I agree with you that Bhagavan led a simple living with minimum requirement for sustenance and his life was his message.I have never seen Bhagavan wearing chappals in any photos or videos..Also there is no photo showing garland around his neck nor he wearing flower crown (Malar kridam)around his neck nor rudraksham mala around his neck which are all common with modern gurus.In the group photos of Bhagaan, we can see devotees sitting along with him side by side whereas wrt modern gurus, deotoees will not be allowed to sit in same level along with gurus. **Bhagavan fits hundred percent wrt to qualification prescribed in scriptures for Jeevan Muktas**. **. Now a days,there are many gurus and the devotees are confused whether the guru is real or fake and the devotees fall into trap.Such devotees can easily recognize a real guru if they compare the life of such gurus with that of Bhagavan to conclude whether such guru is real or fake.Bhagavan Ramana is a Gold Standard.**

Dear Ramanaduli, Human body is only a blessing. Every exsistence is blessing  
anyway. Even,human or not,everything will reach same goal sooner or later. If  
this body is illusion how it can be a curse?! Yes we sufer. But,we are part of  
Him. And we will exsist always. How glorious! Even without realisation human  
body is a blessing. We are realised anyway. We exsist,that is the best  
blessing we can have,i believe. And dont stop asking question if you have  
them. It is the way. The time will come when questions wont come anymore,by  
itself. With Gods grace.
