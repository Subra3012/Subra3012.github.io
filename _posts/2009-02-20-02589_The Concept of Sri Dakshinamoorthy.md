## Miracles Do Happen

When Bhagavan Ramana lived in Virupaksha Cave, He and His devotees would  
occasionally go to the top of Arunachala. Food for the devotees would be  
carried in a big vessel that was tied to a strong bamboo pole. Two people, on  
at each end, would carry it to the peak. On one of these trips, Mr. M.V.  
Venkatarama Iyer, who was strong and well built, carried the food along with  
Ramanatha   
Brahmachari, who was short, puny and frail. Ramanatha Brahmachari was at the  
front and Iyer was at the rear. They lost their way and found themselves in a  
place from where they did not   
know the route to the peak! At that point, they saw Bhagavan Ramana walking  
ahead of them, so they decided to follow Him. Three times, they got lost and  
three times they saw Bhagavan Ramana in the distance showing the way!  
However, when they finally reached the peak, Bhagavan was not there and had  
not been seen by other devotees also who were waiting for the food to come.  
When they all returned, Iyer and Ramanatha Brahmachari saw Bhagavan sitting in  
Virupaksha Cave!   
Both puzzled and astonished, Iyer said: "You are a great trickster!   
How did you manage to be present in two places at the same time?"   
Bhagavan Ramana smiled as usual but gave no reply!

## Tiruvembavai  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 21, 2009, 09:44:16 AM  
---  
Bhagavan Ramana has always commended Tiruvembavai and Tiru   
Ammanai of Manikkavachagar in Tiruvachakam. These two hymns were composed in  
Tiruvannamalai, while the saint was going on giripradakshina. Muruganar  
composed his Tiruvembavai on these lines. This hymn is sung everyday in the  
Asramam during Dhanur month.   
I had given my own translation of Tiruvembavai during dhanur month, Dec  
2008-Jan 2009, in the Forum. Robert Butler has translated these songs in  
English and this appeared in Mountain   
Path, Advent 2006 issue. I shall give Butler's translation of a few   
verses in one or two posts.   
Verse 2: It starts in Tamil, as "Pasam Paranjyoti kku enbai....."   
It is ever your wont, both and day,   
when ere we speak,   
O Maid with flawless jewels adorned,   
to offer your love to that Supernal Light.   
Whence now your desire for this flowery couch?   
For shame, jewelled Maiden, is it then meet   
to play and jest in this holy place?   
where he come in grace the grace to grant,   
Of His flowery feet, that, all abashed,   
the Hosts of Heaven fear to adore!   
Dancer in Thillai's sacred Hall!   
God Teacher! Sivaloka's Lord!   
Are we not His lovers? all?   
El Or Empaavai!   
Butler translates the name as Tirvempaavai. I did it as Tiruvembavai.  
Because, I felt that the letter 'pa' in that place   
should be pronounced in between 'pa' and 'ba', more slanting towards 'ba'.   
The girl sleeping on the flowery couch, then comes out to join the others for  
bathing and going to Siva temple, on the early morning of dhanur-month. Why  
do they go to the temple. The poet says in   
Tirupalli Ezhuchi, to wake up Siva! Who is sleeping? It is we who are  
sleeping and not Siva! Her is ever awake constanly dinning at our ears to  
wake from this long slumber of life!

## The Concept of Sri Dakshinamoorthy  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 20, 2009, 01:32:01 PM  
---  
A clue to Bhagavan's role in this world can be discovered in His   
association with Sri Dakshinamoorthy, the manifestation of Siva   
as the Supreme Teacher. During His early days on Arunachala, Bhagavan said  
that he discovered a secret place on the north side of the Hill where lay a  
secluded banyan tree. It was here, He was stung   
by bees, for intruding on this sacred site.   
Who is this Dakshinamoorthy? And what is the significance of this figure in  
the advaitic tradition? And why do Bhagavan's devotees identify  
Dakshinamoorthy with Bhagavan Ramana?   
The first substantial historical record about Dakshinamoorthy is in   
Suta Samhita of Skanda Puranam. It is believed that Sankara studied this Suta  
Samhita eighteen times before composing his   
Brahma Sutra Bhashyam. Perhaps it was Sankara's familiarity with this text,  
which eventually inspired him to compose the profound   
Sri Dakshinamoorthy Stotram. Bhagavan Ramana's translations of   
Sankara's works include this Stotram, apart from Viveka Choodamani, Atma  
Bodham and Drik Drisya Vivekam. There is also   
a Dakshinamoorthy Upanishad, as part of Krishna Yajur Vedam, but some scholars  
regard it as a late interpolation into the canon. In popular worship today,  
there is a statue of this god on the southern side of the main shrine of Siva  
temples inn South India, though it is rare a temple is dedicated exclusively  
to it. In Tiruvannamalai,   
Mother's Shrine in the Asramam, has got an exquisite Dakshinamoorthy stone  
image on southern side.   
According to Hindu mythology, Dakshinamoorthy is a manfistation of Siva, who  
taught the four sons of Brahma in Silence. It is said that he sits under a  
banyan tree. (Vada Ala Vruksham). His left leg is crossed over the right knee  
in Virasana, his lower right hand poised in Chinmudra, which indicates  
Perfection, and his lower left clasps a bunch of palm-leaves to indicate that  
he is the master of the established teachings. On his upper right, he holds  
the drum which indicates he is in harmony with Time and Creation, because it  
is vibration which manifests as Form. His upper left hand holds a flame, the  
fire of Knowledge which destroys ignorance.   
There is a further esoteric meaning. Dakshinamoorthy is the Effulgent Self as  
revealed by Bhagavan Ramana. Dakshinamoorthy is experienced on the right side  
(dakshina) and yet he is formelss (amurti), that is limitless. Dakshinamoorthy  
is the very form of Awareness (Dakshina)... We find this interpretation in the  
Dakshinamoorthy Upanishad. Semushee Dakshina Proksha....   
The same idea is connected to Avalokiteswara, the Buddhist bodhisattva, whose  
name connotes the lord who looks down on the world (ava=descent; loka=world,  
isvara-lord). While Dakshinamoorthy or Avalokiteswara looks down in Silence  
and compassion, we look north or up to receive their grace.   
Bhagavan Ramana has mentioned a direct reference to Dakshinamoorthy, in Verse  
2 of Sri Arunachala Ashtakam. "   
Who is the seer? I sought within. I watched what survived the Seer viz., the  
Self. No thought arose to say, 'I saw'. How then could the thought that 'I  
did not see' arise? Who have the power to convey this in words?, when even  
you could do so in ancient days by Silence only? Only to convey by Silence,  
Your State, You stand as Hill, shining from heaven to earth!"

Dear Subramanian,   
Really its wonderful that a topic on Dakshinamurthy has come up now as Shiva  
Rathri is just 2 days away. I remembered this incident. It was Shivarathri day  
and the time was around 7 pm or so and all devotees were seated quietly in  
front of Bhagwan. one of the Devotees requested Bhagwan to teach them the  
essence of Sri Dakshinamurthy as there could be no better day to know about  
Dakshinamurthy as it is Shivaraathri today.   
Bhagwan assented to their request and said here it goes and remained silent,  
there was pin drop silence and it became 10 in the night, 12, 1, 2 - Bhagwan  
remained still and kept glancing each and every one. What a moment it would  
have been, I just paused typing. O Bhagwan I love you   
and finally Bhagwan asked them if they understood all about Dakshninam murthy,  
all were glowing and at perfect peace not even knowing that so many hours have  
passed and they remained still.   
What beautiful sweet words coupled with Bhagwans voice: "Chumma Iru" \- Simply be - Just be - Be silent - Be   
O Bhagwan I love you

Dear Ganesh_01,   
Siva is always Silent, mounam. He is also non-moving, achalam.   
For a change, He dances in Thillai, Chidambaram, which dance   
takes place only at the end of the aeon. He danced in Chidambaram,   
for the sake of Vyakrapada, the tiger-footed Sage, who composed   
Ashtadhyayi, the grammar of Sanskrit, from the sounds of Siva's   
hand-drum. He is also called Panini. The dance is also seen for   
ever by Patanjali, the snake-sage, who is incidentally the yoga master, the  
author of yoga aphorisms. Both got benefits from the   
dance of Siva, one made Sanskrit grammar and the other the Patanjali Yoga  
Sutram, from out of the movements of Siva's dance.   
Here, Sakti, Sivakama Valli, who is known for all her actions, fun and frolics  
is very quiet watching Siva's dance. That Sakti curls up into   
Siva in Arunachala, and the couple becomes Ardhanareeswara. Bhagavan says  
this in Aruanchala Nava Mani Malai, Verse 1. One more occasion in which Siva  
showed His Cosmic Dance, is for Karaikal Amma, in Tiru Alangadu, near Chennai.  
He is said to have   
changed his foot and danced in Madurai.   
Arunachala Siva.
