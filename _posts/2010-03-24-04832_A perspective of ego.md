## Thoughts on Easter - 04.04.2010

Gospel according to St. Luke: 24.1-12:-   
1\. Very early on Sunday morning, the women went to the tomb,   
carrying the spice that they had prepared. 2. When they found   
the stone rolled away from the entrance, 3. they went in. But they   
did not find the body of Lord Jesus, 4. and they did not know what   
to think. Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside   
them. 5. The women were afraid and bowed to the ground. But   
the men said: "Why are you looking in the place of the dead for   
someone who is alive? 6. Jesus is not here! He has been raised   
from death. Remember that while he weas still in Galilee, he told   
you, 7. "The son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will   
nail him to a cross. But three days later he will rise to life."   
8. Then they remembered what Jesus had said. 9-10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women were the ones who had gone to the tomb. When they   
returned, they told the eleven disciples and the others what had   
happened. 11. The apostles thought it was all nonsense, and they would not  
believe. 12. But Peter ran to the tomb. And when he   
stooped down and looked in, he saw only the burial clothes. Then he returned,  
wondering what had happened.   
(Later the disciples met Jesus in the village of Emmaus near Jerusalem! Jesus  
asked: "What do you mean, you were telling that I do not know what was  
happening there in Jerusalem during the last few days." The two disciples  
answered: From what they told us in Jerusalem, we know that Jesus was a  
powerful prophet, who   
pleased God and all the people... Jesus then led his disciples out to Bethany  
where he raised his hands and blessed them. As he was doing this, he left and  
was taken up to the heaven.)   
On this day of resurrection of Jesus, the son of Man, let us pray to the son  
of Siva, Bhagavan Ramana to do what would please Him and love all the people.   
Happy Easter, with hot cross buns!   
Arunachala Siva.

## A perspective of ego  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 24, 2010, 09:53:03 AM

Different persons often have different understanding of ego.   
At the grossest level, ego is considered synonymous with pride.   
When a person has pride, he is said to be egoistic.   
If a person is decent and humble, he is not considered as not having ego.   
At a subtle level, ego is considered synonymous to the sense of "I" which is  
identified with the body and mind.   
(This is more common in spiritual parlance where analysis of mind/self is  
involved.)   
Ego can be looked at from another perspective also.   
The higher self is infinite and infinite has to express itself as finite. So  
the entire infinity has expressed itself as the ego in the individual. Like a  
flag representing the entire country. The ego is then like a gate. On one side  
is the world and on the other side is the cave of the heart. The gate is  
common. Facing the side of the world, the gate is wide. Facing the side of the  
cave (of the heart) the gate is narrow. The ego interfaces between the  
infinite inner world and the infinite outer world. The ego can thus represent  
both the higher self and individual self depending on the "direction".

The word 'ego' itself is confusing.   
Originally it only means 'I' (first person pronoun) in Latin.   
It means pride, arrogance in common English usage.   
Again psychiatrists use ego under their own difinitions.   
And in advaita philosophy it means I-thought.   
I do not see it as the matter of 'gross' or 'subtle'.   
I see it as the matter of definition of the word.   
Why don't we use Sanskrit or Tamil term instead?   
This is only my opinion.

Aganthai (ego in English) means only I-thought. It does not mean pride,  
jealousy   
and other emotions. These are all auxillaries to the mind where the I thought  
is   
the first. If aganthai is taken to mean mind then, there is sukshuma, subtle  
mind,   
which operates in the dream state. In Tamil or Sankskrit, there are four  
words,   
Manas, mind, buddhi, intellect, agankaram, aganthai or ego, and chittam, the  
mind   
stuff. The Chittam is the pure mind, or suddha manas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Akira,   
As you said, it is sometimes better to use Sanskrit and Tamil words.   
For example, the word **_Sraddha_**, as Swami Vivekananda has said has no  
English equivalent.   
Swami Ranganathananda explains:  _This word sraddha has no exact equivalent in English; it is usually  
translated as faith; but it is not faith in a creed or dogma but faith in  
oneself, faith in the infinite power lodged in every soul; it is also faith in  
the power of truth & goodness, a firm conviction of the ultimate  
meaningfulness of the universe. It is the totality of positive attitudes,  
astikya buddhi, as Shankara defines it. It is the impelling force behind manÂ’s  
efforts at character development, his civic virtues & social graces, his  
search for truth in science & religion. Its total absence from the heart marks  
the complete cynical attitude._   
However when I said looking at the ego from a different perspective, I did not  
mean giving the exact definition of ego but a way of looking at it in a  
different way; in the opposite direction; self-wards, instead of world-wards.

Subramanian is an expert of Tamil.   
silentgreen is an expert of Sanskrit.   
I hope both of you can give us some Tamil and Sanskrit lessons here on the  
board.   
I am eager to listen.

Dear Akira,   
I am not an expert in Sanskrit, but a learner.   
However I would be glad to start a thread on some basic concepts in Sanskrit  
grammer in simple terms which I learned with some effort. This is not for  
teaching but learning. Experts in the forum can then clarify required points.

Dear Silentgreen,   
Perhaps, the 'higher self' need not express itself as finite, but somehow it  
happenes it does. As a "cosmic joke": self-restriction for some time.   
But this 'self-restricted object' always feels unhappy about it's finity.  
Fortunately, this object has been created flammable and can be burned in  
certain cecumstances. And anyway this self-restriction will be burned up after  
deth.

There are no two selves. There is only the Self. At the same time,   
the usage of higher Self and lower selves or Paramatma and Jeevatma, the Soul  
and the individual soul -- are quite common   
among the Vedanta teachers and there is nothing wrong in   
silentgreen or someone using that two words. But Bhagavan Ramana said only  
the Self. He even went to the extent of saying that there is only one mind,  
only vasanas are of two types. (Who am I?).   
Aham Vritti - "I" thought - The mind jumping out of the Self.   
Aham bodha - I Consciousness or Awareness, the mind curled   
 up in the Self.   
In between when the mind curls up temporarily in a thoughtless   
state for 'some time' one gets the experience of dance of I.   
This is called Chit-Sakti Natanam, the dance of Sakti, guiding you   
into Sivam.   
Arunachala Siva.

There are no two selves.   
However the Infinite Self with the aspect of Shakti can express itself as  
finite selves for its own leela (play).   
When a person gets a little joy, he tries to express himself in so many ways.  
The joy of Sat-Chid-Ananda is an ocean. So It also expresses itself as the  
finite world.   
I feel the aspect of Shiva and Shakti together expresses the harmony of the  
finite and the infinite.   
There are some who tries to go to the extreme and say there is only infinite  
and no finite.   
There are others who go to the other extreme and say stick to the dualistic  
views only.   
But I feel the combination expresses the creation appropriately. One should be  
as comfortable with the dualistic attitude as the non-dual attitude and any  
combination in between. The finite and the infinite will interplay with  
smoothness.   
Sri Ramakrishna was described as bhava-sagara, whose spiritual moods changed  
between finite and infinite as if God is playing the divine music through him,  
striking notes from the lowest in scale to the highest.   
When we see from the ego towards the world (without abiding in self), it is  
the worldly outlook.   
By self-enquiry, the ego turns back towards its own source and gets lost in  
pure space.   
So it is as if the infinite has expressed Itself as the finite through the ego  
(individual "I" sense).

The ego is the source of much unhappiness, what a relief to realise that when  
it tells me I'm rubbish, it holds no water. When it tells me I'm great - it  
holds no water - how nice to just be, without this worry or the need to be  
something else, or to worry about tomorrow.
