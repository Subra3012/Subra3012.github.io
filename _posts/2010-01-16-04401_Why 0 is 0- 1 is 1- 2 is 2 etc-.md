## Oh, is it you?

One afternoon, an old widow, about 60 years old, came with a   
group of women into the Old Hall, prostrated to Bhagavan Ramana   
and stood for sometime. Bhagavan Ramana looked at her and   
exclaimed: "Oh, Is it you?" The old lady became very shy and   
simply rushed out of the Old Hall.   
Bhagavan then told the devotees: Do you know who she is?   
Her family and my family were living in Tiruchuzhi in the same   
house in two portions. I used to go into our kitchen and help   
my mother in some odd jobs in cooking. Amma used to say   
that this girl would be married to me! However, this girl's   
mother used to say: "O, How can I marry my daughter to this   
boy, who always wears a codpiece and help his mother in cooking   
like a female?"   
Bhagavan continued: "Thank God, I did not marry her. There was   
no marriage in my life. Otherwise, what would have happened to   
me now?"   
The devotees laughed heartily, about the hidden meaning in   
Bhagavan Ramana's words!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Attend to the work for which you have come!

Bhagavan Ramana invariably used to tell devotees, Vandha   
Velaiyai Paar.... i.e Attend to the work for which you have come!   
We, human beings have all come here to this world, for the   
purpose of attaining salvation. That is the work for which we   
have come.   
Once a devotee was sleeping in the middle of the Old Hall.   
He would come promptly by 8 am and started dozing off, whether   
there were conversations or not. One attendant was annoyed   
by this. He went to him and woke him up. But he would doze   
off in another few minutes. The attendant again used to do   
his 'waking up'. Bhagavan Ramana saw this and told the attendant: Oye, He has been attending to the work for which he had come. You attend to  
your work for which you have come! Why are you troubling him?"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Why 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 2 etc.,

Why O is O, 1 is 1, 2 is 2 etc.,?   
These numbers are called Arabic algorithms. Roman algorithms   
which came later is 0, I, II, III, IV, V etc.,   
Arabians fixed the forms of these numbers with some hidden   
principles.   
I want mathematical wizards in the Forum to respond.   
Arunachala Siva.

I heard indians are the first people who invented numbers. Especially 0.  
Sometimes I will the 0 has many meanings apart from mathematics.   
In day to day life if a person does not have common sense others say he is  
zero. means he does not has sense.   
On the other hand in spiritual field it is called sunyam and some people  
practice for this sunyata.   
But for me the same zero looks like a complete one. i.e. purnam., From, this  
purnam only all starts and we have to come to the end ( purnam) i,e,   
completion. All planets look like zero means it is a complete one. If you  
start from a bindu and try to join the bindu we reach where we started. The  
joining is looks like a journey.   
The bindu also has great meaning in our hindu culture. Lalitha thripurasundari  
is called bindu vasini, in sri vidya cult. From Her i.e. from bindu jivas are  
taking journey and if jivas are careful to join the bindu i.e. Goddess then we  
become purnam. There are so many meanings hidden in this zero.
