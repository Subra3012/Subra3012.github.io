Dear non duel, It is quite sometime, since we heard from you.   
Today's menu is Kothavariakai Kootu. Kothavaraikai is called   
Indian culster beans. It is narrower in size than the regular   
beans, with a needle like top. It is more tasty.   
Cut kothavarai kai into small pieces, after throwing away the   
neddle tops. Keep them in a basin of water. Take a pan,   
put tamarind paste and water and boil it. Add required salt,   
coriander and asafoetiday. When it is boiling, mix the cut pieces   
of kothavarai kai and stir and boil it further till the whole thing   
becomes a thick gravy. Put off the burner. Take separately,   
a pan, put gingeley oil, mustard seeds, bengal gram and toor dhal   
heat the mixture, till mustard seeds start bursting. Put off the   
burner and add the mixture to the thick gravy. Add coriander   
and curry leaves and stir thoroughly.   
Kothavarai kai kootu is ready. This can be taken with rice or   
bread.   
Arunachala Siva.

No no sir! Discussing lives of Saints is not just reading from books   
its very enlightening to discuss lives of these saints and see the Scriptures  
revealed through them.   
I think we can discuss. They express scriptures through their lives. ill start  
a small discussion thread on Sri Ramakrishna paramahamsa shortly and if all of  
you are ready to participate, will show how such a discussion can be fruitful   
Love!

Dear Sankar and non duel, What I meant was that the life stories   
of saints can be read from books. After reading such books, the   
purport of the happenings in their lives can be discussed.   
Yesterday, srkuadi, wrote about Sri RK. Now, unless one   
knows about Sri RK and Saradhamani, Sri RK and Mathur Babu,   
or Sri RK and Bhairavi Brahamani, one cannot appreciate the   
the incidents and the purport of such incidents. Hence I   
suggested about reading the books containing the life histories   
of such books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs   
When I was going through this old mails, I came to know some meber want to  
write about saints life. Our India is punya boomi. It is the heart for the  
whole world to give jnana and spiritualism. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and  
from east to west we got plenty of saints who took avatar whenever it was  
needed.like samuvami uge uge. Among the saints, some spread bhakti margam like  
meera, some are pure advaitans, They roamed from village to village and they  
sang lots of folk songs, in their respectful languages. Some were sanskrit  
scholars their deciples recorded all in songs form.From south there are so  
many saints. as Subrahmaniyan ji told 63 nayanmar from saivam and 12 Alwars  
from vaishnavam. So we can discuss state by state. There are muslim babas, and  
sufis are also there. We are so fortunate to take birth in India.The tamil  
literature is called Deiva Thamizh. The literature itself contains lots of  
poems about the creator.There are so many siddas who wrote poems and did  
miracles lot still they live around Thruannamalai. Bhagavan also mentioned and  
saw them in His period. If you start this topic. This thread wil be  
everlasting flower in the spiritual garden. We get more chance to know many  
things

Dear Ramanaduli, Thanks for the post. The thread was started   
by Sankar asking for the life stories of saints. I told him that these   
stories can be read from suitable books. We can only discuss   
certain aspects of such stories. The srkudai, started about Sri   
Ramakrishna. I have no problem in narrating the strories. But   
these, as you have said, will be a long serial. Let us see what Bhagavan   
wills.   
Arunachala Siva.
