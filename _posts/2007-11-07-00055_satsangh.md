What is sat sangh?   
Is it meeting people with similar quest? or is it the pause that one takes to  
reconnect with his own self. If the latter is true, does that obviate the need  
to go some place for satsangh!

Satsang is being in communion with a sage/jnani or the company of sincere  
devotees. Satsang embodied on the physical plane is beneficial and a blessing  
if it arises; however, Bhagavan Sri Ramana's presence, the grace of the Self,  
is fully available in all places and at all times. You are in truth the Self,  
from which all experiences arise, hence going somewhere for satsang is  
unnecessary. Bhagavan told seekers that coming to see him physically was not  
necessary. Self-inquiry (Atma-vichara) or total surrender to the Divine were  
identified by Bhagavan as the two means of liberation (moksha), and these can  
be practiced anywhere and at any time.

Satsangh means being in the company of like-minded persons,   
with identical spiritual quest. Bhagavan says, that it is like   
having a Southern breeze, on a hot summer day and there is no   
need for hand fan. But on a higher plane, it means being in the   
permanent company of Sat (Self). Sat-Sangh - the company of   
Self. If other like minded persons are not available, do not go   
to cheats and half-baked ones. Better to stay alone and enjoy the   
company of Self, Which has got no time limit and fixed hours, to   
be with you.

Sat means being.Sat Sangh means association with the being,reality,self  
abidance.   
Inward Sat Sanga happens in profound self-attentiveness,self-enquiry.   
Mental Sat Sanga is far more efficacious than physical Sat Sanga.

Dear DRPVSSN RAJU, you are correct. But Bhagavan   
meant both being with Sat and being with jnanis or   
learned people, with identical spiritual quest. The   
latter helps you to clarify your doubts in practice.

yes, thats so true   
if someone is not in mental satsang, even if physically near a realized  
person, one may not really be in satsang!   
Mentally its just the recognition that Sat is here, ie, we are already in

Dear subramanian,   
 I do not deny that association with Jnanis is real sat sangh.But it is available for the fortunate few.So i wrote about the importance

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. The satsangh of Guru   
makes it easier for the seeker to tread the path of self realikzation.   
Bhagavan has said: "If jnanis satsangh is available, there is no   
need of 'niyama', observances of many religious practices. He   
has also said: "If jnanis satsangh is available, it is like a southern   
breeze, and there is no need for a hand-fan to get the flow of air.   
While Ganges will remove your sins, only when you bathe, the   
Karpaga tree will confer you wealth, only when you get it from   
Indraloka, coolness will be assuured only when there is cloudless   
full moon, the janani's mere look, will give all these benefits   
at a stroke.   
Arunachala Siva.
