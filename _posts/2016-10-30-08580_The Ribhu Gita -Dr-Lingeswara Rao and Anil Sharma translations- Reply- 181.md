27. I am myself the Self Light shining everywhere. I am myself Brahman, myself   
the body, myself the wholesome, the transcendent person.   
28. I am myself Brahman, the import of 'That thou art'; myself the self shining illuminator. I am myself the subsidence of individuality. I am myself the nature of   
Isvara.   
29\. I am myself the supreme Brahman. I myself am the inexhaustible solitude.   
I am the theory and thesis. I am myself the illuminating Self.   
30. I am myself the resplendent form. I am myself the completely blemish-less.   
I am myself the eternal Self, indeed. I am myself the pure, the lovable and  
the   
unlovable.   
31. I am myself the self abiding; myself divested of the body; myself the Self devoid   
of faults; myself abiding as the space.   
32. I am undivided and the whole; filled with essence and un-partitioned.   
I am, indeed, the indivisible bliss and the embodiment of the limitless.   
33. Being of this certitude, I am the perfect Self, Brahman alone am I, not   
different. I alone am the eternal Self indeed. I am the permanent.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
