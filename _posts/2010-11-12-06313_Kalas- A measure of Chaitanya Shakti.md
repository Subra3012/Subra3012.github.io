## Kalas: A measure of Chaitanya Shakti

In the scriptures, Chaitanya-Shakti is measured by means of kalas.   
Sandipani Muni also imparted this knowledge to Sri Krishna.   
According to this: Rocks, minerals and other inert matter have the lowest Chaitanya-Shakti of 1  
kala.   
Plants are the next evolution of Chaitanya-Shakti with 2 kalas.   
Animals have 3,4 kalas.   
Average human beings have 5 kalas.   
Human beings with higher spiritual capacities have 6 kalas.   
Saints have 7 kalas. The most advanced saints and sages have 8 kalas.   
It is not possible for saints to go beyond 8 kalas. A normal human body cannot  
sustain greater than 8 kalas. Beyond that starts the incarnations (avataras)  
with special sattva bodies.   
Varaha Avatara of Vishnu had special sattva body with 11 kalas.   
Sri Ramachandra incarnated with 12 kalas.   
When Sandipani Muni was imparting this knowledge to Sri Krishna and Balarama,  
he did not know that Sri Krishna was an Avatara. He mentioned upto Sri  
Ramachandra and said that in future other Avataras of Vishnu will incarnate.  
Sri Krisha incarnated with 16 kalas (Purna-Avatara), the highest possible  
Chaitanya Shakti. Amsa-Avataras incarnate with lesser kalas.

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice. I have also read about this in some book of SRK Math.   
Since Uma is Krishna in feminine form [Om Govinda rupinyai namah: -Salutations to Her who has taken the form of Govinda - Vishnu - Sri   
Lalita 267], she is also said to have 16 kalas. This is said in Sri   
Lalita 483: Om amrtaadi maha sakti samvrtaayai namah: Salutations to Her who  
is surrounded by sixteen Saktis beginning with Amrta.   
Then how about Siva? As Siva, he is concorporate with Uma.   
So he is also said to have 16 kalas. As Sadasiva, he has no   
kalas at all. He is Poornam.   
For mortals and particularly for Brahma Jnanis, these kalas are seen as the  
halo around their faces. Buddha is said to have halo stretching for half a  
mile all on sides. Bhagavan Ramana [as one   
tried to measure], is said to have a halo spreading on all directions,   
miles after miles. Bhagavan told this Tantric: Do not bother about my halo.  
See your halo first - a typical answer of Bhagavan!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jyoti,   
A 'Kala' is the portion of divine power vested with avatara or even   
a spiritually evolved person, a Jnani. In Vishnu's avatara, the divine   
power was manifesting in each avatara to a degree. Though Vishnu   
is Brahman, with total divine power, the avataras had varied powers. Of these  
avataras, Krishna is called Poorna avatara, since he had the complete divine  
power. Nrisimha, Parasurama, Sri Rama were not like that. They had a  
somewhat limited divine power. These are all scriptural surmises. That is  
all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jyoti,   
So also is the case with halo, the glowing light around one's head,   
in case of Jnanis and avataras. This is visible only through some siddhic  
powers of on lookers. Once a visitor who had such siddhic   
powers came to Sri Bhagavan and told Him: " I have seen the halos of many  
Jnanis. Buddha's halo was one mile long on either side.   
Aurobindo's was only half a mile long on either side. Yours is spreading  
miles and miles on either side!   
Sri Bhagavan smiled and said: "It is alright. But why not measure your own  
halo?"   
Everybody laughed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan was Guru of Gurus and Gods. So, His halo spreads throughout all  
creation and beyond, none can measure it. He is Absolute Himself. Can one  
measure Absolute? Contemplate it.

Dear sirs,   
Like krishna Devi also is described having purna kala. She is called Showdashi  
and purna, pushkala.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Krishna Devi is Sakti. Krishna is masculine form of Sakti. That is why Sakti  
is also called as Narayani. Both are having all the 16 kalas. Poorna Kala.  
Sri Vidya Pancha dasakshari mantram, is having 16 letters. This must however  
be known and learnt through a competent guru.   
Arunachala Siva.
