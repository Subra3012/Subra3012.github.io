## Satvik Food  
Author: Anand Sundaram      Date: August 10, 2014, 07:08:46 PM

Dear friends,   
I wanted inputs from our learned friends on what can be construed as a satvik  
diet in the life of a sadhak.   
This I am writing seeking response with respect to an Indian diet, though i  
presume any response depending on the generality, could help other sadhaks as  
well..   
Secondly with respective to the following simple meals, I request some  
response on what care could be taken to ensure that components of below meals  
and hence the overall meal, remains satvik.   
1.South Indian meal -Rice with sambar (a south indian liquid gravy eaten wit  
rice ),Rice with RAsam (a spicy liquid) and rice with curd along with a curry  
made of any vegetable like brinjal,lady's finger etc fried in oil.   
2.A North Indian diet of chapathi (or Roti-Both Indian Breads) along with a  
curry (In curry there are various dishes possible).Here possibly an  
additional response that would help is which dishes to avoid and which to be  
preferred.   
Since the mind is made up among other things -of the subtle element that we  
eat - this response will help sadhaks to be somewhat choosy whenever an option  
is available to them.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Dear Anand,   
According to Sri Bhagavan, sattvic food is all vegetarian food. Eggs, meat  
etc., are prohibited. Bread etc., are also   
vegetarian food.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anand,   
Always resorting to home food at any cost is best practice, especially cooked  
by oneself or ones closest relative. It is a tapas to not eat from outside.  
Outside food is to be rejected at all costs, no matter how satvic they may  
seem. outside food is outside. Avoiding onions and garlic is a practice  
followed since the time immemorial, by the practice of aspirants.   
Eating very hot and very cold food (refrigerated) is not satvic, microwave  
food is not recommended. The food should not be very spicy, should be of very  
lesser salt and lesser of tamarind as well.   
It is said in the shastras, food must be eaten like this - "Half stomach food,  
one fourth is water and one fourth is for air - left free"   
We have to cultivate nurture our selves to become masters of our tongue. All  
Sages have said that all good things begin to happen when the tongue is tamed  
- by way of what we eat and by way of what we talk (speak less) Hence,  
observing vratas like Ekadasi is highly recommended. Ekadasi vrata is just not  
about not eating, all the senses are to observe vratas, the stomach observes  
fast, the mouth observes fast by not speaking much, the mind observes fast by  
not thinking worldly, the ears observe fast by not listening to the sundri,  
the eyes observe fast by not looking at sundry, and so on. this alone is true  
ekadasi vrata.   
When the tongue is mastered, all vasanas are over come without much struggle  
by the grace of God.   
Not eating at all is bad, eating too much is also bad. one has to discern ones  
own moderation suitable to ones body, biologically.   
Auvvayar says eat only when you are hungry, and you need not eat just because  
it is eating time.   
At the same time, one should not resort to extremes, one has to be wise and  
discriminative as the situation demands, but such demanding situations are to  
be carefully discerned.   
What is very easily digestable is basically satvic!   
If body permits, it is best advised to sit on the floor and eat, eating from  
table is only secondary. There is science in this.   
Also while eating food, one should avoid seeing TV, and such other  
disturbances. Eating food is worship of Lord, it is a sacred and ought to be  
carried in a slow and quietly.   
Finally, inorder to follow these virtues, if it is thrusted on family members  
against their wishes, there is no bigger mistake or sin. One has to take it  
step by step and it is Tapas, nothing happens over night. Win every ones trust  
by way of love and tapas.

The best solution for having the right food that is tasty, at the same time  
sattvic and also quite nutritious is to learn cooking and start preparing your  
own food at home and it does not matter whether you are a man / women. In  
today's complex Urban world it is mandatory for both men and women to know  
cooking and prepare their own food at home instead of depending upon cooks /  
caterers /hotels/ready made food stuffs /processed foods etc etc. They can be  
used for special occasions or during some very tight situations.   
It is never too late to learn cooking and though initially it may look quite  
complex but if you approach cooking as a "Spiritual Practice" in itself then  
you will not feel tired / bored but will approach each day's cooking with love  
and affection. If fact cooking was considered as a sacred act in Hindu Dharma  
. Along with cooking learn basics of Nutrition so that you get to know whether  
your food had adequate carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and fats. You do  
not have to buy any specific books for the same as most of the material is  
freely available on net.   
Today apart from food being sattvic we have to also focus whether we get the  
right type of nutrition as most of the fruits and vegetable as well as the  
other pulses and grains that we get from market are mass produced and lot of  
pesticides are used to increase the agricultural output and hence we just cant  
blindly take for granted that the sattvic food that we take also provides us  
with the right nutrition.   
The Saying "An apple a day keeps the Doctor away " is well known and also  
quite valid even today but we have to also remember that the Apple that we  
eat today is not the same one that was consumed by our Parents / Grandparents  
50 years back.   
Will share more on this topic later

thing fried in oil like poori can not be satwic food. also food main or side  
prepared, stored and eaten later is not satwic except may be like gruel.

This is from Tiruvachakam, Tiruch Sadagam (Holy Hundred), 5.10.1.   
மை இலங்கு நல் கண்ணிப் பங்கனே   
வந்து என்னைப் பணிகொண்ட பின்மழக்   
கை இலங்கு பொன் கிண்ணம் என்று அலால்   
அரியை என்று உனைக் கருது கின்றேன்   
மெய் இலங்கு வெண் நீற்று மேனியாய்   
மெய்ம்மை அன்பர் உன் மெய்ம்மை மேவினார்   
பொய் இலங்கு எனைப் புகுதவிட்டு நீ   
போவதோ சொலாய் பொருத்தம் ஆவதே.   
O consort of the lady with beautiful eyes, with mascera! After You took over  
me and gave me service to You (in Tirup Perundurai   
in building temple), I thought You are not a rare God and You are like a  
golden bowl on my hand. O Lord with Vibhuti on   
Your body, the true devotees have attained the Truth, that is You. However  
this person with falsity, why did you not   
allow me to attain You, but left me in lurch? Is it okay for Your  
compassionate nature?   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is again from Tiruch Sadagam (Holy Hundred), Tiruvachakam,  
5.10.5.   
வான நாடரும் அறி ஒணாத நீ   
மறையில் ஈறும் முன் தொடர் ஒணாத நீ   
ஏனை நாடரும் தெரி ஒணாத நீ   
என்னை இன்னிதாய் ஆண்டு கொண்டவா   
ஊனை நாடகம் ஆடு வித்தவா   
உருகி நான் உனைப் பருக வைத்தவா   
ஞான நாடகம் ஆடு வித்தவா   
நைய வையகத்து உடைய விச்சையே.   
Even the devas who reside in Heavens, cannot comprehend You. Even the end of  
Vedas cannot follow You and attain   
You. Even other persons who live in this world or other worlds cannot know  
You. However, You have out of grace   
and compassion took over me and governed me. You made this fleshy body act in  
this world at Your will. You made me   
melt and drink You. You made me perform the drama of Jnana. O It is Your  
will in this world towards me.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is from Tiruch Sadagam (Holy Hundred), Tiruvachakam,  
5.10.10: பாடவேன்டும் நான் போற்றி நின்னையே   
பாடிநைந்துறைந்துறுகி நெக்குநெக்கு   
ஆடவேன்டும் நான் போற்றி அம்பலத்   
தாடுநின்கழற்போது நாயினேன்   
கூடவேண்டும் நான்போற்றி யிப்புழுக்   
கூடு நீக்கெனைப் போற்றி பொய்யெலாம்   
வீடவேண்டும் நான் போற்றி வீடுதந்   
தருளு போற்றிநின் மெய்யர் மெய்யனே.   
I shall always sing Your praises. By singing like that I should become  
dissipated and met. I shall dance before You,   
melting in the process.I shall praise Your anklet wearing Feet in that Hall of  
Consciousness. This lowly dog should   
merge with You, while doing all these,. I should leave this worm filled body  
and all my falsity. I should praise   
You praying for Your Abode! Please confer me grace and Your Abode. Praise to  
You the Truth of the truthful   
devotees!

Dear sir,   
Thank you very much for giving Thruvachchakam with meaning. When  
Mannikkavachchakar calls himself a lowly dog, (Nayyen) how we call ourselves.  
His poems bring so sweet as Ramalinga adigalar says, therefore Siva Himself  
came to write it down.   
!. Mahabharatha is written by Ganesha while a human being Vyasa recited.   
In the same way Siva wrote Thruvachchakam as another human dicted.   
 Hope we can see more poems in this thread.   
ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
What you say is 100% true. The Saint merely sang the songs as he was going  
from temple to temple. Then he reached   
Chidambaram. He was quite tired of the journey and was taking rest in a  
choultry. Then Siva thought that these gems of   
poems should be written down for the benefit of posterity. In the early night,  
He came as an old brahmin and asked   
the Saint whether he could sing Tiruvachakam songs once again for his benefit.  
The saint though tired, started singing   
them in the same order, Siva puranam to Acho Padigam. The old brahmin took  
them down and then went away thanking   
him. Then Siva kept those palm leaves near Him in Chidambaram Temple. In the  
morning when Dikshitars came and opened   
the Kanaka Sabha,(Hall of Consciousness), they found these palm leaves. They  
sent word for the King and also the saint   
poet. They came and found to their astonishment written at the end of the palm  
leaves: Manikkavachagar solla,   
Azhgiya Tiruchitrambalam Udaiyaan ezhuthiathu !. ... (As Manikka Vachagar  
said, I, who stay in TiruchiRRambalam, the handsome   
TiruchchiRRambalam Udaiyan, the owner of Hall of Consciousness wrote  
down......) They then asked the poet and he said, that he did not know  
anything, but a brahmin came the previous night and took down his poems.   
The King and Dikshitars then asked for the meaning. The saint said: 'What  
meaning can I say? The meaning is only Him.'   
Then he showed while saying these words, to Nararaja and Sivakaama Sundari.  
Then immediately he became a flash of   
light and merged with 'Siva. The King then arranged a metal icon done as  
the poet and installed the same near to the other   
side (right side of Siva. Thus we can see today, the Saint, Nataraja and  
Sivakaama valli in that order. Then the king ordered   
the Dikshitars to make a copy of the palm leaves and then placed the originals  
under the steps on the right side as we enter   
the temple. These steps are even today are called : Tiruk KaLiRRup Padiyar.  
(The holy steps).   
Once someone asked one great scholar Sri Thyaga Raja Mudaliar to write the  
meanings of these poems.Then Mudaliar   
said: You want me to write the meaning? Who can write the meaning? Instead  
I shall jump into the river Kaveri and die.   
Such is the greatness of these poems.Later some persons have written meanings.  
Dr. G.U. Pope made it into English in   
the year 1900. He was a Jesuit father, who learned Tamizh for propagating his  
religion in Southern Tamil Nadu. He was   
in charge of a church there, in Tirunelveli. He was thrilled to read these  
poems and then said: There is nothing more devotional   
than these songs in any of world poetry. He shed tears as he made these  
translations.   
When he was in death bed, in London, he asked his servant to bring  
Tiruvachakam and read a particular verse. (See my next   
post). As he was reading this particular verse in Adaikala Pathu, he breathed  
his last!   
Arunachala Siva.

This is the verse Dr.G.U. Pope read while in death bed and then breathed his  
last: மாவடு வகிரன்ன கண்ணியங் காநின் மலரடிக்கே   
கூவிடு வாய்கும்பிக் கேயிடு வாய் நின் குறிப்பறியேன்   
பாவிடையாடு குழல்போற் கரந்து பரந்த உள்ளம்   
ஆகெடுவேன் உடையாய் அடியேன் உன் அடைக்கலமே.8.   
O Consort of the lady with eyes like split baby mangoes! You either call me  
to Your flowery Feet or place me in Hell.   
I do not know what You have in Your mind. My mind is oscillating like wooden  
piece that goes this side and that side,   
in the weaver's shuttle. I am crying, and horripilating. O Lord, I shall be  
lost and I am,this devotee, ever under Your refuge!   
Arunachala Siva.
