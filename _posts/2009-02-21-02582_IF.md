## Uma, how dare you marry Siva?

Saint-Poet Kalamegam visited the temple in Vaitheeswaran Kovil,   
near Chidambaram. He went to the shrine of goddess, the emerald-   
green Uma, called Thyal Nayaki, (the queen among women). He   
sang a song extempore in Her shrine.   
That fellow has got Fire in His eyes,   
And Fire in His lotus-hands,   
And Fire in His smile.   
His Form is also a column of fire!   
O Thyal Nayaki, how dare you marry her?   
you, the slender waist woman like a green creeper!

this may be pure imagination....but when i had darshan of arunachaleshwara at  
the temple i thought there was some fiery fierceness about Him!   
Uma was so lovely. they dressed her up in gold...She looked so gentle and  
peaceful....in contrast.

Dear vinita,   
Poets always revel in imagination. Seeing something naturally,   
and then running their poetic horse with all sorts of imagery.   
Manikkavachagar calls himself a dog lowlier than a lowly dog.   
Muruganar has said on many poems that he is a dog. When Bhagavan's  
Ucchishtam, that is, the remanants of food, were   
refused one day for him, he sang: "O Brahma, who knows nothing   
about Vedas! Why didn't you give me a birth of a dog, I would have   
taken Bhagavan's Ucchishtam, without anybody refusing it for me!"   
There are several such imageries in Tamil poems and should be in   
other languages too. Abhirami Bhattar sings in his Abhirami Andati,   
that Uma is like a cockoo bird in Madurai, a beautiful peacock in   
Himachala, a blazing Sun in Chidambram and a swan in Tiruvarur.   
Commentators are breaking their heads to find out this imagery.   
One at last found it out! She is a cuckoo in Madurai, as Meenakshi,   
singing melodious songs about her prospects of wedding with Sundareswara,  
Siva. After marriage, with a nice silk saree and the   
newly tied Mangalasutram, she is a housewife in Himachala. She no longer  
sings but makes up with all adornments like a newly married   
wife, to attract Siva and she is here like a peacock! She is the blazing Sun  
in Chidambaram, because Siva is dancing vigorously and the sages Vyakrapada  
and Patanjali are seeing His dance and there should not be any rain to disturb  
the dance and so she is the blazing sun to ward off the rain clouds! She is a  
swan, pure sattva white,   
quiet, sitting near the lotus, watching her husband Siva to run to Paravai  
Nachiar's house at night, to make peace in her quarrel with her husband  
Sundaramoorthy. Such poems make us dwell near god. My wife used to call  
Arunahchaleswara and Unnamulati, as the Cute Little Father and Mother, because  
both their images in Tiruvannamalai temple are short in stature, but majestic!   
Arunachala Siva.

Beautiful,   
Sahithya is the bridge between the human and the ultimate reality. This is  
what I refer to as mad love towards the God or truth. what can one do? we  
dont know how to become one with Bhagwan. in that frustration, the devotee  
begins to long for Bhagawan, he wants to become one with Bhagawan. Alas what  
else could he do? till then he can only relish the grandeur of the Allmighty.  
He begins to experience the Ecstasy of the Lord. Its all spontaneity that  
these dew drops of words come out from such poetry. Like how one makes garland  
for the lord, these poets gave the lord their garland in the form of poetry,  
Love, God is so pleased with such poetry. Murukan is one who loved such poetry  
so much that the result of it is the vast repository of Tamizh works left with  
us. Beauty is God. Love is God, Literature itself is also   
O Bhagwan I love you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
The great Tamil scholar, U.V. Swaminatha Iyer, came to see Bhagavan Ramana.  
He told Him with all humility: O Bhagavan!   
I am able to leave all my desires in life, (Patru in Tamil). But   
I am not able to leave my desire for Tamizh. (Tamizh Patru).   
Bhagavan Ramana with all His grace told Iyer: "Who asked you   
to leave Tamizh-patru? What is Tamizh? It is all Poetry, Beauty!   
Is not Siva all Poetry and Beauty?" U.V. Swaminatha Iyer was   
immensely pleased. He prostrated to Bhagavan Ramana. Bhagavan   
Ramana Himself was a great Tamizh lover. His poems are simple   
but highly poetic. He says in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai: " Is it not You who asked me to come? Now you measure* my life.   
If you feel sad about it, it is your fate!"   
(* measure has not many meanings. Apparently it means measure   
of food, for which the poem was written for Pazhaniswami. Measure   
also means measuring life's purpose, that is liberation. Measure also means  
"poetic metre"! Padi is the word in that verse.)   
Arunachala Siva.
