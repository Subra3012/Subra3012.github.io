Narayana or Vishnu is always quite serene. His job is to sustain   
the universe. He takes care of the entire universe, its animate and   
inanimate objects/beings. Why then there is misery, pain and disease? He  
does not cause these things at all. These things   
happen due to one's prarabdha. Right from the jiva is formed in   
the womb, prarabdha starts. That is why, some babies are born   
dumb, deaf, or blind. Bhagavan Ramana says that Jiva or Sukshma   
Sarira is carrying the mind and prana from the previous birth and takes the  
present birth. The mind is embedded with vasanas. These vasanas create  
prarabdha. He is blue in color, like the Pure Space. Like the Pure Space  
contains all the universe with its living and non living beings, He carries  
them all. Mother Uma, Siva's   
consort is also blue in color. She is the brother of Vishnu. He is the  
darling of Lakshmi. He keeps her ever on his chest. He is attained by the  
dhyana of yogis, who had done their chitta suddhi. He by this dhyana confers  
such yogis the great misery of again getting a birth, or samsara. He is the  
Master of all the universes.   
There is one more sloka, which says that all the prayers to all gods finally  
reach Kesava. Like all the rivers reach their destination only the ocean.   
Incidentally, the Tiruvannamalai Big Temple of Arunachaleswara   
is owned by Vishnu! The land and building rights are still with   
Vishnu, called Sri Venugopala Swami, as per ancient records.   
One can see his metal icon behind Arunachaleswara inner portal behind the  
Lingam, just opposite to Lingodbhava murthi.   
Arunachala Siva.**

It might be that a Vishnu temple was there where Arunachaleswara temple is  
located now.   
It is also said that Tirumala temple resembles a Shakti temple in many  
respects.   
Adi Shankaracharya is said to have installed a Dhana Akarshana Yantra there  
which might be a reason why the temple attracts so much wealth.

Dear silentgreen,   
Your surmise about Tirupati Temple might be true. Some old   
Tamizh books say that Venkateswara was earlier Devi, with long   
tresses of hair [which is now hidden with a huge headgear] and   
she had three eyes. The eye on forehead is hidden by the thick   
Trisuranam. God only knows.   
Saint Arunagiri Natha sings in his Tirupugazh that Venkatgiri is   
actually a Murugan Temple.   
In Panduranga's Temple, in Pandaripuram, on the crown of Panduranga, there is  
a small Siva linga!   
"There are such stuff in heaven and earth, O Horatio, that you   
may not even dream of...." Shakespeare.

Dear silentgreen,   
This is a tricky sloka. This is also used to pray to Lord Ganesa.   
When Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni had darshan of Sri Bhagavan   
for the first time, in Virupaksha Cave, he said this sloke and   
held Sri Bhagavan's right leg with his right hand and left leg   
with his left hand, i.e. keeping his hands crossed.   
When one Padmanabha Swami who was with Muni asked him how he could recite  
sloka of Ganapati to Sri Bhagavan, Kavyakanta   
Ganapati, with his erudite knowledge in Sanskrit said: Suklambaradharam - one who wears white coupina,   
Vishnum - one who knows everything,   
Sasivarnam - one who is like the moon, bright,   
Chaturbhujam - one who has destroyed his mind, senses, pride and thoughts  
[four],   
Prasanna Vadhanam - one who has got peaceful countenance ever.   
When Sri Bhagavan Ramana listened to this explanation, He smiled at Kavyakanta  
Ganapati Muni!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Very nice passage and good description. Ganapati Muni was such a great Pundit  
but humble. Pundits of much less knowledge gets puffed up with ego. The works  
of Ganapati Muni on Devi are revered and acclaimed. The knowledge of Ganapati  
Muni increased his yearning instead of covering it up.

Dear silentgreen,   
Ganapati Muni announced that he would stage his reading of   
Uma Sahasram, at the Arunachaleswarar Temple, on a particular   
day. He could complete only 800 slokas. The last 200 were   
yet to be written. It was already 8 PM on the previous night.   
He was in Pachaiamman Kovil, along with his disciples and Sri   
Bhagavan. Words were not flowing. The four disciples were   
ready to take down. But nothing flowed further. He sat in front   
of Sri Bhagavan, with a silent prayer. Sri Bhagavan looked at   
him intently with all grace. Soon, the words started flowing.   
The remaining 200 hundred verses were completed before 12 midnight. As the  
last sloka was dictated and written down by   
a disciple, Sri Bhagavan who was looking at him all along, asked   
Ganapati Muni: "Nayana, has everything been taken down?"   
Ganapati Muni realized that those verses were actually said by   
Sri Bhagavan through him as medium. He shed tears and prostrated before Him.   
Later, when Ganapati Muni revised some verses [after the stage   
reading in the Temple], he did not make any alterations in the   
last 200 verses. Who am I to change Bhagavan's words? he said.   
I think this Uma Sahasram was lost once completely and Ganapati   
Muni re-wrote them out of his memory! I think, in the Complete   
Works of Ganapati Muni, which have been published recently,   
this Uma Sahasram finds a place.   
Arunachala Siva.

Name of Rama, Rama Naama, is the most sublime mantra for   
attaining liberation. Once a devotee asked Sri Bhagavan that   
he had been chanting Rama Japa and whether he should shift   
to Ramana Japa. Sri Bhagavan said: "Why? Is there any   
difference between the two. Please continue Rama Japa."   
Sri B.V. Narasimhaswami in his Self Realization describes 16   
qualities of Rama which are also there in Sri Bhagavan.   
The puranic story that in Kasi, Viswanatha tells the Rama Naama   
there when persons are dying. He tells them into their right ears.

Dear Soham,   
There is no universal rating of spiritual persons. It varies from person to  
person.   
For a child, his father is a hero and gets the highest rating. For a disciple,  
his Guru is the best and gets the highest rating. However rating does not help  
one to progress spiritually. On the other hand, one should try to squeeze the  
maximum juice of bhakti from whichever form of God appeals to one. Sri  
Ramakrishna said: We have come to eat mangoes and not count the leaves and  
branches of the mango tree.   
Anyway, thanks for your journalism. Its interesting. It also shows the reach  
of mathematics beyond the emperical world.

Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said that He is not seeing anyone   
as Ajnani. For Him, all are Jnanis only. He further added that there is no  
Jnani at all, there is only Jnanam.   
Even when Kaivalya Navaneetam's verse was quoted, [where it is said that there  
are four types of Brahma Jnanis], Bhagavan had   
said that these are all theoretical.   
Annamalai Swami however, made a distinction. He said that there are two types  
of Brahma Jnanis. One is like a lamp. He gives light only to the people  
nearby. They do not attract very many people. Like Akka Mahadevi, Chengottai  
Avudai Akka and Sadasiva Brahmendra. However, the other type is like a  
conflagration, a forest fire. It gives light to many many people. Like Sri  
Bhagavan and Sri Ramakrishna.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Mr. N.R. Krishnmoorty Iyer was in T'malai during his young years   
and had even met Bhagavan in Virupaksha Cave several times.   
Later for about a decade and a half, he went away for studies,   
became postgraduate and was also filling his brain with a lot of   
Western philosophy. With freedom movement all over the country,   
he developed an aversion for 'simply sitting' Jnanis like Sri Bhagavan. Once  
he had to come to T'malai and he spoke to   
T.K. Sundaresa Iyer, [a devotee of Sri Bhagavan and also friend   
of NRK]. He found that since it was some festival time, the house where he  
was placed was rather crowded and noisy. TKS told   
NRK: Both of us can go to Asramam and stay there. It is a better place. NRK  
agreed, but told TKS: I shall not, if I come there,   
prostrate to Sri Bhagavan. I shall even ask Him some inconvenient questions  
and your vanity should not be affected. TKS said: You   
can still come with me. There is no need to prostrate to Sri Bhagavan. You  
may even ask many questions if you want. Both   
went inside the Asramam. Sri Bhagavan was sitting on a wooden chair under the  
Iluppai Tree, which you can see even today, inside the Asramam before you  
take steps towards the temples. There   
NRK saw Bhagavan and immediately prostrated! TKS was laughing   
within. Then NRK somehow adjusted his state and then asked   
Sri Bhagavan: "Swami what is your Stithi?" Stithi means State.   
NRK's brain was ready with all answers and counter questions. If   
He says I am liberated, then he can ask what is liberation? If he   
says that I shall die. Then he can ask what is death? What is   
rebirth? etc., etc.,   
Sri Bhagavan gazed at NRK for full ten minutes. The gaze that would pierce  
one's Heart. Then, as if a bomb had exploded underneath NRK, came the counter  
question: What is your Stithi?   
Now, if he says, he will die, then Sri Bhagavan would ask What is death? If  
he says that he will go to heavens, then Sri Bhagavan   
would ask What is heavens? Where is it?   
NRK's out-turned mind now went inside. What is my stithi? What will happen to  
me after death? Who am I? Slowly the mind went and touched the Self and then  
the pulsating I,I danced merrily   
and reveals Itself. Aham Sphurana.   
For some people, such "rating exercise" sends the mind inward for   
their own good. Is it not?   
Sri Bhagavan says in Verse 28 of Sri AAMM: To feed on You I came. O Arunachala! But I have become Your   
food and am now at peace, effectively consumed by You.   
Arunachala Siva.**

is labelling? Who is asking these questions, find him out,   
find that Who he is?"   
Arunachala Siva.   
Indeed. In this case there would be no forum.   
But this forum has its own purpose and it does it perfectly. How He operates  
one can only marvel and pray in awe.   
If a raindrop touches ocean it is finished automatically. The rates are  
because one sees itself as a raindrop.

Dear amiatall,   
Absolutely correct. In fact Bhagavan Ramana always used the method of begging  
the question/doubt of the questioner, to drive home the point.   
Once Paul Brunton asked: "Bhagavan! To attain the Self, should   
I leave all my possessions?" Bhagavan Ramana replied: "Leave   
the possessor too." If possesor is forsaken and the Self within is   
held on, there is no discussions on Jnanis, their grades etc.,   
On another occasion, a Vaishnavite came to Sri Bhagavan and asked Him as to  
how to control the mind. Sri Bhagavan asked   
him: In Your Vaishnava Siddhanta, what is mind? The gentleman   
replied: In our Sampradaya, [practice], Vishnu is antaryami, the indweller in  
the Heart and Mind is Thaayar, mother, Sri Lakshmi.   
Then Bhagavan asked him: If mind is Sri Lakshmi, why should you control her?  
Just pray to her to give way to attain the Antaryami.   
Why should trouble yourself to control Sri Lakshmi, who is the Mother?"   
On another occasion, one gentleman came and asked Bhagavan   
Sri Ramana: "What is the Sampradaya [daily rituals and practices]   
here. Because I do not see anything. The bell rings and breakfast is served.  
The bell again rings, lunch is served. Again the bell rings, supper is  
served." Sri Bhagavan did not reply. Then after sometime, He asked him,  
'What is your sampradaya?" The gentleman asnwered: "In the mornings we do  
pujas and after   
dinner, we do so many fixed counts of Japa mantras. And before going to bed,  
we submit everything to our Guru." Sri Bhagavan   
replied: "Oh, yet is good. It is like keeping the principal and giving  
interest to the guru." The gentleman did not understand it.   
Just then Muruganar arrived. Sri Bhagavan told Muruganar the entire  
conversation. Muruganar replied: "Oh, Bhagavan! Their   
guru is much better. He collects only the interest [the merits of   
japa mantras], but allows them to retain the Principal. Here,   
our Guru swallows the Principal itself. Everyone laughed. The   
gentleman became more confounded.   
We always keep the Principal [ego] and give only whatever we do   
as submission to our Guru. But Sri Ramana Guru does not even allow that. He  
takes way the ego, the Principal too. Without ego,   
without principal, what we can do, what we can submit to our guru? We submit  
'ourselves' totally to Him to ensure liberation.   
Muruganar has once said: Where is the time for japa etc., There is no ego  
here. Bhagavan is Uyir UNNi. i.e. one who eats the individual soul, or the  
ego!   
Arunachala Siva.

Adi Da treated his own disciples in the worst way.   
You should probably read up on that.   
He did unbelievably nasty things to them that I wouldn't even write down in a  
forum like this.   
He was very intelligent, but his spirituality is a counterfeit.   
It's pretty obvious he's "stacking the deck" here isn't it?

Dear Om Hridayam, simple knowledge about spiritual ideas and   
spiritual goals can make one only a teacher. But a teacher is not   
a Guru. Guru is one who has realized the Truth and can also through his grace  
take the disciples towards the Truth. Of course, self effort is a must and  
guru's grace is equally important. Such Guru's life itself is a teaching.   
However, the teachers whom I mentioned first fumbled in their lives   
and ultimately proved that it is all prattle without practice. Even   
J.K. fumbled at the dusk of his life, when he slept with disciple   
Rajagopal's wife Ms. Rosalind. Ms. Rosalind became pregnant and   
JK took her to a doctor for abortion. What a great fall.   
Arunachala Siva.**

Ah but it is one thing to have a fall and learn from it and quite another to  
carry on with evil, selfish behavior all the way through their lives.   
This is just one of many examples of what Adi Da did to his "disciples": He  
made two married heterosexual men have sex with each other in front of their  
wives.   
Simply for his own amusement.   
This kind of behavior is WAY beyond the norm for what could be considered a  
"slip-up" Most non-spiritual people would never treat people so badly   
much less someone proclaiming themselves the most spiritual person in history  
(Above Buddha and Ramana) The level to which he stretched   
human decency is genuinely hard to understand. I have no respect for him or  
Rajneesh/Osho and I can only consider them to be spiritual counterfeits.   
Having said that please understand that criticising a teacher is something I  
hesitate very strongly to do. It takes quite a bit to make my opinion so  
strongly   
against someone.

I do not know much about Adi Da. But Rajneesh I know through   
my friends and news papers. He had 364 Rolls Royces, zero   
enlightenment and an AIDS carrying body.   
Arunachala Siva.
