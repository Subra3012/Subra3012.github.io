Life is not a bed of roses.   
There are times when circumstances make us sigh.."ohhh..."   
Under such circumstances we may extend the sigh a little bit more and make it  
"ohhh..m".   
Om...the divine name.   
"ohhh..." takes us outwards..."ohhh..m" takes us inwards.   
A depressive situation might change by the divine touch.

It is not everyone. The ohhh takes some fortunate ones those who has empty bag  
of karma. Rather some people become mad, depressed, sick.   
It takes to extreme and lands to sucide. People say grace is everywhere but  
unfortunate people do not know to receive it.Without knowing people   
do some punya karma which accumulates and brings them to spiritual path.  
Slowly they start analysis their experiences. When they give little space   
for divine that time their ohhh becomes OM.
