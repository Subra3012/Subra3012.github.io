## Swami Vivekananda's Satsangh  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 20, 2009, 08:26:48 AM  
---  
In America, Swami Vivekananda spoke like a lion. He used to   
begin his discourses: O Amrita Swarupis... the Forms of Nectar!   
The Americans who had always heard in churches the priests   
addrssing them as "O Sinners!" became highly elated. They used   
to dance during his Satsangh, even though no songs were sung   
but only words flowed from Swami's lips.   
Suddenly a few girls thought that this monk from India was   
hypnotizing them. One of the girls stood up and told Swami   
Vivekananda: "Swami, you are hypnotizing us!"   
Swami Vivekananda smiled and said: "See my child, there is   
no reason to hypnotize you. You are all already hypnotized.   
I am only de-hypnotizing you!"   
This hypnotizing is "thiyakkam" mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana   
in Verse 49 of Sri Arunachala Aksharamana malai. The de-hypnotizing is  
removal of this thiyakkam, delusion of Maya, to   
realize the Self.   
Thedathu UtRa nal tiru aruL aha thiyakkam   
Theerthu aruL Arunachala.   
 \- Verse 49 of SRI A.A.M.M.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Charvakars  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 20, 2009, 10:53:29 AM  
---  
Indian Vedic thought allowed room, for a variety of schools of thoughts and  
philsophies. There were agnostics, there were atheists too.   
One type of athiests were named Charvakars. These Charvakars   
were telling: Why bother about Brahman or Atman?. We have   
got a body, take care of it, eat well and be merry with drinks and   
women.   
WE have today also many Charvakars. They feel that we should   
be happy and die. Eat daily ghee-mixed rice with dhal and curries.   
Dress up well. Go behind women. Buy properties, lands etc.,   
Anyway banks are giving loans left and right. Take all loans.   
Do not pay. The Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is there   
to write off all the loans. Hence there is no need to worry about   
repayment......   
Sri Sankara says that these Charvakars will start worrying about   
the body, when the first grey hair appears, when the first pain   
on the chest appears, when there is no sleep at night, when there   
is a neighbour who died of cardiac arrest in a few hours. When   
the eyes become dim and when the ears start hearing only half   
of the sounds.   
So this Charvaka philosophy is not eternal. Everyone is a   
Charvaka in the younger days. Many do not seek the Self like   
Sri Sankara or Bhagavan Ramana. They first think about God   
or the Self when their philosphy meets with the first signs of   
defeat.   
What are the roots that clutch,   
What branches grow out of this stony rubbish,   
Son of Man, for you know only a heap of broken images,   
Where sun beats, the dead trees give no shelter   
And cricket no relief!   
 \- T.S. Eliot, The Waste Land.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sri Sankara Vijayam - 104  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 11:57:44 AM  
---  
Sri Sankara's Nirvana Shatkam, the Six Verses on Nirvana or   
Freedom is another famous poem. This was actually sung   
by Sri Sankara when he was 8 years old, at the banks of Narmada   
river, when he met Govinda Bhagavatpada, his Guru. When   
Govinda Bhagavatpada asked the little boy: Who are you?   
Sri Sankara replied in verses.   
Verse 1: The true base of the term 'I' is not the mind, intellect, ego or   
perception. Nor is It the sense of hearing, taste, smell, or   
sight. Nor is It the sky, earth, fire or air. It is 'I' that is   
of the form of Siva, the essence of knowledge and beatitude.   
Verse 2: It is not what is called the Prana, nor is it the five vital   
forces. It is not the seven elements of the body, neither   
is it the five sheaths forming the body. It is not the organ   
of speech, hand, foot, the organ of procreation or excretion.   
It is "I" that is of the form of Siva, the essence of knowlege   
and beatitude.   
The above two verses are the same as the Who am I? of   
Bhagavan Ramana. Bhagavan Ramana did not read Sri   
Sankara when He said this Who am I? to Sivaprakasam   
Pillai! All Brahma Jnanis say the same thing, as if they   
had copied from each other's note book as children do in   
school!!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sri Sankara Vijayam - 105  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 12:40:28 PM  
---  
Nirvana Shatkam, Verse 3: The true 'I' is not endowed with hatred or affection, nor has   
It greed or infatuation. It is bereft of pride and the feeling of   
rivalry. Neither is it the goal of ordinary man -- duty, money,   
or sense life. Nor is It even Heavens, coveted by people of   
great merits. It is 'I' that is of the form of Siva, the essence   
of knowledge and beatitude.   
(This idea is again reflected in Who am I? of Bhagavan   
Ramana. He says: Both love and hate must be eschewed.)   
Verse 4: The true 'I' does not gain anything by meritorious deeds nor   
does It lose anything by evil deeds. It has neither happiness   
nor sorrow. It is not attained by holy chants of mystic power   
or by pilgrimage. Nor is It gained by the study of Vedas or   
the performance of Vedic sacrifices. It is not the act of taking   
food, the articles of food or the agent who eats. It is the   
'I' in the form of Siva, the essence of knowledge and beatitude.   
(All the above acts are prelude to Jnana. These confer chidda   
suddhi and deha suddhi.)   
Verse 5: The true 'I' has no death or doubt. Nor has It any differences   
in species. It has no father or mother, for It is unborn.   
It has no friend or relative. It is neither Guru nor disciple.   
It is 'I' that is of the form of Siva, the essence of knowledge   
and beatitude.   
Verse 6: The true 'I' is without any modification and It is formless.   
Being all-pervading, It exists everywhere. Being not attached   
to any sense objects, It has no release to be achieved. It is not   
an object of knowledge. It is 'I' that is of the form of Siva,   
the essence of knowledge and beatitude.   
(The idea is reflected in Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram.)   
With this, I close the serial posts on Sri Sankara Vijayam.   
I bow to the Temple of Vedas, Scriptures, and Puranas.   
I bow to the Temple of Compassion,   
I bow to Bhagavadpadam, (the feet of Brahman)   
I bow to Sankara, who does good and welfare to the world.   
Arunachala Siva.

## skanda Sashti  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 12:39:51 PM  
---  
Skanda Sashti is celebrated after Dipavali, from the first day   
of the waxing moon for six days. These are more the days   
of solemnity, of fasting, of prayers to Skanda. Skanda was   
born from the third eye of Siva. There was no union of Siva   
and Paravati. He is the real Male Child! Skanda killed Surapadma and his two  
brothers on a Sashti day, the sixth day of waxing   
moon in Tula month. The war is mother of all wars, lasting for   
18 years. Skanda was just three years old, when he fought   
Surapadama and brothers.   
Surapadma did a lot of penance for boons from Siva. He is a   
terrific demon, and Ravana and Kumbakarna and Kamsa cannot   
show a candle to him! He took the boons to rule 1008 worlds   
for 108 Yugas, aeons! He was ruling from a place called Veera   
Mahendrapuram in the present Sri Lanka.   
As soon as he got the kingship, he imprisoned Vishnu, Brahma,   
Indra and other gods. Under him, Brahma was the priest for   
his demonic prayers everyday! Indra and Varuna went to the   
oceans to fetch choices fish. Vishnu was the main assistant.   
Surapadma and his two brothers were killed and they became   
the peacock and rooster for Skanda. Mother Parvati gave   
Skanda, the powerful Spear as a weapon.   
Skanda has got as many as 225 temples in India. But six   
temples were his main abodes. These are called 6 barracks   
for him. The number 6 is the number of Skanda.   
He has got 6 faces.   
He has got a 6 lettered mantra, Sa ra va na bha va.   
His main chakra, the meditational drawing has got 6 angles.   
Skandam is the epic of Vyasa that describes Skanda's sports.   
Like Siva, he had no birth and no death. He rose as the Sun   
rose and vanquished the demons and released the gods.   
The Sun never sets.   
A little more information about Skandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda Sashti - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 12:55:49 PM  
---  
Skandam is the largest epic of Vyasa. It has got 100 thousand   
verses. It is one of the 18 epics of Vyasa and comes under   
Siva epics category. There are 8 Siva epics. There are 4   
Vishnu epics. There are again 4 Brahma epics. One is Surya   
epic and the last is Agni epic.   
Skandam has been rendered briefly in Tamil by Kanchi Sivacharya.   
Every verse of this Tamil epic has been corrected and given by   
Skanda of Kanchipuram in Skanda Kottam Temple. It is like   
Bhagavan Ramana correcting Muruganar's poems of Guru   
Vachaka Kovai.   
There are many Tamil songs describing the life and war of   
Skanda. The most important being Tiru Pugazh of Arunagiri   
Natha of Tiruvannamalai. This collection, about 1800 poems   
describes various valourous deeds of Skanda including his   
appearance in Tiruvannamalai temple, when one Sambandhandan   
debated with Arunagri Natha. He appeared near the Eastern   
Towers, and there is a small temple called Kambathu Ilaiyanar   
Temple here. This Temple has been mentioned by various   
Bhagavan Ramana devotees in their reminiscences.   
Among the 6 major abodes of Skanda, the most important   
is Tiruchendur at the tip of India. It is a coastal town with   
a nice temple and sea about 100 metres from the temple.   
This temple is famous because Skanda vanquished the demons   
from this place.   
The second important is Pazhani. Here Skanda is without   
consorts as an ascetic. Many devotees take a vow to go   
to this Temple by foot every year. The Temple is about 1200   
steps from the ground. Devotees take milk pots on their   
shoulders and give milk for abultions to the god.   
The next one is Tiruparan gundram, near Madurai. This is   
where Skanda married his first consort Deiva Nayaki, daughter   
of Indra, given in wedding by Indra, after the victory.   
The next one is Tiruttani, where he is seen marrying the   
huntress girl VaLLi.   
In Swamimalai, near Kumbakonam, he is again a young boy,   
in the ascetic dress. The oldest Tamil poem titled Tiru Murugatru   
Padai, of Nakkirar (3 C. AD) speaks high of this place, where   
Brahmins constantly chant hymns in praise of Skanda. Here   
is where Skanda gave the upadesa to Siva.   
The last one is Pazhamudir Cholai, which is again near   
Madurai. Here Skanda is with both his consorts.   
Many devotees of Bhagavan Ramana had vision of Bhagavan   
Ramana as Skanda of Pazhani, the ascetic, with a codpiece   
and a stick. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni also had a vision like   
this and he started praising Bhagavan Ramana as an avatara   
of Skanda. This he mentions in Sri Ramana Gita.   
Arunachala Siva.

This year I was able to see the Surasamkaram on Podhigai. Before Skandha going  
to kill Sura, there was a kite (garudan) flying in the sky.   
After the arrival of garudan, the killing performence is taking place.   
People say every year it is happening.

## Manisha Panchakakm - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 01, 2009, 09:44:04 AM

Verse 2 of Manisha Panchakam: Kim gangambuni bhimbithe ambaramanou chaandaalavatipaya,   
Bhure chandaramsthi kanchanagati mrutumbhayorvambare,   
Pratyagvasthuni nistharange sahajanandarapodham buthou,   
Viproayam chvapachoyamitrapi mahaan koyam vibhetaprama.   
The Sun reflects on the Ganga waters and also in the gutters   
of a Chandaala. (Is there any difference?). The Space is within   
the golden pot and outside and so also is within the mudpot   
and the outside. (Is there any difference?). The Atma which   
is waveless and limitless ocean of Ananda, is ever the same!   
What is this delusion that makes you feel that difference in   
a brahmin's body and the dog eating body of Chandala?   
Sri Sankara calls the Atma as Pratyakvasthu. This is   
experienced as "I AM". This feeling of am-ness, I AM, is   
common to all living beings, as the Sun without differentiation   
reflects in the Ganga waters as well as in the gutter waters   
near the Chandala's house. The Space is again without any   
differentiation is within and outside of both golden pot and   
mudpot.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say that I AM feeling and "I"-ness   
is more sublime than even Om. It is the feeling not connected   
with one's body or one's mind. If a leg is amputated, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man becomes blind, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man is sleeping, his I am feeling is no way  
absent. This Pratyakvastu is eternal, without change,   
all pervading but not specifically in one place or another.   
Arunachala Siva.
