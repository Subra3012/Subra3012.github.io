Skandam is the largest epic of Vyasa. It has got 100 thousand   
verses. It is one of the 18 epics of Vyasa and comes under   
Siva epics category. There are 8 Siva epics. There are 4   
Vishnu epics. There are again 4 Brahma epics. One is Surya   
epic and the last is Agni epic.   
Skandam has been rendered briefly in Tamil by Kanchi Sivacharya.   
Every verse of this Tamil epic has been corrected and given by   
Skanda of Kanchipuram in Skanda Kottam Temple. It is like   
Bhagavan Ramana correcting Muruganar's poems of Guru   
Vachaka Kovai.   
There are many Tamil songs describing the life and war of   
Skanda. The most important being Tiru Pugazh of Arunagiri   
Natha of Tiruvannamalai. This collection, about 1800 poems   
describes various valourous deeds of Skanda including his   
appearance in Tiruvannamalai temple, when one Sambandhandan   
debated with Arunagri Natha. He appeared near the Eastern   
Towers, and there is a small temple called Kambathu Ilaiyanar   
Temple here. This Temple has been mentioned by various   
Bhagavan Ramana devotees in their reminiscences.   
Among the 6 major abodes of Skanda, the most important   
is Tiruchendur at the tip of India. It is a coastal town with   
a nice temple and sea about 100 metres from the temple.   
This temple is famous because Skanda vanquished the demons   
from this place.   
The second important is Pazhani. Here Skanda is without   
consorts as an ascetic. Many devotees take a vow to go   
to this Temple by foot every year. The Temple is about 1200   
steps from the ground. Devotees take milk pots on their   
shoulders and give milk for abultions to the god.   
The next one is Tiruparan gundram, near Madurai. This is   
where Skanda married his first consort Deiva Nayaki, daughter   
of Indra, given in wedding by Indra, after the victory.   
The next one is Tiruttani, where he is seen marrying the   
huntress girl VaLLi.   
In Swamimalai, near Kumbakonam, he is again a young boy,   
in the ascetic dress. The oldest Tamil poem titled Tiru Murugatru   
Padai, of Nakkirar (3 C. AD) speaks high of this place, where   
Brahmins constantly chant hymns in praise of Skanda. Here   
is where Skanda gave the upadesa to Siva.   
The last one is Pazhamudir Cholai, which is again near   
Madurai. Here Skanda is with both his consorts.   
Many devotees of Bhagavan Ramana had vision of Bhagavan   
Ramana as Skanda of Pazhani, the ascetic, with a codpiece   
and a stick. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni also had a vision like   
this and he started praising Bhagavan Ramana as an avatara   
of Skanda. This he mentions in Sri Ramana Gita.   
Arunachala Siva.

This year I was able to see the Surasamkaram on Podhigai. Before Skandha going  
to kill Sura, there was a kite (garudan) flying in the sky.   
After the arrival of garudan, the killing performence is taking place.   
People say every year it is happening.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. The story is correct. I could not see it, because there is   
no telecast of Podigai, in Bangalore.   
Arunachala Siva.
