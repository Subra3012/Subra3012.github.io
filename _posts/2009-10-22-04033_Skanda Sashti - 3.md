## Skanda Sashti - 3

The Peacock is the vehicle of Skanda. We can usually see   
Skanda's image in temples, with peacock as vehicle. Sometimes,   
the Goat and the Elephant are also his vehicles. Goat is the   
symbolism for Agni, Fire. The god of Agni (Promethus in Greek   
stories) carries when the spark sprouted out of Siva's third eye.   
This became the child Skanda, when Agni left it on the Saravana   
(literally grass) Pond. Hence Agni is the vehicle of Skanda.   
Later after the war with Surapadma, Indra's gave his daughter   
to Skanda in marriage. Indra had the celestial elephant, called   
Iraavatham. This elephant is white in colour with four tusks!   
(Buddha said to have been given a white elephant by Gods.)   
Hence Skanda has also got the elephant as his vehicle.   
The Peacock is also of three forms. The first is Mantra Peacock.   
The Peacock made of holy words, with which Skanda flew over   
the three worlds to get mango fruit from his father, Siva, when   
he was quite young. The second Peacock is called God's peacock,   
which was also gifted by Indra after the conquest of Surapadma.   
The third is called Demon's Peacock. Surapadma, the demon   
requested Skanda to take him as his vehicle after the war.   
It is very difficult to see Peacocks nowadays. In bird sanctuaries   
and zoos, these are all caged and are emaciated without proper   
food and care. But one should see Peacocks in Tiruvannamalai,   
inside the Asramam and on the Hill. They are in their natural   
surroundings. They pick up nuts and grains from the devotees.   
They are fearless for they knew that no one inside the Asramam   
would harm them. They are also on the terraces of Morvi   
Guest House in Tiruvannamalai. They come and take grains   
inside the rooms! My wife once gave a peacock some broken   
biscuits since we had no grains. The peacock took them, further   
broke them into smaller pieces and ate them leisurely and then   
made the pleasant cuckooing sound and went away. We have   
also seen Peacocks dancing with spread out feathers of a million   
colours.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear vinita,   
Yes. Many ardent devotees found Bhagavan Ramana as Skanda,   
Skanda in Pazhani and Swamimalai, the two temples of Skanda,   
where the deity appears as an ascetic, with staff and codpiece.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni has also indicated in his Sri Ramana   
Geeta, that Bhagavan Ramana is an avatara of Skanda.   
Arunachala Siva
