The Prakrti, which according to Samkhya world-view exits only for liberation  
of the shadowy   
incarcerated reflection of the Purusha in the buddhi, is restored back to its  
balance, only   
the undifferenitiated Void remaining with no spectator to contemplate upon  
it, the unhappy   
wedlock of two primal entities being broken, and the individual being immersed  
in the   
Silence of Alone-ness.   
There are cases of Yogs, who have merely merged their differentiated being in  
the unmanifest   
Void. They have the potentialtiy of reborn., as they have not removed the  
skein of tangled knot.   
Such personalities are known as Prakriti leena Purusha in Yoga parlance. The  
progressive ascent   
involved in the various stages of Samadhi is a subtle transition from the  
gross to subtle, it being   
realized that the subtle pervades the entire gamut of manifest and unmanifest  
existence,   
the gross layers covering up the transcendental truth beyond name and form the  
transcendental   
truth beyond name and form like a cloud. The final stage of objectivity is  
that of the intellect   
the most rarefied component of the Prakriti.

Arunachala Siva.
