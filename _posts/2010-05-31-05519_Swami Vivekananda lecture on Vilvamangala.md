**(Delivered on March 25, 1900, in the San Francisco Bay Area)**   
 _Mohammed [as] a young man. .. did not [seem to] care much for religion. He  
was inclined to make money._ He was considered a nice young man and very  
handsome. There was a rich widow. She fell in love with this young man, and  
they married. When Mohammed had become emperor over the larger part of the  
world, the Roman and Persian empires were all under his feet, and he had a  
number of wives. When one day he was asked which wife he liked best, he  
pointed to his first wife: "Because she believed [in] me first." Women have  
faith.... Gain independence, gain everything, but do not lose that  
characteristic of women!. ..   
Mohammed's heart was sick at the sin, idolatry and mock worship, superstitions  
and human sacrifices, and so on. The Jews were degraded by the Christians. On  
the other hand, the Christians were worse degraded than his own countrymen.   
We are always in a hurry. [But] if any great work is to be done, there must be  
great preparation.. .. After much praying, day and night, Mohammed began to  
have dreams and visions. Gabriel appeared to him in a dream and told him that  
he was the messenger of truth. He told him that the message of Jesus, of  
Moses, and all the prophets would be lost and asked him to go and preach.  
Seeing the Christians preaching politics in the name of Jesus, seeing the  
Persians preaching dualism, Mohammed said: "Our God is one God. He is the Lord  
of all that exists. There is no comparison between Him and any other."   
God is God. There is no philosophy, no complicated code of ethics. "Our God is  
one without a second, and Mohammed is the Prophet.". .. Mohammed began to  
preach it in the streets of Mecca.. .. They began to persecute him, and he  
fled into the city of [Medina]. He began to fight, and the whole race became  
united. [Mohammedanism] deluged the world in the name of the Lord. The  
tremendous conquering power!. ..   
You. .. people have very hard ideas and are so superstitious and prejudiced!  
These messengers must have come from God, else how could they have been so  
great? You look at every defect. Each one of us has his defects. Who hasn't? I  
can point out many defects in the Jews. The wicked are always looking for  
defects.. .. Flies come and seek for the [ulcer], and bees come only for the  
honey in the flower. Do not follow the way of the fly but that of the bee....   
 _Mohammed married quite a number of wives afterwards. Great men may marry two  
hundred wives each. "Giants" like you, I would not allow to marry one wife.  
The characters of the great souls are mysterious, their methods past our  
finding out. We must not judge them. Christ may judge Mohammed. Who are you  
and I? Little babies. What do we understand of these great souls?. .._   
[Mohammedanism] came as a message for the masses.. .. **The first message was  
equality.**. .. There is one religion  love. No more question of race,  
colour, [or] anything else. Join it! That practical quality carried the day.  
... The great message was perfectly simple. Believe in one God, the creator of  
heaven and earth. All was created out of nothing by Him. Ask no questions.. ..   
 **Their temples are like Protestant churches.. .. no music, no paintings, no  
pictures. A pulpit in the corner; on that lies the Koran. The people all stand  
in line. No priest, no person, no bishop.. .. The man who prays must stand at  
the side of the audience. Some parts are beautiful.. ..**

**Volume 1, Lectures And Discourses**   
This is a story from one of the books of India, called "Lives of Saints".  
There was a young man, a Brahmin by birth, in a certain village. The man fell  
in love with a bad woman in another village. There was a big river between the  
two villages, and this man, every day, used to go to that girl, crossing this  
river in a ferry boat. Now, one day he had to perform the obsequies of his  
father, and so, although he was longing, almost dying to go to the girl, he  
could not. The ceremonies had to be performed, and all those things had to be  
undergone; it is absolutely necessary in Hindu society. He was fretting and  
fuming and all that, but could not help it. At last the ceremony ended, and  
night came, and with the night, a tremendous howling storm arose. The rain was  
pouring down, and the river was lashed into gigantic waves. It was very  
dangerous to cross. Yet he went to the bank of the river. There was no ferry  
boat. The ferrymen were afraid to cross, but he would go; his heart was  
becoming mad with love for the girl, so he would go. There was a log floating  
down, and he got that, and with the help of it, crossed the river, and getting  
to the other side dragged the log up, threw it on the bank, and went to the  
house.   
The doors were closed. He knocked at the door, but the wind was howling, and  
nobody heard him. So he went round the walls and at last found what he thought  
to be a rope, hanging from the wall. He clutched at it, saying to himself,  
"Oh, my love has left a rope for me to climb." By the help of that rope he  
climbed over the wall, got to the other side, missed his footing, and fell,  
and noise aroused the inmates of the house, and the came out and found the man  
there in a faint. She revived him, and noticing that he was smelling very  
unpleasantly, she said, "What is the matter with you? Why this stench on your  
body? How did you come into the house?" He said, "Why, did not my love put  
that rope there?" She smiled, and said, "What love? We are for money, and do  
you think that I let down a rope for you, fool that you are? How did you cross  
the river?" "Why, I got hold of a log of wood." "Let us go and see," said the  
girl. The rope was a cobra, a tremendously poisonous serpent, whose least  
touch is death. It had its head in a hole, and was getting in when the man  
caught hold of its tail, and he thought it was a rope. The madness of love  
made him do it. When the serpent has its head in its hole, and its body out,  
and you catch hold of it, it will not let its head come out; so the man  
climbed up by it, but the force of the pull killed the serpent. "Where did you  
get the log?" "It was floating down the river." It was a festering dead body;  
the stream had washed it down and that he took for a log, which explained why  
he had such an unpleasant odour.   
**The woman looked at him and said, "I never believed in love; we never do;  
but, if this is not love, the Lord have mercy on me. We do not know what love  
is. But, my friend, why do you give that heart to a woman like me? Why do you  
not give it to God? You will be perfect." It was a thunderbolt to the man's  
brain. He got a glimpse of the beyond for a moment. "Is there a God?" "Yes,  
yes, my friend, there is," said the woman. **And the man walked on, went into  
a forest, began to weep and pray. "I want Thee, Oh Lord! This tide of my love  
cannot find a receptacle in little human beings. I want to love where this  
mighty river of my love can go, the ocean of love; this rushing tremendous  
river of my love cannot enter into little pools, it wants the infinite ocean.  
Thou art there; come Thou to me." So he remained there for years. After years  
he thought he had succeeded, he became a Sannyasin and he came into the  
cities. One day he was sitting on the bank of a river, at one of the bathing  
places, and a beautiful young girl, the wife of a merchant of the city, with  
her servant, came and passed the place. The old man was again up in him, the  
beautiful face again attracted him. The Yogi looked and looked, stood up and  
followed the girl to her home. Presently the husband came by, and seeing the  
Sannyasin in the yellow garb he said to him, "Come in, sir, what can I do for  
you?" The Yogi said, "I will ask you a terrible thing."   
"Ask anything, sir, I am a Grihastha (householder), and anything that one asks  
I am ready to give." "I want to see your wife." The man said, "Lord, what is  
this! Well, I am pure, and my wife is pure, and the Lord is a protection to  
all. Welcome; come in sir." He came in, and the husband introduced him to his  
wife. "What can I do for you?" asked the lady. He looked and looked, and then  
said, "Mother, will you give me two pins from your hair?" "Here they are." He  
thrust them into his two eyes saying "Get away, you rascals! Henceforth no  
fleshy things for you. If you are to see, see the Shepherd of the groves of  
Vrindaban with the eyes of the soul. Those are all the eyes you have." So he  
went back into the forest. There again he wept and wept and wept. It was all  
that great flow of love in the man that was struggling to get at the truth,  
and at last he succeeded; he gave his soul, the river of his love, the right  
direction, and it came to the Shepherd **. The story goes that he saw God in  
the form of Krishna. Then, for once, he was sorry that he had lost his eyes,  
and that he could only have the internal vision. He wrote some beautiful poems  
of love. In all Sanskrit books, the writers first of all salute their Gurus.  
So he saluted that girl as his first Guru.**

Bhilva Mangal is the author of Sri Krishna Karnamrutam. The divine nectar to  
the ears, called Sri Krishna. Long time back, I promised   
to some member that I shall give the meanings of a few verses   
from this book. My book however was missing and I could not do that. The  
book has been traced now. Let me try this after ULLadu   
Narpadu.   
Arunachala Siva.
