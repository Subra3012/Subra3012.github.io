The spirit of sacrifice demonstrated by Bharata in the Ramayana is  
unparalleled. When Rama went to the forest, Bharata was to be crowned as king.  
But he went to the forest to entreat Rama to come back to Ayodhya and ascend  
the throne. Lakshmana who was with Rama in the forest, observed the arrival of  
Bharata and his entourage from a distance. He became furious with the  
misconceived notion that Bharata was coming to wage a battle with Rama. In an  
angry tone, he said, Mother Kaikeyi has sent us to the forest. Now, her son  
does not want us to live in peace even in the forest. That is why he is coming  
here with his army. If You permit me, I will teach him a fitting lesson.   
Reacting to Lakshmanas outburst, Rama said, Lakshmana, I think you have  
developed a desire for the throne of Ayodhya. Better, you go to Ayodhya and  
rule the kingdom. I will keep Bharata with Me in the forest. Bharata is one of  
sacrifice and character. His spirit of sacrifice is matchless. You have  
misunderstood his noble intention.   
Meanwhile Bharata came there and fell at the feet of Rama. My dear, how are  
the parents? This was the first question that Rama asked Bharata. He did not  
enquire about His own mother Kausalya, but He asked about the well-being of  
Kaikeyi. On hearing the name of Kaikeyi, Bharata became furious. It is  
because of that wicked woman you are forced to live in forest. The very  
mention of her name fills me with disgust. Please dont mention her name.  
Rama put His hand on his shoulders and pacified him, saying, Bharata, Mother  
Kaikeyi is a noble woman. It is because of her that My Name is glorified and  
spread far and wide. Do not go by the outward behaviour and talk ill of her.  
Her heart is filled with noble intentions.   
After speaking to Bharata in this manner, Rama went straight to Mother  
Kaikeyi, fell at her feet and said, Mother, by your blessings, I am fine  
here. Do not worry about Me. Let Bharata be crowned as the king of Ayodhya.  
Teach him the codes of governance. After the completion of 14 years, I will  
come back to Ayodhya and see all of you. It is My duty to uphold the promise  
made by My father. It is not enough if one listens to the command of ones  
parents. One should strictly adhere to the rules and regulations laid down by  
the government and strive for the welfare and happiness of fellowmen. Only  
then can one be called an ideal citizen.   
Ramas words made an indelible impression on the mind of Lakshmana. He fell at  
the feet of Rama and repented for his outburst. He said, Brother, when I saw  
Bharata and his army from a distance, I was seething with anger. Now my mind  
rests in peace having known the truth and listening to Your soothing words.  
Rama advised him not to be carried away by the outward scenario but to turn  
inward and strive for experiencing bliss.   
When Bharata started pleading with Rama to return to Ayodhya, Rama  
affectionately drew him close and said, Bharata, no doubt your intentions are  
noble, but you should bear in mind the command of our father. You must follow  
your mothers advice. That is the only way you can please Me. Share your love  
with not only your friends and relatives but with one and all. Remember that  
Thyaga (sacrifice) alone can bestow on you true Bhoga (pleasure).   
Sage Vasishta shed tears of joy listening to the words of Lord Rama. He said,  
Rama, You are forced to live in the forest for no fault of Yours. But, You  
have forgotten the injustice done to You. You are seeing only the good in  
others. We are really moved by Your magnanimity. However, we request You to  
establish Ramarajya (kingdom of Rama) in Ayodhya and give joy to all.   
 **Rama smilingly replied, Now it is Bharatarajya, not Ramarajya. Henceforth,  
it shall be called Bharatadesa (the land of Bharata).**

The earlier name is Ajanabham, the Navalantheevu in Tamil. It was an   
island not a peninsula. Bharata Desam came after a Bharata but not the   
Ramayanam character, if my memory is correct. This Bharata is Shakuntala's   
son.   
Arunachala Siva.
