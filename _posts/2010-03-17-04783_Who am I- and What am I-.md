## Who am I? and What am I?  
Author: Akira               Date: March 17, 2010, 02:30:31 AM

Who am I? நான் யார்   
What am I? நான் என்ன (or What is this 'I'? ; I do not know which is better  
English expression.)   
These two phrases looks similar.   
But Bhagavan always uses the expression 'Who am I?'.   
What is the difference between these two phrases?   
Should it be 'Who am I?' ?   
Or 'What am I?' is equally good?

Dear I,   
It doesn't really matter, what ever expression you are comfortable with, just  
carry on with it, eventually, that will lead you to the 'I'   
Who am I, or What am I - the underlying essence just shouts the same thing -  
about this - 'I'   
I would say, just don't get stuck in these grammatical expressions... It  
doesn't really matter in the enquiry of/about 'I'   
Whos is the 'I' enquiring about the expression of who am I or what am I. Who  
am I to whom these thoughts are arising to?   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Who am I? leads to the answers such as, I am the body, mind, five koshas etc.,   
Then the counter question comes, Whether you were the body, mind, five koshas   
etc., in deep sleep. You will reluctantly agree, that I was not. Then the  
answer   
comes You are Atma.   
What am I? may lead to some other answers, about relationships, characters,   
features etc., I am the husband of so and so, father of so and so etc., This  
may   
again produce the counter question, whether you were the husband, father etc.,   
But Bhagavan Ramana did not say this. Because, one should enquire by one's   
own body, mind, five koshas and not about the relationships.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you, Subramanian.

Dear Akira,   
Let me quote Nisargadatta's saying right on the question (from "I Am That"): "There is no such thing as a person. There are only restrictions and  
limitations. The sum total of these defines the person. You think you know  
yourself when you know _what_ you are. But you newer know _who_ you are. The  
person merely appears to be, like the space within the pot appears to have the  
shape and volume and smell of the pot. See that you are not what you believe  
yourself to be. Fight with all your strength at your disposal against the idea  
that you are nameable and describable. You are not. Refuse to think of  
yourself in terms of this or that. There is no other way out of misery, which  
you have created for yourself through blind acceptance without investigation.  
Suffering is a call for enquiry, all pain needs investigation. Don't be lazy  
to think."

Forum rules -   
Any guru mentioned on this forum MUST have been dead for at least 50 years.   
Please abide by the rules of the forum or you will be excluded from using it.   
Nisargadatta (April 17, 1897  September 8, 1981)   
I think this forum rule is to avoid futile arguments on guru.   
I do not mind you have faith in Nisargadatta.   
So please do not mind that I think Nisargadatta is a fake.   
Orginally I did not want to say this, as I know you replied to me out of good  
heart,   
and I do not want to hurt your feeling.   
I say this because you quoted from Nisargadatta again,   
even though I have already said that I am not interested in him,   
and by that you intentionally ignored my will.

No quarrels please. There is only one Goal, but paths are many.   
Even in Atma Vichara, there are many annexures. One can follow   
what one suits most. Stray references to other gurus who have   
not qualifed as per Admin's rule are okay.   
Arunachala Siva.

I don't really feel it as a concept like 'who am i?' 'what am i?' or 'what is  
this 'I'?'   
The inquiry is much more subtle & direct than a conceptual question to mull  
over, its like directly scanning your sense of self to see what it is, it  
doesn't require any thought, just observation & alertness to look   
The scanning is not a thinking process, its just looking and intuitively  
understanding that what your real essential Self is, is not a phenomena, but  
Infinity   
So attaining it is not necessary, only abiding **_as_** that itself, and not  
living as the mind   
Just like Bhagavans death experience when he was young at his uncles house, he  
describes is as a contemplation where he sees 'i am not the body but the  
spirit that transcends the body'   
He went on to say this wasn't really a thought out mental process, he wasn't  
thinking 'i am not the body' he was directly **seeing** it

Dear RobertAdam,   
I agree with you. However, Bhagavan Ramana said to question,   
whenever thoughts arise, "For whom are these thoughts." Then   
Who am I? No doubt, it is essentially for seekers. But as one   
seeker matures, he would just be looking at the Self within,   
with attention undiverted. This needs Sraddha, efforts with faith.   
Arunachala Siva.
