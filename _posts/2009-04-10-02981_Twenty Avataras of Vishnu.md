Most of us know only about 10 Avataras of Vishnu, of which Kalki,   
the 10th is said to happen at the end of Kali Yuga. Srimad Bhagavatam  
however, speaks about 24 Avataras of Vishnu.   
These are:-   
1. Bhagavan   
2. Virat Purusha   
3. Koorma   
4. Varaha   
4. Narada   
5 & 6. Nara-Narayana   
7. Kapila   
8. Dattatreya   
9. Yajna   
10. Rishaba   
11. Biruthu   
12. Matsaya   
13. Kamata (I do not know its meaning)   
14. Dhanvantri   
15. Mohini   
16. Narasimha   
17. Vamana   
18. Parasurama   
19. Vyasa   
20. Raghurama   
21. Balarama   
22. Krishna   
23. Buddha   
24. Kalki   
The order is somewhat re-arranged to suit versification in Sanskrit.

**The Ten Avatars of Vishnu and Evolution**   
The Dasavataras of Vishnu has a striking resemblance with the unfolding of  
evolution.   
1\. _Matsya Avatara_ as fish - According to science, life originated in water.   
2\. _Kurma Avatara_ as tortoise - The evolution of the fish to an amphibian.   
3\. _Varaha Avatara_ as boar - The evolution of the amphibian to a fully land  
animal.   
4\. _Narasimha Avatara_ as man-lion - The evolution of the land animal to a  
humanoid form with animalistic characteristics.   
5\. _Vamana Avatara_ as dwarf - The evolution of the animal-man to a human  
being in dwarf form.   
6\. _Parashurama Avatara_ \- The evolution of the dwarf to a physically well-  
developed and ferocious warrior.   
7\. _Rama Avatara_ \- The evolution of the ferocious warrior to Rama, who is  
considered as the ideal man or the maryada purushottama and the embodiment of  
morality, ethics and righteousness.   
8\. _Krishna Avatara_ \- The evolution of Rama, the ideal man to Krishna who  
is considered as the ideal yogi, the superman who is known for his many-  
sidedness and all-rounded character.   
9\. _Buddha Avatara_ \- The state of tranquility, silence and peace.   
10\. _Kalki Avatara_ \- Destruction / going back in seed form for a new  
projection?   
\ Possibly first observed by the famous scientist JBS Haldene.

Kalki is an Avatar of Vishnu seated on a horse who goes and destroys the  
wicked.   
The significance of Horse is (knowledge eg. (hayaghreeva)) according to our  
Scriptures, and seated on it is Vishnu (Conscience) and to destroy the wicked  
in the Kali is by Knowledge alone. not by weapons or bloodshed.   
It is destruction of neiscence in our own self - Bhagwan's Enquiry is the best  
example - By who am I we are killing the neiscence. In Kali Yuga, Vishnu takes  
an avatar in every Self alone and not physically!   
When the enquiry begins, Vishnu has taken an Avatar!

Dear munagala, Nagaraj,   
The twenty four Avataras are found in Srimad Bhagavatam. The   
classical ten avataras do not include Buddha. Then ten avataras   
as Nagaraj said, describes the evolution of living beings into man   
and then perhaps a superman. It goes with Darwinian theory of   
evolution of man.   
Arunachala Siva.

It is the same one who is expecting everything.   
One is a Hindu, Christian, Muslim and Other at the same times. Its the only  
one which is expecting a Christ, Kalki, Buddha and Mahdi.
