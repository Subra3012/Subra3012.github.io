**It is all right. Why not? If one accepts the theory of karma, one will have  
to accept the theory of astrology and horoscope also.**   
 **Source** : DAY BY DAY WITH BHAGAVAN From the Diary of A. DEVARAJA MUDALIAR   
 **20th September, 1948**   
Questioner: Swami! According to astrological science,predictions are made  
about coming events, taking into account the influence of the stars. Is that  
true?   
 **Bhagavan: So long as you have the feeling of egoism all that is true. When  
that egoism gets destroyed all that is untrue.**   
Questioner: Does it mean that astrology wont be true in the case of those  
whose egoism is destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Who is there to say it wont be true? There will be seeing only if  
there is one who sees. In the case of those whose egoism is destroyed, even if  
they appear to see they do not really see. The window is open.   
**Questioner: You say that what is to happen will happen and what is not to  
happen will not happen; if that is so, why should it be said that good deeds  
must be done?   
Bhagavan: If something good is done, it results in happiness. Hence people  
say good deeds must be done.**   
Questioner: Yes. That is why elders say that sorrow is adventitious.   
Bhagavan: That is so. Sorrow is adventitious. It is only happiness that is  
natural. Every living being desires happiness because his natural state is the  
embodiment of   
happiness. All sadhanas (spiritual efforts) are for overcoming adventitious  
sorrow.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. The astrology etc., are only to those who are still languishing   
in the ego-self. For Jnanis there is no astrology etc., I find that   
in Tamizh Nadu, this Rahukalam, Yamakandam and saturn's transit,   
are looked upon with extreme fear. The crowd is TirunaLLar, is   
in lakhs whenever saturn moves from one zodiac to another. For that matter  
the presiding deity in TirunaLLar temple is Siva, Siva Surya Narayana Swami,  
as he is called. But on the saturn's transit day, no one cares for Siva and  
they all throng the Saturn's sanctorum. Even the so called 'rationalists' are  
afraid of Saturn. They wear blue diamond rings etc.,   
I think we should worry more about our ego's mischief than the   
saturn's movement.   
Arunachala Siva.
