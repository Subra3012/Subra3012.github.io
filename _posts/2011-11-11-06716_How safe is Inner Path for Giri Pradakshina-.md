## Know About Kanada (Founder Of Vaisheshika School & Concept Of Atom)  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: November 10, 2011, 12:56:51 PM  
---  
Kanada (Founder Of Philosophical School Of Vaisheshika & Originated the  
concept of atom in Theory)   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanada   
 **Theory**   
It has been claimed that Kashyapa, later known as Kanada was a Hindu sage and  
philosopher who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.   
His primary area of study was Rasavadam, considered to be a type of alchemy.  
**He is said to have believed that all living beings are composed of five  
elements: water, fire, earth, air, ether. Vegetables have only water, insects  
have water and fire, birds have water, fire, earth and air, and Humans, the  
top of the creation, have ether the sense of discrimination (time, space,  
mind) are one.** He theorized that Gurutva was responsible for the falling of  
objects on the Earth.   
 **Many believe that Kanada originated the concept of atom. An interesting  
story states that this theory occurred to him while he was walking with food  
in his hand. As he nibbled at the food in his hand, throwing away the small  
particles, it occurred to him that he could not divide the food into further  
parts and thus the idea of a matter which cannot be divided further came into  
existence. He called that indivisible matter anu, i.e. atom.**   
Adherents of the school of philosophy founded by Kanada considered the atom to  
be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects  
invisible to the naked eye which come into being and vanish in an instant.  
This Indian concept of the atom was developed independently and possibly prior  
(depending on which dates one accepts for the life of Kanada) to the  
development of the idea in the Greco-Roman world. Indian theories about the  
atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on  
logic and not on personal experience or experimentation. Thus the Indian  
theories lacked an empirical base, but in the words of A.L. Basham, the  
veteran Australian Indologist they were brilliant imaginative explanations of  
the physical structure of the world, and in a large measure, agreed with the  
discoveries of modern physics.   
 **According to author Dilip M. Salwi, "if Kanadaâs sutras are analysed, one  
would find that his atomic theory was far more advanced than those forwarded  
later by the Greek philosophers, Leucippus and Democritus."**

## How safe is Inner Path for Giri Pradakshina?  
Author: vengateshs          Date: November 11, 2011, 01:40:39 PM

Hi,   
I have done GiriPradakshina in the Outer most Thar Road.   
I heard that there are other 2 paths for GiriPradakshina: (1) Inner Path and  
(2) Yellow Path. I want to know the following information   
 (1) How safe are these paths, Can we easily explore the paths while walking  
or it requires some experience ?   
 (2) Is it necessary to take a Guide with us or it is ok to go alone for the  
first-time ?   
 (3) Is it ok to climb up the mountain alone for the first time ? How much  
time would it take ? What is the suggested timing to go to the top of the hill  
?   
I request the experienced people to throw some light on these.

Dear Vengatesh,   
I have done the girivalam through the inner path (yellow path) alone and i  
found it very safe and it was a great experience. I feel, the only word of  
caution is, if any women are accompanying you, in such case, many locals  
advise to go as groups.   
I am not an experienced in this matter. But its ok to go alone based on my own  
experience.

Just behind the Ashramam, beyond the Old hall, you will find a small gate that  
leads to the hill, on walking up some distane, you will see the path  
deviating, one to the right which leads to Skandashramam and Virupaksha cave  
and on to the left which is the way of inner Girivalam. throughout the path,  
you will find the stones colored in yellow.   
I also heard that recently, they have clearly painted the path in yellow and  
people have taken much pains in developing the inner path.   
You can always talk to the ashrammites and get more details

Dear vengatesh,   
Inner pradakshina is more tough since one has to pass through jungle areas and  
bushes. its also not safe during late evenings and nights.. It is better to  
use the regular 13 mile road from the Asramam gate.

Dear Vengatesh,   
No harm in inner path, if you are going in the day time, with one or more  
friends.   
Guide aspect, I have no idea. Probaby, devotees coming with you at that time  
are   
your guides.

Hi Subramanian,   
I went in Inner Path yesterday with a friend of mine. As you said, the path is  
so tough and through jungles. We walked for about 2 hours and somehow I think  
we took wrong path somewhere and ended up in the Outer Path nearby Vallalar  
mutt.   
There are no clear directions in Inner path; in many places there are multiple  
ways and we were confused; we followed wherever we found "namam" symbol  
written on rocks indicating the right path.   
When we enquired people in the ashram, they told us Inner Path is about 6km  
but I feel it must be more than that.

Dear Vengatesh,   
Nice. You have made sincere attempts and have succeeded though partially. The  
outermost   
road, the metalled road, is the easiest, like Self Inquiry or Self surrender.

Please dont repeat what you did on the Inner path exploration.   
This is not commercial ad -- but this person really acts as a very good guide
