Sri Sankara thought for a while. He immediately understood that   
this Chandala has taught Vedanta to me, by his words. He thanked   
him in his heart and then replied to him in five verses.   
Verse 3 (Sankara's answer 1)   
Jagrath swapna sushuptishu sputathara ya samvidhujjruambathe   
Ya bramhathi pipili kanthathanushu proda jagatsakshini   
Saivaham na cha dhruchyavasthvidithi dhruta prajnapi yasyasthi chet   
Chandaaloasthu sa thu dhivjoshtu gurithyeha manisha mama: In Wakeful state, in dream state, in deep sleep state, there is   
one pure Awareness which clearly shines, and that which is   
the Witness for all beings from Brahma to the ant, and that   
which is in all bodies in and out, that I,I, is not the objective   
reality. One who realizes this Knowledge in full determination,   
he is -- be he a downcaste, Chandaala or be he a Brahmin, he is   
my Guru. This is my conviction and faith.   
One who knows the Truth, regardless of his caste, he is fit to be   
my Guru, says Sri Sankara.   
This reflection is also seen in Gaudapada's Mandukya Upanishad   
Karika.   
The Witness, the Sakshini, is ever shining. We are not able to   
realize It, due to our ignorance and ego. This is the knowledge   
of Consciousness. Pure Consciousness is revealed only for those   
who this all pervading Witness, and not by their mere learning   
or birth and caste.   
This is Prajananam Brahmam. Consciousness is Brahman.   
This is the first Mahavakya (the great saying of) of Upanishad.   
And it is called Lakshna Maha Vakyam. This gives the characteristic of  
Brahman.   
The Vedanta teachings are called Vishayam, the substance.   
The one who knows its purport is called Vishayee, the realizer.   
This realization comes not from learning but from contemplation after removing  
all the worldly thoughts, the objective knowledge.   
This realization of the Effulgence within, comes from negating all objective  
knowledge. Bhagavan Ramana says the same thing   
in Upadesa Saram, Verse 16:-   
It is true wisdom,   
From the mind to turn away   
From outer objects and behold   
Its own effulgent form.   
 (Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Again Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 27 of Upadesa Saram that It is the only  
Knowledge, and not there is nothing more to know. And this is neither  
worldly(objective) knowledge nor ignorance.   
That is true Knowledge which transcends   
Both knowledge and ignorance   
For in Pure Knowledge   
Is no object to be known.   
 (Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Thus in the 3rd Verse of Manisha Panchakam, which is Sri   
Sankara's first reply, he has elucidated the meaning and   
purport of Maha Vakya, Prajnanam Brahmam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. The Self awareness and   
thoughts do not co exist. Because they are like the rope and the   
serpent. When one sees the serpent, the rope is not seen and   
vice versa.

Dear soham3,   
Each Brahma Jnani has got his peculiarities in behaviour. It all   
depends on his Prarabdha. Bhagavan Ramana was always quiet,   
very rarely giving room for anger but never uttered foul words.   
Seshadri Swami was behaving eccentrically, shouting at people,   
and even physically assaulting some of them. Sadasiva Brahmendra   
acted like a lunatic. Sri Ramakrishna was most of the times looking   
like a drunken man. But their Jnana-attainment was all the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

If we understand ourselves then only we can understand others whether they are  
janani or ajanani. The real seeker may not consider the janani's looks,  
behaviour but will be attentive what he says. It is very difficult to know the  
real enlightened people. If we have good karma and God's grace we may meet  
them or they   
may come to our door and elevate us. To have such things in our life we just  
pray and read Ramana Bhagavan's books.

Dear soham3,   
 This has reference to your post on Sri.Nisargadatta Maharaj. **It is said that only a Jnani can recognize another Jnani**. Nisargdtta Maharaj's teaching are same as that of Bhagavan Ramana and what is important is to abide by his teachings instead of commenting on the personality.This forum being devoted to Bhgagavan Ramana Maharishi whose main teaching is to erase the ego, it will be better for the members of this forum to refrain from commenting on sages.

Jnanis do not indulge in anything, they just know they fulfil what  
predestined. But you're right: some ajnanis try to pretend to be jnanis to  
indulge themselves in crimes.   
Whether one is bound by morality or not, he will do exactly whatever  
preordained. There are millions of people who care a lot about morality and  
commit crimes (middleages inquisition for example)

O, come on friends, nobody has the "right" to judge anybody, jnani or whatever  
-- period. For that matter, how does one judge somebody jnani or whatever? I  
said "judge" not recognize what is being done.   
Okay, let's say we all agree that Sri So-and-So is jnani and he/she does some  
silly thing. What to do? Well, if what the fellow is doing looks silly,  
what's wrong with saying "that looks silly!" \-- none at all! But if we say,  
"So-and-So can't be jnani because he picked his nose in public" then we are  
off course. If there is such a thing as jnani, it is in Being not in Doing   
Another example: there was this Zen master, very respected, one day some  
robbers attacked him on the road and killed him -- his disciples were shocked  
to hear that he had screamed when he died. "How could this be?", they asked.  
"No," they were told, "you don't understand, his screams were heard five miles  
away!!!"

Dear everyone,   
Nice discussions. Why all these problems? Because Jnani is   
in a body. If he has left his body, then there will be only a   
Siva Lingam or a Cross over the samadhi or cemetry. Then   
no comments, no praises, no criticisms. The Jnani then becomes   
the Presence. That is why the Presence is quite powerful.   
Jnani with a body is always subject to criticism. There were   
people during Bhagavan Ramana's time, who were telling: What   
is this man? Wearing a coupinam, and walking with his curved legs? Doing no  
work. Then they would say to Shirdi Baba: O this guy   
is a fool, wearing a tattered gown and eating meat pieces. They   
would say to Sri Satya Sai Baba: O who is this guy, with huge   
growth of hair that looks like krotens? They would say to Seshadri Swamigal: Hey, this guy is a crackpot, wearing torn dhoti and banians and eating foul  
smelling old rice and shouting at everyone.   
For Sri Bhagavan Ramakrishna they would say: Who is this guy   
who always eats fish and luchi and dances as if he is drunk.   
There is no end.   
Do not see the Jnani with a body, or as a body. If you have faith in him,  
ignore everything. If you do not have faith in him, please   
stay away.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, I'm not sure you get my modest point which is, "Do not see  
_anybody_ simply as a body" There is a jnani hidden in every body. When this  
is seen, (dimly by most of us, of course), then one loves everybody, not with  
the intensity that God loves us, but love just the same -- in fact one loves  
the world, because the world is no longer the world but shot through with  
God's glory transforming it into His Reality.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I have no quarrel and I am only trying to tell you the dangers   
of seeing the Jnani only as a body. All mind's mischief starts   
only because of that. Is it not? After Bhagavan Ramana's   
Mahanirvana, many people thought that everything was over   
and they packed up to their places. Only a few like Chadwick,   
Arthur Osborne, Kunju Swami, Annamalai Swami and the   
Sarvadikari Chinnaswamy remained. But those guys who went   
away came back in one or two years, because Bhagavan Ramana   
was transmitting His grace not as a body but as the Presence.   
The Ramana Nagar colonly which became almost totally vacant started filling up  
slowly.   
I repeat, that I am taking your views as mine too. The dangers   
lurk only when one thinks othewrise.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nisargadatta Maharaj is often referred to as "a mystic with a stick".   
The stick has straightened many bends over the years and continues to do so.   
There were reasons why Maharaj sometimes told people to go away.   
His place of satsang was very small and could accomodate few people.   
Some people only came to show off instead of being really interested in the  
talks and Maharaj did not tolerate such attitudes. Also sometimes when Maharaj  
found that old timers preventing entry to new comers he told them to seat in  
the back seats and make space for new comers.   
Maharaj was not financially sound and his place of dwelling was small. He also  
had his own family. Under these circumstances he created suitable space for  
satsang and disseminated and gave talks spanning several years. This shows  
that his attitude was to help others. The "stick" methodology was used to help  
people in the shortest possible time. Out of his talks came the spiritual  
classic "I am That".

Whether one is bound by morality or not, he will do exactly whatever  
preordained. There are millions of people who care a lot about morality and  
commit crimes (middleages inquisition for example)

O, come on friends, nobody has the "right" to judge anybody, jnani or whatever  
-- period. For that matter, how does one judge somebody jnani or whatever? I  
said "judge" not recognize what is being done.   
Okay, let's say we all agree that Sri So-and-So is jnani and he/she does some  
silly thing. What to do? Well, if what the fellow is doing looks silly,  
what's wrong with saying "that looks silly!" \-- none at all! But if we say,  
"So-and-So can't be jnani because he picked his nose in public" then we are  
off course. If there is such a thing as jnani, it is in Being not in Doing   
Another example: there was this Zen master, very respected, one day some  
robbers attacked him on the road and killed him -- his disciples were shocked  
to hear that he had screamed when he died. "How could this be?", they asked.  
"No," they were told, "you don't understand, his screams were heard five miles  
away!!!"

Dear everyone,   
Nice discussions. Why all these problems? Because Jnani is   
in a body. If he has left his body, then there will be only a   
Siva Lingam or a Cross over the samadhi or cemetry. Then   
no comments, no praises, no criticisms. The Jnani then becomes   
the Presence. That is why the Presence is quite powerful.   
Jnani with a body is always subject to criticism. There were   
people during Bhagavan Ramana's time, who were telling: What   
is this man? Wearing a coupinam, and walking with his curved legs? Doing no  
work. Then they would say to Shirdi Baba: O this guy   
is a fool, wearing a tattered gown and eating meat pieces. They   
would say to Sri Satya Sai Baba: O who is this guy, with huge   
growth of hair that looks like krotens? They would say to Seshadri Swamigal: Hey, this guy is a crackpot, wearing torn dhoti and banians and eating foul  
smelling old rice and shouting at everyone.   
For Sri Bhagavan Ramakrishna they would say: Who is this guy   
who always eats fish and luchi and dances as if he is drunk.   
There is no end.   
Do not see the Jnani with a body, or as a body. If you have faith in him,  
ignore everything. If you do not have faith in him, please   
stay away.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, I'm not sure you get my modest point which is, "Do not see  
_anybody_ simply as a body" There is a jnani hidden in every body. When this  
is seen, (dimly by most of us, of course), then one loves everybody, not with  
the intensity that God loves us, but love just the same -- in fact one loves  
the world, because the world is no longer the world but shot through with  
God's glory transforming it into His Reality.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I have no quarrel and I am only trying to tell you the dangers   
of seeing the Jnani only as a body. All mind's mischief starts   
only because of that. Is it not? After Bhagavan Ramana's   
Mahanirvana, many people thought that everything was over   
and they packed up to their places. Only a few like Chadwick,   
Arthur Osborne, Kunju Swami, Annamalai Swami and the   
Sarvadikari Chinnaswamy remained. But those guys who went   
away came back in one or two years, because Bhagavan Ramana   
was transmitting His grace not as a body but as the Presence.   
The Ramana Nagar colonly which became almost totally vacant started filling up  
slowly.   
I repeat, that I am taking your views as mine too. The dangers   
lurk only when one thinks othewrise.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nisargadatta Maharaj is often referred to as "a mystic with a stick".   
The stick has straightened many bends over the years and continues to do so.   
There were reasons why Maharaj sometimes told people to go away.   
His place of satsang was very small and could accomodate few people.   
Some people only came to show off instead of being really interested in the  
talks and Maharaj did not tolerate such attitudes. Also sometimes when Maharaj  
found that old timers preventing entry to new comers he told them to seat in  
the back seats and make space for new comers.   
Maharaj was not financially sound and his place of dwelling was small. He also  
had his own family. Under these circumstances he created suitable space for  
satsang and disseminated and gave talks spanning several years. This shows  
that his attitude was to help others. The "stick" methodology was used to help  
people in the shortest possible time. Out of his talks came the spiritual  
classic "I am That".
