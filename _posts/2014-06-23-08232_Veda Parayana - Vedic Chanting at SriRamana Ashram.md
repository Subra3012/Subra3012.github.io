The following are the Morning / Evening Vedic and Sanskrit Chants as followed  
in Ramana Ashram and I believe Bhagwan did give an outline for the same and  
others added some later. I once asked David Godman about this but he could  
not give me the proper answer to its background.   
If there is any changes in the list, I will make it.   
Ramana Ashram Morning Vedic and Sanskrit Chants at 8 a.m**   
1) Sri Ramna Chatvarimshat   
2) Sri Arunachla Pancharatnam   
3) Sri Taittriya Upanishad ( Sikisha /Anand /Bhrigu Valli )   
4) Sri Suktam   
5)Maha Narayana Upanishad ( some portions )   
Ramana Ashram Evening Vedic & Sanskrit Chants at 5 p.m**   
1)Dakshinamurti Stotram   
2) Sri Rudram   
3) Chamakam   
4) Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam,Durga Suktam   
5) Mantra Pushpam.   
 6)Upadesa Saram   
7) Nakarmana   
I have updated the list to make some changes after seeing the final version  
from the book  
"The Veda Parayana At Sri RamanaAshram - An English  
Translation .   
 **According to this book :**   
1) In Sri Bhgawan's lifetime, Vedic Chanting/Veda Parayana was held twice a  
day morning and evening, lasting about 40 mts on each occasion, and this is  
still continued.   
2) This with the Puja which follows it is the only ritual which was or is  
generally attended at the Ashram.   
 **3) It was an hour of tremendous silence when he sat immobile as though  
carved in rock. He never allowed anything to interrupt it. **   
 **4) When asked whether people should learn the meaning, so as to follow it,   
he said no : It was sufficient that the chanting served as a support for  
meditation. **   
5) Despite this, it is also true, however, that the portions used for  
chanting were carefully chosen and approved by Sri Bhgawan Himself.   
 **6) Nothing has been deleted from them since Sri Bhagwan 's lifetime and  
only one item added. That is Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra which, mainly on the  
request of the late Major Chadwick ( Sadhu Arunachala ) is now used as the  
opening hymn before the evening chant. **   
7) Technically in the past even listening to the Chanting of Vedas is supposed  
to made available only to Brahmins, but this prohibition was abrogated by Sri  
Bhagwan.

Dear Child Of Arunachala   
This is what I say to people who say they do not have time to visit the parent  
spiritual Organization ( like Ramana Ashram, Sivananda Ashram, Chinmaya  
Ashram, Ramakrishna Asharm etc ) i.e best is to follow some of the schedules  
there at your own home at least once in morning / evening preferably at the  
same time. If there is a morning aarthi / meditation there then follow it at  
the same time and if it is difficult in morning then try to follow it in  
evening. If it is difficult in the weekdays then follow the Sunday /Saturday  
Satsangs at least at your own house at the same time. Unless and until we try  
to develop some form of samskaras at home itself we will not progress much.   
Every Spiritual Organization has its own Satsang format that people can follow  
at least once a week if not daily at their own homes.   
The following gives the Satsang format as advised by Sri Ramana Ashram**   
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/centres/satsang-format/   
What are Ramana Satsang?   
A Ramana satsang is a group of devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi who gather  
together to strengthen their experience of the presence of Sri Ramana, deepen  
their understanding of his teachings and receive inspiration from fellow  
seekers on the path of practice as taught and lived by the Master.   
These meetings usually take place at devotees? homes, on a weekly, biweekly,  
or monthly basis.   
**A typical satsang program is as follows:**   
 1) Reading of the Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, from Talks with Sri  
Ramana Maharshi, or some similar book.   
 **2) Satsang Recitations ( A. AksaharaMana Malai 2.Ramana Satguru  
 3.Upadesa Saram 4.Arunachala Pancharatham 5.Nakarmana )  
 **3)Silent Meditation: this will vary from 15 minutes to an hour.**   
 4)A reading of Reminiscences of the Maharshi, from books like Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, etc.   
 5) If parents bring their children to the satsang, the children are  
encouraged to sing a bhajan or song from the Ramana Bhaje Namam CD or from  
some other composition on or about Sri Ramana.   
This concludes the satsang. Often arrangements for refreshments are made and  
then served to the devotees at this time.   
The Audios for the Satsang recitations are available for free download at the  
link above.
