Verse 111 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: Finding that the loving disciple was keeping to him like his shadow, the  
Master asked him: 'Are you able to stay   
unshaken as a mere witness? Have all your doubts disappeared? Or, does the  
sense of differentiation creep   
in at times? Tell me your condition.'   
Arunachala Siva.
