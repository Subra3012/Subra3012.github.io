## Maandukya Upanisad and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 29, 2008, 09:20:06 AM  
---  
Maandukya Upanisad which comes in Atharvana Veda, comprises   
only 12 verses. Gaudapada, guru of Sankara's guru, has written   
a verse commentary on this, and it runs to 215 slokas, and is called,   
Gaudapada Karika. It speaks of Ajata Vada, "the theory of no creation-no  
cessation-no liberation". Many devotees of Bhagavan ascribe Him to ajata vada.  
The Upanisad speaks of 'vichara' as the only sure way to merge in Self.  
Sankara has written a commentary to the Upanisad and also to the Karika.  
Perhaps no other Upanisad has given rise to so much   
controversy as Maandukya Upanisad. Dr. S. Radhakrishnan has said   
that the philosophy of Gaudapada and Sankara are different from each   
other and this point has been discussed in "Talks" No. 383 and 399. Day Day,  
entry of 21.11.1945 (Night) also mentions about a discussion on   
this. Prof. Das Gupta, who wrote elaborately on Indian Philosphy said   
that Gaudapada was a Buddhist and he borrowed the ideas from   
Nagarjuna Karika and Lankavatara Sutra! The Upanisad and Karika,   
discusses the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep (each one   
is given a symbolic Sanskrit name) and the state of 'turiya' or 'turiyateeta',  
the fourth. Advaita Ashrama (of Sri Ramakrishna Math), Kolkata has brought a  
beautiful English translation of MU and Karika   
by Swami Nikhilanada. The fourth chapter of Karika, tells about   
'alata shanti', that is, quenching of the firebrand. If one takes a firebrand  
and rotates it, one sees the 'circle of light' around it. If the   
firebrand is quenched, the circle also disappears. Thus, all the world   
is the 'circle' made out by the firebrand, that is, mind. If the mind is   
killed, the world also no longer appears. Arunachala Siva.

## Vedanta-sara and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 30, 2008, 08:26:24 AM

Vedanta-sara is again a small advatic treatise by Sadananda, disciple of   
Sankara. Just any other advaitic book, it analyses step by step, the   
nature of gross body, subtle body, mind, nescience and the states of   
waking, dreaming and deep sleep states and finally talks about Self-   
realization with the help of a Guru. The characteristics of a Jivan-   
Mukta is given at the end. The book is 227 verses, said to be written   
in 15th century. It cross refers Upadesa-Sahasri of Sankara and   
Naishkarmya Siddhi of Sureswara, another disciple of Sankara. Verses   
221-225 state: " He who does not, see anything in the waking state as   
in sound sleep; who,though seeing duality does not really see it as he sees  
only the Absolute; who though engaged in work, is really inactive; he   
and none other is the knower of the Self. In his case, only good desires   
persist, as do his habits of eating, moving etc., which existed before the  
dawn of knowledge. Or, he may become indifferent to all good and evil. After  
realization, humiliy and other attributes, which are steps to knowledge, as  
also such virtues as non-injury etc., persist like so many   
ornaments. Such qualities like non violence etc., come spontaneously to a man  
who has acquired Self-Knowledge."   
Arunachala Siva.
