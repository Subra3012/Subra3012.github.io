Dear silentgreen,   
Nice commentary on mrutyunja mantram and tryambaka mantram.   
Siva is often described as a god of tamas and god of destruction.   
In fact, he destroys only our ignorance. Sri Rudram says he is   
thaskaraanaam pathaye namah He is the chief of robbers.   
The worldly robbers would rob only our wealth and possessions.   
Siva is the robber of our ignorance. Upon holding his feet in   
Poorna saranagati, he will make our life end and reach his feet,   
as smoothly as cucumber is leaving the creeper.   
He is again Agno-Vishnu. He is Agni, the Efflugence, and Vishnu,   
all pervading.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[3]Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai

श्री अरुणाचल अक्षर मणमालै   
Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai   
During the early years of Sri Bhagavan's abode at Virupaksha, Palaniswami and  
others used to go into town to beg food for the small group of devotees, and  
one day they asked Sri Bhagavan for a devotional song to sing as they went. He  
replied that there were plenty of sublime songs composed by the Saints, many  
of them neglected, so there was no need to compose a new one. However, they  
continued to urge him and some days later he set out on pradakshina round the  
Hill, taking a pencil and paper with him, and, on the way, composed the  
hundred and eight verses.   
Tears of ecstasy streamed down his face as he wrote, sometimes blinding his  
eyes and choking his voice. The poem became the great devotional inspiration  
of the devotees. All the pain of longing and all the bliss of fulfillment are  
mirrored in its glowing symbolism. The perfection of Knowledge is combined  
with the ecstasy of devotion. And yet this most heartfelt of poems was  
composed from the standpoint of the devotee, of one who is still seeking. It  
is also an acrostic, its hundred and eight verses beginning with the  
successive letters of the Tamil alphabet. Nevertheless, no poem could be more  
spontaneous. Some devotees asked Sri Bhagavan the interpretation of some of  
the verses and he replied: "You think it out and I will too. I didn't think  
while I was composing it; I just wrote as it came.   
 **Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi**   
 **Payiram by Muruganar** : Tharuna aruna mani kirana vali nigar,   
Dharma kshara mana magizh malai,   
Theru nadiya thiruvadiyar theru maral,   
Theliya parvuthal porualakk,   
Karunkara muni Ramana riyanuva,   
Kaiyinar choliyathu gathiyaga,   
Varunachalamena ga arivodu,   
Mazhvar shivanugamalware.   
 **Recommending verse** : This joyful scented garland,   
Which resembles the beam,   
Of the rays of the rising Sun,   
Was requested for by his devotees   
Who chose the streets for removing   
The delusion and make people understand   
And this was composed by Ramana,   
Who was the ocean of pity.   
Those who choose to tell this as their refuge,   
Would understand that they are Arunachalam,   
And reign in the land of Lord Shiva.   
 **Prayer to Lord Ganapathi** : Arunachalavarketha Akshara malai chatha,   
Karunakara Ganapathiye Karamaruli kaapaye.   
Oh merciful Ganapathi, give a hand and help me,   
To make a garland of letters suitable for Lord Arunachala.

Dear silentgreen,   
Today is Sri Ramana Jayanti. On this Punarvasu day of Dhanur   
month in 1880, the Light was born. There cannot be a better   
prayer to write about Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai. The   
verse came spontaneously from Sri Bhagavan's Heart. It is   
Arunachalam Itself singing from the lips of Sri Bhagavan.   
The Verse 1 has got two meanings.   
a] O Arunachala, you root out the ego of those who think of   
You [Arunachalam] at heart.   
b] O Arunachala, you root out the ego of those who contemplate   
'Arunachalam am I'.   
Since Arunachala stands for the spiritual Heart, the traditional   
belief is that a thought of Arunachala confers liberation is no   
superstition. It is said even in Arunachala Mahatmyam, which   
is in Skandam.   
In the second meaning of the verse, we have already taken off   
to the clear sky of Jnana. Dwelling on the identity of I with   
Pure Awareness, of which this Hill is the solid, tangible symbol,   
the separate I fades away and is rooted out. Its place is taken   
by the universal Self dwelling in this body and fulfilling the universal  
purpose. I-thought becomes I-am-ness.   
Arunachala is the symbol of Jnana-akasa.   
Arunachala Siva.
