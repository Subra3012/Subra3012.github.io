## How to come back to human being?

If you do bad conducts, you can be born as an animal in your next life.   
Animals usually do not do Sadhana, meditation etc.,   
They do not judge good and bad.   
They just do what their instincts tell.   
Then how can animal souls come back to human being?   
Once an animal, forever an animal?

Animals by marking time, with their instinctive fulfillments, like hunger,  
thirst and procreation, reach higher levels of evolution. They too have mind.  
But if that mind   
does not do harm to others excepting for their instinctive fulfillments, it is  
sufficient.   
Cats pouncing at rats is a instinctive fulfillment. It does not create a sin.  
Snakes   
eating the eggs of birds is not a sin. But if a snake keeps on stinging human  
beings,   
excepting for its self protection, is a sin.
