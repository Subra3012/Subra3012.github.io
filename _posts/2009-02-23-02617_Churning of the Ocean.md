## Churning of the Ocean

Suddenly from no where I just happened to remember the story about How Shiva  
swallowed the HalaHala poison. How the Devas and Asuras together churned the  
ocean with Mandara Hill upon Tortoise, with Vasuki the snake as the rope. It  
just flashed to me the real essence of this story.   
1. Tortoise represents the 5 senses - when there is a threat or danger to the tortoise, the tortoise takes its hands and Legs and its face inside its shell. Hands, Legs and Head represents the 5 senses.   
2. The Snake Vasuki represents the Sadhana, the effort made in order to get the Amrut, used for the rotating the Mandara Hill clockwise and anticlockwise alternatively. Pulling the senses gradually from the Asuras (Bad) and Suras(Good) taking to a poit when both of them disappear.   
3. The Mandara Hill represents patience and Bhakti, No spiritual practice is possible without patience.   
4. the Ocean represents the Knowledge bed within which lies all the knowledge the brahman,   
5. The Hala Hala poison represents the Ego   
When Siva swallows the Hala Hala poison the Ego is Merged with Siva itself.   
Then what remains or Got is the Amrut the Brahman the eternal being.   
O Bhagwan I love you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Beautiful interpretation of the story and I thank you. One or two   
additional surmises. Halahala poison, the ego, who drinks? It   
is Siva, Brahman. He is the Self, and the Self consumes the ego,   
and Amruta, the Self Realization occurs.   
In Tirumantiram, Tirumoola sings: When, everyone rushes to take the amruta,  
it is He, Siva the Primordial takes the poison. All gods   
want only Amruta, but unless Siva, the Self first consumes the poison, the  
ego, Self Realization is possible. He is also the Guru and the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Mikkaar amudhunna Nanjunda Melavan.....

Dear Subramanian,   
Thank you for adding such valuable words. Indeed its Shiva, the Self himself  
consumes the Ego.   
In Tirumantiram, Tirumoola sings: When, everyone rushes to take the amruta,  
it is He, Siva the Primordial takes the poison. All gods   
want only Amruta, but unless Siva, the Self first consumes the poison, the  
ego, Self Realization is possible. He is also the Guru and the Self.   
Very beautiful verses. Even in Bhagawad Gita, Krishna says Uddharet  
Atmanatmanatmanam - The self himself is a friend and foe to onself.   
Prostrations to Bhagawan.
