Torio Tokun said: "Do not consider yourself elevated in comparison   
to ordinary people. Those who are commonplace, just rise and fall   
on the road of fame and profit without practising the Way or following   
the Way.   
"They are not only to be pitied, not despised or resented. Do   
not give rise to judgmental thoughts, by comparing yourself   
to them. Do not give rise to ideas of higher and lower."   
"This is the attitude needed to enter the Way of the Sages and   
Saints, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Therefore, we place ourselves   
in the state of ordinary people, assimilating to the ordinary, while   
our will is on the Way, and we investigate its wonders."   
This is called the Lotus in the mud attitude.

Honko was an unusually talented Zen Master, irrepressibly outstanding,   
with a wide learning and powerful memory. His own Zen teacher   
Shigetsu had been one of the greatest scholarly masters. Honko   
himself used to travel around lecturing on Zen at the invitation of centres   
all over the country.   
Among Honko's voluminous writings is a commentary on parts of the   
redoubtable Shobogenzo, which is the magnum opus of the great   
thirteenth century Zen Master Dogen. The first and the only work   
written in classical Japanese, Shobogenzo is one of the most difficult   
works in the canon.   
While Honko was working on his commentary on Shobogenzo, a monk   
involved in the study of logic came to him requesting that he expound   
the Surangama Sutra, a most abstruse and complex work in the   
Chinese language.   
At once the Zen Master placed the Surangama Sutra on the left side   
of the desk, set the Shobogenzo on the right, and put a piece of paper   
in the middle. Then he proceeded to lecture on the Surangama Sutra   
while simultaneously reading Shobogenzo and writing a commentary   
on it! He kept his attention on all the three tasks without confusion!   
Those who observed this were astounded, and rumours began to   
circulate that Honko was an incarnation of a spirit or a saint.

## Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 02, 2009, 07:33:06 AM

Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri was a man of astounding scholarship   
and learning. He had learnt Rig Veda, Ayur Veda, Indian Astrology   
and what not. He composed Hara Sahasram when he reached Tiruvannamalai in the  
first few weeks. This manuscript was taken   
by his disciple and this has been lost for posterity. He composed   
Uma Sahasram, and the last 300 verses were inspired by Bhagavan   
Ramana at Pachaiamman Kovil. He defeated Ambika Datta in Nava   
Dweepa suymposium and earned the title of Kavyakanta. His wife   
Visalakshi, who was initated into Tara Mantra by Ganapati Sastri,   
was an authority of that mantra and the underlying philosphy. His   
son Mahadeva was one of the questioners in Sri Ramana Gita. He   
composed Sad Darsanam which is a Sanskrit rendering of Ulladu   
Narpadu of Bhagavan Ramana. Later many many scholars like   
Kapali Sastri, Lakshmana Sarma and Dr. T.M.P. Mahadevan wrote   
commentaries on Sad Darsanam.   
Bhagavan Ramana had a high regard for Kavyakanta and He used   
to call him affectionately as Nayana. Kavyakanta called Bhagavan   
Ramana as his younger brother Subrahmanya! Ganapati Muni had   
a lot of sankalpas or wishes like making India as the centre of Jnana   
bhoomi, obtaining independence through peaceful means of chanting   
mantras etc., He started a group called Indra Sabha for this purpose.   
After reaching Kharagpur, where he was staying during his last   
months, he was in correspondence with Bhagavan Ramana. These   
letters used to be in Sanskrit. And at the end of each letter, he used   
to add a poem in praise of Bhagavan Ramana. Such poems were   
desgined to make a Ramana Satakam, but Kayakanta breathed his   
last before its completion. Bhagavan Ramana arranged the available   
40 verses into Sri Ramana Chatvarimasat later.   
Kavykanta Ganapati Muni also planned a detailed biography on Bhagavan   
Ramana. Even this remained incomplete with only three chapters written.   
He used to extempore say some slokas and when disciples asked what   
these were, he said that these sloaks would be a part of Maha Ramana   
Gita, which he said, would be complete in a few years! This Maha Ramana   
Gita was also not completed.   
He wrote the famous Sri Soundaryamba Ashtakam, after Mother's   
Maha Nirvana. He only called the perennial well that is between   
Bhagavan's Mahasamadhi and the dining hall, as Sri Soundarymba   
Tirtham.   
We should always remember Sri Ganapati Sastri and Muruganar, for   
their wonderful writings on Bhagavan Ramana. They are the   
Appayya Dikshita and Manikkavachagar for Ramana Siva.

Once Zen Master Bankei said to a group of people: "When I was   
first inspired to seek enlightenment, because I did not find an   
enlightened teacher, I practised all sorts of austerities, wasting   
my body away.   
" Sometimes, I would cut off all human contact and live in isolation.   
Sometimes, I would design a paper enclosure and sit inside it, or   
I would set up screens and sit in a dark room, sitting in lotus positon   
without lying down, until my thighs became ulcerated and festered,   
leaving permanent scars.   
" Then I would hear of the existence of a teacher at such and such   
a place in such and such a province. I would go there directly to meet   
him. After several years like this, there were few places in all of   
Japan, that my foot steps had not reached.   
"All this was due to the fact that I had not met an enlightened teacher.   
After my mind opened up one day, for the first time I realized how   
useless my years of toil and pain had been, and I attained peace.   
"Now I tell you all how to attain fulfillment in your present lives   
without straining yourselves, but you don't completely believe in it.   
This is because you are not really serious and you still think that   
you have strain yourselves to attain enlightenement."

Yui-e, an elder of the Soto school of Zen, came to Zen Master   
Bankei and said: "I was inspired when I was seventeen or eighteeen years old.   
For over thirty years I sat for long periods without lying donw,   
concentrating singlemindedly, but found errant thoughts and   
false consciousness hard to erase. In recent years, my mind   
and intellect have both become clear and I have attained peace.   
How did you concentrate in the past?   
Bankei replied: "I too toiled over the occurrence of thoughts when I was young,   
but suddenly I realized that our school is the school of enlightened   
eye, and no one can help another without clear perception. From   
the beginning I transcended all other concerns and concentrated   
on working solely on attainment of this clear vision. For this reason,   
I have mastered the ability to see whether other people have true   
perception."

"When you are able to switch off (not only switch on!) the activities of your  
mind, at will, you most certainly are the master of your mind." \- a statement

Dear Asit,   
If you are able to adopt the first statement that you have made, that   
is your ability to switch on and switch off, then you are a success, and   
a simple success, but a great success. If you are calling yourself as   
failure, then that 'feeling' or 'calling' itself is a deterrant.   
Self actualization is a process of either gradual progress from the   
basic survival needs to security needs, love needs and ego needs, OR   
a sudden quantum jump from a position where even survival needs   
have not been fulfilled.   
There was one gentleman hailing from Swedish royal family, who   
left his 8 million dollars worth of legacy (valued in 1930s) and came   
to India and finally found the Truth in Tiruvannamalai. When he died, he  
owned only two dhotis. He is Swami Ramanagiri, whose Samadhi is near   
Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Bhagavan Ramana guided him, at all times from 1930s and  
even after His Maha Nirvana, Bhagavan guided him upto the point of merger in  
the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Someone asked the great Zen Master, Bankei, about 'sitting Zen'.   
He repied: "Harmonization with the ineffable wisdom inherent in everyone   
before getting involved in thinking and conceptualization is called   
'meditation.' Detachment from all external objects is called 'sitting'.   
Just closing your eyes and sitting there is not what I call 'sitting   
meditation.' Only sitting meditation attuned to subtle knowledge   
is to be considered of value.   
" All confusion is a matter of revolving in vicious circles of delusion   
because of using thoughts. When angry, thoughts come out,   
you become a titan. Craving makes you an animal. Clinging to   
things makes you a hungry ghost. If you die without giving these   
up, your revolve in a routines forever, taking on all sorts of forms,   
whirling in the flow of birth and death.   
"If you detach from thoughts, there is no confusion, so there is no   
cause or effect. There being no cause or effect, there is no revolving   
in routines. As long as you entertain thoughts, when you cultivate   
good thoughts there are good causes and effects. And when you do   
wrong, there are bad causes and effects. When you have detached   
from thought and tuned to the subtle knowledge, there are no causes   
or effects of birth and death.   
" When I speak this way, it seems like a vision of Nothingness.   
But it is not so. The reason I say that this it is not Nothingness is   
that when I say so, each of you hears it. Even though you do not   
think of hearing, because the original knowlege innate in everyone   
is effectively aware, you can hear it distinctly. When you touch fire   
or water, you know it is hot or cold, yet no one 'learns' to feel heat   
or cold.   
"This is working beyond thought, so even if there is no thought,   
it cannot be called Nothingness. This inherent subtle knowlege   
comprehends everything without involvement in the dualistic   
ideas of Being and Nothingness, just as a clear mirror refelcts   
the images of things distinctly. So what discursive thought is   
necessary for this?   
"Discursive thought is there because there is confusion. When you   
arrive at nondiscursive knowledge, you perceive and distinguish   
things before discursive thought, so in the end there is no confusion.   
That is why non discursive knowledge is valued.   
"For this reason, sitting meditation with unfabricated subtle knowledge is the  
highest practice."   
To be without needs, (and therefore without desires and thoughts)   
is Self actualization. To sleep without dreams is self actualization.
