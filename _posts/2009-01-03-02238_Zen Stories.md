Yui-e, an elder of the Soto school of Zen, came to Zen Master   
Bankei and said: "I was inspired when I was seventeen or eighteeen years old.   
For over thirty years I sat for long periods without lying donw,   
concentrating singlemindedly, but found errant thoughts and   
false consciousness hard to erase. In recent years, my mind   
and intellect have both become clear and I have attained peace.   
How did you concentrate in the past?   
Bankei replied: "I too toiled over the occurrence of thoughts when I was young,   
but suddenly I realized that our school is the school of enlightened   
eye, and no one can help another without clear perception. From   
the beginning I transcended all other concerns and concentrated   
on working solely on attainment of this clear vision. For this reason,   
I have mastered the ability to see whether other people have true   
perception."

"When you are able to switch off (not only switch on!) the activities of your  
mind, at will, you most certainly are the master of your mind." \- a statement  
of 'failure' by Asit

Dear Asit,   
If you are able to adopt the first statement that you have made, that   
is your ability to switch on and switch off, then you are a success, and   
a simple success, but a great success. If you are calling yourself as   
failure, then that 'feeling' or 'calling' itself is a deterrant.   
Self actualization is a process of either gradual progress from the   
basic survival needs to security needs, love needs and ego needs, OR   
a sudden quantum jump from a position where even survival needs   
have not been fulfilled.   
There was one gentleman hailing from Swedish royal family, who   
left his 8 million dollars worth of legacy (valued in 1930s) and came   
to India and finally found the Truth in Tiruvannamalai. When he died, he  
owned only two dhotis. He is Swami Ramanagiri, whose Samadhi is near   
Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Bhagavan Ramana guided him, at all times from 1930s and  
even after His Maha Nirvana, Bhagavan guided him upto the point of merger in  
the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
