## Dhruva and Prahlada

Dhruva was ignored by his father who never considered Dhruva,   
as the eligible heir for his throne. Dhruva went for tapas in the   
forest. Srimad Bhagavatam says that he inhaled all the air   
and retained it within that the plants and animals did not find   
enough air even to breathe! Such was his deep penance. Narayana   
appeared before him. Dhruva had closed his eyes and so he could   
not see Narayana. Then the Lord touched his cheek with the conch-   
shell and Dhruva opened his and rejoiced at the Lord's form. Here,   
Dhruva asked for what from Narayana? He simply wanted due   
recognition from his father and kingship later. It was granted.   
All tapas thus ends in petty fulfilment of desires.   
Prahlada did not do any tapas. He was constantly remembering   
Narayana within and was chanting His name with his school-mates.   
When Hiranyakashyap asked him: Wherefrom are you getting this   
strength? You have survived poisoning etc., Prahlada said: The   
power is Narayana's power. We are all moving about only due to   
Narayana's Sakti. You cannot lift even your sword or maze without   
Him. In fact, we are all in Him. He is not within us. With this   
understanding, Prahlada got liberated in due course, though he did not perform  
any yoga or penance like Dhruva.   
Seppadi viddhai katru... Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai, V.33.   
Give me the knowledge of eternal life that I may learn the great   
wisdom, and shun the delusion of this world, Oh! Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.
