## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi says Our body is like the shop rented by the businessman  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: January 28, 2010, 01:42:50 PM

Knowing that all misery arises only as a result of the fundamental error  the  
original sin  of attending to second and third persons instead of attending  
to and knowing the true nature of the first person, Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
graciously appeared on earth to advise humanity, Throughout the waking and  
dream states you attend only to second and third persons, and in consequence  
you experience endless misery. But in sleep, when you do not attend to any  
second or third person, you do not experience any misery. Overlooking the  
peaceful happiness that you experienced while asleep, you search for happiness  
in the waking state by attending to innumerable external objects. However,  
does not the fact that you experienced happiness during sleep in the absence  
of those objects, indicate that happiness lies not in the objects but in you,  
the first person or subject? Therefore why not you try, even in the waking  
state, to attend not to second and third persons but to the first person I  
?   
On hearing this, however, some devotees wonder whether it is necessary then to  
withdraw from all activities in order to be able to practise Self-attention.  
If we are to follow this sadhana of Self--attention in all earnestness, will  
not work prove to be an obstacle? But if we give up all work, how are we to  
provide the food, clothing and shelter required by the body? they ask.  
However, whenever devotees asked Sri Bhagavan such questions, He used to reply  
that work need not be a hindrance to spiritual practice (sadhana). This does  
not mean, of course, that an aspirant should work in the same spirit as a  
wordly man or that he should work with the same aim in view. The spirit in  
which and the aim with which an aspirant should work in this world, can be  
illustrated by the following example: Suppose a businessman rents a shop in the heart of a big city for Rs. 1,000/-  
a month. If from his business he aims to make only sufficient money to pay the  
rent for the shop, will it not be a worthless business? Should not his aim in  
renting the shop be to earn a profit of Rs. 10,000/- a month? On the other  
hand, if he does not make sufficient money even to pay the rent, will he be  
able to remain in the shop to earn his profit?   
Our body is like the shop rented by the businessman.The aim with which we rent  
this body is to realize Self, while the rent we have to pay for the body is  
food, clothing and shelter. In order to pay this rent, it is necessary for us  
to work, using the mind, speech and body as our instruments. If we do not pay  
the rent, we cannot live in the body and earn the great profit of Self-  
knowledge. However, we should not spend our whole life-all our time and  
effortin working to pay the rent. The mind, speech and body should work only  
for that amount of time and with that amount of effort which is required for  
paying the rent  for providing the food, clothing and shelter necessary for  
the body. If instead we devote all our time and effort towards accumulating  
comforts and conveniences for the body, as worldly people do, we would be just  
like the worthless businessman who works only to pay the rent and who never  
tries to make a profit. Therefore, a sincere aspirant should arrange his work  
in such a way that he will spend only a portion of his time and energy for  
maintaining the body, so that he can utilize the remaining time and energy in  
striving to earn the great profit of Self-knowledge.   
For some aspirants prarabdha will be arranged by God or Guru in such a way  
that they need to do little or no work to maintain their body, whereas for  
other aspirants it may be arranged in such a way that they have to spend most  
of their time in working for the maintenance of the body. But in whatever way  
the prarabdha is arranged, it is arranged only for the aspirants own good,  
that is, for his ultimate attainment of Self-knowledge. Moreover, since  
prarabdha determines only the outward activities of the body and mind, it can  
in no way obstruct the inward desire and yearning for Self-knowledge. If one  
has an intense yearning for Self-knowledge, the Gurus Grace will certainly  
help one in all ways, both from within and without, to enable one to attend to  
Self.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ What progress mankind made so far?

A dog went to the cremation ground. It picked up a sharp piece of bone from  
which the flesh had been completely burnt off and started munching it. The  
sharp edges of the bone pierced the dogs mouth in many places and there was  
bleeding. The dog dropped it, but seeing blood smeared all over it, it thought  
that the blood was coming from the bone because of its ravenous munching. It  
licked the blood and again started chewing the bone even more ravenously, with  
the result that there were more wounds in its mouth and more bleeding. The  
foolish dog went on repeating this process of dropping the bone, licking the  
blood and again chewing the bone. Little did that foolish dog realize that in  
fact the blood came from its own mouth and not from the bone!   
A foolish dog picked up a bone,   
Bereft of flesh because twas burnt,   
Masticated many a round   
Till its mouth was filled with wounds,   
Licked end praised the blood, its own,   
No thing on earth equals this bone,   
\-- Guru Vachaka Kovai, verse 585   
Similarly, when a man enjoys external objects, he only experiences a little of  
the happiness that is already within him. But, on account of ignorance, he  
thinks that the happiness comes from the external objects, and thus he behaves  
like the dog in the story. Exactly like the dog that munched the bone again  
and again, throughout his life man repeatedly searches for and accumulates  
external objects. What is the result of all this? Alas ! Untold heaps of  
misery, with a few iotas of pleasure in between  that is all! Indeed, all  
this is ignorance, otherwise called maya!   
All the researches and efforts of mankind, from the stone age to the modern  
atomic age, in different fields of endeavour, be they intellectual, scientific  
or social  are they not all similar to the efforts of the dog which  
untiringly munches the bone? Do not feel offended by this statement, which may  
seem to be a sweeping one, for when told without reserve, this is the plain  
truth! Tell me, what indeed has mankind done in the name of progress so far,  
other than improving and accumulating external objects for the satisfaction of  
the five senses? All the aforesaid human efforts are based upon nothing but  
the wrong assumption that happiness comes from external objects. Is there any  
difference between the dog which thinks that more blood will come out of the  
dry bone the more it is munched, and the man who thinks that humanity will be  
made increasingly happy by accumulating more and more external objects through  
the improvements of scientific and industrial progress? Certainly not!   
Thus, not knowing the right path for obtaining everlasting happiness, humanity  
has gone too far and is racing still further in the wrong direction! There is  
no wrong in mans love for happiness. It is his birthright. It is in fact the  
birthright of all living beings. Thus happiness should be obtained and should  
never be suppressed! But do not toil to achieve objects of worldly pleasure,  
which give only an iota of fleeting happiness. Direct all your efforts only to  
towards obtaining happiness in full. By desiring petty external objects you  
get only a transient and limited happiness. Therefore, be not a person of  
petty desire! Be a person of full desire! Until perfect happiness is obtained,  
do not give up your efforts. Know the way to experience always and  
uninterruptedly that happiness (ananda) which is you,and which exists (sat)  
and shines (chit) within you as your real nature. This is the goal supreme  
(purushartha), the very purpose for which you were born.

Dear silentgreen,   
There was one Siddha by name Kaduveli Siddhar. He was staying   
on a hill and was constantly in meditation, Brahma Dhyanam. He   
realized Brahman and continued to live as an ascetic on the hill.   
The King asked the courtiers whether it is true that Kaduveli is   
a Brahma Swarupam. They all said Yes. He wanted to 'disturb'   
Kaduveli Siddhar. He sent one of his courtesans. She went and   
asked Kaduveli to marry her. Kaduveli agreed and married her.   
She then wanted a baby. Kaduveli slept with her and gave a baby. One day,  
she left him back to the palace leaving the baby with him. She told the king  
that Kaduveli is a fraud and he had married her   
and also got a baby through her. That evening, she was dancing on in the  
palace. Kaduveli had to come there, because the baby was   
crying for mother's milk. He stood with the baby and was waiting for her to  
complete the dance. Seeing Kaduveli and the baby, everyone   
including the King roared with laughter. Kaduveli then gave the baby and  
stood before the king. The king asked: Are you Brahma Swarupam? The  
Siddhar said: Yes. The king then asked him: How come you are married, had conjugal bliss with my courtesan and also got a  
baby? The Siddhar said: Yes, I did all this. Still I am   
 Brahma Swarupam. The king said: Prove it. The Siddhar said: I am Brahmaswarupam and this is the Truth. I am always the "Being   
through." He then walked towards a wall and entered into the wall   
and disappeared!   
Bhagavan Ramana has told this story once or twice in the Hall.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Sun rays and holes**   
A curtain had many holes of various sizes through which sun rays streaked  
inside a room.   
Aligning in the ray path of any of the holes gives a faint touch of the sun.   
However only concentrating on the sizes of the holes, one may miss the sun  
rays.

Even if all the persons of the world become self-realized at the same time,  
they can all be happy at the same time. Their happiness does not depend on the  
pity generated by seeing sufferings, or in contrast with some unhappiness.  
Their happiness is absolute since it comes from the same self which is  
impersonal and of the nature of bliss.
