**Being Through**   
Pure air even if it is contaminated with smoke knows that it is pure, since it  
"Be's through" the smoke.   
Pure water even if it is contaminated with pollutants knows that it is pure,  
since it "Be's through" the pollutants.   
Pure mind even if it gets contaminated with thoughts knows that it is pure,  
since it "Be's through" the thoughts.

Diet of a worldly person: Tasty dishes, deserts, drinks.   
Diet of a spiritual person: Scriptures, Hymns, Bhajans, Meditation.   
A worldly person enjoys the taste and fills the stomach.   
A spiritual person "unfills" the mind and enjoys the soul.

Dear silentgreen,   
There was one Siddha by name Kaduveli Siddhar. He was staying   
on a hill and was constantly in meditation, Brahma Dhyanam. He   
realized Brahman and continued to live as an ascetic on the hill.   
The King asked the courtiers whether it is true that Kaduveli is   
a Brahma Swarupam. They all said Yes. He wanted to 'disturb'   
Kaduveli Siddhar. He sent one of his courtesans. She went and   
asked Kaduveli to marry her. Kaduveli agreed and married her.   
She then wanted a baby. Kaduveli slept with her and gave a baby. One day,  
she left him back to the palace leaving the baby with him. She told the king  
that Kaduveli is a fraud and he had married her   
and also got a baby through her. That evening, she was dancing on in the  
palace. Kaduveli had to come there, because the baby was   
crying for mother's milk. He stood with the baby and was waiting for her to  
complete the dance. Seeing Kaduveli and the baby, everyone   
including the King roared with laughter. Kaduveli then gave the baby and  
stood before the king. The king asked: Are you Brahma Swarupam? The  
Siddhar said: Yes. The king then asked him: How come you are married, had conjugal bliss with my courtesan and also got a  
baby? The Siddhar said: Yes, I did all this. Still I am   
 Brahma Swarupam. The king said: Prove it. The Siddhar said: I am Brahmaswarupam and this is the Truth. I am always the "Being   
through." He then walked towards a wall and entered into the wall   
and disappeared!   
Bhagavan Ramana has told this story once or twice in the Hall.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Self Friend**   
No new friends came,   
And old friends are gone,   
Life-breath still sounds,   
For self still stays on.

**Sun rays and holes**   
A curtain had many holes of various sizes through which sun rays streaked  
inside a room.   
Aligning in the ray path of any of the holes gives a faint touch of the sun.   
However only concentrating on the sizes of the holes, one may miss the sun  
rays.

## Re:[5]Happiness of self is absolute  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 03, 2010, 11:20:32 AM

Even if all the persons of the world become self-realized at the same time,  
they can all be happy at the same time. Their happiness does not depend on the  
pity generated by seeing sufferings, or in contrast with some unhappiness.  
Their happiness is absolute since it comes from the same self which is  
impersonal and of the nature of bliss.

To write english, we need english alphabets,   
To write sanskrit we need devanagari alphabets,   
To write the language of the divine, we need the alphabets of the saints.   
Spectacles enable us to see the outer world with more clarity.   
Saints leave us their hearts for the world.   
Wearing their hearts enable us to see the inner world with more clarity.

Diet of a worldly person: Tasty dishes, deserts, drinks.

One who needs a strict diet for fear of going astray is very much a wordly  
person.   
One who prescribes do's and don'ts is a worldly person.   
One who feels superior to others because of his spiritual diet is a worldly  
person.   
One who abides in the Self is a religious person no matter what the diet.   
Just my two paisa.
