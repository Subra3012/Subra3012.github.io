## Rudram and Chamakam

I had left learning the Vedas for some time now due to personal difficulties.  
But today I just chanted the Rudram and Chamakam. It took around 30 mins  
appx... I feel so very energized and very positive calm and composed and  
sharp.   
All along till now I can only chant the Rudram and Chamakam only with the help  
of a Book in my hand. I have taken sankalpa that I must learn to chant this  
without seeing by heart and I am going to re start my Veda classes  
immediately.   
This very change in me now is very evident of the potency of Mantras. I just  
saw by my own eyes the grace of Siva. He is so easily pleased when you chant  
the Rudra and Chamakam. I can sense it by the change within me! I am Happy  
now. God is listening. simply chanting the Rudram and Chamakam he has graced  
me so much!   
Just felt like sharing with you all!

i am attracted to mantras...but have not stabilised myself to chant any one  
mantra. my difficulty is also my ignorance of sanskrit which i did not pay  
much attention to while in school many many decades ago. there must definitely  
be a lot of power in mantras which i am yet to experience. the longing, of  
course, is there to learn, meditate and drown in some mantra which wipes out  
the physical.   
i understand that mantras should be recited in a particular way. the  
initiation by a guru is important, they say, for this reason. each mantra has  
its own metre / chanda and syllables.   
was told arunachala shiva itself is a powerful mantra...

I tried Sri Rudram and Chamkam for sometime. But I had to leave   
it because I could not pronounce it properly with my limted knowledge   
of Sanskrit. In Sanskrit mantras, pronouciation is of paramount importance.  
I now chant only Arunachala Siva. Arunachala is   
Ramana Panchakshara. Saiva Siddhantis are accepting Vedas,   
but they do not approve caste differences. Sri Rudram, is central   
to Vedas, it appears in Yajur Veda and the Namasivaya mantra is the  
centrepiece in Sri Rudram.   
Arunachala Siva.

yesterday i was going through rudrashtakam by tulsidas. it is very beautiful.  
starts with "Namami Shami Shan Nirvan Rupam; Vibum Vyakapam  
Brahmvedasvarupam....."   
Eight cantos on Rudra (Rudrashtakam)   
First Canto   
O Ishan! I pray You, the one Who is the lord of all, Who is in eternal  
Nirvana-bliss, Who is resplendent, Who is omni-present, and Who is Brahman and  
Ved in totality. I adore You, Who is for self, Who is formless, Who is without  
change, Who is passionless, Who is like the sky (immeasurable), and Who lives  
in the sky.1   
Eight Canto was very sweet and to some extent answered what we are discussing  
here!   
I don't know yoga, japa (chanting of names), or prayers. Still, I am bowing  
continuously and always to You. O Shambhu! O Prabhu! Save me from the  
unhappiness due to old age, birth, grief, sins, and troubles. I bow to You,  
Who is the Lord.8

Dear Vinita,   
Its a very beautiful shloka full of meaning and Bhavam. Tulasidas's works are  
in such simple Hindi that as we read the Shloka, we are able to imbibe the  
essence then and there! if one continuously keeps chanting these shlokas, the  
Bhavam, the love for the Self will intensify and it will definitely inspire  
one in realizing the Self.   
This is what is called Bhakthi Rasa.   
Nagaraj

Dear munagala,   
Bhagavan Ramana always recommended continuation of Gayatri   
Mantra and Sandhyavandhana for Brahmins who were already   
doing it. He also advocated not to remove the tuft of hair, if they   
had already got. He is the one Jnana Guru, who did not disturb   
the existing practices for any devotee according to his own religion.   
Arunachala Siva.
