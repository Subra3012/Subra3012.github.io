It is striking too how the simplest of questions are often the most difficult  
to answer. What is the wisest   
way to greet such apparently widespread indifference to things that really  
matter? How best may love   
be sustained in the face of hostility and hatred forgiven while maintaining  
utter integrity regarding   
condemnation of violence and the absolute requirement to stand fast in the  
face of oppression?   
The answers are challenging in the extreme and do little to console us. Often  
it is suffering alone that   
will open our eyes to the deepest issues of life and death -- while sometimes  
only absolute outrage at the   
atrocities we witness around us by way of the veritable bombardment of  
information from the mass media   
that invades our lives, will pierce the sense of apathy and open our hearts to  
God's mercy.   
Ever wary of attachment to extreme opinions, we can at least always begin by  
taking a firm stand on the   
most noble of ideals. In such a restive and rapidly shifting ear as our own,  
is it not the bounden duty   
of all of us who share these concerns somehow to find time in our busy lives  
to wrest out the space and   
opportunity to pay tribute to the highest good of which we can conceive - God,  
Reality or Truth --   
no matter how we may term it?
