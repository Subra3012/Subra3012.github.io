## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 10 And 11

Verse 10   
Prabu charitra sunibe ko rasiya   
Ram Lakhan Sita man Basiya   
 **Verse 10 Meaning**   
 _You are an ardent listener, always so keen to listen to the narration of  
Shri Ram 's Life Stories. Your heart is filled with what Shri Ram stood for.  
You therefore always dwell in the hearts of Shri Ram, Lakshman and Sita._   
 **Verse 11**   
Sukshma roop dhari Siyahi dikhava   
Vikat roop dhari lanka jarava   
 **Verse 11 Meaning**   
 _You appeared before Sita in a Diminutive form and spoke to her in humility.  
You assumed an awesome form and struck terror by setting Lanka on fire._   
 **Commentary** : In Verse 10 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman always listens with love and  
devotion to narrations of Shri Ram's Life Stories.   
Similarly Guru Ramana Maharshi was inspired by Periya Puranam which describes  
the legendary lives of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical poets of Tamil  
Shaivism.   
Ramana Maharshi before his self-realisation in Madurai read only Periya  
Puranam and few parts of Bible.   
So it is always adviced to devotees to read and discuss your favourite god's  
life history and his teachings.   
Ramana Maharshi's devotees Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma would make a  
bundle of provisions, such as rice and pulses, and put them on his head.  
Loaded in this way, they would start on our journey of forty miles to  
Arunachala from desur. They would walk slowly and leisurely, telling each  
other stories of Bhagavan.   
So we need to take inspiration from Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma in  
this regard.   
So here total surrender to guru/god is suggested.   
In Verse 11 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman was in a state of humility  
when spoke to goddess Sita Devi but when required and when his guru/god is in  
danger then lord hanuman would not hesitate to assume awesome form and destroy  
the evil and save the guru/god.   
Ramana Maharshi Devotee Perumalswami though very strong was very humble in the  
presence of guru ramana maharshi but when required and if he sees any trouble  
for his guru he used to fierce back so strongly on the wicked people.   
 **Below is one incident in which Perumalswami protects his guru**   
In 1916, an attempt was made by some drunken pandarams (sadhus) to take away  
the Sri Bhagavan from Tiruvannamalai. They came to Virupaksha Cave and  
solemnly informed the Swami, We are sadhus from Podigai Hill, the sacred Hill  
in which the ancient Agastya Rishi is still doing his tapas,as he has done for  
thousands of years. He has ordered us to take you first to the Siddhas  
conference at Srirangam and thence to Podigai, to give you regular diksha,  
(initiation) after extracting those salts from your body which prevent the  
attainment of higher powers.   
The situation was evidently serious. The Swami,with his rule of equanimity  
maintained silence and awaited developments. Meanwhile, a strong and  
resourceful disciple of his, Perumalswami, hit upon a remedy. Accosting the  
newcomers,Perumalswami said, We have received intimation of your visit and we  
have been commissioned to place your bodies in crucibles(melting pot) and  
place the crucibles over the fire. What do you say? and he also told a fellow  
disciple Mastan, Go and dig a deep pit for preparing the fire for those  
people. The visitors were dumbfounded and promptly retreated.   
But unfortuntely later this same guy Perumalswami for selfish reasons had a  
tiff with guru ramana for different reasons.

Yes. As Tulasidas said Lord Hanuman listens with dovotion and love of Sri  
Ram's story, I have seen when Ramayanam is read or doing pravachanam, near the  
photo of Ram, one plank will be placed and covered with red silk cloth. They  
say it is the seat offering to Lord Hanuman to sit and listen the Ramayana.

It is truely said, Hanuman is Balavan (most powerful) Bhudhiman. He knows all  
sastras but He never shows infront of Rama. In tamil He is called sollin  
chelvan. i.e. He knows how to where to what to say the word.   
Once I heard from the pravachanam. I do not know whether this incident is in  
Ramayana or not. But it shows how He is devoted to Ram. After the  
Pattabhishekam, Sita was very much pleased for the service of Hanuman so she  
presented her pearl mala to Hanuman. He received it but He did not put on His  
neck instead He started biting each pearl and was seeing. Sita got angry then  
she asked why He was spoiling her gift. Hanuman told her, He was searching  
whether there is Ram inside it.   
The Pandit told He wanted to see Ram every where, in every particle. Otherwise  
it does not matter for Him how much it is costly. In this way we must see Ram  
in every atom. That bhavam we must have.   
In Ramayana there are so many people who were drawn to Ram. Dasrat, Kowsalya  
even Kaikeyi also. Then there comes all rishis, His public, Guhan, Sabari.  
Vibhishna. But among all these people Hanuman stands first. It is for Bhakti  
only. He is an symbol for bhakti. We must have that type of bhakti. In Kamba  
ramayana we can see His bhakti. Let us pray to grant that type of bhakti to  
attain our Gods or gurus.

Adding to this same thread, in Vishnu temples we can see Hanuman but in some  
shiva temples also we can see   
Hanuman in pillar. People do pujas to this Hanuman. I was told that Shiva took  
Hanuman avatar to serve Narayana.There is no difference in Shiva and Narayana.

ramayana we can see His bhakti. Let us pray to grant that type of bhakti to  
attain our Gods or gurus.

Adding to this same thread, in Vishnu temples we can see Hanuman but in some  
shiva temples also we can see   
Hanuman in pillar. People do pujas to this Hanuman. I was told that Shiva took  
Hanuman avatar to serve Narayana.There is no difference in Shiva and Narayana.

Verse 10   
Prabu charitra sunibe ko rasiya   
Ram Lakhan Sita man Basiya   
 **Verse 10 Meaning**   
 _You are an ardent listener, always so keen to listen to the narration of  
Shri Ram 's Life Stories. Your heart is filled with what Shri Ram stood for.  
You therefore always dwell in the hearts of Shri Ram, Lakshman and Sita._   
 **Verse 11**   
Sukshma roop dhari Siyahi dikhava   
Vikat roop dhari lanka jarava   
 **Verse 11 Meaning**   
 _You appeared before Sita in a Diminutive form and spoke to her in humility.  
You assumed an awesome form and struck terror by setting Lanka on fire._   
 **Commentary** : In Verse 10 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman always listens with love and  
devotion to narrations of Shri Ram's Life Stories.   
Similarly Guru Ramana Maharshi was inspired by Periya Puranam which describes  
the legendary lives of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical poets of Tamil  
Shaivism.   
Ramana Maharshi before his self-realisation in Madurai read only Periya  
Puranam and few parts of Bible.   
So it is always adviced to devotees to read and discuss your favourite god's  
life history and his teachings.   
Ramana Maharshi's devotees Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma would make a  
bundle of provisions, such as rice and pulses, and put them on his head.  
Loaded in this way, they would start on our journey of forty miles to  
Arunachala from desur. They would walk slowly and leisurely, telling each  
other stories of Bhagavan.   
So we need to take inspiration from Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma in  
this regard.   
So here total surrender to guru/god is suggested.   
In Verse 11 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman was in a state of humility  
when spoke to goddess Sita Devi but when required and when his guru/god is in  
danger then lord hanuman would not hesitate to assume awesome form and destroy  
the evil and save the guru/god.   
Ramana Maharshi Devotee Perumalswami though very strong was very humble in the  
presence of guru ramana maharshi but when required and if he sees any trouble  
for his guru he used to fierce back so strongly on the wicked people.   
 **Below is one incident in which Perumalswami protects his guru**   
In 1916, an attempt was made by some drunken pandarams (sadhus) to take away  
the Sri Bhagavan from Tiruvannamalai. They came to Virupaksha Cave and  
solemnly informed the Swami, We are sadhus from Podigai Hill, the sacred Hill  
in which the ancient Agastya Rishi is still doing his tapas,as he has done for  
thousands of years. He has ordered us to take you first to the Siddhas  
conference at Srirangam and thence to Podigai, to give you regular diksha,  
(initiation) after extracting those salts from your body which prevent the  
attainment of higher powers.   
The situation was evidently serious. The Swami,with his rule of equanimity  
maintained silence and awaited developments. Meanwhile, a strong and  
resourceful disciple of his, Perumalswami, hit upon a remedy. Accosting the  
newcomers,Perumalswami said, We have received intimation of your visit and we  
have been commissioned to place your bodies in crucibles(melting pot) and  
place the crucibles over the fire. What do you say? and he also told a fellow  
disciple Mastan, Go and dig a deep pit for preparing the fire for those  
people. The visitors were dumbfounded and promptly retreated.   
But unfortuntely later this same guy Perumalswami for selfish reasons had a  
tiff with guru ramana for different reasons.

Yes. As Tulasidas said Lord Hanuman listens with dovotion and love of Sri  
Ram's story, I have seen when Ramayanam is read or doing pravachanam, near the  
photo of Ram, one plank will be placed and covered with red silk cloth. They  
say it is the seat offering to Lord Hanuman to sit and listen the Ramayana.

It is truely said, Hanuman is Balavan (most powerful) Bhudhiman. He knows all  
sastras but He never shows infront of Rama. In tamil He is called sollin  
chelvan. i.e. He knows how to where to what to say the word.   
Once I heard from the pravachanam. I do not know whether this incident is in  
Ramayana or not. But it shows how He is devoted to Ram. After the  
Pattabhishekam, Sita was very much pleased for the service of Hanuman so she  
presented her pearl mala to Hanuman. He received it but He did not put on His  
neck instead He started biting each pearl and was seeing. Sita got angry then  
she asked why He was spoiling her gift. Hanuman told her, He was searching  
whether there is Ram inside it.   
The Pandit told He wanted to see Ram every where, in every particle. Otherwise  
it does not matter for Him how much it is costly. In this way we must see Ram  
in every atom. That bhavam we must have.   
In Ramayana there are so many people who were drawn to Ram. Dasrat, Kowsalya  
even Kaikeyi also. Then there comes all rishis, His public, Guhan, Sabari.  
Vibhishna. But among all these people Hanuman stands first. It is for Bhakti  
only. He is an symbol for bhakti. We must have that type of bhakti. In Kamba

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 12 And 13  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:53:46 AM  
---  
**Verse 12**   
Bhima roop dhari asur sanghare   
Ramachandra ke kaj sanvare   
**Verse 12 Meaning**   
With over-whelming might you destroyed the Asuras (demons) and performed all  
tasks assigned to you by Shri Ram with great skill.   
 **Verse 13**   
Laye Sanjivan Lakhan Jiyaye   
Shri Raghuvir Harashi ur laye   
**Verse 13 Meaning**   
 **You brought Sanjivan (A herb that revives life) and restored Lakshman back  
to life, Shri Raghuvir (Shri Ram) cheerfully embraced you with his heart full  
of joy.**   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 12 tulasidas tells that lord hanuman performs with great skill/zest  
all tasks assigned by Lord Shri Rama.   
God-Guru's grace is much required if we are to progress in this spiritual life  
and to eradicate ignorance in us.   
As known with ramakrishna paramahamsa's grace narendra has become swami  
vivekananda and has revived hinduism and can easily say that he is one of the  
most influential hindu saints in 20th century.   
When he asked his master ramakrishna whether he as seen god,master said in  
return "Is there anyone who has not seen god?" which impressed vivekananda and  
be became a great disciple of bhagavan ramakrishna.   
As guru ramana says,   
As a lion seen in a dream by an elephant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a  
sage, awakens the disciple from the dream of ignorance.The cause of all  
miseries is the impure vasana, the belief that holds the body to be I.   
The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you will only  
receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of the ocean;  
the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is entirely upto  
you.   
In Verse 13 tulasidas describes that Lord Hanuman has brought Sanjivan (A herb  
that revives life) and restored Lakshman back to life which made Lord Rama  
happy.   
Miracles do happen with guru's grace and we have seen many incidents in past  
regarding miracles.   
In Mahabharata war lord krishna saved arjuna and other pandavas manytimes with  
his miracles else pandavas would have lost the war.

## Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 10 And 11  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 08, 2010, 01:33:31 PM  
---  
Verse 10   
Prabu charitra sunibe ko rasiya   
Ram Lakhan Sita man Basiya   
 **Verse 10 Meaning**   
 _You are an ardent listener, always so keen to listen to the narration of  
Shri Ram 's Life Stories. Your heart is filled with what Shri Ram stood for.  
You therefore always dwell in the hearts of Shri Ram, Lakshman and Sita._   
 **Verse 11**   
Sukshma roop dhari Siyahi dikhava   
Vikat roop dhari lanka jarava   
 **Verse 11 Meaning**   
 _You appeared before Sita in a Diminutive form and spoke to her in humility.  
You assumed an awesome form and struck terror by setting Lanka on fire._   
 **Commentary** : In Verse 10 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman always listens with love and  
devotion to narrations of Shri Ram's Life Stories.   
Similarly Guru Ramana Maharshi was inspired by Periya Puranam which describes  
the legendary lives of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical poets of Tamil  
Shaivism.   
Ramana Maharshi before his self-realisation in Madurai read only Periya  
Puranam and few parts of Bible.   
So it is always adviced to devotees to read and discuss your favourite god's  
life history and his teachings.   
Ramana Maharshi's devotees Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma would make a  
bundle of provisions, such as rice and pulses, and put them on his head.  
Loaded in this way, they would start on our journey of forty miles to  
Arunachala from desur. They would walk slowly and leisurely, telling each  
other stories of Bhagavan.   
So we need to take inspiration from Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma in  
this regard.   
So here total surrender to guru/god is suggested.   
In Verse 11 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman was in a state of humility  
when spoke to goddess Sita Devi but when required and when his guru/god is in  
danger then lord hanuman would not hesitate to assume awesome form and destroy  
the evil and save the guru/god.   
Ramana Maharshi Devotee Perumalswami though very strong was very humble in the  
presence of guru ramana maharshi but when required and if he sees any trouble  
for his guru he used to fierce back so strongly on the wicked people.   
 **Below is one incident in which Perumalswami protects his guru**   
In 1916, an attempt was made by some drunken pandarams (sadhus) to take away  
the Sri Bhagavan from Tiruvannamalai. They came to Virupaksha Cave and  
solemnly informed the Swami, âWe are sadhus from Podigai Hill, the sacred  
Hill in which the ancient Agastya Rishi is still doing his tapas,as he has  
done for thousands of years. He has ordered us to take you first to the  
Siddhasâ conference at Srirangam and thence to Podigai, to give you regular  
diksha, (initiation) after extracting those salts from your body which prevent  
the attainment of higher powers.â   
The situation was evidently serious. The Swami,with his rule of equanimity  
maintained silence and awaited developments. Meanwhile, a strong and  
resourceful disciple of his, Perumalswami, hit upon a remedy. Accosting the  
newcomers,Perumalswami said, âWe have received intimation of your visit and  
we have been commissioned to place your bodies in crucibles(melting pot) and  
place the crucibles over the fire. What do you say?â and he also told a  
fellow disciple Mastan, âGo and dig a deep pit for preparing the fire for  
those people.â The visitors were dumbfounded and promptly retreated.   
But unfortuntely later this same guy Perumalswami for selfish reasons had a  
tiff with guru ramana for different reasons.

Yes. As Tulasidas said Lord Hanuman listens with dovotion and love of Sri  
Ram's story, I have seen when Ramayanam is read or doing pravachanam, near the  
photo of Ram, one plank will be placed and covered with red silk cloth. They  
say it is the seat offering to Lord Hanuman to sit and listen the Ramayana.

That is excellent ramanaduli garu. That shows the devotion(bhakti) aspect to  
the highest level.

It is truely said, Hanuman is Balavan (most powerful) Bhudhiman. He knows all  
sastras but He never shows infront of Rama. In tamil He is called sollin  
chelvan. i.e. He knows how to where to what to say the word.   
Once I heard from the pravachanam. I do not know whether this incident is in  
Ramayana or not. But it shows how He is devoted to Ram. After the  
Pattabhishekam, Sita was very much pleased for the service of Hanuman so she  
presented her pearl mala to Hanuman. He received it but He did not put on His  
neck instead He started biting each pearl and was seeing. Sita got angry then  
she asked why He was spoiling her gift. Hanuman told her, He was searching  
whether there is Ram inside it.   
The Pandit told He wanted to see Ram every where, in every particle. Otherwise  
it does not matter for Him how much it is costly. In this way we must see Ram  
in every atom. That bhavam we must have.   
In Ramayana there are so many people who were drawn to Ram. Dasrat, Kowsalya  
even Kaikeyi also. Then there comes all rishis, His public, Guhan, Sabari.  
Vibhishna. But among all these people Hanuman stands first. It is for Bhakti  
only. He is an symbol for bhakti. We must have that type of bhakti. In Kamba  
ramayana we can see His bhakti. Let us pray to grant that type of bhakti to  
attain our Gods or gurus.

Adding to this same thread, in Vishnu temples we can see Hanuman but in some  
shiva temples also we can see   
Hanuman in pillar. People do pujas to this Hanuman. I was told that Shiva took  
Hanuman avatar to serve Narayana.There is no difference in Shiva and Narayana.
