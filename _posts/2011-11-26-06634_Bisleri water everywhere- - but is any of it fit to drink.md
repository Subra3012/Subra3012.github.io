Dear Sri Graham,   
My wife prepares hot water and cools it in room temperature, without placing  
that in refrigerator and our family drink only that.\   
All brands of mineral waters are waters packed in plastic containers. No  
brand is supplying pure water.

Graham,   
Sorry but i have doubt here also.   
By 12 liters, do you mean the cans supplied to houses? And what about 1  
litre water bottles that are sold opp. to Ramansramam?   
I heard antoher notion that the shopkeepers or intermediate vendors just fill  
river water and supply those plastic cans to houses, not just bisleri band to  
be blamed. Even in Bangalore AquaGuard plastic cans have issues atleast as I  
know.   
Best way is to finish this adulterated janma and attain permanent liberation.
