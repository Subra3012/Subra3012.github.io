Once Bhagawan is sitting near Virupaksha cave and a group of Sadhus are  
sitting in front of him silently with reverance.One Sadhu with big belly came  
there   
but is quite uncomfortable with the way people giving importance to Bhagawan  
and he selected a seat much higher than Bhagawan and declared that he is   
greater than Bhagawan because he sat at a higher level than Bhagawan and  
insisted that other sahus must adore him.Sadhus are surprised at his behaviour   
but Bhagawan remained without any reaction.After some time one monkey came and  
occupied a comfortable position on a tree much higher than everybody.   
Now Bhagawan declared now that a monkey is occupying a higher position than  
all of us including that big belly Swami it must be greater than all of us   
according to the statement of the Swami let us all adore that monkey.Everybody  
laughed wholeheartedly except that big belly swami who went away ashamed.

Dear Raju, Many sadhus in the Hills had tried many pranks   
some even dangerous pranks, like rolling down a rock upon Bhagavan,   
have been tried. Bhagavan kept his normal Silence in these matters.   
These 'sadhus' have been vividly described in Tamil, Ramana   
Vijayam. Bhagavan often used to say, that there is no 'ajnani',   
there is no 'jnani', but there is only Jnana!   
Arunachala Siva.
