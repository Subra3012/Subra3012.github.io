Dear sir   
I came to know they got fixed a web camera on western side of the Holi hill.  
It starts 6.a.m.to 6 p.m In every 60 sec, we can see   
different view of the Holi Hill. We can see on our pc.also.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. This can be seen from your PC, by clicking Arunachala Webcam.   
I am starting my computer work in the Forum everyday after seeing this only.  
The web photo is available with varying photographs during   
nights also on full moon days.   
Arunachala Siva.
