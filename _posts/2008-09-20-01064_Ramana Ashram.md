## Ramana Ashram

I am planning in visiting Rama Ashram in a week from today (september 27th or  
28th) from a period of two weeks.   
I saw on previous posts email address for enquiries on accomodation at the  
Ashram - Thanks.   
Is there any teaching or guidance available in the Ashram in case required?   
(I encounter some difficulties in my current practice).   
As far as I remember this the start of the monsoon season in Tami Nadu, from  
my experience in north India the monsoon is quite heavy - can someone kindly  
elaborate on how "bad" it is during this period down south?   
Thanks,   
Bill

Dear Billbill,   
I am glad you are visiting Sri Ramansramam, in a week's time.   
A few tips, since I have gone there, in the beginning of this week.   
1\. Stay is possible in Asram's guest houses, (inside and outside   
Asram) only with prior written request and their written permission.   
Further, no one can stay beyond three days in guest houses. For   
a longer stay, you choose a hotel, (there are many with different   
levels of comforts), the charges will be around Rs 400 per day   
for a double room. Only vegetarian food will be available on   
extra payment.   
2\. There is no rain in T. Malai right now. The temperature is around   
35 degrees celsius.   
3\. Regarding self enquriy practices:- People are quite busy in   
Asram. You may have to patiently request them and wait for their   
convenience. You may also ask fellow pilgrims.   
4\. You can eat inside the Asram. Their timings are:-   
7.00 am - Coffee/tea   
11.30 am - lunch   
4.00 pm \- tea   
7.30 pm \- dinner   
Arunachala Siva.
