## Ramana Ashram  
Author: billbill            Date: September 20, 2008, 07:02:04 AM

I am planning in visiting Rama Ashram in a week from today (september 27th or  
28th) from a period of two weeks.   
I saw on previous posts email address for enquiries on accomodation at the  
Ashram - Thanks.   
Is there any teaching or guidance available in the Ashram in case required?   
(I encounter some difficulties in my current practice).   
As far as I remember this the start of the monsoon season in Tami Nadu, from  
my experience in north India the monsoon is quite heavy - can someone kindly  
elaborate on how "bad" it is during this period down south?   
Thanks,   
Bill

Dear Billbill,   
I am glad you are visiting Sri Ramansramam, in a week's time.   
A few tips, since I have gone there, in the beginning of this week.   
1\. Stay is possible in Asram's guest houses, (inside and outside   
Asram) only with prior written request and their written permission.   
Further, no one can stay beyond three days in guest houses. For   
a longer stay, you choose a hotel, (there are many with different   
levels of comforts), the charges will be around Rs 400 per day   
for a double room. Only vegetarian food will be available on   
extra payment.   
2\. There is no rain in T. Malai right now. The temperature is around   
35 degrees celsius.   
3\. Regarding self enquriy practices:- People are quite busy in   
Asram. You may have to patiently request them and wait for their   
convenience. You may also ask fellow pilgrims.   
4\. You can eat inside the Asram. Their timings are:-   
7.00 am - Coffee/tea   
11.30 am - lunch   
4.00 pm \- tea   
7.30 pm \- dinner   
Arunachala Siva.

Obituary: Sri T. R. Srinivasan   
In 1978 while working as a stenographer for the management of a Chennai engine   
and valve factory, Sri T. R. Srinivasan got a diagnosis from physicians that  
he had   
only six months to live. Thinking his life was at an end, he took time off and  
came to Sri   
Ramanasramam for a weeks stay. During the visit he found himself called to  
stay on and   
was blessed to begin service in the Ashram office. Meanwhile, in Bhagavans  
Ashram, his   
health was restored and TRS, as he came to be known, faithfully served the  
Ashram for   
the next 32 years. Known for his diligence, TRS was said to be ever mindful of  
Bhagavans   
injunction regarding Ashram correspondence: letters should be answered the  
same day.   
TRS was meticulous in his duties and gracious in his service to Ashram  
devotees.   
In 2010, following a fall which left him with an impaired hip, TRS withdrew  
from   
active life. His health was in decline for the last year until the afternoon  
of the 26th   
September, at the age of 78, when he peacefully drew his last breath.   
from the saranagathi newsletter oct 2013

Sri Ramana Maharshi rarely asked visitors if they practiced self-enquiry or  
Japa but He did ask them Have had your food? Remembering this on Sunday May  
3rd over five thousand people were served hot food between 9:15 AM and 12 PM  
at the entrance to the ashram. The kitchen workers started cooking as early as  
1:30 AM on Sunday and prepared huge amounts of food in the relatively small  
cooking facility of the ashram. Huge cauldrons filled with tasty Pongal,  
Sambar rice, Curd rice, Vegetable rice, Vangi bhaat etc were transported by  
tricycle to an area near ashram gate and hot food was served to visitors  
without any restriction. The number of devotees walking around the Arunachala  
Hill was very great because of Chitra Pournima(Full moon during when the star  
Chitra is ascendant).   
Another feeding of about five hundred people was done in the evening.  
Boliye(Let us say) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Mahahrshi ki Jai Devotees ki Jai and  
ashram cooks ki jai

When I arrived at the abode of Maharshi, called Ramanashram and jumped out  
from the two wheeled cart just in front of the temple, I was taken straight  
into the presence of the Sage.   
He was sitting in a large hall, near one of its walls. I was led to within  
three or four yards of Maharshi. The Saint lifted up his head, looked at me,  
and made a gesture with his hand as if inviting me to come a little nearer. I  
was struck by the softness and serenity of this movement, so simple and  
dignified that I immediately felt I was facing a great man. His attitude was  
so natural that the newcomer did not feel any wonder or shyness. All his  
critical faculty of thought and his curiosity dropped away. The image of the  
Sage was in this very first moment vividly engraved on my mind, without any  
qualifications, like a picture cast on a sensitive photo plate. But as nothing  
can be conveyed without words, I will try to describe his appearance.   
Maharshi, as I saw him, was a thin, white haired, very gracious old man; his  
skin had the colour of old ivory; his movements were easy, calm and soft; his  
countenance breathed a natural state of inner concentration without the  
slightest effort of will. Or may I say that he had reached that stage when  
will power no longer needs to be used for overcoming any hindrance, or for  
achieving any purpose For the simple reason that everything has already been  
achieved.   
I wonder how it is that I have never forgotten even the smallest detail  
concerning Maharshi; it can be evoked in my brain like a picture on a hidden  
sensitive plate of whose very existence I was unaware.   
May I say that I understand that Maharshi's life is not concentrated on this  
our earthly plane; that it extends far beyond our world; that he contemplates  
a different and real world, a world not subject to storms and changes; that he  
is a torch of light before the throne of the Most High, shedding its rays all  
around; that he is like the incense smoke constantly rising towards the blue  
sky which we see through the temple roof; that his eyes, just now looking at  
me, seem to convey no, I am unable to say anything more. I cannot even think.   
I only feel a stream of tears upon my face. They are abundant and serene. They  
flow silently. It is not suffering, regret, or repentance that is their  
source. I do not know how to name their cause. And through these tears I look  
at the Master. He knows full well their origin. His serious, almost solemn  
face, expresses endless understanding and friendship, and glows with inner  
light which makes it so different from all other human faces. In the light of  
his profound gaze I suddenly understand the reason and purpose of my tears.  
Yes, I see at last. The sudden illumination is too strong to allow immediate  
belief in the truth of the seen. Is this really possible Can it be possible  
But Maharshi's eyes seem to bring a confirmation of it Mouni Sadhu in In days  
of great peace.

Arunachala by night - Mouni Sadhu.   
The outlines of Arunachala peak were clear-cut and sharp against the sky. The  
lower, massive body of the hill remained invisible, wrapped in the darkness of  
night. I have never failed to feel the strange magnetic influence of  
Arunachala even in its visible form. At first I could not rationally explain  
what relation there could be between Maharshi and the hill, for I knew that  
the Sage was far beyond all special beliefs, and that he regarded the whole  
world as an illusion and a play of our physical senses. And yet it was  
undeniable that even in his books he mentions Arunachala with the highest  
reverence and love. It is mysterious, at least for those who have not fathomed  
the symbolism of this strange South Indian Hill. In this quiet night  
meditation, I decided to use the newly discovered method of perceiving that  
which is imperceptible to the ordinary mental faculties. This method consists  
in a preliminary purification of the mind of all thoughts, leaving only the  
intention of getting into touch from within, as it were, with the desired  
object of cognition. Afterwards what is translatable into the language of the  
mind is transmitted to it. In other words, intuition has to provide light from  
a source which the mind cannot reach. The powerful magnetism of Arunachala  
makes the whole process easier. As soon as I plunged into meditation,  
discarding all objects from my sight, I began to see that for which I had been  
searching.   
First of all became clear the well-known occult law that Everything has its  
corresponding form of manifestation in different worlds. Hence that which is  
the spiritual essence of Arunachala has its reflection on the physical plane.  
To me, as to many others, Arunachala was, and is, a sign-post on the path.  
Maharshi also said: Arunachala destroys attachment to worldly things, that is,  
to the objects of physical illusion. This I proved later, when I found that  
every time Arunachala was mentioned or described by those who regarded it as  
their beacon, I felt this worldly illusion disappearing from my thoughts,  
falling into the shadows of unreality, which is their true source.

From Mouni Sadhu's correspondence.   
What kind of attitude is proper in the presence of the Master? Nothing is more  
helpful in the presence of a great being than stillness of mind. It opens the  
door of our heart and enables the Master to come in. The proximity of Maharshi  
makes this effort of stilling the mind infinitely easier than it would be  
elsewhere. Often, even when people pray according to their own faiths, the  
result can ultimately be the same. In the presence of Bhagavan Maharshi we are  
able to find intuitively by ourselves the proper attitude.   
The student of Self‑knowledge begins to understand that his personality is a  
focus or fulcrum, as it were, through which flows and shines the light of life  
that is God. But he himself is not this focus. He must take care to maintain  
it in perfect purity, to enable the maximum of light to shine through it. But  
this should be his only care and nothing more. Herein lies the mystery of the  
disappearance of the ego as the result of Self‑realization. It brings true  
freedom. When the focus has fulfilled its task it is discarded with neither  
pain nor regret. But this happens only when it has become a lived reality and  
not a theory. And that is the highest initiation.   
Maharshi highly appreciates Sri Sankaracharya's Viveka Chudamani or The Crest  
Jewel of Wisdom. Many Hindus regard the Sage of Arunachala to be a  
reincarnation of the author of this treatise, which reaches the highest summit  
of occult philosophic conception. In any event one thing is true: only a  
balanced and one‑pointed mind leads to the realm of truth to samadhi.  
Interruptions in the state of samadhi prove that the mind is not completely  
subdued; it comes back to activity and evades the still imperfect control.

Muruganar day   
Many devotees came from far and near to sing Muruganar's songs on Muruganar?s  
day. We recited 51 titles from Ramana Sannathi Murai chosen for their likeness  
to Tiruvachakam titles. Of Course Aksharamanamalai was chanted to invoke the  
Master?s presence while Vedas were chanted inside the shrine during worship of  
the Samadhi. Born in 1895, Sri C. K. Subrahmanyam grew up in an atmosphere of  
Tamil learning and became in due course a teacher of Tamil in a High School.  
His first collection of poems, Swatantra-Gitam, owed much to his ardent  
admiration of Gandhiji and, like the early work of his elder contemporary,  
Subrahmanya Bharati, formed a distinct contribution to the national movement.  
But when he came to Bhagavan and fell under his spell, he renounced all other  
interests, completely effaced his personality and turned into "a shadow of  
Bhagavan." And he has lived ever since in a state of stark simplicity, utterly  
poor and obscure.   
In thus losing the world to find Bhagavan, he has found a joy to utter and a  
voice to utter it which have given him a high and assured place among the  
immortal singer saints of Tamil Nadu. This sudden and complete change in the  
poems and in the manner of his utterance, the marvelously sustained and  
infinitely varied beauty of the enormous bulk of his verse on a single theme,  
constitutes an undoubted " miracle " wrought by Bhagavan, permanently there  
for all eyes to behold.   
Muruganar was content with composing his poems and having them read by  
Bhagavan. For him there was no ?wider public" to whose notice they should be  
brought. Thus it fell to an admirer, Sri Ramana Padananda, to arrange for the  
printing and publication of six volumes of Muruganar's poems. In practising  
the Presence of Bhagavan under the terms of Muruganar's images and rhythms,  
one enters into intensely felt relations with the Guru who figures in various  
roles of Siva or Subrahmanya, as father. mother or lover, as master, king or  
commander, as beggar or betrayer. Each of the 850 stanzas in Guru-Vachaka-  
Kovai1 is a little golden casket wrought with loving care to enshrine and set  
off a gem fallen from the Master's lips. The stream of Muruganar's inspiration  
has continued running fresh and strong even after the passing of Bhagavan. If  
it has lost some of the old briskness and brightness, it has acquired a new  
serenity. Leaving aside Muruganar's own copious outpourings, his success in  
evoking so much of the little that Bhagavan himself wrote is something to be  
grateful for. It is to Muruganar that we owe the existence and poetic pattern  
of Upadesa Saram, (' Instruction in Thirty Verses ') the living quintessence  
of advaitic thought and a brief but sufficient summary of Bhagavan's own  
practical guidance. Muruganar composed a long narrative poem telling how the  
rishis who trusted too much to their rituals were taught a lesson. At the  
crucial moment, when Siva had to deliver His teaching, Muruganar left it to  
Bhagavan to provide the ipsissima verba of divine revelation.   
Many of the Forty Verses on Reality owe their final form and the exposition  
its logical arrangement to Muruganar's efforts. And this game of collaboration  
reached its climax in the composition of Atma Vidya, wrhich fills a musical  
mould of Gopalakrishna Bharati with a new, profound meaning. Beginning "Easy  
is Self-knowledge," it raises only to reject the image of " the berry in the  
palm of one's hand " ; so evident is this perception that it needs neither  
perceiver nor thing perceived. Having proceeded thus far, Muruganar had to  
leave off where the poet qua poet could only say or imply, "The rest is  
silence ". But Bhagavan, speaking with an authority higher than any poet's,  
continued the argument, explained the sadhana and the grace and ended with a  
hint that Annamalai, the Inner Eye, the One Alone, is the author.

Facing the challenges of life, the Ramana Way.   
Sometimes difficult situations descend on us suddenly. Relationships go sour,  
economic hardships arise, health problems threaten our loved ones or we  
experience all-round failure in our attempts. The feeling of frustration and  
disappointment increases when we feel that the problem is caused by something  
we actually did or by something that we should have done but didn't do. Sri  
Ramana Maharshi has compassionately taught us the way to deal with such  
situations. Here we recount the Master's teaching on this subject and see how  
it grants spiritual peace and freedom from suffering. A devotee once asked  
Ramana Maharshi about the existence of sorrow and evil in creation.   
M.: God's will!   
D.: Why does God will it so?   
M.: It is inscrutable. No motive can be attributed to that Power - no desire,  
no end to achieve can be asserted of that one Infinite, All-wise and All-  
powerful Being. God is untouched by activities, which take place in His  
presence; compare the sun and the world activities. There is no meaning in  
attributing responsibility and motive to the One before it becomes many.   
If so, what should a person facing challenges in his life, do to overcome his  
troubles? Sri Ramana Maharshi teaches that by accepting one's own free-will as  
an instrument of the Divine Will one can eventually obtain peace of mind. In  
Talks He says Acceptance of God's will for the prescribed course of events is  
a great solution of the free-will problem. He elaborates this further saying  
If the mind is restless on account of a sense of the imperfect and  
unsatisfactory character of what befalls us or what is committed or omitted by  
us, then it is wise to drop the sense of responsibility and free-will by  
regarding ourselves as the ordained instruments of the All-wise and All-  
powerful, to do and suffer as He pleases. He then carries all the burdens and  
gives us peace.   
In the reminiscences of Ramana Maharshi by G V Subbaramayya we read On the  
17th of June, Sri R. Narayana Iyer told Sri Bhagavan of his vain efforts at  
matrimonial alliance for his eldest daughter and said that he would make no  
further attempts unless he received a specific direction from Sri Bhagavan.  
Just at that moment the mail brought a journal named Progress. Sri Bhagavan  
read out its motto You can succeed if you know the power that is in you, and  
said that here was the reply to Narayana Iyer. The latter, regarding it as a  
clear token of Sri Bhagavan's Grace, took up at once a new proposal and  
succeeded this time. In a letter dated July 12, 1940 Narayana Iyer writes Till  
Thursday evening I did not know that the marriage was to be settled and to  
take place on the Sunday following. No preparation whatever was made. . .   
What could I do? Just a day's interval and nothing done. I appealed to Sri  
Bhagavan and wrote a letter of saranagati (surrender) with tears trickling  
from my eyes. From that very moment the burden was lifted. I go to  
Tiruvannamalai only to find that I had no work. Buildings, cooks, vessels,  
servants, provisions, in fact every detail had been arranged and everything  
went off very well. It is wonderful. The nerve-racking suspense, frantic  
efforts at the last moment, and the frenzied wanderings look like a dream now,  
and I only chant and chant like a mantra the words, You will succeed if you  
know the Power that is in you.?

Ramana Maharshi After the death experience, one of the new features related to  
the visit of Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. After awakening I would go almost  
every evening to the temple. I would go alone and stand before Meenakshi for  
long periods. I would feel waves of emotion overcoming me. This was God?s  
(Isvara?s) play with the individual spirit. I would stand before Isvara, the  
Controller of the universe and the destinies of all, the Omniscient and  
Omnipresent, and occasionally pray for the descent of his grace upon me so  
that my devotion might increase and become perpetual like that of the sixty-  
three saints.?   
Selection from Devi Mahatmyam or Durga Saptasati   
A vanquished king and a merchant facing severe financial losses retire to a  
forest hermitage where they question a sage Medha as follows: Question: My mind is afflicted with grief. Though I have lost the kingdom, I  
have an attachment to my former kingdom. Though I know the actuality how is  
this sense of ?mine afflicting me like an ignorant man, O best of sages And  
this merchant has been disowned by his children, wife and servants, and  
forsaken by his own people; still he is inordinately affectionate towards  
them. Thus both he and I, drawn by attachment towards objects whose defects we  
do know, are exceedingly unhappy. How is it that even the knowledgeable are  
deluded??   
Answer:Bhagavati, the Mahamaya entangles humans into delusion forcibly drawing  
the minds of even the wise. She creates this entire universe, both moving and  
unmoving. It is She who, when propitious, grants the best to humans and shows  
the way for their final liberation. She is the supreme knowledge, the cause of  
final liberation, and eternal; She is the cause of the bondage of  
transmigration and the sovereign over all lords?.   
Question: Venerable sir, who is that Devi whom you call Mahamaya How did she  
come into being, and what is her sphere of action, O sage? What constitutes  
her nature? What is her form Wherefrom did she originate? All that I wish to  
hear from you, O you supreme among the knowers of Brahman.?   
Answer: That Goddess is eternal, without beginning. The entire universe is her  
Form. By Her all this is pervaded. Nevertheless She incarnates in manifold  
ways; hear it from me. Though She is eternal, She is said to be born in the  
world, whenever She manifests herself in order to achieve the purposes of the  
devas.

Human mind is so construed that it cant see the Divine Mother except in a  
Royal dress even if She is depicted as doing Tapas(austerity). Today the theme  
is Mother doing tapas (or austerity) but nevertheless Mother is decorated in  
the fashion of the Queen Empress of the Universe. Even during Bhagavan's time  
this was so as Smt Nagamma writes in the Letters from Sri Ramanasramam: You  
have seen the decorations made in the shrine of Mathrubhuteswara on the first  
day of Navarathri festival last year. There was a different type of decoration  
every day during those nine days, and on one of the days, in accordance with  
the Puranic story that Amba went out to do Tapas as she could not bear the  
separation from Siva the idol of Amba was decorated suitably and was put in  
the shade of a tree. After the night meal was over that day, Bhagavan was  
taken to that place and was shown that idol. Next morning, Bhagavan said,  
Yesterday's ornamentation was intended to show that Amba was doing Tapas.  
Unable to bear the separation, she goes out to do Tapas (penance) here.  
Parvathi is depicted as sitting in a stylish pose under a tree to do Tapas,  
wearing a silk saree, gold jewels and flower garlands. What our people do is  
always like this. Tapas means meditation connected with the practice of self-  
denial or bodily mortification, does it not Amba is reported to have closed  
the eyes of Siva with both her hands for fun and to expiate that sin,  
Parameswara asked her to perform penance, and so she left her husband, went to  
a lonely place, and in self-mortification, forgot about her body, became weak  
and with great austerity, performed Tapas. See the way Amba is decorated to  
depict that story. She is dressed like a Maharani with diamonds and emeralds  
and gold ornaments and wearing a silk saree and flower garlands!   
Devi Mahatmyam   
According to Devi Mahatmyam even good and great people are opposed by evil or  
demonic forces. Yesterday we saw Maha Vishnu opposed by the demons Madhu and  
Kaitabha. Similarly Indra the god of Devas is overrun by the demon  
Mahishasura. Good people when in trouble seek divine protection from the  
Divine Mother and Her intervention tilts the balance of power leading to the  
victory of good over evil. Devi Mahatmyam says that the sum-total of divine  
energy of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva manifested in a fierce form and slayed the  
demon Mahishasura thus restoring Indra to his position. May the grace of the  
Divine Mother ever protect us from the hold of Mahishasura in the form of  
inauspicious thoughts.

Sri Ramana Maharshi rarely asked visitors if they practiced self-enquiry or  
Japa but He did ask them Have had your food? Remembering this on Sunday May  
3rd over five thousand people were served hot food between 9:15 AM and 12 PM  
at the entrance to the ashram. The kitchen workers started cooking as early as  
1:30 AM on Sunday and prepared huge amounts of food in the relatively small  
cooking facility of the ashram. Huge cauldrons filled with tasty Pongal,  
Sambar rice, Curd rice, Vegetable rice, Vangi bhaat etc were transported by  
tricycle to an area near ashram gate and hot food was served to visitors  
without any restriction. The number of devotees walking around the Arunachala  
Hill was very great because of Chitra Pournima(Full moon during when the star  
Chitra is ascendant).   
Another feeding of about five hundred people was done in the evening.  
Boliye(Let us say) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Mahahrshi ki Jai Devotees ki Jai and

When I arrived at the abode of Maharshi, called Ramanashram and jumped out  
from the two wheeled cart just in front of the temple, I was taken straight  
into the presence of the Sage.   
He was sitting in a large hall, near one of its walls. I was led to within  
three or four yards of Maharshi. The Saint lifted up his head, looked at me,  
and made a gesture with his hand as if inviting me to come a little nearer. I  
was struck by the softness and serenity of this movement, so simple and  
dignified that I immediately felt I was facing a great man. His attitude was  
so natural that the newcomer did not feel any wonder or shyness. All his  
critical faculty of thought and his curiosity dropped away. The image of the  
Sage was in this very first moment vividly engraved on my mind, without any  
qualifications, like a picture cast on a sensitive photo plate. But as nothing  
can be conveyed without words, I will try to describe his appearance.   
Maharshi, as I saw him, was a thin, white haired, very gracious old man; his  
skin had the colour of old ivory; his movements were easy, calm and soft; his  
countenance breathed a natural state of inner concentration without the  
slightest effort of will. Or may I say that he had reached that stage when  
will power no longer needs to be used for overcoming any hindrance, or for  
achieving any purpose For the simple reason that everything has already been  
achieved.   
I wonder how it is that I have never forgotten even the smallest detail  
concerning Maharshi; it can be evoked in my brain like a picture on a hidden  
sensitive plate of whose very existence I was unaware.   
May I say that I understand that Maharshi's life is not concentrated on this  
our earthly plane; that it extends far beyond our world; that he contemplates  
a different and real world, a world not subject to storms and changes; that he  
is a torch of light before the throne of the Most High, shedding its rays all  
around; that he is like the incense smoke constantly rising towards the blue  
sky which we see through the temple roof; that his eyes, just now looking at  
me, seem to convey no, I am unable to say anything more. I cannot even think.   
I only feel a stream of tears upon my face. They are abundant and serene. They  
flow silently. It is not suffering, regret, or repentance that is their  
source. I do not know how to name their cause. And through these tears I look  
at the Master. He knows full well their origin. His serious, almost solemn  
face, expresses endless understanding and friendship, and glows with inner  
light which makes it so different from all other human faces. In the light of  
his profound gaze I suddenly understand the reason and purpose of my tears.  
Yes, I see at last. The sudden illumination is too strong to allow immediate  
belief in the truth of the seen. Is this really possible Can it be possible  
But Maharshi's eyes seem to bring a confirmation of it Mouni Sadhu in In days  
of great peace.

Arunachala by night - Mouni Sadhu.   
The outlines of Arunachala peak were clear-cut and sharp against the sky. The  
lower, massive body of the hill remained invisible, wrapped in the darkness of  
night. I have never failed to feel the strange magnetic influence of  
Arunachala even in its visible form. At first I could not rationally explain  
what relation there could be between Maharshi and the hill, for I knew that  
the Sage was far beyond all special beliefs, and that he regarded the whole  
world as an illusion and a play of our physical senses. And yet it was  
undeniable that even in his books he mentions Arunachala with the highest  
reverence and love. It is mysterious, at least for those who have not fathomed  
the symbolism of this strange South Indian Hill. In this quiet night  
meditation, I decided to use the newly discovered method of perceiving that  
which is imperceptible to the ordinary mental faculties. This method consists  
in a preliminary purification of the mind of all thoughts, leaving only the  
intention of getting into touch from within, as it were, with the desired  
object of cognition. Afterwards what is translatable into the language of the  
mind is transmitted to it. In other words, intuition has to provide light from  
a source which the mind cannot reach. The powerful magnetism of Arunachala  
makes the whole process easier. As soon as I plunged into meditation,  
discarding all objects from my sight, I began to see that for which I had been  
searching.   
First of all became clear the well-known occult law that Everything has its  
corresponding form of manifestation in different worlds. Hence that which is  
the spiritual essence of Arunachala has its reflection on the physical plane.  
To me, as to many others, Arunachala was, and is, a sign-post on the path.  
Maharshi also said: Arunachala destroys attachment to worldly things, that is,  
to the objects of physical illusion. This I proved later, when I found that  
every time Arunachala was mentioned or described by those who regarded it as  
their beacon, I felt this worldly illusion disappearing from my thoughts,  
falling into the shadows of unreality, which is their true source.

From Mouni Sadhu's correspondence.   
What kind of attitude is proper in the presence of the Master? Nothing is more  
helpful in the presence of a great being than stillness of mind. It opens the  
door of our heart and enables the Master to come in. The proximity of Maharshi  
makes this effort of stilling the mind infinitely easier than it would be  
elsewhere. Often, even when people pray according to their own faiths, the  
result can ultimately be the same. In the presence of Bhagavan Maharshi we are  
able to find intuitively by ourselves the proper attitude.   
The student of Self‑knowledge begins to understand that his personality is a  
focus or fulcrum, as it were, through which flows and shines the light of life  
that is God. But he himself is not this focus. He must take care to maintain  
it in perfect purity, to enable the maximum of light to shine through it. But  
this should be his only care and nothing more. Herein lies the mystery of the  
disappearance of the ego as the result of Self‑realization. It brings true  
freedom. When the focus has fulfilled its task it is discarded with neither  
pain nor regret. But this happens only when it has become a lived reality and  
not a theory. And that is the highest initiation.   
Maharshi highly appreciates Sri Sankaracharya's Viveka Chudamani or The Crest  
Jewel of Wisdom. Many Hindus regard the Sage of Arunachala to be a  
reincarnation of the author of this treatise, which reaches the highest summit  
of occult philosophic conception. In any event one thing is true: only a  
balanced and one‑pointed mind leads to the realm of truth to samadhi.  
Interruptions in the state of samadhi prove that the mind is not completely  
subdued; it comes back to activity and evades the still imperfect control.

Muruganar day   
Many devotees came from far and near to sing Muruganar's songs on Muruganar?s  
day. We recited 51 titles from Ramana Sannathi Murai chosen for their likeness  
to Tiruvachakam titles. Of Course Aksharamanamalai was chanted to invoke the  
Master?s presence while Vedas were chanted inside the shrine during worship of  
the Samadhi. Born in 1895, Sri C. K. Subrahmanyam grew up in an atmosphere of  
Tamil learning and became in due course a teacher of Tamil in a High School.  
His first collection of poems, Swatantra-Gitam, owed much to his ardent  
admiration of Gandhiji and, like the early work of his elder contemporary,  
Subrahmanya Bharati, formed a distinct contribution to the national movement.  
But when he came to Bhagavan and fell under his spell, he renounced all other  
interests, completely effaced his personality and turned into "a shadow of  
Bhagavan." And he has lived ever since in a state of stark simplicity, utterly  
poor and obscure.   
In thus losing the world to find Bhagavan, he has found a joy to utter and a  
voice to utter it which have given him a high and assured place among the  
immortal singer saints of Tamil Nadu. This sudden and complete change in the  
poems and in the manner of his utterance, the marvelously sustained and  
infinitely varied beauty of the enormous bulk of his verse on a single theme,  
constitutes an undoubted " miracle " wrought by Bhagavan, permanently there  
for all eyes to behold.   
Muruganar was content with composing his poems and having them read by  
Bhagavan. For him there was no ?wider public" to whose notice they should be  
brought. Thus it fell to an admirer, Sri Ramana Padananda, to arrange for the  
printing and publication of six volumes of Muruganar's poems. In practising  
the Presence of Bhagavan under the terms of Muruganar's images and rhythms,  
one enters into intensely felt relations with the Guru who figures in various  
roles of Siva or Subrahmanya, as father. mother or lover, as master, king or  
commander, as beggar or betrayer. Each of the 850 stanzas in Guru-Vachaka-  
Kovai1 is a little golden casket wrought with loving care to enshrine and set  
off a gem fallen from the Master's lips. The stream of Muruganar's inspiration  
has continued running fresh and strong even after the passing of Bhagavan. If  
it has lost some of the old briskness and brightness, it has acquired a new  
serenity. Leaving aside Muruganar's own copious outpourings, his success in  
evoking so much of the little that Bhagavan himself wrote is something to be  
grateful for. It is to Muruganar that we owe the existence and poetic pattern  
of Upadesa Saram, (' Instruction in Thirty Verses ') the living quintessence  
of advaitic thought and a brief but sufficient summary of Bhagavan's own  
practical guidance. Muruganar composed a long narrative poem telling how the  
rishis who trusted too much to their rituals were taught a lesson. At the  
crucial moment, when Siva had to deliver His teaching, Muruganar left it to  
Bhagavan to provide the ipsissima verba of divine revelation.   
Many of the Forty Verses on Reality owe their final form and the exposition  
its logical arrangement to Muruganar's efforts. And this game of collaboration  
reached its climax in the composition of Atma Vidya, wrhich fills a musical  
mould of Gopalakrishna Bharati with a new, profound meaning. Beginning "Easy  
is Self-knowledge," it raises only to reject the image of " the berry in the  
palm of one's hand " ; so evident is this perception that it needs neither  
perceiver nor thing perceived. Having proceeded thus far, Muruganar had to  
leave off where the poet qua poet could only say or imply, "The rest is  
silence ". But Bhagavan, speaking with an authority higher than any poet's,  
continued the argument, explained the sadhana and the grace and ended with a  
hint that Annamalai, the Inner Eye, the One Alone, is the author.

Facing the challenges of life, the Ramana Way.   
Sometimes difficult situations descend on us suddenly. Relationships go sour,  
economic hardships arise, health problems threaten our loved ones or we  
experience all-round failure in our attempts. The feeling of frustration and  
disappointment increases when we feel that the problem is caused by something  
we actually did or by something that we should have done but didn't do. Sri  
Ramana Maharshi has compassionately taught us the way to deal with such  
situations. Here we recount the Master's teaching on this subject and see how  
it grants spiritual peace and freedom from suffering. A devotee once asked  
Ramana Maharshi about the existence of sorrow and evil in creation.   
M.: God's will!   
D.: Why does God will it so?   
M.: It is inscrutable. No motive can be attributed to that Power - no desire,  
no end to achieve can be asserted of that one Infinite, All-wise and All-  
powerful Being. God is untouched by activities, which take place in His  
presence; compare the sun and the world activities. There is no meaning in  
attributing responsibility and motive to the One before it becomes many.   
If so, what should a person facing challenges in his life, do to overcome his  
troubles? Sri Ramana Maharshi teaches that by accepting one's own free-will as  
an instrument of the Divine Will one can eventually obtain peace of mind. In  
Talks He says Acceptance of God's will for the prescribed course of events is  
a great solution of the free-will problem. He elaborates this further saying  
If the mind is restless on account of a sense of the imperfect and  
unsatisfactory character of what befalls us or what is committed or omitted by  
us, then it is wise to drop the sense of responsibility and free-will by  
regarding ourselves as the ordained instruments of the All-wise and All-  
powerful, to do and suffer as He pleases. He then carries all the burdens and  
gives us peace.   
In the reminiscences of Ramana Maharshi by G V Subbaramayya we read On the  
17th of June, Sri R. Narayana Iyer told Sri Bhagavan of his vain efforts at  
matrimonial alliance for his eldest daughter and said that he would make no  
further attempts unless he received a specific direction from Sri Bhagavan.  
Just at that moment the mail brought a journal named Progress. Sri Bhagavan  
read out its motto You can succeed if you know the power that is in you, and  
said that here was the reply to Narayana Iyer. The latter, regarding it as a  
clear token of Sri Bhagavan's Grace, took up at once a new proposal and  
succeeded this time. In a letter dated July 12, 1940 Narayana Iyer writes Till  
Thursday evening I did not know that the marriage was to be settled and to  
take place on the Sunday following. No preparation whatever was made. . .   
What could I do? Just a day's interval and nothing done. I appealed to Sri  
Bhagavan and wrote a letter of saranagati (surrender) with tears trickling  
from my eyes. From that very moment the burden was lifted. I go to  
Tiruvannamalai only to find that I had no work. Buildings, cooks, vessels,  
servants, provisions, in fact every detail had been arranged and everything  
went off very well. It is wonderful. The nerve-racking suspense, frantic  
efforts at the last moment, and the frenzied wanderings look like a dream now,  
and I only chant and chant like a mantra the words, You will succeed if you  
know the Power that is in you.?

Ramana Maharshi After the death experience, one of the new features related to  
the visit of Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. After awakening I would go almost  
every evening to the temple. I would go alone and stand before Meenakshi for  
long periods. I would feel waves of emotion overcoming me. This was God?s  
(Isvara?s) play with the individual spirit. I would stand before Isvara, the  
Controller of the universe and the destinies of all, the Omniscient and  
Omnipresent, and occasionally pray for the descent of his grace upon me so  
that my devotion might increase and become perpetual like that of the sixty-  
three saints.?   
Selection from Devi Mahatmyam or Durga Saptasati   
A vanquished king and a merchant facing severe financial losses retire to a  
forest hermitage where they question a sage Medha as follows: Question: My mind is afflicted with grief. Though I have lost the kingdom, I  
have an attachment to my former kingdom. Though I know the actuality how is  
this sense of ?mine afflicting me like an ignorant man, O best of sages And  
this merchant has been disowned by his children, wife and servants, and  
forsaken by his own people; still he is inordinately affectionate towards  
them. Thus both he and I, drawn by attachment towards objects whose defects we  
do know, are exceedingly unhappy. How is it that even the knowledgeable are  
deluded??   
Answer:Bhagavati, the Mahamaya entangles humans into delusion forcibly drawing  
the minds of even the wise. She creates this entire universe, both moving and  
unmoving. It is She who, when propitious, grants the best to humans and shows  
the way for their final liberation. She is the supreme knowledge, the cause of  
final liberation, and eternal; She is the cause of the bondage of  
transmigration and the sovereign over all lords?.   
Question: Venerable sir, who is that Devi whom you call Mahamaya How did she  
come into being, and what is her sphere of action, O sage? What constitutes  
her nature? What is her form Wherefrom did she originate? All that I wish to  
hear from you, O you supreme among the knowers of Brahman.?   
Answer: That Goddess is eternal, without beginning. The entire universe is her  
Form. By Her all this is pervaded. Nevertheless She incarnates in manifold  
ways; hear it from me. Though She is eternal, She is said to be born in the  
world, whenever She manifests herself in order to achieve the purposes of the  
devas.

Human mind is so construed that it cant see the Divine Mother except in a  
Royal dress even if She is depicted as doing Tapas(austerity). Today the theme  
is Mother doing tapas (or austerity) but nevertheless Mother is decorated in  
the fashion of the Queen Empress of the Universe. Even during Bhagavan's time  
this was so as Smt Nagamma writes in the Letters from Sri Ramanasramam: You  
have seen the decorations made in the shrine of Mathrubhuteswara on the first  
day of Navarathri festival last year. There was a different type of decoration  
every day during those nine days, and on one of the days, in accordance with  
the Puranic story that Amba went out to do Tapas as she could not bear the  
separation from Siva the idol of Amba was decorated suitably and was put in  
the shade of a tree. After the night meal was over that day, Bhagavan was  
taken to that place and was shown that idol. Next morning, Bhagavan said,  
Yesterday's ornamentation was intended to show that Amba was doing Tapas.  
Unable to bear the separation, she goes out to do Tapas (penance) here.  
Parvathi is depicted as sitting in a stylish pose under a tree to do Tapas,  
wearing a silk saree, gold jewels and flower garlands. What our people do is  
always like this. Tapas means meditation connected with the practice of self-  
denial or bodily mortification, does it not Amba is reported to have closed  
the eyes of Siva with both her hands for fun and to expiate that sin,  
Parameswara asked her to perform penance, and so she left her husband, went to  
a lonely place, and in self-mortification, forgot about her body, became weak  
and with great austerity, performed Tapas. See the way Amba is decorated to  
depict that story. She is dressed like a Maharani with diamonds and emeralds  
and gold ornaments and wearing a silk saree and flower garlands!   
Devi Mahatmyam   
According to Devi Mahatmyam even good and great people are opposed by evil or  
demonic forces. Yesterday we saw Maha Vishnu opposed by the demons Madhu and  
Kaitabha. Similarly Indra the god of Devas is overrun by the demon  
Mahishasura. Good people when in trouble seek divine protection from the  
Divine Mother and Her intervention tilts the balance of power leading to the  
victory of good over evil. Devi Mahatmyam says that the sum-total of divine  
energy of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva manifested in a fierce form and slayed the  
demon Mahishasura thus restoring Indra to his position. May the grace of the  
Divine Mother ever protect us from the hold of Mahishasura in the form of  
inauspicious thoughts.

Rishabha or Bull is the vehicle of the Lord. Sages tell us that it stands for  
Dharma or righteousness meaning only righteous devotee will be chosen by the  
Lord to carry Him or His message. Why was Bull chosen over other vehicles In  
part due to its tenacity which will crush under the weight of the load but  
will not take a single step backwards. The images for the evening procession  
will be seen tomorrow. Please see images of Special Veda Parayana at the  
ashram and Sri Vidya Havan at Rajarajeswari temple near Sankara Mutt.   
Unique One, giver of goodness, Lord Sonagiri! He whose beautiful form is  
seated upon the bull! When will you grant me the boon of eternal life, At what  
time shall I, in joy, obtain it This much tell to me, your solitary devotee,  
this very day! Guhai Namasivayar   
The power of the name Arunachala was once directly confirmed by Sri Bhagavan.  
In 1948 a certain devotee came to him from Bombay, and with him he brought a  
notebook in which he had written the name 'Arunachala Siva' many thousands of  
times. On the last page of this notebook the devotee wrote a prayer to the  
following effect, 'O Bhagavan, in the life of Sarada Devi [the wife of Sri  
Ramakrishna] it is written that she has said that if even an animal dies in  
Kasi it will attain liberation. Therefore, graciously bestow upon be the boon  
of death in Kasi.' and gave the notebook to Sri Bhagavan.   
Bhagavan looked through the notebook and when he came to the last page he read  
out loud the devotee's prayer: at once he expressed the greatest surprise and  
exclaimed, 'Smaranat Arunachalam!'   
The words 'Smaranat Arunachalam' mean 'by remembering Arunachala', and they  
occur in the very same Sanskrit verse that says that by dying in Kasi one will  
attain liberation. Bhagavan then turned to the revolving bookcase by his side  
and took out a book,probably the Arunachala Mahatmyam. Opening it as if at  
random, he read out a sentence in Tamil that said, 'One ''Arunachala'' is  
equal power to three crore ''Om Nama Sivaya'''.   
I have seen a wonder, a magnetic hill that forcibly attracts the soul.  
Arresting the activities of the soul who thinks of it even once, drawing it to  
face itself, the One, making it thus motionless like itself, it feeds upon  
that sweet [pure and ripened] soul. What a wonder is this! O souls, be saved  
by thinking of this great Arunagiri, which shines in the mind as the destroyer  
of the soul [the ego]. Sri Ramna Maharshi

Today is the Punarvasu day of the Tamizh month of Ashada. Punarvasu is the  
birth star of Sri   
Bhagavan. Every Punarvasu star day, there will be good abhikshekam,  
alankaram, and arti   
for Sri Ramaneswara Mahalingm.   
There will be such celebrations today, followed by good lunch with sweets.  
The crowds will be   
quite large.   
Muruganar has composed a poem called Punarvasu VaNNam (the glory of punarvasu)  
and this can be seen in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai.   
I shall give in this context, some translations from Guru Vachaka Kovai of  
Muruganar.   
Destruction of Mind: 913\. Unsteady and wavering minds find only   
 Failure and frustration always.   
914\. The restless mind moves with a speed   
 That shames the God of Wind. To starve it,   
 So that it, like a cripple, stays   
 Totally immobile is to attain   
 Actual Immortality.   
915\. It is true wisdom to pluck out   
 Before they grow too strong the weeds   
 Of lust and anger and greed, and keep   
 The mind serene and self contained   
 Like a vast ocean deep and calm   
 Untroubled by a single ripple   
 Raised by any wind.   
918. He who has vanquished thought, he only   
 Sits like an emperor on the neck   
 Of the majestic elephant, Jnana,   
 Know for certain that the mind's   
 Movements alone give rise to birth   
 And every cruel pain and sorrow.   
920. Even as the ego does not die   
 Unless the Self's glance falls on it,   
 The painful dream of this phenomenal   
 World will never disappear   
 Unless the mind meets glorious death.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ashram offered solemn worship to Lord Krishna on the sacred occasion of  
Janmashtami or the birth of Lord Krishna. As is well known Bhagavan reached  
Arunachala on the day after Janamashtami. Srimati Nagamma describes a scene in  
Sri Ramansram as follows;I was reminded of Lord Krishna in Repalle when I saw  
the grand spectacle of Bhagavan standing in the midst of the cows in the  
Gosala. Not only this, in Brahma Vaivartha Purana it is stated that Krishna is  
the Paramatma, the Lord of the cow world, and that Radha is Prakriti. The  
theory in that Purana is that Radha and Madhava are Prakriti and Purusha-the  
inseparable pair. Standing with his body bent slightly to the left, and with  
his left hand on Lakshmi, and with the walking stick in his right hand,  
looking as if it was a flute, with a sparkling smile on the face like the foam  
on the waves of the ocean of ananda, with a compassionate look towards the  
group of devotees that had gathered along with the herd of cows, Sri Ramana,  
the embodiment of grace, it is no surprise if one were reminded of Lord  
Krishna Himself standing with crossed legs, resting on his toes and playing  
exquisitely on the flute. If that Krishna is Ramana, what are we to say of our  
Lakshmi who appears to have been completely oblivious of this world with her  
ears hanging down, with her eyes closed and enjoying transcendental bliss  
caused by the touch of Bhagavan's hands on her body Shall I say that she is  
the embodiment of Prakriti in the shape of Radha? Otherwise, how could she  
understand human language.   
Sri Ramana Maharshi has several times explained the inner significance of  
Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna had to do the fighting. So Krishna said, Place  
all the burden on Me, do your duty; you are merely an instrument. I will see  
to everything. Nothing will bother you. But then, before one surrenders to  
God, one should know who it is that surrenders. Unless all thoughts are given  
up there cant be surrender. Further Bhagavan says: What exactly did Lord  
Krishna tell Arjuna He told him, the deed will get done according to the  
doing. I am the doer watching the whole thing from above. Why do you worry? It  
is your body which does the killing of your relatives. Are you the body? No!  
Why then this bondage for you? Renounce the idea, he said. This means that he  
asks Arjuna to do the thing but to give up the feeling that it is he that is  
doing it. That is personal effort. The feeling that one is, or is not, the  
body, comes from one's own ignorance. One only has to give up that feeling;  
that which one has, one must oneself reject. Who else can do it? If by  
personal effort that bondage is removed, action, under the orders of the doer,  
Iswara, goes on of its own accord. Every one has his work allotted to him and  
he will do it automatically. Why should one worry? Arjuna, when he felt that  
it was not proper to kill his relatives, was only told to give up the feeling  
that he was the doer, yet it was Arjuna himself who ultimately fought. By  
listening to the Gita, he lost the feeling of being the doer and the doubt he  
had had was no longer there. The work had to be done with that particular  
body, and it was done.   
from the fb Ramana Maharishi

Arunachala Causes Grace to well up and pour forth as a Stream.   
As known to everyone Tiruvannamalai was reeling under the spell of worst  
drought in recent memory. Indeed, it was sad to see the last drop of water  
disappear from Sona Tirtham, Pali Tirtham, Simha Tirtham and many of other  
Tirthams. Many groups of devotees including our ashram organized prayers as  
enjoined in Scriptures to Lord Varuna, the rain God, for sending us rains.  
Individual devotees prayed in their own way by doing Giri-Pradakshina,  
chanting Hanuman Chalisa and other Prayers. However, it appeared that Rain  
Gods were in no hurry to answer our prayers. There was a general feeling of  
Why this delay Lord along the lines of Sri Ramana Maharshi asking Lord  
Arunachala in the prayer for cure of His mother's fever. Ashram was forced to  
cut down on visitors, spend hard cash to buy water and adopt austere measures  
to deal with the hardship brought by unexpected climate change.   
For the past fortnight or so there have been sporadic showers but still  
nothing like a heavy downpour. All that changed yesterday. There was such a  
heavy downpour that water running down the Hill turned into a violent stream  
breaking the wall between Seshadri Swamigal's ashram and Sri Ramana Ashram and  
blowing away the gates of Sri Ramanashram close to the Sri Dakshinamurty  
temple. (Is Nature asking us how dare you build walls between Saints). Not  
only that the forceful current of water entered the lane adjoining the Mourvi  
guest house and wreaked havoc blowing away everything on its way including a  
car, the walls of residential buildings and anything that stood in its way.  
Some devotees had to stand in knee-deep water in their own homes. Naturally  
ashram has lifted all the restriction on visitors coming to the ashram.  
Further all the sacred tanks are brimming with water now. We conclude the  
mercy of Lord by quoting from ten verses from Arunachala of Ramana Maharshi O  
Love in the shape of Arunachala! Thou causest Grace to well up in abundance  
and pour forth as a stream! Jai Arunachala

பகவான் ஸ்ரீ ரமண மகரிஷிகளின் தந்தையார் ஸ்ரீசுந்தரம் ஐயரின் நினைவு தினம் இன்று  
(6/3/2018) ஆச்ரமத்தில் அனுசரிக்கப்பட்டது. தாயார் சந்நிதியில் அன்னாரின்  
புகைப்படத்திற்கு சிறப்பு வழிபாடுகள் நடைபெற்றன.   
ரமண மகரிஷி போன்ற ஒரு ஞானசூரியனை இந்த வையகம் பெற்றிட அவரது குடும்பத்திற்கு  
இருந்த ஒரு சாபம் எவ்வாறு தொடர்புடையது என்று இங்குக் காண்போம்: சுமார் இருநூறு வருடங்களுக்கு முன் நாராயண அய்யர் குமாரர் வேங்கடேசுவர அய்யர்  
காலத்தில் இந்நிகழ்ச்சி நடந்திருக்க வேண்டும். அன்னாரின் இல்லத்திற்கு  
எங்கிருந்தோ ஒரு துறவி வந்து தனக்கு உண்டி   
உறைவிடம் வேண்டி நிற்க அத்துறவியின் வேண்டுகோளை இல்லத் தலைவர் நிராகரிக்க அதனால்  
சினமடைந்த அத்துறவி தன்னைப்போல் அன்னாரின் குடும்பத்தில் ஒவ்வொரு தலைமுறையிலும்  
ஒருவர் துறவு பூண்டு உண்டிக்காக அலைய வேண்டுமென்று சாபமிட்டார்.   
அந்த சாபத்திற்கேற்ப சுந்தரம் ஐயரின் மூத்த சகோதரர் வேங்கடேச அய்யர் ஒருநாள்  
திருப்பரங்குன்றம் போவதாகச் சொல்லிச் சென்றவர் திரும்பி வரவில்லை. அவர்  
தில்லையில் சந்நியாசி உடையில் இருந்து அங்கு உழவாரப் பணி செய்து கோயிலைச்  
சுற்றியுள்ள முட்புதர்களையும் களைகளையும் நீக்கிப் பக்தர்கள் கோயிலைச்  
சுற்றுவதற்கு உதவி செய்தார் என்று சிலரும் இல்லையில்லை காசிக்குச் சென்றார் என்று  
வேறு சிலரும் கூறினர்.   
அப்பொழுது சுந்தரம் ஐயர் தன்னுடைய குழந்தைகளில் யார் உலகத்தைத் துறந்துத் துறவறம்  
செல்லுவார் என்று சிறிதுகூட எண்ணியிருக்க மாட்டார்.   
துர்வாசரின் சாபமும் நாரத முனியின் கலகமும் நல்லதில் முடியும் என்பார்கள்.  
இத்துறவி இட்ட சாபம் பிற்காலத்தில் மனித குலத்திற்கு ஒரு வரப்பிரசாதமாக  
அமையப்போவதை அப்பொழுது யாரறிந்தார்?

from fb Sri Ramana Maharshi   
Arunachala Causes Grace to well up and pour forth as a Stream.   
As known to everyone Tiruvannamalai was reeling under the spell of worst  
drought in recent memory. Indeed, it was sad to see the last drop of water  
disappear from Sona Tirtham, Pali Tirtham, Simha Tirtham and many of other  
Tirthams. Many groups of devotees including our ashram organized prayers as  
enjoined in Scriptures to Lord Varuna, the rain God, for sending us rains.  
Individual devotees prayed in their own way by doing Giri-Pradakshina,  
chanting Hanuman Chalisa and other Prayers. However, it appeared that Rain  
Gods were in no hurry to answer our prayers. There was a general feeling of  
Why this delay Lord along the lines of Sri Ramana Maharshi asking Lord  
Arunachala in the prayer for cure of His mother's fever. Ashram was forced to  
cut down on visitors, spend hard cash to buy water and adopt austere measures  
to deal with the hardship brought by unexpected climate change.   
For the past fortnight or so there have been sporadic showers but still  
nothing like a heavy downpour. All that changed yesterday. There was such a  
heavy downpour that water running down the Hill turned into a violent stream  
breaking the wall between Seshadri Swamigal's ashram and Sri Ramana Ashram and  
blowing away the gates of Sri Ramanashram close to the Sri Dakshinamurty  
temple. (Is Nature asking us how dare you build walls between Saints). Not  
only that the forceful current of water entered the lane adjoining the Mourvi  
guest house and wreaked havoc blowing away everything on its way including a  
car, the walls of residential buildings and anything that stood in its way.  
Some devotees had to stand in knee-deep water in their own homes. Naturally  
ashram has lifted all the restriction on visitors coming to the ashram.  
Further all the sacred tanks are brimming with water now. We conclude the  
mercy of Lord by quoting from ten verses from Arunachala of Ramana Maharshi O  
Love in the shape of Arunachala! Thou causest Grace to well up in abundance  
and pour forth as a stream! Jai Arunachala

from fb ஸ்ரீ ரமணமகரிஷி   
அன்னை அழகம்மையின் சமாதி தினம் (மஹாபூஜை) இன்று (7/6/2018) ஸ்ரீரமணாச்ரமத்தில்  
அமைந்துள்ள மாத்ருபூதேச்வரர் ஆலயத்தில் சிறப்பாக நடந்தேறியது. அதிகாலை முதல்  
மஹன்யாஸ ருத்ர ஜபம், அபிஷேக ஆராதனைகள் நடைபெற்று சுமார் 10.30 மணியளவில் ஆரத்தி  
நடைபெற்றது. திரளான பக்தர்கள் கலந்து கொண்டனர்.   
பகவான் ரமண மகரிஷிகள் மதுரையில் இருந்து வீட்டைத் துறந்து போனது அவரது தாயார்  
அழகம்மைக்குப் பேரதிர்ச்சியாக இருந்தது. விதவைத் தாயாரான அழகம்மை இறுதியில் தன்  
மகன் திருவண்ணாமலையில் இருப்பதை அறிந்தாள். பவழக்குன்றில் பகவான் இருந்தசமயம்  
மகனைக் காண வந்தார். தன்னோடு ஊருக்குத் திரும்பிவரும்படி மன்றாடினார். ரமண  
மகரிஷிகள் அன்னைக்கு பதிலை கீழ்க்கண்டவாறு பொதுப்படையாக எழுதிக் காண்பித்தார்: அவரவர் பிராரப்தப் பிரகாரம் அதற்கானவன் ஆங்காங்கிருந்தாட்டுவிப்பான். என்றும்  
நடவாதது என் முயற்சிக்கினும் நடவாது; நடப்பது என் தடை செய்யினும் நில்லாது. இதுவே  
திண்ணம். ஆகலின், மௌனமாயிருக்கை நன்று.   
மகனைப் பிரிந்து வாடும் அன்னைக்கு இந்தப் பதில் எவ்வாறு ஆறுதல் அளிக்கும். மகனை  
அருணாசலத்தில் விட்டு விட்டு துயரத்துடன் மதுரைக்குத் திரும்பினாள்.  
விருப்பமில்லாமல் அர்ப்பணித்தாலும் (அருணாசல) சிவனுக்கென்று அர்ப்பணிக்கப்பட்டது  
அனைத்துமே விலைமதிப்பற்றதேயாகும் அல்லவா   
சில வருடங்களுக்குப் பிறகு, அன்னை அழகம்மை, தம் இறுதிக் காலத்தில் மகனுடனேயே தங்க  
விழைந்தபோது அதற்கு மறுப்பேதும் கூறாமல் ஒப்புக் கொண்டார் பகவான். தமக்கென்று  
எவரிடமும் எதையுமே கேட்டுப் பெறாத பகவான், தமது அன்னை உடல் நலமின்றி இருந்தபோது  
அருணாசலத்திடம் அன்னை உடல்நலம் பெற வேண்டி கீழ்க்கண்ட பாடல்களின் வாயிலாகப்  
பிரார்த்தித்தார். அன்னையும் உடல் தேறினார்.   
அலையா வருபிறவி யத்தனையு மாற்ற   
மலையா யெழுந்த மருந்தே தலைவாநின்   
றாள்கதியாய் வாழுமென் றாய்தாப மாற்றியே   
யாள்வதுவு முன்கடனே யாம்.   
காலகா லாவுன் கமல பதஞ்சார்ந்த   
பால னெனையீன்றாள் பாலந்தக் ? காலன்றான்   
வாரா வகையுன்கால் வாரிசமே காட்டுவா   
யாராயிற் காலனுமே யார்.   
ஞானாங்கி யாயோங்கு நல்லருண வோங்கலே   
ஞானாங்கி யாலன்னை நல்லுடலை \- ஞானாங்க   
மாகச்செய் துன்பதத்தி லைக்கியமாக் கிக்கொள்வாய்   
சாகத்தீ மூட்டுவதேன் சாற்று.   
மாயா மயக்கமதை மாற்றருண மாமலையென்   
றாயார் மயக்ககற்றத் தாமதமேன் றாயாகித்   
தன்னைடைந் தார்வினையின் றாக்கறுத்தாள் வாருலகி   
லுன்னையலா லுண்டோ வுரை.   
காய்ச்சலிலிருந்து அன்னையைக் காத்தருளுக அருணாசல சிவமே என்ற பிரார்த்தனைப் பாடலாக  
மேற்சொன்ன வெண்பாக்கள் தோன்றினாலும் காய்ச்சல் போன்ற மாய உலக வாழ்வினின்றும்  
தாயாரை விடுவித்து ஒருமையாம் உண்மையில் அவளைச் சேர்த்து விடு என்பதே அவ்  
வேண்டுதலின் உட்பொருளாகும்.   
சில வருடங்கள் கழித்து, உடல் நலிவுற்ற அன்னையின் அருகில் அமர்ந்து ஸ்ரீ பகவான்  
தமது வலக்கரத்தை அன்னையின் இதயத்திலும் இடது கையைச் சிரசிலும் பதித்த வண்ணம்  
தாயின் மனதை அமைதிப் படுத்தி, அன்னைக்கு முக்தியருளினார்.   
ரமண மகரிஷிகள் அன்னையின் சமாதியில் ஒரு ஆலயத்தை நிர்மாணித்து, மாத்ருபூதேச்வரர்  
ஆலயம் என்ற பெயரில் நித்ய பூஜைகள் மற்றும் வேதகோஷங்களுடன் ஒரு மகத்தான ஆலயமாக  
இலங்கிக் கொண்டிருக்கின்றது.   
இந்த நன்நாளில், மகனின் திருக்கரத்தால் முக்தியடையும் பேறுபெற்ற அழகம்மையையும்  
அருணாசல ரமணரையும் வணங்கி அருள் பெறுவோம்.

பகவான் ஸ்ரீ ரமண மகரிஷிகளின் தந்தையார் ஸ்ரீசுந்தரம் ஐயரின் நினைவு தினம் இன்று  
(6/3/2018) ஆச்ரமத்தில் அனுசரிக்கப்பட்டது. தாயார் சந்நிதியில் அன்னாரின்  
புகைப்படத்திற்கு சிறப்பு வழிபாடுகள் நடைபெற்றன.   
ரமண மகரிஷி போன்ற ஒரு ஞானசூரியனை இந்த வையகம் பெற்றிட அவரது குடும்பத்திற்கு  
இருந்த ஒரு சாபம் எவ்வாறு தொடர்புடையது என்று இங்குக் காண்போம்: சுமார் இருநூறு வருடங்களுக்கு முன் நாராயண அய்யர் குமாரர் வேங்கடேசுவர அய்யர்  
காலத்தில் இந்நிகழ்ச்சி நடந்திருக்க வேண்டும். அன்னாரின் இல்லத்திற்கு  
எங்கிருந்தோ ஒரு துறவி வந்து தனக்கு உண்டி   
உறைவிடம் வேண்டி நிற்க அத்துறவியின் வேண்டுகோளை இல்லத் தலைவர் நிராகரிக்க அதனால்  
சினமடைந்த அத்துறவி தன்னைப்போல் அன்னாரின் குடும்பத்தில் ஒவ்வொரு தலைமுறையிலும்  
ஒருவர் துறவு பூண்டு உண்டிக்காக அலைய வேண்டுமென்று சாபமிட்டார்.   
அந்த சாபத்திற்கேற்ப சுந்தரம் ஐயரின் மூத்த சகோதரர் வேங்கடேச அய்யர் ஒருநாள்  
திருப்பரங்குன்றம் போவதாகச் சொல்லிச் சென்றவர் திரும்பி வரவில்லை. அவர்  
தில்லையில் சந்நியாசி உடையில் இருந்து அங்கு உழவாரப் பணி செய்து கோயிலைச்  
சுற்றியுள்ள முட்புதர்களையும் களைகளையும் நீக்கிப் பக்தர்கள் கோயிலைச்  
சுற்றுவதற்கு உதவி செய்தார் என்று சிலரும் இல்லையில்லை காசிக்குச் சென்றார் என்று  
வேறு சிலரும் கூறினர்.   
அப்பொழுது சுந்தரம் ஐயர் தன்னுடைய குழந்தைகளில் யார் உலகத்தைத் துறந்துத் துறவறம்  
செல்லுவார் என்று சிறிதுகூட எண்ணியிருக்க மாட்டார்.   
துர்வாசரின் சாபமும் நாரத முனியின் கலகமும் நல்லதில் முடியும் என்பார்கள்.  
இத்துறவி இட்ட சாபம் பிற்காலத்தில் மனித குலத்திற்கு ஒரு வரப்பிரசாதமாக  
அமையப்போவதை அப்பொழுது யாரறிந்தார்?

from fb ஸ்ரீ ரமணமகரிஷி   
அன்னை அழகம்மையின் சமாதி தினம் (மஹாபூஜை) இன்று (7/6/2018) ஸ்ரீரமணாச்ரமத்தில்  
அமைந்துள்ள மாத்ருபூதேச்வரர் ஆலயத்தில் சிறப்பாக நடந்தேறியது. அதிகாலை முதல்  
மஹன்யாஸ ருத்ர ஜபம், அபிஷேக ஆராதனைகள் நடைபெற்று சுமார் 10.30 மணியளவில் ஆரத்தி  
நடைபெற்றது. திரளான பக்தர்கள் கலந்து கொண்டனர்.   
பகவான் ரமண மகரிஷிகள் மதுரையில் இருந்து வீட்டைத் துறந்து போனது அவரது தாயார்  
அழகம்மைக்குப் பேரதிர்ச்சியாக இருந்தது. விதவைத் தாயாரான அழகம்மை இறுதியில் தன்  
மகன் திருவண்ணாமலையில் இருப்பதை அறிந்தாள். பவழக்குன்றில் பகவான் இருந்தசமயம்  
மகனைக் காண வந்தார். தன்னோடு ஊருக்குத் திரும்பிவரும்படி மன்றாடினார். ரமண  
மகரிஷிகள் அன்னைக்கு பதிலை கீழ்க்கண்டவாறு பொதுப்படையாக எழுதிக் காண்பித்தார்: அவரவர் பிராரப்தப் பிரகாரம் அதற்கானவன் ஆங்காங்கிருந்தாட்டுவிப்பான். என்றும்  
நடவாதது என் முயற்சிக்கினும் நடவாது; நடப்பது என் தடை செய்யினும் நில்லாது. இதுவே  
திண்ணம். ஆகலின், மௌனமாயிருக்கை நன்று.   
மகனைப் பிரிந்து வாடும் அன்னைக்கு இந்தப் பதில் எவ்வாறு ஆறுதல் அளிக்கும். மகனை  
அருணாசலத்தில் விட்டு விட்டு துயரத்துடன் மதுரைக்குத் திரும்பினாள்.  
விருப்பமில்லாமல் அர்ப்பணித்தாலும் (அருணாசல) சிவனுக்கென்று அர்ப்பணிக்கப்பட்டது  
அனைத்துமே விலைமதிப்பற்றதேயாகும் அல்லவா   
சில வருடங்களுக்குப் பிறகு, அன்னை அழகம்மை, தம் இறுதிக் காலத்தில் மகனுடனேயே தங்க  
விழைந்தபோது அதற்கு மறுப்பேதும் கூறாமல் ஒப்புக் கொண்டார் பகவான். தமக்கென்று  
எவரிடமும் எதையுமே கேட்டுப் பெறாத பகவான், தமது அன்னை உடல் நலமின்றி இருந்தபோது  
அருணாசலத்திடம் அன்னை உடல்நலம் பெற வேண்டி கீழ்க்கண்ட பாடல்களின் வாயிலாகப்  
பிரார்த்தித்தார். அன்னையும் உடல் தேறினார்.   
அலையா வருபிறவி யத்தனையு மாற்ற   
மலையா யெழுந்த மருந்தே தலைவாநின்   
றாள்கதியாய் வாழுமென் றாய்தாப மாற்றியே   
யாள்வதுவு முன்கடனே யாம்.   
காலகா லாவுன் கமல பதஞ்சார்ந்த   
பால னெனையீன்றாள் பாலந்தக் ? காலன்றான்   
வாரா வகையுன்கால் வாரிசமே காட்டுவா   
யாராயிற் காலனுமே யார்.   
ஞானாங்கி யாயோங்கு நல்லருண வோங்கலே   
ஞானாங்கி யாலன்னை நல்லுடலை \- ஞானாங்க   
மாகச்செய் துன்பதத்தி லைக்கியமாக் கிக்கொள்வாய்   
சாகத்தீ மூட்டுவதேன் சாற்று.   
மாயா மயக்கமதை மாற்றருண மாமலையென்   
றாயார் மயக்ககற்றத் தாமதமேன் றாயாகித்   
தன்னைடைந் தார்வினையின் றாக்கறுத்தாள் வாருலகி   
லுன்னையலா லுண்டோ வுரை.   
காய்ச்சலிலிருந்து அன்னையைக் காத்தருளுக அருணாசல சிவமே என்ற பிரார்த்தனைப் பாடலாக  
மேற்சொன்ன வெண்பாக்கள் தோன்றினாலும் காய்ச்சல் போன்ற மாய உலக வாழ்வினின்றும்  
தாயாரை விடுவித்து ஒருமையாம் உண்மையில் அவளைச் சேர்த்து விடு என்பதே அவ்  
வேண்டுதலின் உட்பொருளாகும்.   
சில வருடங்கள் கழித்து, உடல் நலிவுற்ற அன்னையின் அருகில் அமர்ந்து ஸ்ரீ பகவான்  
தமது வலக்கரத்தை அன்னையின் இதயத்திலும் இடது கையைச் சிரசிலும் பதித்த வண்ணம்  
தாயின் மனதை அமைதிப் படுத்தி, அன்னைக்கு முக்தியருளினார்.   
ரமண மகரிஷிகள் அன்னையின் சமாதியில் ஒரு ஆலயத்தை நிர்மாணித்து, மாத்ருபூதேச்வரர்  
ஆலயம் என்ற பெயரில் நித்ய பூஜைகள் மற்றும் வேதகோஷங்களுடன் ஒரு மகத்தான ஆலயமாக  
இலங்கிக் கொண்டிருக்கின்றது.   
இந்த நன்நாளில், மகனின் திருக்கரத்தால் முக்தியடையும் பேறுபெற்ற அழகம்மையையும்  
அருணாசல ரமணரையும் வணங்கி அருள் பெறுவோம்.

from fb Sri Ramana Maharishi   
Aradhana of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi   
Today (April 20) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi's Aradhana will be celebrated  
with devout worship and simple formalities. The usual large scale feeding will  
not be there due to the prevailing conditions caused by the Corona pandemic.   
Aradhana means memorial of death. Death of what, whom and when ? It is true  
that Sri Bhagavan left the body on this date. But death! Here is what He says  
on the subject : A sudden and unmistakable fear of death seized me. I felt I was going to die.  
Why I should have so felt cannot now be explained by anything felt in my body.  
Nor could I explain it to myself then. I did not however trouble myself to  
discover if the fear was well grounded. The shock of fear of death made me at  
once introspective, or introverted. I said to myself mentally, i.e., without  
uttering the words Now, death has come. What does it mean ? What is it that  
is dying This body dies. I at once dramatised the scene of death. I extended  
my limbs and held them rigid as though rigormortis had set in. I held my  
breath and kept my mouth closed, pressing the lips tightly together so that  
no sound might escape. Let not the word I or any other word be uttered ! Well  
then, said I to myself, this body is dead. It will be carried stiff to the  
burning ground and there burnt and reduced to ashes. But with the death of  
this body, am I dead Is the body I This body is silent and inert. But I feel  
the full force of my personality and even the sound I within myself apart  
from the body. So I am a spirit, a thing transcending the body. The material  
body dies, but the spirit transcending it cannot be touched by death. I am  
therefore the deathless spirit. I was something very real, the only real thing  
in that state, and all the conscious activity that was connected with my body  
was centred on that.

## Ramana Ashram

I am planning in visiting Rama Ashram in a week from today (september 27th or  
28th) from a period of two weeks.   
I saw on previous posts email address for enquiries on accomodation at the  
Ashram - Thanks.   
Is there any teaching or guidance available in the Ashram in case required?   
(I encounter some difficulties in my current practice).   
As far as I remember this the start of the monsoon season in Tami Nadu, from  
my experience in north India the monsoon is quite heavy - can someone kindly  
elaborate on how "bad" it is during this period down south?   
Thanks,   
Bill

Dear Billbill,   
I am glad you are visiting Sri Ramansramam, in a week's time.   
A few tips, since I have gone there, in the beginning of this week.   
1\. Stay is possible in Asram's guest houses, (inside and outside   
Asram) only with prior written request and their written permission.   
Further, no one can stay beyond three days in guest houses. For   
a longer stay, you choose a hotel, (there are many with different   
levels of comforts), the charges will be around Rs 400 per day   
for a double room. Only vegetarian food will be available on   
extra payment.   
2\. There is no rain in T. Malai right now. The temperature is around   
35 degrees celsius.   
3\. Regarding self enquriy practices:- People are quite busy in   
Asram. You may have to patiently request them and wait for their   
convenience. You may also ask fellow pilgrims.   
4\. You can eat inside the Asram. Their timings are:-   
7.00 am - Coffee/tea   
11.30 am - lunch   
4.00 pm \- tea   
7.30 pm \- dinner   
Arunachala Siva.
