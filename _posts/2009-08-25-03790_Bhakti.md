when we are in trouble or suffering from illeness, we are thinking of God and  
asking his help? when we are ok, we are not thinking as much as we are in  
trouble. why?   
 Arunachala siva !

Dear Brinda,   
God is sure to help us whether we pray or not, subject to one's   
Prarabdha, that is, the effects of good or bad deeds of the past   
births. God is only the dispenser of justice, on the basis of our   
merits and demerits. The happiness and sorrow of present birth,   
will not cause any effects in this birth itself. The good and bad   
deeds of our present birth will accrue to our total of such good   
deeds and bad deeds for results in our future births. So our   
prayers today will only to strengthen our score and faith in God   
and shall not remove our unhappiness or happiness.   
Arunachala Siva.

By default a person is outward looking. he feels certain external  
circumstances must be satisfied for him to feel complete. so when he sees that  
certain external circumstances are uncontrollable, he requests God for help.   
When those prayers are answered he gains in faith and starts seeking more and  
more help.   
when, however, the person sees that the gifts that he requests for are trifle  
 that is when True bhakti arises. The person no more hankers after the  
objects of senses but he now requests for a Total Sense of Completeness... he  
starts to ignore external circumstances and he finds himself entering into  
True Bhakti.   
Love!   
Silence
