1\. Choose the highest ideal and live your life upto that. Look at the "ocean"  
and not at the wave.   
2\. That which tends to increase the divinity in you is virtue, and that which  
tends to increase brutality in you is vice.   
 **3\. He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really  
worships Shiva.   
4\. Purity in thought, speech, and act is absolutely necessary for anyone to  
be religious. Purity is strength. Spiritual truth is purity.**   
5\. The ideal of the man is to see God in everything. The real evil is  
idleness which is the principal cause of our poverty.   
 **6\. Everyone should know that there is no salvation except through the  
conquering of desires.**   
7\. Death being so certain, it is better to die for a good cause.   
8\. Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.   
9\. Your country reqires heroes, be heroes!   
 **10\. To me the very essence of education is concentration of the mind, not  
the collecting of facts.**   
11\. Each soul is potentially divine.   
12\. Religion is the idea which is raising the brute unto man, and man unto  
God.   
13\. All power is within you; you can do anything and everything. Believe in  
that.   
14\. Work, work, work - let this be your motto.   
15\. Now the only way out is to listen to the words of the Lord in the Gita.   
16\. Be a hero. Always say, "I have no fear".   
17\. Struggle hard to get money, but don't get attached to it.   
 **18\. Feel that you are great and you become great.**   
19\. To devote your life to the good of all and to the happiness of all is  
religion. Whatever you do for your own sake is not religion.   
20\. At my will mountains will crumble up. Have that sort of energy, that sort  
of will; work hard, and you will reach the goal.   
21\. It is those foolish people who identify themselves with their bodies that  
piteously cry, 'Weak, weak, we are weak'.   
22\. Keep the motto before you: "Elevation of the masses without injuring  
their religion".   
23\. Man never progresses from error to truth, but from truth to truth, from  
lesser truth to higher truth.   
24\. Avoid all weakness, for weakness is sin, weakness is death.   
 **25\. Never talk about the faults of others, no matter how bad they may be.  
Nothing is ever gained by that.**   
26\. I shall inspire men everywhere until the world shall know that it is one  
with God.   
27\. Let us go forward and do yet greater things.   
28\. The more selfish a man, the more immoral he is.   
29\. Give to the weak, for there all the gift is needed.   
30\. Knowledge exists, man only discovers it.   
31\. Give up all desire for enjoyment in earth or heaven.   
32\. Be courageous. Do not try to lead your brethren, but serve them.   
 **33\. Be the witness and do not react, only thus can you be happy.   
34\. None can help you, help yourself; work out your own salvation.**   
35\. Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvellous work.   
36\. Try to love anybody and everybody.   
37\. You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make  
you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul. Know it for  
certain that you are in everything.   
38\. Go on bravely. Do not expect success in a day or a year.   
39\. Let all your nerves vibrate through the backbone of your religion.   
40\. Do not talk much, but feel the spirit within you.   
 **41\. If you want to be spiritual, you must renounce.   
42\. Your way is the best for you, but that is no sign that it is the best for  
others.**   
43\. Renounce the lower so that you may get the higher.   
44\. Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in  
every living being?   
45\. Your work is to serve the poor and miserable, without distinction of  
caste or colour.   
Help another because you are in him and he is in you.   
46\. The poor, the illiterate, the ignorant, the afflicted,... let these be  
your God. Know that service to these alone is the highest religion.   
47\. If I am in the dark, let me light a lamp.   
48\. The earth's bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the  
good of many, for the welfare of all.   
49\. Every duty is holy, and devotion to duty is the highest form of worship  
of God.   
 **50\. We only get what we deserve. It is a lie when we say, the world is bad  
and we are good. It can never be so.**   
51\. You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little  
of strong blood in you.   
52\. It is struggle against nature and not conformity to nature that makes man  
what he is.   
53\. Each work has to pass through these stages - ridicule, opposition and  
then acceptance.   
54\. First there should be strict integrity... Secondly, entire devotion to  
the cause.   
55\. The will is not free - it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect - but  
there is something behind the will which is free.   
56\. You fail only when you do not strive sufficiently to manifest infinite  
power.   
57\. Whatever you do, devote your whole Mind, Heart, and Soul to it.   
 **58\. Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak,  
weak you will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.**   
59\. Never mind failures; they are quite natural, they are the beauty of life  
- these failures.   
 **60\. He works best who works without any motive, neither for money, nor for  
fame, nor for anything else.   
61\. The new religion says that he is an atheist who does not believe in  
himself.   
62\. Neither seek nor avoid, take what comes.**   
63\. You should work like a master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but  
do not do a slave's work.   
64\. Believe that the soul is immortal, infinite and all powerful.   
65\. Even if the order be wrong, first obey and then contradict it.   
 **66\. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves; because to advance we must  
have faith in ourselves first and then in God.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ It was Lord Rama who coined the name "Bharata Desa"  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 09, 2010, 10:01:40 AM

The spirit of sacrifice demonstrated by Bharata in the Ramayana is  
unparalleled. When Rama went to the forest, Bharata was to be crowned as king.  
But he went to the forest to entreat Rama to come back to Ayodhya and ascend  
the throne. Lakshmana who was with Rama in the forest, observed the arrival of  
Bharata and his entourage from a distance. He became furious with the  
misconceived notion that Bharata was coming to wage a battle with Rama. In an  
angry tone, he said, Mother Kaikeyi has sent us to the forest. Now, her son  
does not want us to live in peace even in the forest. That is why he is coming  
here with his army. If You permit me, I will teach him a fitting lesson.   
Reacting to Lakshmanas outburst, Rama said, Lakshmana, I think you have  
developed a desire for the throne of Ayodhya. Better, you go to Ayodhya and  
rule the kingdom. I will keep Bharata with Me in the forest. Bharata is one of  
sacrifice and character. His spirit of sacrifice is matchless. You have  
misunderstood his noble intention.   
Meanwhile Bharata came there and fell at the feet of Rama. My dear, how are  
the parents? This was the first question that Rama asked Bharata. He did not  
enquire about His own mother Kausalya, but He asked about the well-being of  
Kaikeyi. On hearing the name of Kaikeyi, Bharata became furious. It is  
because of that wicked woman you are forced to live in forest. The very  
mention of her name fills me with disgust. Please dont mention her name.  
Rama put His hand on his shoulders and pacified him, saying, Bharata, Mother  
Kaikeyi is a noble woman. It is because of her that My Name is glorified and  
spread far and wide. Do not go by the outward behaviour and talk ill of her.  
Her heart is filled with noble intentions.   
After speaking to Bharata in this manner, Rama went straight to Mother  
Kaikeyi, fell at her feet and said, Mother, by your blessings, I am fine  
here. Do not worry about Me. Let Bharata be crowned as the king of Ayodhya.  
Teach him the codes of governance. After the completion of 14 years, I will  
come back to Ayodhya and see all of you. It is My duty to uphold the promise  
made by My father. It is not enough if one listens to the command of ones  
parents. One should strictly adhere to the rules and regulations laid down by  
the government and strive for the welfare and happiness of fellowmen. Only  
then can one be called an ideal citizen.   
Ramas words made an indelible impression on the mind of Lakshmana. He fell at  
the feet of Rama and repented for his outburst. He said, Brother, when I saw  
Bharata and his army from a distance, I was seething with anger. Now my mind  
rests in peace having known the truth and listening to Your soothing words.  
Rama advised him not to be carried away by the outward scenario but to turn  
inward and strive for experiencing bliss.   
When Bharata started pleading with Rama to return to Ayodhya, Rama  
affectionately drew him close and said, Bharata, no doubt your intentions are  
noble, but you should bear in mind the command of our father. You must follow  
your mothers advice. That is the only way you can please Me. Share your love  
with not only your friends and relatives but with one and all. Remember that  
Thyaga (sacrifice) alone can bestow on you true Bhoga (pleasure).   
Sage Vasishta shed tears of joy listening to the words of Lord Rama. He said,  
Rama, You are forced to live in the forest for no fault of Yours. But, You  
have forgotten the injustice done to You. You are seeing only the good in  
others. We are really moved by Your magnanimity. However, we request You to  
establish Ramarajya (kingdom of Rama) in Ayodhya and give joy to all.   
 **Rama smilingly replied, Now it is Bharatarajya, not Ramarajya. Henceforth,  
it shall be called Bharatadesa (the land of Bharata).**

The earlier name is Ajanabham, the Navalantheevu in Tamil. It was an   
island not a peninsula. Bharata Desam came after a Bharata but not the   
Ramayanam character, if my memory is correct. This Bharata is Shakuntala's   
son.   
Arunachala Siva.
