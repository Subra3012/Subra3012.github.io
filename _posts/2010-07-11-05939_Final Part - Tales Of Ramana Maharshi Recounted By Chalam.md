A devotee wanted to take a photo of Bhagavan together with Ganapati Muni.  
Bhagavan consented, and a carpet was spread near the well, on which a sofa was  
put for Bhagavan to sit on. Ganapati Muni sat down at his feet, but Bhagavan  
asked him to sit by his side. Ganapati Muni was reluctant, but Bhagavan lifted  
him up and made him sit on the sofa. The photo was taken, and some prints were  
made and distributed among   
the devotees.   
The Ashram authorities came to know about it when it was all over and, quite  
naturally, were indignant, for sitting on the same level with oneâs Guru was  
a serious breach of custom, implying a claim for spiritual equality. The  
negative and the prints had to be given up. **But the man who had taken the  
photo refused to surrender his copy. It did not bring him any luck; shortly  
after he committed suicide. The question why Bhagavan forced Ganapati Muni to  
sit on the sofa was never answered. Maybe it was his way of bringing the  
deeply hidden weaknesses of everybody to the surface.**   
Bose and Yogi Ramaiah were accompanying Bhagavan up the hill. While they were  
waiting for him to return, Yogi Ramaiah told Bose that a cement platform would  
be useful for Bhagavan to rest on. On his return Bhagavan was told of the idea  
and he said, âDonât. If you construct a platform,somebody will erect a  
templeâ.   
Once a devotee asked Bhagavan, âHave you seen Shiva,Nandi and Kailas?â  
Bhagavan replied, âNo, never. But the Self I see every momentâ.

This photo with Ganapati Muni and Bhagavan on the sofa, has   
never been made available. The whole incident is a mystery.   
**   
Once Maruice Frydman asked Bhagavan: "If I am the Self and   
you are the Self, why not I sit with you.?" Bhagavan Ramana   
smiled and said: "Why not? Come and sit!" Maurice Frydman   
said: "But, Bhagavan! If I sit, perhaps You may not mind; but   
the people in the Asramam will lynch me!" Then Bhagavan Ramana   
said: "Then till such time, you realize the Self, when people would   
not mistake your sitting with me, please pursue self enquiry!"   
No one has sat with Him on the sofa. Perhaps that fortune was   
available to some squirrels, monkeys and a leopard which was brought to  
Bhagavan. The leopard being very rajasic, did not   
stay with Him for more than one day, since the devotees were   
afraid and the owner took it back.   
Arunachala Siva.**
