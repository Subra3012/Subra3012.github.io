## Madhura Bhakti - Gopikas Selling Milk, Curds..  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: December 30, 2009, 11:03:08 AM

It is really so delightful to see thee Gopikas on the streets to sell milk and  
curds in their pails that were kept one upon the other on their heads. A  
Gopika was determined to sell buttermilk, contemplated on the Divine Feet of  
Bala Murali, entirely forgetting herself, uttered in bliss Govinda! Oh  
Damodara! Oh Madhava... they usually call out loudly, "milk!", "curds!"  
beckoning people to come. But strangely they have forgotton themselves and are  
moving around calling - "Govinda!", "Damodara", "Madhava", "Muralidhara"...  
They have forgotten the very purpose of their visit. One would wonder if they  
would have rebirth? Will they ever be born again? What a gifted souls they  
were! They are really blessed!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 27, 2009, 07:49:36 AM  
---  
The 17th song is sung on the 17th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month,   
this year it is falling on 1st January 2010.   
Here the girls first tell Yasoda and Nandagopa to wake up and then ask Krishna  
and Balarama to wake up.   
"O the Attire, the Water and the Food! Our Lord, the dharmic   
Nandagopa, please wake up. O the Leader of all gopas and the   
light and the lamp of the clan Yasoda our Lordess, please wake   
up. O our Lord who measured the Space and the Worlds (with   
your feet, as Trivikrama), the god of the gods, please wake up.   
O the anklet wearing brave Balarama, please wake up. O the   
brothers wake up without further sleep."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 18  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 02, 2010, 09:48:50 AM  
---  
Today is the 18th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month and it is the   
practice in many Tamil houses and with Tamil knowing Sri Vaishnavas of  
Karnataka, to sing the 18th song of Tiruppavai   
of AndaL.   
This particular song reveals some hitherto unknown information.   
Krishna or Kannan is already married to one lady by name Nappinnai. Krishna  
is said to have 108 wives, (Vallabhacharya   
says the number is 16108!) and one among them is the Tamil   
girl Nappinnai. Nappinnai means a girl with lustrous jet black hairs!  
Beginners in Sri Vaishnava philosophy think that AndaL is one of   
Krishna's wives. Yes. But that is only in Sri Rangam - Srivilliputtur  
stories. There is no reference to AndaL in Srimad Bhagavatam   
or Sri Narayaneeyam. Some authors say that AndaL is   
Goda Devi. But there is no name of Godadevi either in these   
two books. But there is reference to Nappinnai. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says that Krishna married one Dravidian (!) (Blackie!)   
girl by name Nappinnai. So, Nappinnai, the brunette, is Goda Devi   
or AndaL, we should conlcude.   
He is of the strength of an elephant, and valorous shoulders   
that shall never retreat against his enemies. He is Nandagopa,   
the foster-father of Krishna. O Nappinnai, one with long jet black   
fragrant hairs, the DAUGHTER IN LAW OF Nandagopa, please open   
the door. All of Krishna's girl friends have come for bathing. The   
cuckoos perching on the Madhavi creepers are cuckooing, again and   
again. We are repeatedly singing the holy names of Krishna, your   
hubby. Please open the door with your bangle-tingling lotus like   
hands!   
The cuckoos are cooing. So this is already morning, after dawn.   
In the dawn, as per Manikkavachagar's Tiruvembavai, the cocks   
make sounds first. Then the red legged snarks give forth sounds.   
Then the conch shells from priests make sounds. Then only   
the late rising cuckoos make cooing. Here AndaL refers to cooing   
of cuckoos. Hence it is no more dawn but early morning.   
Nappinnai, the brunette, has only long jet black hairs. But her   
limbs are pinkish red like those of a doll. This is evident from the last  
sentence of the poem. Hence she is a Dravidian but fair complexioned!   
Arunachala Siva.

## T.R. Kanakammal merged in the lotus feet of Bhagavan Ramana

T.R Kanakammal, a great devotee of Bhagavan and student of Muruganar Swamigal  
merged into Bhagavan on Ist January,2010, on the Jayanthi day of Bhagavan  
while she went around the shrine of Bhagavan at Sri Ramanashram,  
Tiruvannamalai. Her greatest contribution was her commentaries in Tamil on the  
complete poems of Bhagavan's Nool Thirattu. She has also written a book on  
reminescences of Bhagavan. Like Meera merging with Lord Krishna in Dwaraka  
Temple,yet another miracle of a woman devotee absorbed in Bhagavan Ramana in  
his shrine at Sri Ramanashram.   
Arunachala Siva Arunachala Siva Arunachala Siva........

Dear arcsekar,   
I am very happy and at the same time sad to see your post. I   
was present in the Samadhi Hall, at the material time. Most of   
the people present at the Samadhi Hall, expressed the same feelings   
mixed with happiness and sadness. Liberation on Bhagavan Ramana's Jayanti day  
on 1.1.2010 is a great gift of Bhagavan to   
that totally devoted lady. A gentleman who was sitting near me,   
in the Samadhi Hall said such miracles do happen in the Asramam,   
and only a few people know it and no one records it. Once, I am told that a  
worker, who had climbed up to set right the shamiana   
for a function like Jayanti, fell down from about 30 feet and straight on a  
rock on the ground. With his skull broken, he was rushed to   
Vellore and everyone thought that his life was over. But to the   
surprise of doctors in Vellore, he became alright in about 10 days   
and came back to work in the Asramam.   
Bhagavan Ramana's miracles do not ever stop. It happens even today. My case  
is itself a glorious example but I am not able to   
reveal the full details.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sl.Lakshmi,   
In good and happy times, hardly few think about God or Guru.   
When the life situation becomes utterly unmanageable, with penury,   
diseases, sorrows, one should think of God or Guru. But we do not   
do that. Because, our ego tries to fight these miseries, without   
seeking God or Guru or we become deluded by the events around   
us and do not have mental make up to think of God or Guru. That   
is why, one Azhwar said: Appothaikku, Ippothe solli vaithen Narayana. "I do  
not know whether I can chant your names Narayana, in times of unbearable  
distress, and that is why I am   
chanting your names now!" This is the situation. But we do not   
chant his names ippothe, now itself, as a reserve for appothe, at   
that time of distress. This is the human behaviour for most people.   
When the horses became jackals again at night, the Pandya King   
grew very angry at Saint Manikkavachagar and made him walk on   
the summer sands of Vaigai river, with hot bricks on his head.   
The Saint sang: "Namasivaya, Namasivaya, even if I faint I should   
think and chant your name in subconscious state!"   
How many of us can do this? It is very difficult. On the last day   
of His avatara period, that is on 14th April 1950, at about 8 PM,   
the inmates in the Asrmam suddenly started in chorus, singing: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... Bhagavan Ramana raised His   
back from the pillows and looked at them with abundant grace and   
thankfulness. Tears rolled down from His eyes. At 8.47 He left   
His body as a meteor! He is the complete Guru, with no mind/body  
consciousness for 54 years and no vasanas whatsoever.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi and others,   
In today's "The Hindu", there is an obit, informing the merger of   
T.R. Kanakammal at the golden feet of Bhagavan Ramana. This   
has been inserted by her friends and devotees. There is also a   
small photograph above the announcement.   
Arunachala Siva.

Smt. T.R. Kanakamma was a great soul and a true devotee of Bhagavan. Her  
importance also is glorified by her personal receipt of Grace from Bhagavan  
Ramana Maharshi and Kanchi Mahaswamigal.She was taught by Sri Muruganar  
Swamigal and she brought out two volumes of Bhagavan's Vedantic and devotional  
works with meanings as learnt from the great poet-devotee-saint Muruganar.Her  
merging with the Bhagavan in His own abode and while she was at prayer on His  
Jayanthi day are simply miraculous. May She in her exalted status continue to  
bless us all.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Thank you for the information about Smt. Sampooranammal.   
I did not know it so far. There was one Thinnai Swami (Thinnai   
means in Tamil, the raised frontal portion of the house. Once   
when he wanted to take leave of Bhagavan Ramana, Bhagavan   
Ramana said "Iru" Iru means in Tamil "Stay." Thinnai Swami   
took this as a great Upadesa and simply stayed in Tiruvannamalai.   
His wife was with him for some months and she also left T'malai   
to take care of her children in Chennai. This man simply stayed   
in Thinnai and so was called Thinnai Swami! He had no extra   
set of dhotis and shirt. He lived with that single dhoti and   
shirt occasionally taking bath. There was no smell due to these   
old dhoti and shirt! He will take only food that is given by others.   
He would never go to the Temple or the Asramam or for begging.   
He attained merger with Bhagavan many years later on a Maha   
Deepam Day! He was foretelling his departure stating that   
Arunachala and Unnamulai would take him on the Mahadeepam   
Day!   
Arunachala Siva.

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.
