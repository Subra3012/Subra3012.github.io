Arunachala Maahatmyam, Tamil version is available in the Asramam.   
I am not sure about the English version. Regarding Arunachala Puranam, this  
original Tamil work is again available in the Asramam.   
You may kindly write to Asramam, Tiruvannamalai 606 603, India   
and find out.   
Arunachala Siva.
