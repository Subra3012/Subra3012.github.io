Is it true that we ourselves are the goal that we seek?

All goals being mental there is no where to reach. Mentally motion is  
possible. Physically motion is possible. for the Self, where is the question  
of motion? It alone being, where does it move and from where ? It being beyond  
time there is no seeking, no goal etc. The mind can continue seeking, the body  
can continue moving the Self just IS.   
There is a Zen story: The laughing buddha was a zen monk who used to distrubute sweets to children.  
he used to carry a bag full of sweets. Some one went to him and asked, sir  
"what is Self realization?" he simply dropped the bag he was carrying [meaning  
to see oneself as totally actionless] and then he asked how would one live  
after self realization, he simply took the bag and went along ! [meaning,  
having known the self as motionless, let things be as they are... nothing has  
to be done in particular].

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai. Nice question. Nice Zen story.   
We are the goal, the path and the traveller in the Self.-enquiry.   
All become goal at the end. As T.S. Eliot said: "There will be time,   
there will be time, when everything looks alike." "I have measured   
my life in coffee-spoons!"

Dear srkudai,   
 The zen story is significant.Leaving the bag is symbolic of state of enlightenment.   
 Taking the bag again is symbolic of state "Beyond enlightenment".   
 Creating a goal is a trick of the mind to elude us from positing in the self.

Dear Raju,   
Thats an interesting perspective. An alternative perspective is   
Leaving the bag is a sign of enlightenment   
but picking up the bag is : knowing that its all a dream, one may continue  
ones usual life style.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Nice exchange of ideas. "We   
are all such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded   
with a sleep." There is a story about Kaduveli Siddhar, a Brahma   
Jnani. The King wanted to test him and sent a courtesan to attract   
him. The lady won the battle, Kaduveli Siddhar married her, begot   
a kid and was looking after the kid, whenever the lady went for   
a dancing job. She told the King also about her victory over the   
Siddhar. One day, when she was away, the baby cried for milk,   
and the Siddhar ran to the King's court to give the baby to the   
lady, who was dancing. Everyone was laughing at the Siddhar.   
"See here is a man who is said to be a Brahma Jnani but had a   
baby through illicit relationship.". The lady was dancing, and   
suddenly her anklet got snapped and she was bending to set it   
right. The Siddhar said, "I shall set right the anklet, and meantime,   
you feed the baby." The King roaring with laugher asked the   
Siddhar, "Are you a Brahma Jnani, still?" Then the Siddhar   
said pointing to a stout pillar in the hall, " Oh Pillar! If you   
are the Brahman and I am a Brahma Jnani, please open up   
and consume me!". The pillar opened up, the Siddhar went into   
the pillar and the pillar got closed as before!   
Dear 'kudai', Ultimately, the bhavana that comes out of faith,   
is a great thing in our path for self enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Yes that is very true. Firm conviction that "i am Awareness" is very important.   
BTW, you can call me udai. my name is udai. srk when i created my mail id,  
i was a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna[srk] and followed bhakti marga. I still  
consider him as my guru and follow bhakti, but no more am emotional abt it as  
i was earlier. right now, to me, Self Inquiry is the highest kind of Bhakti  
too!

Dear srkudai, Yes, all paths lead to the Ramana Way. He had   
no quarrel with any other paths. When Aurobindo said that   
there is a Super Mind, which is beyond mind, Bhagavan said: there are no two minds, but only one mind and only vasanas   
are many. But He permitted certain devotees to go to Aurobindo   
to puruse the path most suited to them.

Dear Vladimir and Raju, All sins are predestined incidents.   
But here, what Bhagavan refers is the Forgetfulness of the Self,   
which is our permanent nature and this forgetfulness is the sin.   
Whether, this is also happening as pre destined, is depending   
on one's carry of 'vasanas', our inherent tendencies acquired   
out of previous births.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju and srkudai, all this drama occurs because of chit-jada   
granthi, the self-body complex. When we say, mano-nasa, it is   
not 'killing the mind', because 'mind' has not got any 'physical   
entity' for killing. It is 'leaving' the mind, or resolving the mind,   
once for all and staying in the Self. Whenever we think of   
something, while watching a TV story or a cinema, and in the process, miss a  
scene in TV or cinema, we say that 'mind has gone somewhere.   
In other words, mind has left the scene. Again, Raju, it is only   
with the mind, the mind can be 'killed ' or left for good.   
As Bhagavan says, it is like a stick that is used to stir the funeral   
pyre, and after the work is over, the stick is also burnt on the pyre.   
(Who am I?).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Thats perfectly correct.   
By a pure mind, i understand a mind where "I" points to Self and not body or  
mind.   
So such a mind does not load the physical or mental problems on the Self.   
So Someone calls me an idiot; the idea he thinks i am an idiot comes in  
mind : but since i no more think I am the mental "I", this thought fails to  
affect me. If i am present as a mental entity, then this thought affects.

Dear srkudai, You said it. In retrospect, I think, Bhagavan   
said this "Suddha manas" concept for two reasons. One is   
to clarify the doubt of the seekers, as how can Bhagavan do   
all the work in this world, without mind. Second, many of us are damn afraid  
of mano-nasa, thinking that we would then go mad! Bhagavan   
said: All right, do not be afraid, have a Suddha manas. This reminds   
me of a story in management. A person had a monkey, hung   
permanently around his neck and the knot was so tight that   
no one could untie it. One doctor said: All right, I shall sedate   
you, so that the monkey will not trouble you and he was put   
on sedation. Another came and said: No I shall not sedate you,   
I shall sedate the monkey, and the monkey was sedated so that   
it could not trouble that man. After sometime, nothing worked.   
Then one another doctor came and said: It is simple, I shall   
untie the knot; he untied it, with some difficulty and both the   
man and the monkey became peaceful. After some time,   
the man came again! I am so much used to monkey and now I am   
not able to live without the monkey! Then the doctor said: All right, I shall paint a monkey on your chest! You can always   
"feel" that the monkey is ever with you. He did the painting,   
and the man became peaceful without any further problem.   
The painted monkey, is perhaps, the Suddha manas!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju, in spiritual game, every one is a winner, because   
everyone gets gold medal, that is Light. There is no silver and   
bronze here.   
Dear srkduai, the when the person who is an audience in the   
movie, becomes the Witness, it does not matter, whether the   
play stops or not. If by inter galactic wars, all the universe   
perishes, even then Brahman is a Witness, though the 'play'   
has stopped. At that time, the 'maha-maya' curls up into the   
Brahman. Or Sakti is united with Siva, till the next play starts,   
for her to do her mischief.

Dear Raju and srkudai, all this drama occurs because of chit-jada   
granthi, the self-body complex. When we say, mano-nasa, it is   
not 'killing the mind', because 'mind' has not got any 'physical   
entity' for killing. It is 'leaving' the mind, or resolving the mind,   
once for all and staying in the Self. Whenever we think of   
something, while watching a TV story or a cinema, and in the process, miss a  
scene in TV or cinema, we say that 'mind has gone somewhere.   
In other words, mind has left the scene. Again, Raju, it is only   
with the mind, the mind can be 'killed ' or left for good.   
As Bhagavan says, it is like a stick that is used to stir the funeral   
pyre, and after the work is over, the stick is also burnt on the pyre.   
(Who am I?).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Thats perfectly correct.   
By a pure mind, i understand a mind where "I" points to Self and not body or  
mind.   
So such a mind does not load the physical or mental problems on the Self.   
So Someone calls me an idiot; the idea he thinks i am an idiot comes in  
mind : but since i no more think I am the mental "I", this thought fails to  
affect me. If i am present as a mental entity, then this thought affects.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, You said it. In retrospect, I think, Bhagavan   
said this "Suddha manas" concept for two reasons. One is   
to clarify the doubt of the seekers, as how can Bhagavan do   
all the work in this world, without mind. Second, many of us are damn afraid  
of mano-nasa, thinking that we would then go mad! Bhagavan   
said: All right, do not be afraid, have a Suddha manas. This reminds   
me of a story in management. A person had a monkey, hung   
permanently around his neck and the knot was so tight that   
no one could untie it. One doctor said: All right, I shall sedate   
you, so that the monkey will not trouble you and he was put   
on sedation. Another came and said: No I shall not sedate you,   
I shall sedate the monkey, and the monkey was sedated so that   
it could not trouble that man. After sometime, nothing worked.   
Then one another doctor came and said: It is simple, I shall   
untie the knot; he untied it, with some difficulty and both the   
man and the monkey became peaceful. After some time,   
the man came again! I am so much used to monkey and now I am   
not able to live without the monkey! Then the doctor said: All right, I shall paint a monkey on your chest! You can always   
"feel" that the monkey is ever with you. He did the painting,   
and the man became peaceful without any further problem.   
The painted monkey, is perhaps, the Suddha manas!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju, in spiritual game, every one is a winner, because   
everyone gets gold medal, that is Light. There is no silver and   
bronze here.   
Dear srkduai, the when the person who is an audience in the   
movie, becomes the Witness, it does not matter, whether the   
play stops or not. If by inter galactic wars, all the universe   
perishes, even then Brahman is a Witness, though the 'play'   
has stopped. At that time, the 'maha-maya' curls up into the   
Brahman. Or Sakti is united with Siva, till the next play starts,   
for her to do her mischief.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSRAJU,   
 thoughtlessness is nothing special. Self-Attention is special.   
Please note this. There are pancha koshas 5 Seaths ; 5 bodies the  
physical body, the subtle body, mind, intellect, vasanas   
And Self is wearing them all.   
When we think the state of the body affects us, we are stuck at the level of  
the body and it means we are thinking "I" means body.   
when we think the state of the mind affects us, we are stuck at the level of  
the mind it means "I" is attached to mind.   
When we see ourselves as the Self, Pure Awareness and reject to identify with  
the states of mind: how does it matter whether there are thoughts in the mind  
or no thoughts ?   
just as it does not matter whether there is a wound in the body or no wound : coz we are the Self, and do not carry the troubles ofthe body onto ourselves.  
Same way, we do not carry the states of the mind onto ourselves, and recognize  
ourselves as the Pure Awareness just witnessing the various states of mind: how does it matter wether there are thoughts or not thoughts ? If there are  
thoughts that is beautiful if there are none, that too is wonderful, Coz  
we remain with the Self.   
Just be the Witness!   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSN Raju & srkudai, Thought-free consciousness   
can be attained only through the thought. Please read the   
stick and the funeral pyre story. This only remaining thought   
will also burn away at the end.   
As srkudai, the five sheaths (pancha kosas) are within the body.   
Bhagavan says, that one should enquire the Self within these five   
kosas (which includes the mind, which produces thoughts) and not   
outside from the books. (Who am I? -1902).   
It is like pulling out the innermost stem of an elephant grass,   
(dharba - which is used in ceremonies).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I do not think that thoughtlessness is anyway related to Realization.   
When Ramana talked about thoughtlessness, he was talking meaning he had  
that thought, and yet he was ever in sahaja samadhi.   
He was thoughtless and bodyless too ! while all the same he was speaking to us  
!   
How do we understand this ? Just that the seath's, the various koshas were  
there but he no more identified with them.   
Just as presence or absence of body does not make any difference to a Jnani   
Presence or absence of thoughts also does not cause any difference to a Jnani.   
[I do not see why this should not be so, as mind too is just another kosha]   
Again, more radical: Presence or absence of ego does not make any difference  
to a jnani   
[Psychologically there does not exist anyone without ego. Ego is a must in  
everyone]   
But all the same a Jnani knows that the body, the mind and the ego are not he,  
who is Self   
 **Mano, budhi, ahamkara chittani naham [I am neither the mind, intellect nor  
the ego]   
...   
Chitananda rupam sivoham sivoham [I am of the form of pure bliss - Siva;  
unadultrated by anything].**   
An Ajnani who identifies with mind, thinks of thoughtlessness as making a  
difference to him, as even the presence of a thought.   
Someone who strives to reach thoughtlessness will be a real pity coz every  
thought is a disturbance to him, coz he is trying to be without it!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, The discussions are going awesome and crazy.   
1. Thoughtlessness is not a think of being thoughtless. It is just   
being thoughtless, and that is all. No one can think about thoughtlessness.   
2. Thoughtlessness is Self Realization. Please see Who am I?   
3. For a Jnani who has already killed his mind, and who is ever   
thoughtless, the mind is like a burnt rope. The mind is no   
longer useful. How he does he think, how does he live in body,   
how does he talk, how does he eat, how does he write, how does   
he dream, how does he sleep - He does all this as the SELF.   
When the SELF could be everywhere, all powerful, all wise, all   
effulgent, does it need a mind to do all the above things that I   
above mentioned?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
For the first time in our discussions, i disagree with you here. Please do not  
see my disagreement as lack of respect. It could just be my own foolishness.   
I know most people speak of thoughtlessness as Self Realization and  
intentionally i mentioned that it is not.   
Ramana said I am thoughtless, he also said, i am bodyless ! Please see this.  
He was thoughtless just as he was bodyless.   
[Meaning, Since he is the Self, the thoughts are there, the body is there   
there is no identification anywhere. That is why mind is a burnt rope coz  
identification is burnt.Not thoughts. Once identification is burnt off, no  
thought is a burden anymore. Thoughts continue, Speaking happened, thinking  
happened, but no idenification hence no speaker or thinker. but that does not  
mean mind is thoughtless.]

Dear srkudai, Yesterday, I mentioned "thoughtless state is   
self realization" and you had a different view.   
Again, I am quoting from Who am I? Please read this, and   
tell me, whether 'thoughtless state is self realization".   
Under Question 16, Bhagavan says: The Self is that where there   
is absolutely no "I" thought. This is called, 'Silence'. The Self   
itself is the world, the Self itself is "I". The Self itself is God.   
All is Siva, the Self.   
(Here Bhagavan mentioned "I" thought, because "I" thought   
is the root of all thoughts).   
Again under Question 25, Bhagavan says: "Remaining quiet is   
what is called Wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to resolve the   
mind in the Self......"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
When Bhagavan Spoke these words he had thoughts, did he not ?   
Let us see what he seems to be saying: Suppose sir, that i am watching a movie. and forgot myself in he character of  
the movie. Suppose my name in the movie is "I". And all actions are happening  
where "I" is the doer. All of a sudden sir, i learn that i am not the  
character in the movie, but the one sitting outside. Sir, now tell me, does  
the character in the movie stop ?   
But at the same time, is the watcher the doer ?   
The Watcher is the Self.   
The character in the movie is "I" [Read Movie == mind]   
There is no "I" in the Watcher.   
The view most people hold is that the movie has to stop for someone to know  
himself as the Seer. Sir, suppose as i am thinking that i am the character in  
the movie, if someone points towards the Watcher and says : U r that, not  
this! I can be liberated while in the movie itself.   
If Ramana never Saw the movie, the world, after Realization he could not  
have communicated. He saw, but he saw it like the movie unaffected by what  
happened and continued the game of playing the role of "I".   
The mind and body are just functioning in the presence of Self. Like, in the  
presence of electricity the bulb glows, the fan revolves. They continue to  
glow as they are.   
To remain quiet is to be established in the fact that i am the Witness and not  
the "Doer". Doership is not being quiet.   
I am only trying to express my understanding, since i have not yet reached  
Nirvikalpa Samadhi, my understanding may be not correct. All i know is about  
Savikalpa Samadhi keeping the attention fixed on Self, the Witness.   
I think Sri Ramana Talked about Sahaja Samadhi. Perhaps that is Samadhi in  
which thoughts are not seen as disturbance, but just happenign without the  
presence of a doer.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
 I will try to explain in a different way about what you wrote.Suppose an infant is taking breast milk from his mother while sleeping   
he is not aware of the act of what he is doing.He is only enjoying the  
happiness of deep sleep even during the act of breast feeding.It is only   
from the point of view of others that he is sucking the breast.From his point  
he is not aware of being in any action but only enjoying the   
happiness of deep sleep.There,in case of infant there is no doer sucking the  
breast nor there is a thought from his side but action happens   
by itself on it's own accord without the interference of the thought.In a  
similar way Bhagawan is so much self absorbed many times he used   
to say i am aware that i am here and i have a body because you are pointing  
it.When Bhagawan dealt the outside world there is no thinker   
in him.His thoughts and acts are spontaneous response to a challenge unlike  
our's which usually is a calculated response from the thinker   
inside us.As far as we are concerned unless the thinker is annihilated by what  
ever is the means the spontaneous revelation of self-conscious   
being is not possible.Bhagawan in sahaja samadhi having thoughts does not mean  
that we can be a thinker with thoughts and at the same   
time attain the self-conscious being.   
So far no body answered to my original question"can we attain self-conscious  
being through thought"?While answering many are deviating   
from the essence of the question and answering in their own way.   
My experience is that clarity of self-consciousness is inversely proportional  
to thought traffic.   
Thought is an off spring of self-ignorance.How can such instrument be used to  
find the self?That is my question.   
Decrease in thought traffic amounts to decrease of self-ignorance which  
facilitates the spontaneous revelation of the self.   
For this self-enquiry is the best way.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
My experience is that clarity of self-consciousness is inversely proportional  
to thought traffic.

facilitates the spontaneous revelation of the self.   
For this self-enquiry is the best way.   
Only when thought traffic is less we see clarity this is coz we identify  
with mind and states of mind. When the mind is still, we find stillness   
but in reality whether mind is still or otherwise, there is a current of  
stillness in the background all the time. isnt it ?   
This is due to our weakness. Just as when the body is ill, we cannot be clear  
 not that body's health has anything to do with being with the Self, just  
coz we identify with the body, the body's states affect us. Same way the  
mental states affect us coz we identify ourselves with the mental "I".   
Please see that Thoughts alone can help us. Coz The Self does not need  
Ramana's talks. The body does not need. Only the mind needs. It has to  
ultimately start at the mind. And mentally we have to recognize that we are  
not the mental "I". In Advaita Bodha Deepika these are mentioned very  
clearly. Please see that.   
After Realization, in my opinion, neither "I" nor the thoughts cease. They  
just continue. Then the "I" is like playing a role, i play the role of a Rich  
man in a movie, and forgot myself, when i recognize myself, the role need not  
be dismissed. It is played all the same, knowing clearly that i am not the  
role.

Dear srkudai,   
 I feel that whole humanity identify with body-mind complex.Afflictions of them affect them because they superimpose the   
afflictions of the body and mind on them due to the defect of Adhyasa.I agree  
there is undercurrent of stillness even when we are engaged   
in thought or activity.But that applies to only those who are established in  
witnessing consciousness.You are saying that thoughts are helpful for  
realisation.Then why Manonasa is very much stressed as the basis of  
realisation?For those who are identified with the body bound "I" i feel that   
thoughts are a hindrance and they are required to do self-enquiry to posit in  
the self-conscious being.

Dear Raju,   
Mano nasha is destruction of identification with mind not physical  
destruction of mind !   
Otherwise there is alternative way: hit on the head of someone.   
First thing it happens only via thoughts. U use ur mind to get beyond it. So  
its important.   
But then, once beyond, i agree with you that thoughts do not matter.

Dear srkudai and Raju, In the movie example, the movie is the   
Jagat and not I. By seeing the character in the movie as 'I', you   
are acting by superimpsing yourself in you. The Watcher is the   
Self. When the watcher stops seeing the movie, the movie does   
not stop. Here the world does not stop. But for whom? For   
others. So far, you are concerned, the continuation of movie   
is as good as its stopping, becuase, you are not seeing, At night,   
when you are sleeping, the world is not there for you. But for   
a mechanic doing night shift in the office, the world is. Bhagavan's   
reference is always towards the 'seeker' and all the upadesa is   
for the seeker. Hence, He does not bother, whether the world   
is there for others, but only says that the world is not there for you.   
Hence, I still believe that the thoughtless state is a self realized   
state. If a Jnani does work, he does so, as I told earier, with the   
Suddha manas, a Pure Mind, which is like a burnt rope. In other   
words, things around a Jnani happen because of his Sannidhya,   
the power of the presence.   
All of us can discuss this thing further, for more light to the topic.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
 I never said manonasa is physical destrction of the mind.With all respect for you i feel that destruction of identity with the mind   
is through thought in the initial stages.I also differ with your concept that  
mind has the capacity to go beyond itself.

Dear Raju,   
I never said that mind has the capacity to go beyond mind!   
I just said that you use mind to go beyond mind.   
Essentially it is a simple correction in the mind : the word "I" should point  
to Self. That is all. When i say "I", i should be reminded of Self, Awareness,  
Witness and not this body. As such you are already beyond mind, so no where to  
go. The body need not go anywhere either. Only the mind which links "I" with  
the body and other jada padartha [dead bojects] needs to be corrected.   
Self needs no correction.   
Body needs no correction.   
Only mind needs correction : that is the word "I" is wrongly associated.   
Love!   
Silence
