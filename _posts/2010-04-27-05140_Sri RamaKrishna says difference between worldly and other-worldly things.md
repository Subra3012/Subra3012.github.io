" **In order to be able to renounce, one must pray to God for the will power  
to do so.** One must immediately renounce what one feels to be unreal. The  
rishis had this will-power. Through it they controlled the sense-organs. If  
the tortoise once tucks in its limbs, you cannot make it bring them out even  
by cutting it into four pieces.

DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly  
things?"   
MASTER: "While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has to  
practise renunciation, applying the logic of ' **Neti, neti '**'Not this, not  
this', But after attaining the vision of God, he realizes that God alone has  
become all things.   
"At one time Rama was overpowered by the spirit of  
renunciation.Dasaratha,worried at this, went to the sage Vasishtha and begged  
him to persuade Rama not to give up the world. The sage came to Rama and found  
him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had been raging in the  
Prince's mind.   
**Vasishtha said: 'Rama,why should You renounce the world? Is the world  
outside God? Reason with me.' Rama realized that the world had evolved from  
the Supreme Brahman. So, He said nothing.**   
"Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes this  
knows that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After  
separating the butter with great effort-that is to say, after attaining  
Brahmajnanayou will realize that as long as butter exists, buttermilk also  
must exist.   
**Wherever there is butter there must be buttermilk as well. As long as one  
feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware that the universe, living  
beings,and the twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well.**

Bhagavan Ramana said that the Self is within and if one realizes   
this, then the world, jivas, personal gods - are all Brahman.   
Arunachala Siva.
