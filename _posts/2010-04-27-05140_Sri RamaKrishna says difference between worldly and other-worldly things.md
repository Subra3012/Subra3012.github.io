M: "Is the world unreal?"   
MASTER: "Why should it be unreal? What you are asking is a matter for  
philosophical discussion.   
"In the beginning, when a man reasons following the Vedantic method of ' **Not  
this, not this** ', he realizes that Brahman is not the living beings, not the  
universe,not the twenty-four cosmic principles. All these things become like  
dreams to him. **Then comes the affirmation of what has been denied, and he  
feels that God Himself has become the universe and all living beings.**   
 **" Suppose you are climbing to the roof by the stairs. As long as you are  
aware of the roof, you are also aware of the stairs. He who is aware of the  
high is also aware of the low. But after reaching the roof you realize that  
the stairs are made of the same materialsbrick, lime, and brick-dustas the  
roof.**   
"Further, I have given the illustration of the bel-fruit. Both changeability  
and   
unchangeability belong to one and the same Reality.   
 **" The ego cannot be done away with.As long as 'I-consciousness' exists,  
living beings and the universe must also exist. After realizing God, one sees  
that, it is He Himself who has become the universe and the living beings.**  
But one cannot realize this by mere reasoning.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says How can one recognize a holy man?

Devotee: "How can one recognize a holy man?"   
 **Rama Krishna: "He who has surrendered his body, mind, and innermost self to  
God is surely a holy man. He who has renounced 'woman and gold' is surely a  
holy man.** He is a holy man who does not regard woman with the eyes of a  
worldly person. He never forgets to look upon a woman as his mother, and to  
offer her his worship if he happens to be near her.   
The holy man constantly thinks of God and does not indulge in any talk except  
about spiritual things. Furthermore, he serves all beings, knowing that God  
resides in everybody's heart. These, in general, are the signs of a holy man."

DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly  
things?"   
MASTER: "While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has to  
practise renunciation, applying the logic of ' **Neti, neti '**'Not this, not  
this', But after attaining the vision of God, he realizes that God alone has  
become all things.   
"At one time Rama was overpowered by the spirit of  
renunciation.Dasaratha,worried at this, went to the sage Vasishtha and begged  
him to persuade Rama not to give up the world. The sage came to Rama and found  
him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had been raging in the  
Prince's mind.   
**Vasishtha said: 'Rama,why should You renounce the world? Is the world  
outside God? Reason with me.' Rama realized that the world had evolved from  
the Supreme Brahman. So, He said nothing.**   
"Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes this  
knows that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After  
separating the butter with great effort-that is to say, after attaining  
Brahmajnanayou will realize that as long as butter exists, buttermilk also  
must exist.   
**Wherever there is butter there must be buttermilk as well. As long as one  
feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware that the universe, living  
beings,and the twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well.**

Bhagavan Ramana said that the Self is within and if one realizes   
this, then the world, jivas, personal gods - are all Brahman.   
Arunachala Siva.
