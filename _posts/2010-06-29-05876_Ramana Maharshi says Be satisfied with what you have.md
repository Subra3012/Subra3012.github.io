At Skandasramam lived a monkey named Nondi, which was the pet of all. Maharshi  
had ordered that whatever food was served to his followers should also be  
served to the monkey, and in case it was absent elsewhere, then its share  
should be kept separate for its return. In such a case, the food would be kept  
near a window inside the cave and the shutter closed but not bolted. This was  
the custom.   
 _On one of his periodical visits to the Asramam one day,the boy had enjoyed  
the sweet dishes served to the devotees. He had a little more than the usual  
share. The monkey being absent, its share was kept near the closed window. The  
boy, having had his share, went up to the window and began to eat out of the  
monkeys as well. Suddenly, the monkey came and opened the window only to see  
the boy eating its share. It gave the boy a blow on his cheek. Shocked and  
terrified, the boy cried out and devotees tried to console him. Bhagavan came  
to the spot, understood the situation and told the boy: You deserve it. Why  
did you want his (monkeys) share. You have had enough already.You ought to  
have been contented with that. Instead of appeasing the beloved child,  
Bhagavan put him right. The boy became silent and heeded Bhagavans words._   
 **Do not touch the property of others. Be content with what you have. Share  
equally what you have. Divide it with one and all around you. Help the needy.  
Be not blind when a wrong is committed before you. Correct it if possible, or  
at least speak out for the right. These are some of the golden truths the  
young boy was able to grasp from the words of the Maharshi that day.**   
That blessed boy is Swami Ramanananda (Sri T.N.Venkataraman, former president  
of Sri Ramanasramam, the only descendant of Maharshis family).

Dear prasanth,   
About desire and fear, Muruganar says in Padamalai:-   
Verse 1974: Unless one realizes one's non dual nature, the desire   
and fear that are caused by delusion will not cease.   
Verse 1821: Instead of enjoying bliss, established in the state of the Self,  
why this desire in you for the world, which frightens the mind?   
Verse 722: With the help of divine grace, destroy your fear, end   
your suffering, and attain the state of bliss.   
Verse 342: Since Iswara abides as your own Self, it is impossible   
to deceive him, no mater, what you do.   
Verse 2225: By indulging in improper conduct, the jiva will swelter   
and suffer in the burgeoning fire of sordid sense objects.   
Verse 1023: Accept with great joy whatever is obtained without desiring it.  
Regard it as sufficient and offer it to the body.   
Arunachala Siva.
