What a beautiful and powerful poem.   
This body is not me.   
I am not limited by this body.   
I am life without boundaries.   
I have never been born,   
and I have never died.   
Look at the ocean and the sky filled with stars,   
manifestations from my wondrous true mind.   
Since before time, I have been free.   
Birth and death are only doors through which we pass,   
sacred thresholds on our journey.   
Birth and death are a game of hide and seek.   
So laugh with me,   
hold my hand,   
let us say good-bye,   
say good-bye, to meet again soon.   
We meet today.   
We will meet again tomorrow.   
We will meet at the source every moment.   
We meet each other in all forms of life.   
~ Thich Nhat Hanh
