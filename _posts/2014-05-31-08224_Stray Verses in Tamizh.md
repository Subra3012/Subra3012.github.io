## The Vedas

Friends,   
I just happen to chance upon this introduction on upanishad by Graham: Quote  
> Unlike the Vedas which can only be read and chanted by initiated Brahmins,  
> the Upanishads can be read and chanted by anyone.   
> The Vedas do not deal with the Self and final Liberation, but the Upanishads  
> deal with the Self, its Source, Attainment and Final Liberation and are thus  
> the jewel in the crown of Vedic literature.   
> It is taught that to read and chant the Upanishads, as well as other  
> authoritative works dealing with the Self, helps to destroy the ego and  
> leads to Emancipation.  
Please refer here: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/upanishads/upanishads.htm   
The upanishads are part and parcel of Vedas.As such, although everyone may  
study them,the chanting (adhyAyana)is to be done only by Brahmins who have  
learnt it directly from the Guru.It is a oral tradition and the chant is to be  
heard and then recited only By Brahmins.This is what Sri Bhagavan has also  
said categorically. Ofcourse,everyone can listen to it and derive the benefit.   
It is totally wrong to say : Quote  
> Vedas do not deal with the Self and final realization.  
This is a vast subject and everyone should know at least a wee bit of what the  
Vedas truly are.The Essence of Vedas is the Gayatri mantra-the King of all  
Mantras.This is the essence of all the Four Vedas-To chant The Gayatri mantra  
and to dwell on its essence is no less than self-enquiry.   
 **Sri Ramakrishna says** :  **' The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om, and, Om in  
samadhi'**.   
I will post here from Sri Aurobindo's 'Secret of the Veda' and from the Talks  
on the vedas by Sri Kanchi mahAswAmi in this thread.   
Namaskar.

**Preserving the Vedas: Why it is a Lifetime Mission** -By Sri KAnchi  
mahAswami   
_This excerpt from mahaswAmi 's talk contains an illuminating exposition of  
the physics and metaphysics of sound._   
'If the divisions of labour on a hereditary basis is good for all society,  
**what specifically is the benefit gained from the vocation of Brahmins, that  
is preserving the Vedas?** ' is a question frequently asked.   
 **The potter makes pots for you; the washerman launders your clothes; the  
weaver weaves clothes for you to wear; the cowherd brings you your milk; the  
peasant tills the land to grow rice for you to cook and eat.Everyone does some  
work or other essential in the life of everybody else. The rice (or wheat)  
grown by the tiller sustains us all. The cloth woven by the weaver is  
indispensable to our modesty; it is also needed to keep us warm in the cold  
season. We drink the milk brought by the cowherd and also use it to make  
buttermilk; we cook our food in the pot made by the potter. We find that all  
jatis provide commodities useful for the society. What is the Brahmin 's  
contribution in this context? What vocation is assigned to him by the Sastras  
which are the basis of varna dharma? The Brahmin has to learn the Vedas by  
listening to his teacher chanting them; this is adhyayana. If adhyayana is  
chanting the Vedas, adhyapana is teaching the same. The sastras have charged  
the Brahmin with the additional duty of performing various rites including  
Vedic sacrifices**.   
 **The Vedas contain lofty truths. People in modern times may not be averse to  
the idea that these truths are worthy of being cherished. Society requires  
knowledge, arts, etc. The Vedas are a storehouse of knowledge. So the idea  
that we must have a special class of people to propagate the truths contained  
in the Vedas may seem reasonable enough**. According to the sastras, however,  
such a special class is needed to preserve the sound of these scriptures. This  
class is constituted by the Brahmins and they perform their function on a  
hereditary basis. **The idea that propagating the truths of the Vedas will  
help mankind may be acceptable to many, but not the belief that a small group  
of people can contribute to the good of the world by preserving the sound of  
the Vedas**.   
 **The community stands to lose if the peasant does not till the land and the  
potter, weaver, carpenter, etc., do not do their respective jobs. But would  
you say the same thing about the work of the Brahmin? What difference would it  
make to the society if he ceased intoning the Vedas?**

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the Vedas** continued....   
To understand the questions raised above we must first try to find out the  
nature of the Vedas. No purpose is served by approaching the subject entirely  
on an intellectual level. We must accept the words of great men who know the  
Vedas deep in their hearts. 'How can we do that, sir?' some people might  
protest. 'We are rationalists and we can be convinced of a truth or statement  
only on the basis of reason or direct knowledge. '   
What do we do then? How can anyone claim, as a matter of right, that all  
subjects ought to be brought within the ken of human reasoning? Man is but one  
among countless creatures. Take for instance the experiments conducted by a  
physicist in his laboratory. Does a cow understand them? If the scientist  
formulates certain laws on the basis on his experiments, does the cow say that  
'These laws of physics do not exist?' How are humans ignorant of physics to  
know about such laws? They trust the statements made by people proficient in  
the subject. To illustrate, take the example of any common appliance. Let us  
assume that you are told that it works on the basis of certain principles of  
science. Don't you accept these principles by observing how the appliance  
works?   
In the same way we must have faith in what great men say about the Vedas,  
great men who live strictly adhering to the sastras. We must also place our  
faith on our scripture on the basis of the fruits or benefits yielded by them,  
the benefits we directly perceive. One such 'fruit' is still there for all of  
us to see. It is Hinduism itself, the religion that has withstood the  
challenges of all these millennia. Our religion has produced more great men  
than any other faith. People have been rewarded with the highest inner well-  
being [the highest bliss] as a result of their faith in the Vedic tradition.  
There is no insistence on their part that everything on earth must be brought  
within the realm of reason or direct perception.   
 **The sages transcended the frontiers of human knowledge and became one with  
the Universal Reality. It is through them that the world received the Vedic  
mantras.This is one of the basic concepts of our religion. If you do not  
accept that human beings can obtain such Atmic power as exemplified by these  
seers, any further talk on the subject would be futile**. One could point to  
you great men whom you can see for yourself, great men who have perfected  
themselves and acquired powers not shared by the common people. But if you  
think of them to be cheats or fraudulent men, any further talk would again be  
useless. **In your present state of limited understanding, the argument that  
denies the existence of anything beyond the range of human reason and  
comprehension itself betrays the limits of rationalism.**

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
You have come here to listen to me instead of going to a political meeting  
where you can hear interesting speeches. So I believe that few of you here are  
full-fledged rationalists. You may not therefore refuse to listen to me if I  
speak to you about why the Vedas should be preserved according to the time-  
honoured tradition. But it is also likely that even if some of you happen to  
be rationalists, you may still be willing to listen to me thinking that there  
may be some point in what the Svamiyar(swami-ravi) has to say.   
 **Some people are at a loss to understand why the sound of the Vedas is given  
so much importance. How does sound originate or how is it caused? Where there  
is vibration, where there is movement or motion, there is sound. This is  
strictly according to rational science**. Speech is constituted of vibrations  
of many kinds. We hear sounds with our ears. But these are sounds that are  
converted into electric waves and these we cannot hear. We know this from the  
working of the radio and the telephone. All that we hear or perceive others  
are indeed electric waves. Science has come to the point of recognizing all to  
be electric waves- the man who sees and listens, his brains, all are electric  
waves.   
There are countless numbers of inert objects in the world- land masses and  
mountains, rivers and oceans, and so on. Also there are sentient creatures of  
many kinds. All of them must have been created out of something. During  
creation this something must have vibrated in many different ways and given  
rise to all that we see today. If all movements are sound, there must have  
existed numerous different kinds of sound before creation. In this creation  
one is sustained by another. In the process of mutual sustenance, different  
movements and sounds must be produced. It is not necessary that vibrations  
should form a part only of gross activities. **Science has discovered that  
even our thinking process is a kind of electric current or energy. Each  
thought process is a form of electric current or energy and it must produce a  
vibration and a sound. This kind of sound being very subtle we do not hear it  
with our ears. Just as there are bacteria which we do not see with our naked  
eye, there are many sound that our ears do not pick up. According to science  
any physical or mental movement must produce a sound**.   
The idea that each movement produces its own sound may be put differently  
thus: to create a particular sound a particular movement must be produced.  
Take the case of vidvan singing. If you want to sing like him or creates  
birquas like him, you will have produce the same vibrations that he creates in  
his throat. **Sound and vibration(or motion) go together. The vibrations  
produce either a gross object or a mental state. We come to the conclusion  
that creation is a product of sound. This ancient concept is substantiated by  
science itself**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
Creation, the many things connected with it, thoughts and movements and the  
sound associated with them fill space. What happens to the sound produced by  
the clapping of our hands? It remains in space. Good as well as bad action  
produce their own sounds as well as movements associated with them.  
Conversely, the creation of these types of movements will result in good as  
well as evil. **To produce good thoughts in people, good movements must be  
created: the sounds corresponding to them must be produced**. If we can  
generate such sounds for the good of mankind, what can be more beneficial than  
such good thoughts? **The mantras of the Vedas are sounds that have the power  
to inspire good thoughts in people**.   
One more thing. We need food for our sustenance. And to grow food there must  
be rain. The formation of clouds and their precipitation are dependent on  
certain vibrations. Rainfall depends on the production of particular sounds  
which, in turn, create particular vibrations. The same applies to all our  
needs in life. It is true that unnecessary and evil objects are also produced  
by sound. But **the one and only goal of the sound of the Vedas is the  
creation of well-being throughout the world**.   
But are sound and vibrations spontaneously produced? If vibrations arise on  
their own they will be erratic and confusing and not related to one another.  
But what do we see in the cosmos? **There is a certain orderliness about it  
and one thing in it is linked to another. What do we infer form this? That a  
Great Intelligence has formulated this scheme that we see, that it has created  
it from its own vibrations**.   
 **The Vedas are sounds emanating from the vibrations of this Great  
Intelligence, the Great Gnosis. That is why we believe that the mantras of the  
Vedas originate from the Paramatman himself. We must take special care of such  
sounds too,as they ensure the good of the world. Yes, the Vedic mantras are  
sequences of sounds that are meant for the good of the world**.   
Doubts are expressed on this point. People argue: ' **We hear the mantras of  
the Vedas distinctly. But we do not hear the sounds in space, the sounds of  
creation. How can the two be the same?** '   
What exists in the cosmos in present in the individual being. The belief that  
the "microcosm" inherits the "macrocosm" is not in keeping with our  
commonsense view of things. But all people, including atheists, will agree  
that there are "instruments" in our body in the form of the senses that we can  
grasp what exists in the macrocosm. The sun in the macrocosm is felt by our  
body as heat. We perceive the flower in our garden through its scent. We  
savour the sweet taste of sugarcane with our tongue. With our eyes we learn  
that one object is red, that another it yellow.   
 **Unless the macrocosm and microcosm are constituted of the same substance  
the one will not be able to be aware of the other. Indeed the very conduct of  
life will not be possible otherwise. If we go one step further, the truth will  
dawn on us that it is not merely that the macrocosm and the microcosm are  
constituted of the same substance but that it is the same substance that  
becomes the macrocosm and the microcosm. The yogins know this truth directly  
from their experience**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
Whatever is present in space is also present in the individual being. These  
elements exists in the human body in a form that is accessible to the senses.  
The sounds a person makes in his throat have their source in space in a form  
not audible to us. The radio transforms electrical waves into sound waves. If  
a man can grasp the sounds in space and make them audible, he will be able to  
create with them what is needed for the good of the world. Yoga is the science  
that accomplishes such a task. Through   
yogic practice (perfection) one can become aware of what is in the macrocosm  
and draw it into the microcosm. I shall not be able to give you proof of this  
in a form acceptable to human reason. Yoga transcends our limited reason and  
understanding. **The purpose of the Vedas is to speak about matters that are  
beyond the comprehension of the human mind**.   
You must have faith in the words of great men or else, to know the truth of  
such matters, you must practise yoga strictly observing its rules. It may not  
be practicable for all those who ask questions or harbour doubts about the  
Vedas to practice yoga in this manner. Even if you are prepared to accept the  
words of a true yogin, how are you, in the first place, to be convinced that  
he in indeed a true yogin and not a fraud? Altogether it means that you must  
have faith in someone, in something. Later such   
faith will be strengthened from your own observations, inference and  
experience. There is no point in speaking to people who have either no faith  
or refuse to develop it through their own experience.   
There is a state in which the macrocosm and the microcosm are perceived as  
one. Great men there who have reached such a state and are capable of  
transforming what is subtle in the one into what is gross in the other. I am  
speaking here to those who believe in such a possibility.   
When we look at this universe and their complex manner in which it functions,  
we realise that there must be a Great Wisdom that has created it and sustains  
it. It is from this Great Wisdom, that is the Paramatman, that all that we see  
are born and it is from It that all the sounds that we hear have emanated.  
**First came the universe of sound and then the universe that we observe. Most  
of the former still exists in space. The space that exists outside us exists  
also in our heart**. **The yogins have experience of this hrdayakasa, this  
heart-sky or this heart-space, when they are in samadhi (absorbed in the  
Infinite). In this state of theirs all differences between the outward and the  
inward vanish and the two become one. The yogins can now grasp the sounds of  
space and bestow the same on mankind. These successions of sounds that bring  
benefits to the world are indeed the mantras of the Vedas**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
These mantras are not the creation of anyone. Though each of them is in the  
name of a rsi or seer, in reality it is not his creation. When we say that a  
certain mantra has a certain sage associated with it, all that we mean is that  
it was he who first "saw" it existing without a beginning in space and  
revealed it to the world. The very word "rsi" means "mantra-drasta" (one who  
saw- discovered- the mantra), not "mantra-karta" (one who created the mantra).  
Our life is dependent on how our breathing functions. In the same way the  
cosmos functions in accordance with the vibrations of the Vedic sounds- so the  
Vedic mantras are the very breath of the Supreme Being. We must thus conclude  
that, without the Vedas, there is no Brahman: To put it differently, the Vedas  
are self-existent like the Paramatman.   
 **The mantras of the Vedas are remarkable in that they bring blessings to the  
world in the form of sound- even if their meaning is not understood. Of  
course, they are pregnant with meaning and represent the lofty principle that  
it is the One Truth that is manifested as all that we perceive**. They also  
confer blessing on us by taking the form of deities appropriate to the  
different sounds (of the mantras). Sound does not bring any benefits, any  
fruits, by itself. **Isvara alone is the bestower of benefits. However,  
instead of making the fruits available to us directly, he appoints deities to  
distribute them in the same manner as the king or president of a country  
appoints officials to carry out his dictates. The mantras represent various  
deities in the form of sound. If we attain perfection (siddhi) by constant  
chanting and meditation of a   
mantra, it should be possible for us to see the deity invoked in his physical  
form. The deities also arise if we make offerings into the sacrificial fire  
reciting specific mantras**. If a sacrifice is conducted in this manner, the  
deities give us their special blessings. **We do not pay taxes directly to the  
king or president. In the same way, we pay taxes in the form of sacrifices and  
Vedic chanting to the aides of the Paramatman for the sake of the welfare of  
the world. The sounds of the mantras constitute their form**.   
 **The sound of some mantras have greater value than their meaning. Their  
syllables chanted in a particular manner create a special energy, but their  
meaning has no special significance**. Take the mantra recited to cure a man  
stung by a scorpion. The words, the syllables, constituting the mantra have no  
special meaning. Indeed, they say, the meaning is not to be told. But by  
chanting the mantra, the vibrations are caused in space and one stung by a  
scorpion will be cured: the potency of the syllables of the mantra is such.  
The efficacy of sounds varies with the difference mantras. Evil is caused by  
reciting certain mantras or formulae: this is called "abhicara"[understood as  
the black magic in the West]. In all this the clarity with which the syllables  
are enunciated is important. There was the practice of knocking off the teeth  
of those who practiced billi sunyam (a form of black magic). The black  
magician, if toothless, will not be able to articulate the mantras properly  
and so his spells will not have the intended effect. If the syllables of the  
spell are not clearly and properly enunciated, they will not give us the  
desired benefit. **If we appreciate the fact that sounds have such power, the  
question of the language of the mantras loses it importance. It would be  
meaningless then to demand that the mantras must be expressed in some other  
language [that we understand]. It would be equally meaningless to wonder  
whether the mantras of the sraddha ceremony should be rendered into English,  
Tamil or some other language so that our departed parents would understand  
them better**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
 **The question that now occurs is- why there should be a separate caste  
committed to Vedic learning practices, even if it is conceded that Vedic  
mantras have the power to do good?**   
 **In answering this question we must first remember that the Vedas are not to  
be read from the written text. They have to be memorized by constant listening  
and repeated chanting. The learner then becomes a teacher himself and in this  
manner the process goes on from generation to generation. Maintaining such a  
tradition of learning and teaching is a whole-time occupation. Neither the  
teacher nor the taught may take up any other work**.   
We must also remember that the Brahmin is expected to master subjects other  
than the Vedas also, like the arts and crafts and the various  
sciences(sastras). He has in fact to learn the vocations of other jatis (but  
he must not take up any for his own livelihood). **It is the responsibility of  
the Brahmin to promote knowledge and culture. He is expected to learn the  
hereditary skills of all jatis, including the art of warfare, and pass on  
these skills to the respective jatis to help them earn their livelihood. The  
Brahmin 's calling is adhyayana and adhyapana (learning and teaching the  
Vedas). According to the sastras he must live in a modest dwelling, observe  
strict rules and vows so as to gain mastery of the mantras. He must eat only  
as much as is needed keep body and soul together. All temptations to make  
money and enjoy sensual pleasures he must sternly resist. All his actions must  
be inspired by the spirit of sacrifice and he must pass his days sustaining  
the Vedic tradition and practices for the good of mankind**.   
It is the duty of other jatis to see that the Brahmin does not die of  
starvation. They must provide him with bare necessities of life and such  
materials as re needed for the performance of sacrifices. Wages are paid to  
those who do other jobs or a price is paid for what they produce. The Brahmin  
works for the whole community and serves it by chanting mantras, by performing  
sacrifices and by leading a life according to the dictates of religion. That  
is why he must be provided with his upkeep. **The canonical texts do not say  
that we must build him palace or that he must be given gifts of gold. The  
Brahmin must be provided with the wherewithal for the proper performance of  
sacrifices. In his personal life he must eschew all show and luxury. It is by  
taming his senses- by burning away all desire- that he gains mastery over the  
mantras**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
I have said more than once that the **Vedas are to be learned by constant  
listening, that they are not to be learned from the written text**. Let me  
tell you why.   
**The sound of the Vedas must pervade the world. This is of paramount  
importance, not that the text itself should be maintained in print. Indeed,  
the Vedas must not be kept in book form. If the printed text is available all  
the time, we are likely to neglect the habit of memorizing the hymns and  
chanting them. There is not the slightest doubt about this. "After all it is  
in the book. When the need arises we can always refer to it. Why should we  
waste our time in memorizing the mantras? ?   
Thus an attitude of indifference will develop among those charged with the  
duty of maintaining the Vedic tradition**.   
Nowadays we have what is called the "pancanngaran" (pancangakkaran), that is  
the "almanac-man". We understand his job to be that of officiating at the  
rites performed by members of the fourth varna. But from the term  
"almanac"-man" we know that this is not his main duty. The pancangakkaran or  
almanac-man is truly one who determines the five angas or components of the  
almanac. Each day has five angas: tithi, vara, naksatra, yoga and karana. To  
find out whether a particular day is auspicious or whether certain work or  
function may be performed on a particular day, all these five factors have to  
be taken into account. Today astronomers in Greenwich observe the sun, the  
moon and the stars to fix the timings of sunrise and sunset. **Three or four  
generations ago, every village had an almanac-man who was an expert in such  
matters. He could predict eclipses, their exact timings, with the precision of  
present-day astronomers. He inscribed the five angas relating to the day on a  
palmleaf   
and took it round from house to house to help people in their worldly and  
religious duties. In the past he had also another name "Kuttai Cuvadi"(meaning  
"Shortened Palm-leaf").**   
 **How have the present day almanac-men forgotten their great science? With  
the advent of the printing press the almanac could be printed for a whole year  
and made available to people. There was no longer any need for the old, type  
of almanac to pancanga, an important part of astronomy, is now on the verge of  
extinction.   
The Vedas would have suffered a similar fate had we stuck to a system of  
learning them from written or printed texts. Their sound would not have then  
filled the world and created all-round well-being**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
Our forefathers realised that to put anything in writing was not the best way  
of preserving it since it bred indifference to the subject so preserved. **One  
who recited the Vedas from the written text ( "likhita-pathaka") was looked  
down upon as an "adhama" (one belonging to the lowest order among those  
chanting the Vedas)**.   
**In Tamil the Vedas are known as the "unwritten old text"(ezhutakilavi). In  
Sanskrit the Vedas are also called "Sruti", which means "that which is heard",  
that is to say not be learned from any written text. Since listening to the  
Vedas as they were chanted and then memorizing them was the practice,  
preserving the Vedic tradition came to be full-time vocation. The teacher  
taught pada by pada(foot by foot) and the student repeated each pada twice. In  
this way the sound of the Vedas filled the whole place. It was thus that the  
study of our own scripture, with all its recessions which are like the expanse  
of a great ocean, was maintained in the oral tradition until the turn of the  
century. This treasure, this timeless crop that sustains our inner beings, has  
come to us through the ages as ordained by the Lord. There can be no greater  
sin that that of neglecting this treasure and allowing it to perish**.   
If the Vedic tradition becomes extinct there is no need for a separate caste  
called Brahmins. Nowadays the cry is often heard, "Brahmin, get out". But do  
we hear cries like, "Potter, get out" or "Washerman, go away?? If the potter  
and the washerman leave the village they will be brought back by force and  
retained. Why so? Because the community needs their services.   
So long as the Brahmin possessed sattva-guna (the quality of goodness and  
purity) and so long as he kept the Vedic tradition going and lived a simple  
life, others recognized his value for society. They regarded him with  
affection and respect and paced their trust in him. They realised that if  
society was not afflicted by famine and disease (as in the case today), it was  
because the sound of the Vedas pervaded everywhere and the performance of  
Vedic recites created a healthy atmosphere around and brought its own  
blessings.   
 **This was not the only way in which the Brahmin served society. His personal  
example was itself a source of inspiration to people. They saw how he curbed  
his sensual appetites, how he lived a life of peace, how he was compassionate  
to all creatures, how he mediated on the Lord, how he performed a variety of  
rites strictly adhering to sastric rules and without any expectations of  
rewards. They saw a whole case living a life of selflessness and sacrifice**.  
Naturally, they too were drawn to the qualities exemplified by its members.  
They emulated their example, observed fasts and vows to the extent permitted  
by the nature of their occupations.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
It is preposterous to accuse the Brahmin of having kept other jatis  
suppressed. There is a special way of life that the scriptures have prescribed  
for him and in remaining true to it he becomes a personal example for others  
desirous of raising themselves. It is equally preposterous to suggest that  
other where kept down because they were denied the right to learn the Vedas. I  
have already spoken to you that preserving the Vedic tradition is a hereditary  
and lifelong vocation. **Any calling must be pursued on a hereditary basis.  
Otherwise, there is the risk of society being torn asunder by jealousies and  
rivalries**.   
The maintenance of the Vedic tradition is a calling by itself. There will be  
confusion and chaos in the system of division of labour if people whose  
vocations are different are allowed to pursue one common tradition. Also, as a  
consequence, will not the social structure be disturbed? **Every vocation has  
as high a place on the social scale as any other. Why should anyone nurse the  
ideas that the pursuit of the Vedic dharma belongs to a plane higher than all  
other types of work?**   
 **Some castes are not permitted to learn the Vedas but there is no bar on  
their learning the truths contained in them. This is all that is needed for  
their Atmic advancement**. We need only one class of people charged with the  
mission of keeping the sound of the Vedas alive in the world. The ideas  
contained in them for spiritual uplift are open to all. The songs of non-  
Brahmin saints like Appar and Nammazhvar are replete with Vedic and Vedantic  
thoughts. **Were it true that Brahmins had monopolised Atmic knowledge and  
devotion and kept others downtrodden, how would you explain the rise among the  
non-Brahmin jatis of so many great saints, not only the examples just  
mentioned above, Appar and Nammazhvar, but a number of other Nayanmars and  
Azhvars? The Nayanmars included men belonging even to jatis regarded as "low".  
Where do you find men of inner enlightenment like Tayumanavar and  
Pattiinattar? **Apart from the fact that there were among non-Brahmin men  
worthy of being lauded by Brahmins for enlightenment and devotion, there were  
individuals from the fourth varna who established empires and gave new life  
and vigour to the Vedic dharma. **That Brahmins exploited other castes is a  
recently invented myth**.   
I do not claim that Brahmins are free from faults or are not guilty of lapses.  
Nobody is free from faults. But on the whole the Brahmin has done good to  
society and has been a guide to all its members. That is why he was enabled to  
live with dignity all these centuries. When other communities now see that the  
Brahmin no longer serves   
society in any manner, they raise the cry, "Brahmin, get out". If they do not  
serve society and if all they do is to join others in the scramble for money,  
where is the need for a separate caste called Brahmins? **It occurs to me  
that, if the caste called Brahmins serves no purpose to society, I shall be  
the first to seek its destruction. Nothing has any right to exist if it has no  
utility value. There is no need for a caste called Brahmin if the world does  
not stand to benefit from it**.   
Now there are "toll-gates" located in many places but often without any  
"gate". In the past a toll used to be collected from people crossing the  
boundary marked by these "gates". Later such a system was discontinued and no  
purpose was served by the gate. Nothing exists without a purpose. Now, if the  
Brahmin without Vedic learning has become as purposeless as the toll-gate  
without any toll actually charged, with what reason or justice can we say that  
he must not be thrown out?   
 **The Brahmin today deserves to be reproved, if he expects to be treated with  
any special respect. Criticism, however, should be it. The Brahmin must be  
faulted for abandoning his dharma, but the dharma itself, the Vedic dharma, is  
another matter. It is not proper to find fault with the dharma itself and it  
is the duty of others to help the Brahmin practice it. the Vedic dharma must  
be sustained so as to ensure the well-being of the world**. Other jatis must  
support the principle that there must be a caste whose hereditary calling it  
is to maintain the Vedic tradition. If they themselves have lost faith in the  
Vedic dharma, they cannot find fault with the Brahmin for having forsaken it.  
**If they believe that the Vedic dharma is not wanted, then it would mean  
(according to their own logic) that the Brahmin is not committing any offence  
by giving up his hereditary vocation. It also follows that for the sake of his  
livelihood he will have too take up some other job, competing with the others  
for the same**. So to hold that there is no need for the Vedic dharma and  
that, at the same time, the Brahmin should not do any work other than the  
pursuit of that dharma does not stand to reason. On the other hand, it is  
proclaimed that the Vedic dharma is all wrong and must cease to exist but, on  
the other, the man whose duty it is to practice that dharma is hated for  
trying to do some other work. Is this just? **It is part of humanity to see  
that not even a dog or a jackal goes hungry and it is a dharma common to all  
religions**.Even those who maintain that we do not need any religion, talk of  
compassion and the spirit of sacrifice in all our actions. So it is not just  
to insist that a man must not pursue his hereditary vocation and that he must  
not, at the same time, do any other work but die of starvation.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
Others can help greatly by making the Brahmin true to himself as the upholder  
of the Vedic dharma. I have heard it said that in the old days some Brahmins  
would go to the untouchable quarter and tell people there: "You and we, let us  
become one.? Whereupon the untouchables would reply: "No. no. You keep doing  
your work. That is for the good of both of us. Don't come here again". They  
would prevent the Brahmins from approaching them again by breaking their pots  
in front of them, the pots which were their only asset. Though people then  
were divided in the matter of work and did not mix together, they had  
affection for one another and believed that each did his work for the common  
good.   
Even today the common people are not non-believers, nor have they lost faith  
in the Vedas. I feel that they will continue too have respect for the Vedic  
dharma and that the propaganda of hate [against Brahmins and the Vedas] is all  
to be attributed to political reasons. People, I repeat, do have faith in the  
Vedas, in Vedic rites and customs and if the Brahmin becomes a little better  
[that is by being true to his vocation] all hatred will vanish.   
As I said before, **instead of expecting respect from others, he must remain  
true to his dharma even at the risk of his life. It is my belief that society  
will not allow him to suffer such an extreme fate. But my stand is that, even  
if it does, he must not forsake his dharma. Whatever the attitude of others,  
whether they help him or whether they run him down, the Brahmin must uphold  
the Vedic tradition for the well-being of all**.   
 _What I have spoken for the Brahmin community applies in principle to other  
also. The duties about which I have to speak to them (non- Brahmins) are many.  
They too are eager to know about them and I am confident that, things are  
properly explained, they will pursue faithfully their respective dharma_ s.  
**I must, however, be qualified to give them advice**. It is generally  
believed that I have a special relationship with the Brahmin community. In the  
Matha a number of Vedic rites are performed. So, rightly or wrongly, the  
impression has gained around that I have much to do with the case whose duty  
it is to uphold the Vedic dharma. That being the case, a question will arise  
in the minds of people belonging to other communities if I speak to them on  
matters of dharma, even if it is assumed that they will listen to me with  
affection and respect.   
 **The question is this: "Brahmins are so much dependent on his support. Yet  
we don't see them acting on his advice and correcting themselves. So why  
should he come to speak to us of our duties? **"   
 **As a matter of fact, both are same to me, Brahmins and non-Brahmins**. I am  
indeed more dissatisfied with Brahmins than with the others because they have  
abandoned the Vedic dharma, the dharma that confers the highest inner well-  
being on all. Even so, since it is believed that Brahmins are specially  
attached to me, I keep admonishing them to go back to the Vedic dharma with  
all their hearth, with all their strength. **If Brahmins observe in practice a  
fraction of what is expected of them, then alone   
shall I be qualified to remind other communities of their duties. Brahmins  
must try as best they can to keep up the Vedic tradition. That is how they  
will help me to speak to other communities of their duties**.   
All mankind, all creatures of earth, must live in happiness. Everybody must  
practise his allotted dharma for the good of all with the realisation that  
there is no question of any work being "higher" than any other or "lower".  
**Preserving the sound of the Vedas must remain the duty of one class so as to  
ensure plenty in this world as well as to create universal Atmic uplift**. To  
revert to the question I put to you first. Leaving aside the vocation of the  
Vedic dharma, let us assume that the hereditary system is beneficial in  
respect of all types of work. **But why should the preservation of the Vedic  
dharma be the lifelong vocation of one class? It is now established, as I  
conclude, that however it may be with the other vocations, whether or not they  
exist, whether or not there is a mix-up in them, the pursuit of the Vedic  
dharma must remain a separate calling.**

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
I could live in solitude in some village somewhere, performing puja and  
meditating. For the conduct of the Matha it is not at all necessary to have so  
much money as I receive from people in the cities. In my opinion the mathas  
ought to have only the minimum of strength in terms of money and men. **A  
large entourage and a battalion of hangers-on are not essential to their  
maintenance. A matha 's financial support and strength are nothing but the  
quality of the individual presiding over it**.   
 **If I leave my life of solitude and come to the city it is not because you  
give me a lot of money. You have great affection and devotion for me and you  
are so glad that I am present here at your request**. You wanted me to come  
here and you are happy that I am in your midst. This is your business. **But I  
have my own business, my own work, in coming to this city. What is it?**   
I have come with the hope of making some arrangement according to which  
Brahmins will not give up the Vedic dharma and will continue to practise it  
without a break. The purpose of my being here is to ask to prepare a scheme  
for the promotion of the Vedic dharma which is the source and root of all our  
systems of thought and ways of life; the scheme must ensure that the dharma  
does not become extinct in this generation itself. The Vedas which know no  
origin should be kept shining for ever their original authentic form. The  
Brahmin must be a servant who will keep holding up this light, this torch, to  
illumine all the world. This is a duty he cannot but perform not only for  
today but for the generations to come.   
 **" Brahmanya" or Brahminhood did not come into being for Brahmins to lord it  
over others or for their own individual advancement. Its purpose is that the  
Brahmin should serve as a peon to hold up the Vedic lamp and show the path of  
Vedic dharma to mankind. If I come to the cities it is to urge the Brahmin  
community there not to extinguish this lamp, for to put out this light would  
be to plunge the whole world in darkness for all time**.   
 _In the towns and cities people come to listen to me in their thousands. So I  
am able to talk directly to a large number of people. It is with this idea in  
mind that I come to the big towns though it means some detriment to the  
observance of the rites associated with the Matha_.   
You spend a lot of money on constructing pandals in locality after locality  
for people to gather and listen to me. You come to hear my discourses in the  
midst of all your problems. However, my conscience does not permit me to give  
an entertaining talk without speaking to you about what is wrong with your way  
of life and perhaps causing you hurt thereby. It would serve you no purpose if  
I take all your money but fail to tell you about what is good for you and the  
world. That is why I keep asking you   
again and again to protect the Vedic tradition and to practise the ancient  
dharmas. **Whether or not I will succeed, I have come here to urge you again  
and again to do it**.   
You honour me with a "shower" of gold coins and celebrate with much pomp the  
day of my installation on the Pitha. You do so because of your great affection  
for me. You appoint committees, collect money and toil day and night for the  
purpose. But how are we to be sure that the acaryas who will succeed to the  
Pitha in the future will also be similarly honoured? **If the Vedic dharma  
becomes extinct why should there be a matha at all or a mathadhipati ( head of  
the matha)**? So I tell you: "I see that you are so enthusiastic about  
honouring me with a shower of gold coins to celebrate the day of my ascending  
the Pitha. **Why don 't you have the same enthusiasm to work for the  
preservation of the Vedic dharma**? Why don't you appoint committees for the  
purpose, draw up schemes, raise funds?   
 **It does not matter if you are unable to create conditions in which Brahmins  
henceforth will make the pursuit of the Vedic dharma their lifelong vocation.  
All I ask you is the minimum you can do, make arrangements to impart to your  
children the Vedic mantras, to teach them to recite the scripture for at least  
one hour a day from the time they are eight years old until they are eighteen.  
Teach them also the prayoga (the conduct of rites). Do this on a cooperative  
basis in each locality. If you succeed in this you will have truly honoured me  
with a shower of gold coins.**

Nothing is achieved without effort. If we take up some work for own sake we  
are ready to suffer any amount of hardship. There is a university in a distant  
land and you are told that if you take a degree from it you will get a very  
attractive job. What do you then? You get the syllabus from that institution  
by post at once, manage to go and study there. **Must we abandon our dharma on  
the plea that its pursuit involves a great deal of trouble? If there is  
trouble it means the benefits yielded will be   
proportionately greater- also it should be a matter of greater pride**.   
I have come to give you trouble in this fashion. I wonder why I should not  
stay here and keep giving you trouble until you agree to complete the  
arrangements to carry out my suggestion. After all, I have to stay somewhere,  
so why not here? It gives me joy that more and more bhajans are conducted in  
the towns than before, that work connected with temples is on the increase and  
that puranic discourses are given more often than before. But we must remember  
that the Vedas constitute the basis of all these. If our scripture suffers a  
decline, how long will the activities based on its survive? The Vedas must be  
handed down from father to son, from generation to the next. It is because we  
have forgotten this tradition that our religion itself has become shaky. **All  
the trouble in the world, all the suffering and all the evil must be  
attributed to the fact that the Brahmin has forsaken his dharma, the Vedic  
dharma.** **I am not worried about the system of jatis destroyed, but I am  
worried about the setback to the welfare of mankind. I am also extremely  
concerned about the fact that, if the Vedic tradition which has been  
maintained like a chain from generation to generation is broken, it may not be  
possible to create the tradition all over again**.   
The good arising in a subtle form, the sound of the Vedas and the performance  
of sacrifices is not the only benefit that constitutes "lokakshema" or the  
welfare of mankind. From Vedanta are derived lofty truths that can bring Atmic  
uplift to people belonging to all countries. **How did foreigners come to have  
an interest in our Vedanta? When they came to India they discovered here a  
class of people engaged in the practice of the Vedic dharma as a lifetime  
calling. They were curious to find out in what way the Vedas were great that  
an entire class of people should have dedicated themselves to them all their  
life. They conducted research into these scriptures and discovered many truths  
including those pointing to the unity of the various cultures of the world**.   
 **The Vedas bring universal good. This is not all. In the beginning, in my  
opinion, the Vedic culture was prevalent throughout the world**. Others also,  
it is likely, will arrive at the same view on a thorough inquiry into the  
subject. **The fact that there is something common to all mankind should be a  
source of universal happiness and it should also contribute to a sense of  
harmony among the various religions**.

Dear Ravi,   
Nice discourse by Sri Kanchi Mahaswami on the Vedas. I have only one doubt,  
not in this connection. He has said that when   
animal sacrifices were done in the Yagnas, the brahmin priests used to take a  
bit of roasted animal flesh, to the size of a   
moong dhal. Is it a correct information? In another place, it is said (not  
by Him) that they used to make a paste of moong   
dhal as in the case of making vadas, and they will place it in the Yagna fire  
and then eat it.

## Re:[90] The Vedas  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: August 08, 2014, 07:22:34 AM  
---  
**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas-The upangas** continued...   
 **Mimamsa and Adi Sankara**   
Buddhism on the one hand, Nyaya and Mimamsa on the other which were opposed to  
it, and Sankhya which does not accept Isvara but respects the pramanas of the  
Vedas: of these our Acarya accepts elements that are to be accepted and  
rejects elements that are to be rejected. He establishes the Vedantic system  
which harbours all these and which is their source. Sankara's view is not at  
variance with the ultimate message of Buddhism, that is the exalted state of  
jnana. He accepts some of the basic concepts of Sankhya like Purusa that is  
jnana by itself and equivalent to the Nirguna-Brahman and Prakrti which is the  
same as Maya. At the same time, he accepts the Vedic rituals of Mimamsa and  
the Isvara of Nyaya. But he sees each of them as an aspect of the one Truth,  
not as the final goal which it is to the various individual systems mentioned.  
He integrates these different aspects into a harmonious whole in his own  
system of thought.   
As we have already seen, Udayana and other supporters of the Nyaya system  
criticized Buddhism on the score that it was silent on the question of God,  
while mimamsakas like Kumarilabhatta attacked the same because it did not  
favour Vedic rituals. The acarya was in sympathy with these views and believed  
that Vedic sacraments, considered all-important by the mimamsakas were  
essential to the cleansing of the mind and to the proper conduct of the  
affairs of the community. However, he was opposed to the mimamsakas not only  
because they did not accept an entity like Isvara as the dispenser of the  
fruits of our actions but also because they did not believe that, after being  
rendered pure by works, there is any need for one to go further and take the  
path of jnana. He also did not agree with their view that to become a sanyasin  
giving up all karma is not right.   
Kumarilabhatta and Mandanamisra are particularly important among the  
mimamsakas. The Acarya had a debate with Kumarilabhatta during the last days  
of that mimamsaka and won him over to his viewpoint. Similarly, Mandanamisra  
also became a convert to Advaita Vedanta and came to be one of the Acarya's  
chief disciples assuming the title of Suresvaracarya.   
 **If the Acarya opposed Mimamsa, which is one of the fourteen branches of  
Vedic lore, it was not because he thought it to be wholly unacceptable. He was  
in agreement with the sacraments dealt with in that system, but he differed  
from it on the question of devotion to the Lord. He further believed that the  
fruits yielded by the rites, rewards like paradise, must be dedicated to  
Isvara and that in this very act of renunciation the mind is purified**.  
Sankara's teaching is this: it is only if we realise that Isvara is the Phala-  
data, the one who awards the fruits of our actions, that we will not be  
tempted by petty rewards like paradise. Only then will we be inspired to go  
beyond to attain the higher reward of inner purity. **The Vedic works were  
wholly acceptable to our Acarya. But for the mimamsakas they were an end in  
themselves; they did not transcend them to become devoted to the Supreme  
Godhead and to acquire jnana, the final realisation that Isvara and we are one  
and the same. Sankara criticised mimamsakas for their failure to understand  
this truth**. **That he did not oppose Vedic karma is proved again by the fact  
that in his upadesa (teaching) -it is called Sopana-Panchaka- before giving up  
his body he made the admonishment that the Vedas must be chanted every day and  
that the rites mentioned in them must be performed**.   
 **Vedo nityam adhiyatam   
Taduditam karma svanushtiyatham**   
The Acarya, however, taught us not to stop with karma (performed for the sake  
of karma), but to go beyond it. The rites that we conduct must be made an  
offering to Isvara. This is a means of obtaining inner purity and also that of  
receiving instruction in jnana. That is the time when we must give up all  
karma to meditate upon the teaching we have received, indeed meditate on it  
with intensity and make it our inner experiential reality. **Sankara takes us,  
step by step, in this way to final release. He opposed the mimamsakas because  
they failed to understand the purpose of Vedic karma and refused to go beyond  
it.**   
continued....

Namaste Jewell and Vinodji: Yes, it will be nice to have more trees on the left side of the road and  
regular trimming of the ones on the right.   
I can't say that about dogs. Much as I love them, their barking (all night  
long) disturbs me.   
Tiruvannamalai is very noisy and some of the noise is from TV sets. If you  
live in Ramana Nagar you know what I mean.   
Early morning when the rest of us are just waking up, doing sun salutation,  
meditating or generally enjoying the quiet and beauty of Arunachala, TV sets  
will be turned on full blast to some Guru talking in some Indian language. So  
if you have two or three neighbours, there are two or three TV sets that are  
blasting out the same damn talk.   
I have promised myself that I will never donate to this guru who used to come  
to Tiruvannamalai regularly and cannot any more. Arunachala kept him away. HA!  
HA! The lesson for him was that if you are guru, you are responsible for how  
your disciples/ devotees behave _(or in this case misbehave and disturb the  
peace of their neighbours)._   
So, yes, I would recommend that there be no TV sets, radios or loudspeakers  
allowed within the city of Tiruvannamalai just as it is banned in Tirupati and  
Vaishno Devi.   
Frankly, in my opinion, if you live in Tiruvannamalai and feel the need for a  
TV, then you are not ready for Arunachala. That is a dead giveaway. YOU ARE  
JUST NOT READY FOR ARUNACHALA. "We have the money", "we are spending our  
retirement years here" or any such excuse is not acceptable. Find another  
place to pollute.   
Also, there are some people who talk very loudly and disturb the peace and  
then there are some who are so peaceful. When I asked my maid servant why  
that is so in Tiruvannamalai, she replied: "Those people (not her community)  
eat a lot of salt and chillies. It makes them very agitated."   
Maybe community leaders or the local media can increase public awareness about  
this. People on the spiritual path should eat sattvic food without a lot of  
salt and chillies. If you love your salt and chillies or pizzas for that  
matter, then find some place else to live until your vasanas let go of you.   
Vinodji, I agree about the building of houses but that I am sure will come in  
time as the government, the Arunachaleswarar temple and Ramana Ashram play a  
greater role in the development of Tiruvannamalai.   
Come, let us pray that Arunachala blesses them with making the right decisions  
and they have the money, technology and will power to quieten and beautify  
Tiruvannamalai quickly. I have faith it will happen. The government has  
managed to enforce order in Tirupati and Vaishno Devi, I am sure it is capable  
of doing it in Tiruvannamalai as well.

Namaste dear Child of Arunachala and dear Vinod!   
Indeed,all You both mentioned should be done. I am for that,that in all places  
around the world should be preserved nature and animal life. I prefer when it  
is untouched and wild nature more,than buildings,houses and traffics.  
Somehow,we spoil everything we come in touch with.   
So also about Tiru and Arunachala,such Holy place,Lord Shiva Himself,Reality  
itself.   
I also love dogs,animals of all kinds and nature. By respecting this beautiful  
place,we get respect from it too. Not to mention enjoyment of walking  
beautiful green paths,with birds singing and heartbreaking site to watch.   
I never have been to Tiru,but i truly hope i will come one day in one peaceful  
and serene town.   
Regarding pictures,i find them all by chance. For this one i tiped "burning  
candle animated gif".   
I also found one excellent community site with lots of rare  
photographies,named "pinterest".   
With love and prayers,

Dear Vinod,   
There is nothing wrong. All names and forms are in Arunachala which is  
Paramaatman (the Self.). The Self is the same   
only names and forms are different. I know one person who always says Tirupati  
Muruga, Tirupati Muruga! Are   
Sri Venkateswara and Muruga different? (The reason however, was that it is  
believed that Tirupati Lord is Muruga   
only.)   
Further the term Arunachala is all inclusive. The Arunachala Mahatmyam says  
chanting Arunachala once is equivalent to chanting   
a ten million times the Panchaksharam, Namasivaya.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear Vinod,   
Remembering Arunachala even once paves the way for liberation. in this very  
life as written by Sadhu OM in his Arunachala Venba.   
For some reason, the Supreme Brahman has taken the form of this hill and can  
be remembered by his form or by incantation of his name.   
So if we can remember Arunachala alll the time, by incantation of his name  
what more is needed to be aspired for.   
Regards,   
Anand.

_After receiving instruction from His teacher, Rama said that He would  
renounce the world. Dasaratha sent the sage Vasishtha to Rama to dissuade Him.  
Vasishtha found Him filled with intense renunciation. He said to Rama: 'First  
of all, reason with me, Rama; then You may leave the world. May I ask You if  
this world is outside God? If that is so, then You may give it up.' Rama found  
that it is God alone who has become the universe and all its living beings.

He would go into an ecstasy of joy over a rain-storm. He would get very angry  
if, anyone went near him when he meditated. One day I came to him while he  
was meditating, and that made him very cross. He discriminated constantly,  
'Brahman alone is real and the world is illusory.' Since the appearance of  
diversity is due to maya, he walked about with a prism from a chandelier in  
his hand. One sees different colours through the prism; in reality there is  
no such thing as colour. Likewise, nothing exists, in reality, except  
Brahman. But there is an appearance of the manifold because of maya, egoism.  
He would not look at an object more than once, lest he should be deluded by  
maya and attachment. He would discriminate, while taking his bath, at the  
sight of birds flying in the. sky. He knew grammar. He stayed here for  
three days. One day he heard the sound of a flute near the embankment and

MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day  
the farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his  
son was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he  
found the boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry.  
Sadly the wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he  
hasn't even one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and  
the father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as  
virtuous. They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the  
various arts. Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should  
weep for those seven children or this one boy.' To the jnanis the waking state  
is no more real than the dream state.

There is one world with family   
There is one world with spouse, mother father, parents, children each child,  
friends, each friends, etc., and each close one separately

There is another world where we derive peace   
There is another world of spirituality   
There is another world of our Guru and his life world   
There is this forum world   
There is our own world of various worlds of sadhanas - self enquiry, Bhakti,

only!

Stray thoughts...   
The greatest test of discipline is   
being true to oneself!   
If this is passed everything passes,   
if this fails everything else fails!

Tis, but I cannot name it, 'tis the sense   
Of majesty, and beauty, and repose,   
A blended holiness of earth and sky,   
Something that makes this individual spot,   
This small abiding-place of many men,   
A termination, and a last retreat,   
A centre, come from whereso'er you will,   
A whole without dependence or defect,   
Made for itself, and happy in itself,   
Perfect contentment, Unity entire.   
~ William Wordsworth

This is also from inimitable Poet KaaLamegam. He speaks of Thiruthuruthi  
Siva, and also makes the word snake to be used,   
for different purposes: காலையிலும்1 வேலை கடையக் கயிறாகும்2   
மாலையிலும் பூ முடித்து வாழுமே3 - சோலை செறி   
செய்யிலாரம் பயிலும்4 செந்துருத்தி மா நகர் வாழ்   
பொய்யிலா மெய்யரிடும் பூண்.5   
kaalaiyilum - kaal + ayilum, the snake will consume air.   
vElaik kataiya kayirRaakum = it serves the purpose of churning the milky ocean  
as a coir.   
maal ayilum poo mutithu = Maha Vishnu swallowed the entire world and such a  
world is borne by the serpent -   
as per puraanas, the world is borne by the snake Aadi Sesha.   
seyyil aaram payilum = in the groves of Thiruth thuruthi, in the groves, where  
pearls are growing in the sugar canes.   
aaram = pearls.   
poyyilaa meyyareitum pooN = the True God Siva wears it as an ornament.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is by Poet KaaLamegam. The verse is called katai mozhi  
maaRRu, that is, the last word of the verse   
is to be taken as the first word of the verse and the meaning understood: மாடு தின்பான் பார்ப்பான் மறையோதுவான் குயவன்   
கூடிமிக மண் பிசைவான் கொல்லனே \- தேடி   
இரும்படிப்பான் தான் செக்கான் எண்ணைய் விற்பான் வண்ணான்   
பரும் புடவை தப்பும் பறை.   
Here the word PaRai - the last word of the verse, should be taken first and  
then meaning understood.   
paRai = the low caste people, will consume the flesh of cows and bulls.   
paarppan = the brahmin will chant Vedas.   
kuyavan = the potter will take the clay and make pots.   
kollan = the blacksmith, will hit the iron rods and make iron utensils.   
sekkaan = the oil monger, will sell oils.   
vannaan = the washerman will hit the clothes on the stone slab and make it  
neat.   
Arunachala Siva.,

The following verse is also from Poet KaaLamegam. Here again, the words must  
be re-set to understand the meaning correctly: கொன்றை மலர் தரித்தான் கோபாலன் கோல் எடுத்து   
நின்று குழல் ஊதினான் நீள் சடையோன் \- பொன் திகழும்   
அக்கணிந்தான் மாயன் அரவணையில் கண் வளர்ந்தான்   
சிக்கலிலே வாழும் சிவன்.   
Siva, who stays in a town called Sikkal (near Nagapattinam in Tamizh Nadu),  
the God with long matted locks, is wearing   
konRai flowers. Gopalan, Maha Vishnu took the flute and played it to charm  
all the cows and also the gopikas.   
Again Siva in His chest wore the garland of bones or rudraksha. Mayan, again  
Mahavishnu slept in Yoga Nidra,   
on the bed of serpent (Aadi Seshan).   
Arunachala Siva.

maaRRu, that is, words should be re-set   
to understand the meaning correctly: ஆயனுக்கு கண் மூன்றாம் ஆதி சிவனுக்கு இரு கண்   
மாயனுக்கு செங்கையிலே மான் மழுவாம் \- நேயமுடன்   
சங்கரற்கு சங்காழி தான் மாலுக் காலமாம்   
மங்கையிடத் தாற்காகு மண்.   
The ancient Siva has got three eyes. Ayan, Mahavishnu has got two eyes. For  
Sankara on the hands are the   
pick axe and deer. For Mayan, Mahavsihnu, on the hands are conch shell and  
disc, chakra. Siva, who has got   
Devi on the left of His form, eats hala hala poison as food. Mal, Mahavishnu  
eats the earth as His food.*   
*This is in Krishanavataram.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is from Poet KaaLamegam, as a Nindha Stuti i.e praying as  
if criticizing: கண்ணபுரம் கோயில் கதவடைத்து தாழ் போட்டார் 3   
மண்ணை உண்டார் 5 வெண்ணையுண்ட மாயனார் 4 - எண்ணும்   
சிரக்கப் பரை ஏந்திச்2 செங்காட்டில் ஈசர்1   
இரக்கப் புறப்பட்டார் என்று.   
In the temple of Tiruch chengaadu, Iswara, Siva went out of the temple(1)  
taking the Brahma's skull as bhiksha paatram.2   
So the devotees, in order that Maha Vishnu who is also in Tiruk Kanna Puram,  
does not leave the temple, they   
bolted the temple from outside. 3   
Inside the temple, Mayanaar, Maha Vishnu, who had earlier consumed butter, 4  
now has to take only sand (the earth)5.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is also from Poet KaaLamegam. The verse is called katai  
mozhi maaRRu, i.e the last words   
of the verse should be taken first to understand the meaning: கடம்பற்கு எண் தோள் கண் பதினைந்து ஆமால்   
கடம்பற்கே நால் வாய் கை ஐந்தே \- கடம்பற்கோடு   
ஆனை முகற்கு ஆயிரம் கண்ணா கண்டலற்கு இலம்பாடு   
ஆனை முகற்கு ஆறு இரண்டு கை.   
For Muruga, who wears katampa maalai, there are twelve shoulders (6 X 2).  
For Ayan, Brahma, there are eight faces. For Katampa,   
(one who stays in Katampa forest), that is, Siva, there are fifteen eyes (for  
His five faces). For elephant faced God, Vinayaka,   
there is dropping tongue, trunks which are teeth, and five shoulders. For  
Indra, there are thousand eyes. For Siva, who   
suffers from poverty (that is, He is an alms seeker), there is an old bull as  
His vehicle.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is also from Poet KaaLamegam. He speaks that Siva  
(Chokkanathar) and Vishnu are one and the same God.   
கடம்ப வனச் சொக்கருக்குக் கண்ணன் தான் வேறோ   
இடம் பெரிய கண்ணொன்றை ஈந்தான் \- உடம்பதனில்   
செம்பாதி ஆனான் சுமக்க எரு தானான்   
அம்பானான் தேவியும் ஆனான்.   
For the Chokkanathar (who is Katampa Vanam, that is, Madurai). Krishna or  
Vishnu is not different. KaNNan   
lent one of His eyes (in Tiruveezhimizhalai), when He was doing Siva Puja. He  
also became a part (the left of   
Siva's form- Ardhanaari) as Devi. He also became the Bull for the chariot of  
Siva (in Tripura Samahara story).   
He also became the arrow for Siva's bow (in the same story). He also became  
Devi, on the left form of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is also by KaaLamegam. He speaks about Maha Vishnu and  
Siva of Tiruveezhimizhalai: காலால் படி அளக்கும் கண்ணிடந்து பூசிக்கும்   
சேலாம் கமடமாம் சிங்கமாம் \- பாலாகும்   
ஆழியப்பிலே துயிலும் ஐவர்க்கும் தூதாகும்   
விழியப்பர் ஏறும் விடை.   
The Rishaba Vaahanam (which is Maha Vishnu) of Siva of Tiruveezhimizhalai,  
will measure the world with His three steps,   
(in the story of Mahabali). He will keep one of His eyes (when one of the  
lotuses were missing), when Mahavishnu was doing Siva Puja. He is the SEl  
(fish) in one of His avataras. He is Kamatam (tortoise) in one of His other  
avataars. He is Singam (Lion -   
in Narasimha Avataar. He lies in Yoga Nidra on the milky (paal) ocean  
(aazhi). He went as a messenger on behalf of   
five (eivar) Pandavas. He is also the Bull (Rishabha) for Siva (in Darkuka  
forest story).   
Arunachala Siva.
