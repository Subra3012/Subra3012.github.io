**Need for daily self analysis   
Daily self-analysis or self-examination is an indispensable requisite. Then  
alone can you remove your defects and can grow rapidly in spirituality. A  
gardener watches the young plants very carefully. He removes the weeds daily.  
He puts a strong fence around them. He waters them at the proper time. Then  
alone they grow beautifully and yield fruits quickly. Even so, you should find  
out your defects through daily introspection and self-analysis and then  
eradicate them through suitable methods~Swami Sivananda**

Advice to spiritual aspirants - retire periodically from worldly atmosphere   
The life of a spiritual aspirant in the world is verily like a fierce struggle  
and fight with deadly serpent. Samsara or worldly life is a terrible and  
deadly serpent. Man must keep constant and alert watchfulness lest the  
Samsara-sarpa take you unawares. Keep the twin eyes of Viveka (discrimination)  
and Vichara (enquiry) wide open. At times the man becomes poisoned in the  
course of his Vyavahara (worldly activities). He must retire periodically from  
the worldly atmosphere and take recourse to Satsanga (association with the  
wise), Sadhana, seclusion and silent meditation~Swami Sivananda**

This is also from inimitable Poet KaaLamegam. He speaks of Thiruthuruthi  
Siva, and also makes the word snake to be used,   
for different purposes: காலையிலும்1 வேலை கடையக் கயிறாகும்2   
மாலையிலும் பூ முடித்து வாழுமே3 - சோலை செறி   
செய்யிலாரம் பயிலும்4 செந்துருத்தி மா நகர் வாழ்   
பொய்யிலா மெய்யரிடும் பூண்.5   
kaalaiyilum - kaal + ayilum, the snake will consume air.   
vElaik kataiya kayirRaakum = it serves the purpose of churning the milky ocean  
as a coir.   
maal ayilum poo mutithu = Maha Vishnu swallowed the entire world and such a  
world is borne by the serpent -   
as per puraanas, the world is borne by the snake Aadi Sesha.   
seyyil aaram payilum = in the groves of Thiruth thuruthi, in the groves, where  
pearls are growing in the sugar canes.   
aaram = pearls.   
poyyilaa meyyareitum pooN = the True God Siva wears it as an ornament.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is by Poet KaaLamegam. The verse is called katai mozhi  
maaRRu, that is, the last word of the verse   
is to be taken as the first word of the verse and the meaning understood: மாடு தின்பான் பார்ப்பான் மறையோதுவான் குயவன்   
கூடிமிக மண் பிசைவான் கொல்லனே \- தேடி   
இரும்படிப்பான் தான் செக்கான் எண்ணைய் விற்பான் வண்ணான்   
பரும் புடவை தப்பும் பறை.   
Here the word PaRai - the last word of the verse, should be taken first and  
then meaning understood.   
paRai = the low caste people, will consume the flesh of cows and bulls.   
paarppan = the brahmin will chant Vedas.   
kuyavan = the potter will take the clay and make pots.   
kollan = the blacksmith, will hit the iron rods and make iron utensils.   
sekkaan = the oil monger, will sell oils.   
vannaan = the washerman will hit the clothes on the stone slab and make it  
neat.   
Arunachala Siva.,

The following verse is also from Poet KaaLamegam. Here again, the words must  
be re-set to understand the meaning correctly: கொன்றை மலர் தரித்தான் கோபாலன் கோல் எடுத்து   
நின்று குழல் ஊதினான் நீள் சடையோன் \- பொன் திகழும்   
அக்கணிந்தான் மாயன் அரவணையில் கண் வளர்ந்தான்   
சிக்கலிலே வாழும் சிவன்.   
Siva, who stays in a town called Sikkal (near Nagapattinam in Tamizh Nadu),  
the God with long matted locks, is wearing   
konRai flowers. Gopalan, Maha Vishnu took the flute and played it to charm  
all the cows and also the gopikas.   
Again Siva in His chest wore the garland of bones or rudraksha. Mayan, again  
Mahavishnu slept in Yoga Nidra,   
on the bed of serpent (Aadi Seshan).   
Arunachala Siva.

மாயனுக்கு செங்கையிலே மான் மழுவாம் \- நேயமுடன்   
சங்கரற்கு சங்காழி தான் மாலுக் காலமாம்   
மங்கையிடத் தாற்காகு மண்.   
The ancient Siva has got three eyes. Ayan, Mahavishnu has got two eyes. For  
Sankara on the hands are the   
pick axe and deer. For Mayan, Mahavsihnu, on the hands are conch shell and  
disc, chakra. Siva, who has got   
Devi on the left of His form, eats hala hala poison as food. Mal, Mahavishnu  
eats the earth as His food.*   
*This is in Krishanavataram.   
Arunachala Siva.

_A man came with a basket of fruits. The fruits were meant for offering. He  
asked the monks what he should do with the basket. They told him to throw it  
out in the lane. Mother looked at the lane and said, "Look there. They have  
asked him to throw away such a nice basket! It does not matter for them in the  
least. They are all monks and totally unattached. But we cannot allow such a  
waste. We could have utilized it at least for keeping the vegetable peelings."  
She asked someone to fetch the basket and wash it. It was kept for some future  
use._

_God Himself has provided different forms of worship. He who is the Lord of  
the Universe has arranged all these forms to suit different men in different  
stages of knowledge.   
The mother cooks different dishes to suit the stomachs of her different  
children. Suppose she has five children. If there is a fish to cook, she  
prepares various dishes from it - pilau,pickled fish, fried fish, and so on -  
to suit their different tastes and powers of digestion._

_A man cannot get rid of body-consciousness as long as he is attached to  
worldly things and loves 'woman and gold'. As he becomes less and less  
attached to worldly things, he approaches nearer and nearer to the Knowledge  
of Self. He also becomes less and less conscious of his body. He attains Self-  
Knowledge when his worldly attachment totally disappears. Then he realizes  
that body and soul are two separate things. It is very difficult to separate  
with a knife the kernel of a coconut from the shell before the milk inside has  
dried up. When the milk dries up, the kernel rattles inside the shell. At that  
time it loosens itself from the shell. Then the fruit is called a dry coconut.   
The sign of a man having realized God is that he has become like a dry  
coconut. He has become utterly free from the consciousness that he is the  
body. He does not feel happy or unhappy with the happiness or unhappiness of  
the body. He does not seek the comforts of the body. He roams about in the  
world as a jivanmukta, one liberated in life. 'The devotee of Kali is a  
jivanmukta, full of Eternal Bliss.'_

_When you find that the very mention of God 's name brings tears to your eyes  
and makes your hair stand on end, then you will know that you have freed  
yourself from attachment to 'woman and gold' and attained God. If the matches  
are dry, you get a spark by striking only one of them. But if they are damp,  
you don't get a spark even if you strike fifty. You only waste matches.  
Similarly, if your mind is soaked in the pleasure of worldly things, in 'woman  
and gold', then God-Consciousness will not be kindled in you. You may try a  
thousand times, but all your efforts will be futile. But no sooner does  
attachment to worldly pleasure dry up than the spark of God flashes forth._

TRAILOKYA: _What is the way to dry up the craving for worldly pleasure?_   
MASTER: _Pray to the Divine Mother with a longing heart. Her vision dries up  
all craving for the world and completely destroys all attachment to 'woman and  
gold'. It happens instantly if you think of Her as your own mother. She is by  
no means a godmother. She is your own mother. With a yearning heart persist in  
your demands on Her. The child holds to the skirt of its mother and begs a  
penny of her to buy a kite. Perhaps the mother is gossiping with her friends.  
At first she refuses to give the penny and says to the child: 'No, you can't  
have it. Your daddy has asked me not to give you money. When he comes home  
I'll ask him about it. You will get into trouble if you play with a kite now.'  
The child begins to cry and will not give up his demand. Then the mother says  
to her friends: 'Excuse me a moment. Let me pacify this child.' Immediately  
she unlocks the cash-box with a click and throws the child a penny.   
You too must force your demand on the Divine Mother. She will come to you  
without fail._

NEIGHTBOUR: "Sir, is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of  
a householder?"   
MASTER: _Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company and  
pray unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the mind are  
thus washed away, one realizes God.The mind is like a needle covered with mud,  
and God is like a magnet. The needle cannot be united with the magnet unless  
it is free from mud. Tears wash away the mud, which is nothing but lust,  
anger, greed, and other evil tendencies, and the inclination to worldly  
enjoyments as well. As soon as the mud is washed away, the magnet attracts the  
needle, that is to say, man realizes God. Only the pure in heart see God_.

_Pain and pleasure are inevitable in a body. He who has realized God dedicates  
his mind and life, his body and soul, to God. When Rama and Lakshmana went to  
take their bath in Pampa Lake, they thrust their bows into the ground. Coming  
out of the water, Lakshmana took out his bow and found its tip stained with  
blood. Rama said to him: 'Look, brother! Look. Perhaps we have hurt some  
creature." Lakshmana dug in the earth and found a big bullfrog. It was dying.  
Rama said to the frog in a sorrowful voice: 'Why didn't you croak? We should  
have tried to save you. You croak lustily enough when you are in the jaws of a  
snake.' The frog said: 'O Lord, when I am attacked by a snake I croak, saying: "O Rama, save me! O Rama, save me!" This time I found that it was Rama who was  
killing me; so I kept still.'"_

_When the devotee develops raga-bhakti, passionate love of God, he realizes  
Him. But one loses vaidhi-bhakti, formal devotion, as easily as one gains it.  
This is formal devotion: so much japa, so much meditation, so much sacrifice  
and homa, so many articles of worship, and the recitation of so many mantras,  
before the Deity. Such devotion comes in a moment and goes in a moment. Many  
people say: 'Well, friend, we have lived on havishya for so many days! How  
many times we have worshipped the Deity at our home! And what have we  
achieved?' But there is no falling away from raga-bhakti.who gets this  
passionate love for God? Those who have performed many meritorious deeds in  
their past births, or those who are eternally perfect. Think of a dilapidated  
house, for instance: while clearing away the undergrowth and rubbish one  
suddenly discovers a fountain fitted with a pipe. It has been covered with  
earth and bricks, but as soon as they are removed the water shoots up_.

_Why should I make myself dry through mere reasoning? May I have unalloyed  
love for the Lotus Feet of God as long as the consciousness of 'I' and 'you'  
remains with me!   
(To Govinda) "Sometimes I say, 'Thou art verily I, and I am verily Thou.'  
Again I feel, 'Thou art Thou.' Then I do not find any trace of 'I'. It is  
Sakti alone that becomes flesh as God Incarnate. According to one school of

Consciousness._

_There are innumerable pathways leading to the Ocean of Immortality. The  
essential thing is to reach the Ocean. It doesn 't matter which path you  
follow. Imagine that there is a reservoir containing the Elixir of  
Immortality. You will be immortal if a few drops of the Elixir somehow get  
into your mouth. You may get into the reservoir either by jumping into it, or  
by being pushed into it from behind, or by slowly walking down the steps. The  
effect is one and the same. You will become immortal by tasting a drop of that  
Elixir._

_Sometimes God becomes the magnet and the devotee the needle, and sometimes  
the devotee becomes the magnet and God the needle. The devotee attracts God to  
him. God is the Beloved of His devotee and is under his control_.

_Better than reading is hearing, and better than hearing is seeing. One  
understands the scriptures better by hearing them from the lips of the guru or  
of a holy man. Then one doesn 't have to think about their non-essential  
part_.

_After receiving instruction from His teacher, Rama said that He would  
renounce the world. Dasaratha sent the sage Vasishtha to Rama to dissuade Him.  
Vasishtha found Him filled with intense renunciation. He said to Rama: 'First  
of all, reason with me, Rama; then You may leave the world. May I ask You if  
this world is outside God? If that is so, then You may give it up.' Rama found  
that it is God alone who has become the universe and all its living beings.  
Everything in the world appears real on account of God's reality behind  
it.Thereupon Rama became silent._

_" Once a Vedantic monk came here. He used to dance at the sight of a cloud.  
He would go into an ecstasy of joy over a rain-storm. He would get very angry  
if, anyone went near him when he meditated. One day I came to him while he  
was meditating, and that made him very cross. He discriminated constantly,  
'Brahman alone is real and the world is illusory.' Since the appearance of  
diversity is due to maya, he walked about with a prism from a chandelier in  
his hand. One sees different colours through the prism; in reality there is  
no such thing as colour. Likewise, nothing exists, in reality, except  
Brahman. But there is an appearance of the manifold because of maya, egoism.  
He would not look at an object more than once, lest he should be deluded by  
maya and attachment. He would discriminate, while taking his bath, at the  
sight of birds flying in the. sky. He knew grammar. He stayed here for  
three days. One day he heard the sound of a flute near the embankment and  
said that a man who had realized Brahman would go into samādhi at such a  
sound."_

_Once an impersonator dressed himself as a world-renouncing monk. Pleased with  
the correctness of his disguise, some rich people offered him a rupee. He did  
not accept the money but went away shaking his head. Afterwards he removed his  
disguise and appeared in his usual dress. Then he said to the rich people,  
'Please give me the rupee.' They replied:'Why, you went away refusing our  
present. Why do you ask for it now?' The man said: 'But then I was in the role  
of a holy man. I could not accept money.' Likewise, when God becomes man He  
behaves exactly like a man._

MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day  
the farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his  
son was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he  
found the boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry.  
Sadly the wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he  
hasn't even one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and  
the father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as  
virtuous. They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the  
various arts. Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should  
weep for those seven children or this one boy.' To the jnanis the waking state  
is no more real than the dream state.

_Truthfulness in speech is the tapasya of the Kaliyuga. It is difficult to  
practise other austerities in this cycle. By adhering to truth one attains  
God.Tulsidas said: 'Truthfulness, obedience to God, and the regarding of  
others' wives as one's mother, are the greatest virtues. If one does not  
realize God by practising them, then Tulsi is a liar.'_

_Once some blind men chanced to come near an animal that someone told them was  
an elephant. They were asked what the elephant was like. The blind men began  
to feel its body. One of them said the elephant was like a pillar; he had  
touched only its leg. Another said it was like a winnowing-fan; he had touched  
only its ear. In this way the others, having touched its tail or belly, gave  
their different versions of the elephant. Just so, a man who has seen only one  
aspect of God limits God to that alone. It is his conviction that God cannot  
be anything else_.

_Who can comprehend everything about God? It is not given to man to know any  
aspect of God, great or small. And what need is there to know everything about  
God? It is enough if we only realize Him. And we see God Himself if we but see  
His Incarnation. Suppose a person goes to the Ganges and touches its water. He  
will then say, 'Yes, I have seen and touched the Ganges.' To say this it is  
not necessary for him to touch the whole length of the river from Hardwar to  
Gangasagar. (Laughter.)   
If I touch your feet, surely that is the same as touching you. (Laughter.) If  
a person goes to the ocean and touches but a little of its water, he has  
surely touched the ocean itself. Fire, as an element, exists in all things,  
but in wood it is present to a greater degree._   
GIRISH (smiling): _" I am looking for fire. Naturally I want to go to a place  
where I can get it."_   
MASTER (smiling): _" Yes, fire, as an element, is present more in wood than in  
any other object. If you seek God, then seek Him in man; He manifests Himself  
more in man than in any other thing. If you see a man endowed with ecstatic  
love, overflowing with prema, mad after God, intoxicated with His love, then  
know for certain that God has incarnated Himself through that man.   
(To M.) "There is no doubt that God exists in all things; but the  
manifestations of His Power are different in different beings. The greatest  
manifestation of His Power is through an Incarnation. Again, in some  
Incarnation there is a complete manifestation of God's Power. It is the Sakti,  
the Power of God, that is born as an Incarnation."_

individual souls can be united to the Supreme Soul. Every house has a

Then your house will be lighted._

_There are certain signs of God-realization. The man in whom longing for God  
manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of  
that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living  
beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories  
of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing  
in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far  
to seek.   
The state of a servant's house will tell you unmistakably whether his master  
has decided to visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are  
cleared up. Second, the soot and dirt are removed from the rooms. Third, the  
courtyard, floors, and other places are swept clean. Finally the master  
himself sends various things to the house such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble  
for smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude  
that the master will very soon come._

_Three words- 'master', 'teacher', and 'father'-prick me like thorns. I am the  
son of God, His eternal child. How can I be a 'father'? God alone is the  
Master and I am His instrument. He is the Operator and I am the machine.   
If somebody addresses me as guru, I say to him: 'Go away, you fool! How can I  
be a teacher?' There is no teacher except Satchidananda. There is no refuge  
except Him. He alone is the Ferryman to take one across the ocean of the

2017 Mahakumbhabhishekam Arunachaleswarar Temple Update   
Consecration of peripheral shrines (shrines of accompanying deities) in Sri  
Arunachaleswarar temple in Tiruvannamalai was held on Thursday February 2,  
2017.   
The consecration of the Sri Arunachaleswarar Shrine will occur on February 6  
but rituals began on the last week of January. On January 31, the 12 kala  
homam began in the 108 Yaga Kundams set up in a yagasalai complex inside the  
temple.   
The pots containing holy water placed by the homa kundams, the holy fire to  
make offerings, were taken in procession by priests to the shrines such as  
Kambathilayanar Sannidi, a shrine of Lord Muruga, Pathala Lingam,  
Gopurathilaiyanar Sannidi and Sambandha Vinayagar Sannidi. The priests then  
poured the holy water from the Vimanams of the shrines to perform  
consecration.

Dear Vinod,   
There is nothing wrong. All names and forms are in Arunachala which is  
Paramaatman (the Self.). The Self is the same   
only names and forms are different. I know one person who always says Tirupati  
Muruga, Tirupati Muruga! Are   
Sri Venkateswara and Muruga different? (The reason however, was that it is  
believed that Tirupati Lord is Muruga   
only.)   
Further the term Arunachala is all inclusive. The Arunachala Mahatmyam says  
chanting Arunachala once is equivalent to chanting   
a ten million times the Panchaksharam, Namasivaya.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear Vinod,   
Remembering Arunachala even once paves the way for liberation. in this very  
life as written by Sadhu OM in his Arunachala Venba.   
For some reason, the Supreme Brahman has taken the form of this hill and can  
be remembered by his form or by incantation of his name.   
So if we can remember Arunachala alll the time, by incantation of his name  
what more is needed to be aspired for.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Stray thoughts...   
Just because Sri Rama decided to stick to his decision to honour 'what is' or  
Dharma or 'Ulladu', everybody else were saved from transgression of committing  
sin of acting against Dharma.   
His father Dasharatha, wanted to stop Kaikeyi by force, and wanted to so much  
dishonour his vow made to Kaikeyi, of sending Rama to Forests and install  
Bharatas the King. but he could not do so at Rama's steadfastness in honouring  
his fathers words. His sin was averted!   
Mother Kausalya, wanted to desert his husband, due to his actions! This sin  
was averted!   
Lakshmanas anger and intentions to restore the honour of his beloved brother!  
These sins were averted!   
Bharata's rage averted!   
Just a moment of flashes, how one person's Tapas transcends all boundaries and  
saves the near and dear ones. Such is the power of honouring Dharma.   
IT is difficult, but the good things are not openly seen or felt when the mind  
is agitated.   
Is it simply said?   
Ramo Vigrahavan Dharma   
"Rama is the embodiment of Dharma"   
There are plenty of small small instances that require careful study of  
Ramayana, by which we can derive the ambrosial nectar by which we can uplift  
ourselves and move out of humanly delusions and fears.   
पिबरे राम रसम् रसने   
पिबरे राम रसम् ॥   
दूरीकृत पातक संसर्गम्

 _From old IkshvÃ¡ku 's line he came,   
Known to the world by RÃ¡ma's name: With soul subdued, a chief of might,   
In Scripture versed, in glory bright,   
His steps in virtue's paths are bent,   
Obedient, pure, and eloquent.   
In each emprise he wins success,   
And dying foes his power confess.   
Tall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb,   
Fortune has set her mark on him.   
Graced with a conch-shell's triple line,   
His throat displays the auspicious sign.   
High destiny is clear impressed   
On massive jaw and ample chest,   
His mighty shafts he truly aims,   
And foemen in the battle tames.   
Deep in the muscle, scarcely shown,   
Embedded lies his collar-bone.   
His lordly steps are firm and free,   
His strong arms reach below his knee;   
All fairest graces join to deck   
His head, his brow, his stately neck,   
And limbs in fair proportion set: The manliest form e'er fashioned yet.   
Graced with each high imperial mark,   
His skin is soft and lustrous dark.   
Large are his eyes that sweetly shine   
With majesty almost divine.   
His plighted word he ne'er forgets;   
On erring sense a watch he sets.   
By nature wise, his teacher's skill   
Has trained him to subdue his will.   
Good, resolute and pure, and strong,   
He guards mankind from scathe and wrong,   
And lends his aid, and ne'er in vain,   
The cause of justice to maintain.   
Well has he studied o'er and o'er   
The Vedas and their kindred lore.   
Well skilled is he the bow to draw,   
Well trained in arts and versed in law;   
High-souled and meet for happy fate,   
Most tender and compassionate;   
The noblest of all lordly givers,   
Whom good men follow, as the rivers   
Follow the King of Floods, the sea: So liberal, so just is he._

Sri Rama lived like a human being, a complete human being, he showed his  
bravery, cried for loss of Sita, took His father's   
words as final and proceeded to forest without a word of protest, loved all, a  
lower caste Guha, monkeys like Sugriva and   
Hanuman. doubed Sita as a typical normal husband. But He is Purushottama. He  
never did miracles like Krishna killing Puthana   
when he was just a milk drinking child etc.,   
I consider Rama as a man becoming God, even though he is already an avatar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, Sri Udai. It is true. But it is impossible to describe the power of His  
Name. We only can bow down to the great life this Avatara has had and to take  
His as example in our lives!

_**A son who delivers his father from   
a hell known as 'Put' protects his   
ancestors in every way and therefore he is called 'Putra'.**_   
Rama to Bharata, who stays steadfast in fulfilling his vow to to make sure his  
father's honour is kept up who had conferred boons to Kaikeyi, by whom Rama  
was ordered to go to the forests for 14 year, so that her (Kaikeyi) son  
Bharata would be made the emperor (and not Rama, rightfully)

**ANGER**   
(Sundara Kanda Sarga 55)  
 _ **" Blessed is he who like controlling fire with water can control  
his anger with awareness."**_   
While the citizens of Lanka looked in stunned disbelief at the ruin that was  
once their beautiful city and their pride, Hanuman dipped his still burning  
tail into the ocean. Just then a sudden terror gripped him and he gasped, âI  
have burnt Lanka! What a wicked thing to do. Blessed is he who like  
controlling fire with water can control his anger with awareness. Which angry  
man will not commit a sin? He will not only deny the wisdom of the wise but  
can even kill his own guru. To him who is possessed by a great rage no evil is  
beyond him and no blasphemy beyond utterance. He alone is man who can  
patiently shed his anger like a snake silently sheds its slough. I have  
incinerated Lanka without thinking of Sita, who may have perished in the fire.  
May I too go up in flames for I am a traitor!â   
Unwilling to forgive himself Hanuman blamed his anger for the havoc it had  
created, perhaps causing the destruction of Sita and the doom of Ramaâs  
mission. Scolding himself he said, âI have once again proven to the world  
the truth about the much ridiculed traits of the monkey. Though capable of  
saving Sita, I have lost her to my unbound freedom and to the whims of my  
capricious mind. How can I ever face my king, Rama and Lakshmana? Death is my  
only salvation! Should I burn, drown or be food to the creatures of the sea?  
Rama shall never survive news of Sitaâs death, Lakshmana will not live  
without Rama. Bharata and Satrughna will follow them and the very race of the  
Ikshvakus will cease to exist. Sugriva too will pass on. Suddenly a ray of  
hope flashed into Hanumanâs anguished mind, âHow can Sita who is pure as  
fire perish? How can fire burn fire?â With that his fear grew faint, his  
hope grew strong and Hanuman reverted back to his brave indomitable self. It  
was also then, that he heard voices from the sky say that though Hanuman had  
achieved the impossible by burning Lanka with its towers, turrets and gates,  
Sita was safe and unharmed! Relieved, he sped away happily to meet Sita once  
again.

After reaching Panchavati, Rama asked Lakshmana to choose a place for their  
hermitage. But Lakshmana said   
_**âI am your servant and I have not that freedom. The decision shall always  
be yours.â**_   
Happy with his brotherâs faith in him, Rama chose a site close to a lake  
where soft petaled lotuses filled the air with fragrance.   
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*  
Soon a cottage took shape, built ever so lovingly by one adoring brother for  
another. Rama loved the cottage and he loved Lakshmana for his affection,  
embracing whom he said, and   
_**âDutiful dharmic, and ever aware of my needs, you are like a father to  
me. Dasaratha is not dead but lives through you.â**_

Rama said,   
_**âBharata! Man is not independent of divine will nor is he master of his  
fate, for destiny is inexorable. Wealth amassed can vanish and lofty positions  
can crumble. Every union ends in separation and life ends in death, just as  
every fruit that ripens has no other fear except that of falling from the  
tree. For every man born, there is no other fear than death. The strongest  
homes built on mighty pillars, fall to ruin, as time passes on and so do those  
who grow old and perish with age. In this world days and nights pass quickly  
decreasing the life of all just as the rays of the merciless sun dry up the  
waters.   
To grieve is unwise for whether one stands still or keeps walking, life will  
continue to ebb. Death walks with man and will sit, if he sits. It will travel  
to the ends of the world with him if he wishes to travel long miles, and will  
come back with him when he does. The body wrinkles with age, into the raven  
black of the hair creeps the white of the snows. Youth fades and vitality  
diminishes but by what means can man escape these ravages of time? How can he  
rejuvenate himself and by what mortal power?**_ _**Men rejoice every sunrise  
and sunset, unaware that every passing morning and evening robs them of a  
dayâs life. Oblivious that every season shortens his life span, man looks  
forward to every new season, enjoying every new experience and the mood that  
they usher in.â   
Inescapable is separation, for just as drifting pieces of wood come together,  
in the boundless main toss around for a while and then drift apart. So do  
wives, children, relatives and riches. They remain together for some time to  
be separated again by the irresistible laws of destiny to which all life must  
bend and bow. In this changing world the common lot of not one man can ever be  
neither changed nor averted. Why lament for the dead, whom tears can never  
bring back. Like a flowing river life can never roll back to its source, and  
age with time marches onwards, relentlessly. Those who aspire to conquer the  
higher worlds must lead a life of compassion and obedience to the gurus,  
seeking only the pleasures that do not contradict the rules of dharma."**_   
(Rama to Bharata Sarga 106, Ayodhyakaanda, who had come all the way to  
Chitrakuta where Rama was residing inorder to bring Rama back to kingdom)

Kaikeyi then had the audacity to tell that most righteous of men,  
_**âIf you desire your father and yourself to be known as men of honor in  
this world Rama, listen to me. As vowed by the king you are to be exiled. All  
that has been procured for your coronation shall be used to install Bharata as  
king. Forsaking the throne of Kosala, you will live in the Dandaka forest for  
a period of fourteen years, clad in robes of bark. Bharata will rule the  
kingdom of Kosala from its capital city of Ayodhya, which abounds in gems,  
jewelry, horses, chariots and elephants. This is the reason for the kingâs  
grief. A breach of promise is a grave transgression, save your father from  
committing that ignominy and save him from perjury.â**_   
Struck at the misfortune that had befallen his beloved son, Dasarathaâs soul  
writhed in agony. His eyes were unable to see beyond the veil of tears, and  
his voice choked with emotion was rendered speechless. But Rama the most noble  
and virtuous of men, betrayed no sign of sorrow.   
 _ **Rama was unmoved by Kaikeyiâs merciless tirade. It brought no sadness  
upon him to know that her dishonourable wishes would only bring distressing  
results. In all humility, gracious to the core, he said,**_   
 _ **âWhy did my father himself not tell me of Bharataâs coronation when I  
would have willingly given up all that I possess, for the asking, to my  
brother Bharata. How much more will I not relinquish for my king, who is also  
my father, my âGuruâ and my god. To honor his vows I shall go into exile.  
Let messengers ride swift-footed horses, to escort Bharata back to  
Ayodhya.â**_   
Ramaâs words thrilled Kaikeyi. Not wanting to jeopardize her moment of  
triumph, she wished Rama away that very instant urging him to tarry no  
further. She even tried to convince him that it was of no concern if the king,  
shamed and confused did not speak to Rama his beloved son. She then dealt the  
ultimate blow by announcing to Rama that the king may not even bathe or eat  
until he left. Aghast at the blatant lie, Dasarathaâs dwindling strength and  
tolerance crumbled. His battered mind succumbed to the havoc created by  
Kaikeyiâs wiles and the great king fell unconscious on his golden couch.   
 _ **Unaffected by the queenâs jarring words, Rama, the virtuous son of a  
virtuous father, neither lost his his composure nor his grace. Beyond reach of  
all emotions he lifted his father tenderly, urged all the while by Kaikeyi to  
start on the journey. Impervious of Kaikeyiâs frantic efforts, Rama,  
tranquil as ever told her with utmost courtesy,**_   
 _ **âMother I have no ambitions. Know me to be an equal of the rishis. In  
dharma alone I take refuge. If fulfilling my fatherâs wishes brings upon me  
my very death, so be it! If there be a greater virtue than that of serving my  
father, I am not aware of it. Even if my father does not say so I will still  
exile myself, so as to honor your wishes. Did you doubt my nature and my  
obedience towards you so much that you had to make your desire sound like a  
royal decree? I now take leave of you. Rest assured that I would not remain a  
moment more than it would take to bid farewell to my mother Kausalya and not a  
moment more than necessary to appease Sita.â**_   
Witness to all this, Dasarathaâs tears flowed unchecked. A king broken and  
defeated agonized helplessly over his son. Once again he fought a losing  
battle with his consciousness and once again did it betray him. Rama took  
silent leave of his father who lay unconscious by worshipfully touching his  
feet. Kaikeyiâs wickedness did not prevent Ramaâs nobility from paying her  
an equally reverential farewell. He then joined his friends followed by  
Lakshmana whose eyes streamed with tears of anger.   
 _ **Relinquishing the kingdom did not mar Ramaâs serenity nor did it  
diminish his glory. Like a great sage whose heart was ever devoid of turmoil,  
Rama set out. Renouncing the throne and being banished from the country cast  
no shadow over him. Bidding an affectionate farewell to all those around him  
he went to see Kausalya with no trace of emotion. His only concern was of the  
distress that the fateful changes would cause, where supreme joy had  
prevailed. In relinquishing the kingdom Rama gave up the entire fanfare and  
trappings that went with it. Abandoning the royal canopy, the beautifully  
ornate fans and the chariot, he walked to his motherâs apartments, his face  
radiating a divine glow.**_   
(Excerpts from Ayodhyakanda Sarga 18 & 19)

Rama entered his motherâs abode, unaccompanied by any kind of royal  
fanfare or pomp. Kausalya, who had spent a night of meditation and prayer, was  
in the temple of Visnu, invoking his blessings upon her son. Rama beheld his  
mother clad in soft silks, radiant as a celestial, as she hurried to embrace  
him and softly touched her lips to his forehead saying,   
_**âMy son! May you become a Rajarshi, illustrious and famous as befits your  
race. Go to your father, the honorable king, who waits to coronate you king of  
Kosala ".**_   
Rama with head bowed in an attitude of reverence prepared himself to tell  
Kausalya that he was not to be king. Gathering his courage to take leave and  
dreading the pain it would cause her Rama gently said,   
_**âMother, Bharata will be crowned ruler of Ayodhya and I am to dwell in  
the forest for fourteen years, leading the life of a mendicant.â**_   
Kausalya looked at Rama in disbelief. The blow dealt by those words was almost  
physical and she was thrown to the ground where she lay stunned. Recovering  
slowly she said,   
_**âMy son, if I had not borne you I would have been spared this grief.  
Without you my life has no meaning, I will follow you like a cow follows. Even  
at the height of the kingâs glory I have never enjoyed the privileges that  
should have been mine. Slighted by him, dominated by Kaikeyi who is spiteful  
and full of anger, I have led a life of insignificance. Tormented by such  
agony, why does not my heart break? Disciplining myself with prayer and  
meditation I brought you up. My efforts cannot go waste like this,â**_  
lamented Kausalya. Overwhelmed by the pathos of the situation, fighting a  
losing battle with her grief, the noble queen broke down sobbing without  
restraint.   
Consoling Kausalya, Lakshmana said that he saw no reason for Rama to go the  
forests, forsaking the throne merely on an order passed by a woman.   
_**âGoaded by Kaikeyi, enslaved by his passion for her, with a mind rendered  
feeble with age, what will not Dasaratha say? What trespasses has Rama  
committed to warrant his banishment? There is none in this world that dare  
confront him with an accusation. God-like, guiless, impeccably disciplined by  
great masters, dear even to his enemies, Rama is an embodiment of nobility.  
How can a father beholding a son so immaculate, exile him without cause or  
compunction? Before word of this banishment spreads, let us together take over  
the kingdom. With me by your side, no man will dare face you. If the wicked  
king, our father, infatuated and instigated by Kaikeyi chooses to turn our  
enemy, I will not hesitate to capture him, nor will I hesitate to even slay  
him. If a father, who is also the guru, goes beyond the barriers of justice in  
his arrogance, he is punishable. What authorizes the king to bestow this realm  
on Kaikeyi, which is your inheritance? What gives him the courage to alienate  
and distance us, so as to crown Bharata?â**_   
Lakshmana turned to mother Kausalya assuring her,   
_**âI pledge my allegiance to my brother in every way. Any forest or fires  
that Rama enters consider it done that I will enter it first. I will dispel  
your grief like the Sun dispels the dark of night.â**_   
Kausalya pleaded with Rama to act upon Lakshmanaâs advice.   
_**âCan you leave me to the mercy of Kaikeyi, a woman so full of spite and  
malice? You speak of righteousness and that righteousness says a mother is as  
sacred to man as his father, and that both are his Gurus. Be righteous Rama! I  
command you not to go. Stay by my side and serve me. I cannot live without  
you! If you do not heed me, I shall fast unto death.â**_   
Neither Kausalya's tears nor Lakshmana's anger swayed the noble son of  
Dasaratha, from his resolve, as he said,   
_**âI do not have the strength to defy my father. In the days of yore, Rishi  
Kandu accrued the sin of slaying a cow in discharging his filial duty. The  
sons of Sagara destroyed many lives in fulfilling their fatherâs wishes.  
Parasurama executing the orders of his father Jamadagni axed his mother to  
death. Many a man of might and honor had obeyed his sire and so will I. Am I  
establishing a new code of honour that had not existed earlier?   
âThe king, all his life, has been famed for his virtue, knowledge and  
righteousness. If such a man commands me, I will not ask the reason why. I  
shall only obey and so shall you. It is up to me to help him keep his promise  
to Kaikeyi. Kshatriya dharma does not permit disobedience to the word of a  
father, mother or a Brahmin even if they arise out of anger, passion or  
desire. It is by the order of the king that Kaikeyi banishes me. Perish your  
thoughts of violence and honour your duty!   
âMother! So noble and so god fearing is Dasaratha, that he is the image of  
dharma. When such a man is alive, how can you say you will follow me into the  
forest? Never shall I sacrifice my duty, even if it be to inherit the earth,  
nor shall I accept an inheritance which is not impeccably just. In a life so  
impermanent, I do not wish to rule a world equally impermanent for which I  
have little use. The rewards of kingship are so paltry and inferior, compared  
to the immortal fame gained by strict adherence to righteousness.â **_   
Rama then bade an affectionate and reverential farewell to his mother.

Lakshmana shook with an uncontrollable rage. He stomped around with  
flailing arms flashing eyes and stormy demeanor, making him seem like an  
intoxicated tusker. To this fiery embodiment of fury, whose sighs sounded like  
the hissing of king cobras Rama quietly said   
 _ **âLakshmana! Your anger against our father and your sorrow for me has to  
be restrained. The coronation has not been stopped for any lack of competence  
on your part, so it is of no disgrace to you. Do show the same zeal in  
procuring things for my exile, as you did for my coronation. As for mother  
Kausalya, I rely on you to dispel her doubts about my ever becoming ruler of  
Ayodhya. It grieves me to see her agonizing over me, but the king will be  
distressed if his promises are violated. His distress will also be mine. My  
early departure will make queen Kaikeyi happy and clear the way for  
Bharataâs installation.   
âListen Lakshmana! To be given a kingdom for a moment, only for it to be  
snatched away the next, is merely an act of the Gods. The merciless utterances  
of mother Kaikeyi, to prevent my coronation are destiny. My banishment now and  
my enthronement later, is destiny. How otherwise, can a princess so noble, so  
virtuous, ill-treat me like a common shrew, in the presence of her king and  
consort? Even the devatas cannot allay the mysterious forces of destiny. It is  
this unalterable judgment that has altered my fortune and Kaikeyiâs feelings  
for me. No man can conquer fate. Good and evil, fear and anger, gain and loss,  
being and non-being and all that they involve are ruled by destiny.â**_   
 _ **âEven sages in all their glory, driven by that mysterious force, fall  
prey to it. Rendered victims of their anger and passion they lose the powers  
of their immense penance. A coronation stops mid-way, is that not destiny? I  
see no reason to bemoan it. Stop sorrowing; help me depart in peace and not in  
turbulence. To me, whether it is a palace or a forest makes no difference.  
Banished to live amidst exotic forest life is a joy. It is more a blessing  
than a bane, for a crown comes with a price and many demands. A forest has no  
demands! I will have the good fortune to see the greatest of sages and  
ascetics who live in sylvan solitude.â**_   
Noble and compassionate to the core, Rama did not abandon thoughts of Kaikeyi.  
Protective to the end, his kindness compelled him to remind Lakshmana that the  
reason why the crown chose to rest on a head other than his was not Kaikeyi.  
He said it was purely an act of destiny condoned by the gods.   
_**âDo you now realize the powers of the divine Lakshmana?â**_   
asked Rama.

Just reproducing very wise words of Sri Graham from the Interactive page as  
regards to Forum, which I felt is important to remember once again.   
 _The purpose of this forum is to help those who need information to find it  
with ease. To assist those who seek genuine enlightenment to overcome their  
concerns and perceived difficulties through the knowledge of other members.   
However, like every other forum, there will be useful as well as not-so-useful  
content. I recommend visitors to be cautious about applying anything they read  
on the forum to their lives, unless it is also clearly stated in the Vedas, as  
these are the final authority._   
Thank you,   
With prayers,   
ॐ

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thanks for your feedback, i was of the impression that it may be easier to  
read and that readers may be interested with it. I would discontinue with it  
and henceforth continue with the normal practice.   
ॐ
