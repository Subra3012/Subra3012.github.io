The word mind is generally taken to be a collective name for the whole  
multitude of thoughts, although in actual fact the only fundamental and  
essential characteristic of the mind is the root thought I, the first person  
singular feeling.   
 **Thus the word mind may be said to have two meanings. Its primary meaning  
is the subjective aspect of the mind, namely the first person thought I,  
while its secondary meaning is the objective aspect of the mind, namely the  
multitude of other thoughts, all of which exist only by depending upon this  
first thought I.** This multitude of thoughts is only a crowd of second  
person objects.

Note: Moreover in srimad bhagavatam it is written   
 **The mind is not to be killed.Mind or desire cannot be stopped, but to  
develop a desire to function for spiritual realization, the quality of  
engagement by the mind has to be changed.** The mind is the pivot of the  
active sense organs, and as such if the quality of thinking,feeling and  
willing is changed, naturally the quality of actions by the instrumental  
senses will also change.   
 **Srimad Bhagavatham, 2.1.17.**

Mind is insentient blankness.Thought arises when this insentient blankness  
associates with consciousness.Thought is the index of mind.   
Mind is only in the name like insentient sky,you cannot hold the sky in your  
fist.Same is the case with the mind,it has no form it is not tangible.Mind is  
inferred when there is thought.When there is no thought there is nothing like  
an entity like mind.(Naiva maanasam).

There were two questions that were asked by someone to   
Annamalai Swami: Question: Why does the mind always go outwards instead of inwards?   
A.S: Because we don't ask the question,: "Why does the mind   
go outwards instead of inwards?"   
Question: Does the mind die gradually or suddenly?   
A.S: One answer is: "When the sun comes up, does darkness   
disappear suddenly or gradually?"   
Bhagavan, speaking on this topic, once remarked: "Someone   
mistakes a rope hanging in the darkness for a snake. He then   
asks how many years it will take for the snake to die?"   
This is a better answer: If the mind does not exist, it cannot die either  
quickly or slowly!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 That's beautifully said. I like it. Can you elaborate on that ? What is not clear is, the latent tendencies also should form a part of the mind right? In that case, how can we say mind is not present between thoughts? perhaps its dormant?   
Love!   
Silence
