Verse 8: ஒன்றாய் முளைத்தெழுந்   
 தெத்தனையோ கவடுவிட்டு   
நன்றாக வைத்தென்னை   
 நாய்சிவிகை ஏற்றுவித்த   
என்றாதை தாதைக்கும்   
 எம்மனைக்கும் தம்பெருமான்   
குன்றாத செல்வற்கே   
 சென்றூதாய் கோத்தும்பீ.   
He is like a tree that springs from the earth with One single trunk and puts  
forth innumerable branches.   
He keeps me well.   
He caused me,   
a mere cur,   
to ride a palanquin.   
He is my Father;   
He is the Lord-God of my father and my mother;   
His is opulence that never knows any decrease.   
O King-Thumpi,   
Fare forth to Him and over Him,   
hum.   
Arunachala Siva.
