Dear sirs   
There are many many siddas in our land. All are enlightened. Some wrote poems  
on various subjects   
some did miracles. Some did only tapas. Some lived with people some were in  
caves. How They became   
sidda purush. whether doing ashtanga yoga or simply by the grace of God. There  
are 18 siddas in tamil text   
 But there are more nos. People say all siddas are attracted to Thruvannamal  
like an iron by magnet.   
They are still living. They can be seen to those people who are very  
fortunate. In recent time there are   
many magazines which speak about siddas.Why suddenly this development ls seen  
in recent times.   
Bhagavan also mentioned once to His devotees while taking girivalam, He used  
to stand for a while and give way as if some one was crossing Him. He told   
there are many siddas who are taking pradshina. He said they may come in any  
form, like dogs, monkeys etc.etc.Last year during girivalam one employee from  
E.B. took a snap of one sidda. When Sidda noticed this man he flew from the  
ground to sky and disappeared. It was shown on Jaya TV. Many devotees who are  
going to girivalam they say still we can see them. Any body has such  
experience.?

Dear ramanaduli,   
A Siddha Purusha is one who has acquired eight superhuman powers, like anima  
etc., [ Sri Dakshinamoorthy Stotram]. They   
can either remain in a human body or live in an astral plane.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said that these Siddha Purushas are   
already for self-realized, but they remain in a body for some   
purpose for others. Tiru Moolar is one such Siddha. His story   
is in Periya Puranam. He lived in body for 3000 years. Others   
live in astral plane for some work for the sake of others. One   
cannot see a Siddha or take a photograph. If such photographs are shown, they  
are all bogus. Mostly they live like a column   
of light etc., Bhagavan Ramana has 'seen' many such Siddhas.   
Some came to see Him, in the guise of an animal. They are   
supposed to circumbambulate the Hill for their own satisfaction even though  
they have attained Self Realization. The 18 Siddhas which are spoken about in  
Tamil, are also poets who wrote about medicinal herbs, how to live a good  
life, how to prolong life, what is Siva's nature etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the reply. What is the difference in between siddas and Bhagavan.  
Because siddas also have all poweres and help the human   
being. Is not it? They say those who has 8 gunas are called Bhagvan. In tamil  
they say ENN GUNATHAN. bY the way can you write about   
Kaduveli siddar's details. Long time ago you posted how he proved his  
innocence in front of the king. I want his life details.   
Thanks   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana is a Brahma Jnani, but he displayed only   
eight gunas, characteristices, like love, non injury etc., Siva is said to  
have these 8 guans also. But a Siddha is, apart from being a Brahma Jnani,  
can also exhibit 8 aisvaryas, riches, like flying, disappearing from the  
scene, becoming a heavy object,   
becoming a light object, becoming a very fat object and   
becoming a very thin object like a streak of light, knowing   
what is happening at a far off place, knowing past, present   
and future etc., Bhagavan Ramana did not want to exhibit   
such powers, nor did He encourage others to acquire them.   
He said, it is all like magic. Why cheat yourself? He has   
clearly said in Who am I?: "What is Jnana Dhrishti? Being   
still, Summa irutthal, is Jnana Dhrihti and not seeing an   
object at a far off place, knowing three aspects of past,   
present and future, knowing someone else's mind etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.
