9. I alone am the imperishable that is evident. i alone am adorable to me. I alone am ever Brahman.   
I alone am the ever undiminishing.   
10. I alone am in the front of myself, indeed. I alone am the interior of the innermost recesses. I alone   
am the space of awareness. I alone am the space of awareness. I alone am the  
illuminator.   
11. I alone am the creator always. I alone am the protector. I alone am the sportive Self. I alone am the   
certitude.   
12. I alone am the witness always. You are verily the ancient Yourself. You alone are the Supreme   
Brahman. You alone are the intersticeless.   
13\. I alone am me, verily myself. I alone am verily you, indeed. I alone am  
the non dual form. I am the   
body-less.   
14\. I alone am my support. I alone am the Self ever. I alone am the  
quiescent Self. I alone am the   
enduring.   
15\. I alone am equanimity. I alone am earnestness too. I alone am the great  
expanse. I alone am the self   
consisting of parts.   
16. I alone am the end of desire. I alone am the interior, ever. I alone am the anterior. I am the   
posterior myself ever.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
