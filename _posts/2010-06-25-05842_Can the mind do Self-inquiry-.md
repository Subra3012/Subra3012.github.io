## Can the mind do Self-inquiry?  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 25, 2010, 07:12:33 AM

The mind cannot do Self-inquiry, because whatsoever the mind can do will  
strengthen the mind. Any doing on the part of the mind makes the mind more  
strong. So Self-inquiry by the mind is impossible.   
Mind doing something means mind continuing itself -- so that is not in the  
nature of things. But Self-inquiry happens through watching the mind, not by  
doing anything.   
The watcher is separate from the mind, it is deeper than the mind, higher than  
the mind. The watcher is always hidden behind the mind. A thought passes, a  
feeling arises -- who is watching this thought? Not the mind itself -- because  
mind is nothing but the process of thought and feeling. The mind is just the  
traffic of thinking. Who is watching it? When you say, "Fear has arisen in  
me," who are 'you'? In whom has the thought of feararisen? Who is the  
container? The thought of fear is the content -- who is the container?   
Consciousness is like empty paper. Mind is like written, printed paper.   
Whatsoever exists as an object inside you, whatsoever you can see and observe,  
is the mind. The perceiver is not the mind, the observed is the mind.   
So if you can go on simply observing,watching,witnessing without condemning,  
without in any way creating a conflict with the mind, without indulging it,  
without following it, without going against it, if you can simply be there  
indifferent to it, in that indifference Self-inquiry happens. when the watcher  
arises, the witness is there, mind simply disappears.   
Mind exists with your cooperation or your conflict. Both are ways of  
cooperating -- conflict too! When you fight with the mind, you are giving  
energy to it. In your really fight you have accepted the mind, in your very  
fighting you have accepted the power of the mind over your being. So whether  
you cooperate or you conflict, in both the cases the mind becomes stronger and  
stronger.   
Just watch. Just be a witness. And, by and by, you will see gaps arising. A  
thought passes, and another thought does not come immediately -- there is an  
interval. In that interval is peace. In that interval is love. In that  
interval is all that you have always been seeking -- and finding never. In  
that gap, you are no more an ego. In that gap you are not defined, confined,  
imprisoned. In that gap you are vast, immense, huge! In that gap you are one  
with existence -- the barrier exists not. Your boundaries are no more there.  
You melt into existence and the existence melts in you. You start overlapping.   
If you go on watching and you don't get attached to these gaps either...  
because that is natural now, to get attached to these gaps. If you start  
hankering for these gaps... because they are tremendously beautiful, they are  
immensely blissful. It is natural to get attached to them, and desire arises  
to have more and more of these gaps -- then you will miss, then your watcher  
has disappeared. Then those gaps will again disappear, and again the traffic  
of the mind will be there.   
So the first thing is to become an indifferent watcher. And the second thing  
is to remember that when beautiful gaps arise, don't get attached to them,  
don't start asking for them, don't start waiting that they should happen more  
often. If you can remember these two things -- when beautiful gaps come, watch  
them too, and keep your indifference alive -- then one day the traffic simply  
disappears with the road, they both disappear. And there is tremendous  
emptiness.   
That's what Buddha calls 'Nirvana' \-- the mind has ceased. This is what I  
call suicide -- but mind has not committed it. Mind cannot do it. You can help  
it to happen. You can hinder it, you can help it to happen -- it depends on  
you, not on your mind. All that mind can do will always strengthen the mind.   
So Self-inquiry is not really mind-effort. Real meditation is not effort at  
all. Real Self-inquiry(Nija Vicharana) is just allowing the mind to have its  
own way, and not interfering in any way whatsoever -- just remaining watchful,  
witnessing. It silences, by and by, it becomes still. One day it is gone. You  
are left alone.   
That aloneness is what your reality is. And reality is beginningless and  
endless. The mind has a beginning and an end, hence the mind and reality  
cannot meet. The mind cannot comprehend the eternal.   
Reality is simply the loss of ego. Destroy the ego by seeking its identity.  
Because the ego is no entity it will automatically vanish and reality will  
shine forth by itself.   
And in that aloneness nothing is excluded, remember it. In that aloneness  
everything is included -- that aloneness is God. That purity, that innocence,  
uncorrupted by any thought, is what Self is.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes.   
Muruganar says in Padamalai:-   
Verse 1364: Since consciousness is reality, in order to know reality,   
why is is necessary to associate with the movements of the mind?   
Verse 2690: Do not struggle with the mind, regarding it as something   
real, If you enquire within and know what it is, it will cease to exist.   
Day by Day entry dt. 8.11.45 also says: Bhagavan: To ask the mind to kill the mind is making the thief   
the policeman. He will go with you and pretend to catch the thief.   
But nothing will be gained. So you must turn inward and see where   
the mind rises from, and then it will cease to exist.   
Question: Is not asking the mind turn inwards and seek its source   
also employing the mind?   
Bhagavan: Of course, we are employing the mind. It is well known and  
admitted that only with the help of of the mind, can the mind   
be killed. But instead of setting about saying that there is a mind,   
and I want to kill it, you begin to seek the source of the mind, and you find  
the mind does not exist at all. The mind turned outwards, results in thoughts  
and objects. Turned inwards, it becomes the Self.   
Day by Day, entry dated 11.1.1946   
Question: What is the difference between the mind and the Self?   
Bhagavan: There is no difference. The mind turned inwards is the   
Self. Turned outwards, it become the ego and all the world.....   
But the mind does not exist apart from the Self. i.e. It has no independent  
existence. The Self exists without the mind, never   
the mind without the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
