Some songs froma wonderfull book about Dzogchen Mediation....you will find  
great delight in reading it...it is worth the text....   
SONG SIX: Initiation into our true existential condition   
EHMAHO! Again, beloved children of my heart, listen! "Mind", this universal  
concept, this most significant of words, being no single entity, manifests as  
the gamut of pleasure and pain in samsara and nirvana. There are as many  
beliefs about it as there are approaches to Buddhahood. It has innumerable  
synonyms.   
In the vernacular it is "I"; some Hindus call it "the Self"; the Disciples say  
"self-less individual"; the followers of Mind-only call it simply "mind"; some  
call it "perfect insight"; some call it "Buddha-nature"; some call it "the  
Magnificent Stance" (Mahamudra); some call it "the Middle Way"; some call it  
"the cosmic seed"; some call it "the reality-continuum"; some call it "the  
universal ground"; some call it "ordinary consciousness". Since the synonyms  
of "mind", the labels we apply to it, are countless, know it for what it  
really is. Know it experientially as the here and now. Compose yourself in the  
natural state of your mind's nature.   
When at rest the mind is ordinary perception, naked and unadorned; when you  
gaze directly at it there is nothing to see but light; as Awareness, it is  
brilliance and the relaxed vigilance of the awakened state; as nothing  
specific whatsoever, it is a secret fullness; it is the ultimacy of nondual  
radiance and emptiness.   
It is not eternal, for nothing whatsoever about it has been proved to exist.  
It is not a void, for there is brilliance and wakefulness. It is not unity,  
for multiplicity is self-evident in perception. It is not multiplicity, for we  
know the one taste of unity. It is not an external function, for Awareness is  
intrinsic to immediate reality.   
In the immediate here and now we see the face of the Original Lord abiding in  
the heart centre. Identify yourself with him, my spiritual sons. Whoever  
denies him, wanting more from somewhere else, is like the man who has found  
his elephant but continues to follow its tracks. He may comb the three  
dimensions of the microcosmic world systems for an eternity, but he will not  
find so much as the name of Buddha other than the one in his heart.   
Such is my introduction initiating recognition of our true existential  
condition, which is the principal realization in Cutting Through to the Great  
Perfection.   
SONG SEVEN: Assertion of our Intrinsic Buddhahood   
EHMAHO! Once more listen attentively, my noble sons and daughters. The three  
modes of Buddha's being -- essence, nature and responsiveness -- and the five  
modes of being, as well as the five aspects of primal awareness, all are  
completed and perfected in the naturally luminous intrinsic awareness of the  
here and now.   
The essence of Awareness, indefinable by any term such as colour, shape or  
other attribute, is the dharmakaya; the inherent radiance of emptiness is the  
light of the sambhogakaya; and the unimpeded medium in which all things  
manifest is the nirmanakaya.   
The three modes are explained figuratively like this: the dharmakaya is a  
crystal mirror; the sambhogakaya is its nature -- brilliant clarity; and the  
nirmanakaya is the unobstructed medium in which the reflection appears.   
From the first, people's minds have existed as these three modes of being. If  
they are able to recognize this spontaneously, it is unnecessary for them to  
practise even so much as a moment of formal meditation -- the awakening to  
Buddhahood is instantaneous.   
In this introduction to the three modes they are defined separately. In truth,  
my heart-children, do not fall into the error of believing them to be  
separate, belonging to different continuums.   
From the beginning, the three modes of being are empty and utterly pure.  
Understanding them as a single essence that is the union of radiance and  
emptiness, conduct yourself in a state of detachment.   
The triad of essence, nature and responsiveness, again, corresponds to  
dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. Understanding these three as the  
mystic union of emptiness and radiance, conduct yourself in a state of  
detachment.   
Further, since the primal awareness of self-existing Awareness manifests  
everything whatsoever, this awareness is the pure-being of the Creator,  
Vairocana; since it is unchanging and unchangeable, it is the pure-being of  
Immutable Diamond, Aksobhya-vajra; since it is without centre or  
circumference, it is the pure-being of Boundless Light-form, Amitabha; since  
it is also the gem that is the source of supreme realization and relative  
powers, it is the pure-being of the Fountain of Jewels, Ratnasambhava; since  
it accomplishes all aspiration, it is the pure-being of the Fulfiller of All  
Ambition, Amoghasiddhi. These deities are nothing but the creative power of  
Awareness.   
The primal awareness of Awareness is mirror-like awareness because of the  
manifest clarity of its unobstructed essence. It is awareness of sameness  
because it is all-pervasive. It is discriminating awareness because the entire  
gamut of diverse appearances is manifest from its creativity. It is the  
awareness that accomplishes all actions because it fulfils all our ambition.  
It is awareness of the reality-continuum, the dharmadhatu, because the single  
essence of all these aspects of awareness is primal purity. Not so much as an  
atom exists apart from these which are the creativity of intrinsic Awareness.   
When a pointed finger introduces you directly and immediately to the three  
modes -- essence, nature and responsiveness -- and the Five Buddhas and the  
five aspects of awareness, all together, then what is experienced is  
brilliant, awakened Awareness unaffected by circumstance and uninfluenced by  
clinging thought; it is cognition of the here and now, unstructured and  
unaffected.   
All the Buddhas of the three aspects of time arise from this Awareness.  
Constantly identify yourselves with it, beloved sons and daughters, because  
this is the spirituality of all the Buddhas of the three aspects of time.   
Awareness is unstructured, natural radiance your own mind, so how can you say  
that you cannot see the Buddha? There is nothing at all to meditate upon in  
it, so how can you complain that meditation does not arise? It is manifest  
Awareness, your own mind, so how can you say that you cannot find it? It is a  
stream of unceasing radiant wakefulness, the face of your mind, so how can you  
say that you cannot see it? There is not so much as a moment of work to be  
done to attain it, so how can you say that your effort is unavailing? Centred  
and dispersed states are two sides of the same coin, so how can you say that  
your mind is never centred? Intrinsic Awareness is the spontaneously  
originated three modes of being, which is achieved without striving, so how  
can you say that your practice fails to accomplish it? It is enough to leave  
the mind in a state of non-action, so how can you say that you are incapable  
of attaining it? Your thoughts are released at the moment of their inception,  
so how can you say that the antidotes were ineffective? It is cognition of the  
here and now, so how can you say you do not perceive it?   
SONG EIGHT: The Method of Attaining Conviction   
EHMAHO! Once again, beloved sons and daughters, listen with devotion! "Mind in  
its insubstantiality is like the sky." Is this true or false, my children?  
Confirm it by relaxing completely and looking directly at the mind, gazing  
with your entire mind, free of all tension.   
"The emptiness of the mind is not just a blank nothingness, for without doubt  
it is the primal awareness of intrinsic Awareness, radiant from the first.  
Self-existent, natural radiance is like sunlight." Is this indeed true? To  
confirm it, relax completely, looking directly at the nature of your mind.   
"There is no doubt that it is impossible to objectify or grasp thought or the  
movement of memory. This capricious, changeable movement is like the cosmic  
wind!" Is this indeed so? To confirm it, relax completely, looking directly at  
the nature of your mind.   
"Without doubt all appearances whatsoever are our own manifestation. All  
phenomena, whatsoever manifests, is like reflection in a mirror." Is this  
indeed so? To confirm it, relax completely, looking directly at the nature of  
your mind.   
No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing to see  
other than that seen at the moment of vision. No experience is possible  
anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing to meditate upon other than  
mind. No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing  
to do other than what is done in the mind. No experience is possible anywhere  
but in the mind, so there is no samaya to be sustained outside the mind. No  
experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is no goal to be  
reached that is not in the mind.   
Look, look, and look again. Look at your own mind!   
Project your attention into external fields of space, and, attentively  
watching the nature of your mind, see if it moves. When you are convinced by  
observation that the mind does not move, retract your attention and  
concentrate upon the mind within, and look carefully for the projector of  
diffused thought. When you have decided that there is no entity responsible  
for thought patterns, look carefully for the colour and shape of the mind.  
When you arrive at the emptiness that has no colour or shape, look for a  
centre or circumference. Certain that middle and margin are the same, search  
for an inside and an outside. Finding no distinction between inside and  
outside, you arrive at Awareness, which is as vast as the sky.   
"By virtue of its all-penetrating freedom this Awareness that has no centre or  
circumference, no inside or outside, is innocent of all partiality and knows  
no blocks or barriers. This all-penetrating intrinsic Awareness is a vast  
expanse of space. All experience of samsara and nirvana arises in it like  
rainbows in the sky. In all its diverse manifestation it is but a play of  
mind."   
You need only look out from the motionless space of intrinsic Awareness at all  
experience, illusory like the reflection of the moon in water, to know the  
impossibility of dividing appearances from emptiness.   
"In a state of Awareness there is no separation of samsara and nirvana." Look  
out from the motionless space of intrinsic Awareness at all experience,  
illusory like the reflection in a mirror, and no matter what manifests it can  
never be tasted, its existence can never be proved. In this dimension samsara  
and nirvana do not exist and everything is the dharmakaya.   
All beings wandering in the three realms of samsara remain trapped in dualism  
until they realize that within their own perception resides the primal  
awareness that is the ultimate identity of all experience of samsara and  
nirvana. Due to the power of the delusive subject/object dichotomy, they hold  
samsara and nirvana to be different states of mind. They remain bound because,  
where in truth there is nonduality, they see a duality.   
In reality no distinction between samsara and nirvana can exist in anybody's  
mind. However, when the worldly fool rejects some things and indulges in  
others, avoiding the "bad" and cultivating the "good", despising one while  
loving another, then due to partiality, prejudice and bias, aimlessly he  
wanders through successive lives.   
Rather than attain the spontaneously accomplished three modes of intrinsic  
Awareness without striving, thick-headed aspirants explore the techniques and  
stages of many time-consuming methods of "self-improvement", leaving them no  
time to reach the seat of the Buddha.   
"Emphatically, all phenomenal appearances whatsoever are one's own vision."  
Look out from the state of motionless intrinsic Awareness and all light-form  
and animate existence is like reflection. Appearances are empty, sound is  
empty and indeed one's own nature is originally empty.   
Similarly, turn your attention inwards to the mind that is the viewer, and  
your thought processes, naturally subsiding, are empty like the sky,  
unstructured, free of conceptual elaboration, utterly indeterminable, beyond  
description, concept and expression of any kind.   
All events whatsoever are an illusory magical display of mind and all the  
magical display of mind is baseless and empty. When you have realized that all  
events are your own mind, all visual appearances become the empty dharmakaya.   
Appearances are not binding. It is through attachment to them that beings are  
fettered. Sever all delusive attachments, children of my heart!

Dear matthias,   
Dzogchen Meditation - Wonderful. The flight of Garuda, is a great   
simile used in almost all religions. Bhagavan Ramana says 'bird'   
though not specifically Garuda. He says in Sri Arunachala Stuti   
Panchakam, like a bird flying all over the ocean, which has no resting   
place, excepting the land, the mind wanders everywhere, but it   
can rest only in the Self, within.   
Arunachala Siva.
