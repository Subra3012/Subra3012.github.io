## Guru's Words

Amiatall wrote about Guru's words and Chuck Cliff made a remark   
about the words being the Word and the silence between the two   
words, like the silence between the two notes of music.   
Once there was a Guru, who told his disciple: "My hip is paining.   
I shall lie down turned one side. Please press your leg on the   
hip to set balm the pain."   
The disciple cried and said: "O Guru, No, No. I shall not press   
your hip with my leg."   
The Guru said: "Now, You have kicked my tongue with your   
reply!"   
Arunachala Siva.

On the second page of the interview, at the bottom, is an exchange I'd like to  
mention in the context of "words"   
Quote  
I don't say things simply to convince people that they are true. I am not  
speaking about these matters so that people can build up a philosophy that can  
be rationally defended, and which is free of all contradictions. When I speak  
my words, I am not speaking to your mind at all. I am directing my words  
directly at consciousness. **I am planting my words** in your consciousness.  
If you disturb the planting process by arguing about the meaning of the words,  
they won't take root there. Once my words have been planted in consciousness,  
they will sprout, they will grow, and at the appropriate moment they will bear  
fruit.  
The words I put in bold stick out for anybody coming from a Christian  
background, but more important, give an inkling of what is meant by a "word"  
in the spiritual sense. An analogy with music: the music is what is going on  
between the notes.   
Could it be that all teaching is in silence, that the [spoken] words "only"  
get/entice us to listen to the silence?   
(Here, at bottom, you can see this exchange as David recalled it later
