Dear non duel, It is quite sometime, since we heard from you.   
Today's menu is Kothavariakai Kootu. Kothavaraikai is called   
Indian culster beans. It is narrower in size than the regular   
beans, with a needle like top. It is more tasty.   
Cut kothavarai kai into small pieces, after throwing away the   
neddle tops. Keep them in a basin of water. Take a pan,   
put tamarind paste and water and boil it. Add required salt,   
coriander and asafoetiday. When it is boiling, mix the cut pieces   
of kothavarai kai and stir and boil it further till the whole thing   
becomes a thick gravy. Put off the burner. Take separately,   
a pan, put gingeley oil, mustard seeds, bengal gram and toor dhal   
heat the mixture, till mustard seeds start bursting. Put off the   
burner and add the mixture to the thick gravy. Add coriander   
and curry leaves and stir thoroughly.   
Kothavarai kai kootu is ready. This can be taken with rice or   
bread.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, yes, Silence is the Self. Here again it is very difficult   
to practise. Bhagavan said that silence does not simply mean not   
mouthing words, but it is stillness of the mind. The so called mouna-   
yogis who abound today, are silent without words, but write answers   
on a slate to the seeker's questions. Is it silence. The silence is the   
halting of the ever grinding machine, that is mind! It is the stillness   
of the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, please do that practice. In Who am I? there are   
several aids given for self-realization. Please read and see   
how may one can practise.   
Arunachala Siva.

When it is silence, it is not merely not mouthing of words, but   
it is silence of the mind. It is, as you said, the Self. Bhagavan   
said: Silence is the uninterruped speech! It is like one hand   
clapping of the Zen masters.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Yes. Silence is where nothing else appears. Silence   
is where there are no attachments, because in non-attachment,   
nothing appears. (Who am I?)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subrahmaniyan ji   
No here I learnt another definition for self. First I knew it is everywhere  
all the time and it is only bliss, consiousness and awarness. Now it is  
silence also.   
They say in Tamil, UMAI KANDA KANAVU. Means, after realisation, silence comes  
to that person so he becomes dumb.   
When other asks him, he may not express what he has seen and he may not like  
to express. By the way, I tried Mouna vratham. But I found mind chaters lot  
rather than normal days.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mounam or Silence is not merely abstaining from mouthing of words.\   
In silence, mind works out so many thoughts. True Silence is a   
thoughtlessness. When the words and thoughts cease their work,   
naturally, the deeds also will not take place. In Kanchipuram, Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswati used to observe kashta mounam, where   
even swallowing the saliva will not be there, since swallowing of   
saliva will also make a noise.   
Bhagavan Ramana's mounam was speechless, thoughtless and   
actionless. That is the state, by practising which, one can attain   
the self. Bhagavan also said that the mounam is an uninturrupted   
speech, in the sense that at that stage the individual souls talks   
for ever with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
