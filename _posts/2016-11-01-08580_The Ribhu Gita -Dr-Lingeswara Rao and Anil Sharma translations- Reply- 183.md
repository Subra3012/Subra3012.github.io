42. Brahman indeed is all, verily the Self. There is not a trace apart from Brahman.   
Everything is unreal, the world is unreal. Being appearance, it is like the  
pot and such.   
43. Brahman indeed am I; there is no doubt of this. Being consciousness I ever am.   
Brahman indeed, being of the nature of the pure and the seer, is itself the  
greatest.   
44. I alone am the supreme Brahman. I alone am the beyond the beyond.   
I alone am the one beyond the mind. I alone am the world transcending.   
45\. I alone am the eternal Self. I am of the illusory nature. Bliss am I,  
without   
support. Brahman alone is, nothing else.   
46\. I am Brahman, nothing else; naught else but the undiminishing awareness.   
Anything other than the Self is despicable. Other than Self, there is no 'I'.   
47. Other than the Self, I have no body. The Self alone am I. I have no impurities.   
My mind is only established in the Self. I am only the Self. It is not  
separate.   
48. I am the Self alone. I am the void. The Self alone am I; nothing is mine.   
The Self alone is; there are no qualities. The Self alone is; there is  
nothing separate.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
