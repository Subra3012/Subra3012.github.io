Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear friends,   
 SAT Sangh is not something to be "done". .. it is something to be recognized. .. that The Self every IS, here and now is to be realized. That understanding is true Sat Sangh.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?   
Love!

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get

jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

like that, they are supposed to subside. .. so the person's life returns to

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

like that, they are supposed to subside. .. so the person's life returns to

There is zero use in going to holy places -- from spiritual purpose. Someone's

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?   
Love!

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.

desires start floating in. Fulfillment of desires is not the way to go beyond  
the desires.

Dear all,   
 I am very much benefited by going to holy places and holy people spiritually.They help our mind to reflect the divine "as it is" without any distortion.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?   
Love!

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature

if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

like that, they are supposed to subside. .. so the person's life returns to

There is zero use in going to holy places -- from spiritual purpose. Someone's

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any place instead  
see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not for others who  
are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
This is not so. For anyone. .. ripe or otherwise. .. changing place of his /  
her stay is totally useless pursuit.   
What happens is, due to one's emotional attachment, one might feel very  
special on the first few days... later on, emotions subside.. emotions are  
like that, they are supposed to subside. .. so the person's life returns to  
the regular routine. ..   
There is zero use in going to holy places -- from spiritual purpose. Someone's  
desire may be to go and live in a holy place... that might be fulfilled by  
going there. .. but like every other desire, after the desire is fulfilled new  
desires start floating in. Fulfillment of desires is not the way to go beyond  
the desires.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?   
Love!

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?   
Love!

Dear srk udai,   
 To me Arunachala is more than a holy person because it conveys Truth to me and i bought a small apartment opposite Ramanasramam   
to spend more time at Tiruvnnamalai.It attracted many saints like  
Bhagawan.There Truth is revealed unasked,how i do not know.

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear sirs,   
To write a full sentence we need to learn alphabet and we need a place  
(school) and one teacher (one guru} In the same way when we want to see  
ourselves, we need a holy name, holy place and holy guru. Once you learn all  
these, need not   
to go anywhere. So what Bhagavan said about Arunachala is 100% correct. In  
beginning the Hill acts like a school then after realising us, our self become  
Arunachala. What Srk udai ji says is correct that no need of going to any  
place instead see within, it is for those who realised themselves. But not  
for others who are still strugling to have full awarness always.   
They should go to their tuned places,do all the practices without failure.   
Once Kabir also said, if taking bath in a holy river is auspicious and can go  
to heaven, then all fishes can easily go to heaven.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana always stressed the need of contemplating on   
Arunachala Hills or going to Tiruvannamalai, as way to 'cleanse'   
ourselves. If one could see the Self within, without going anywhere,   
it is the best, no doubt. But majority of the seekers need the   
Power of the Presence. The power of the Presence helps the seekers   
to a great extent. Arunachala Puranam and Arunachala Mahatmyam,   
both stress only this. Sat Sangh is another great opportunity. Here   
again, Sat would mean the Self or the the society or the group   
of people that abide in Sat. This also helps the true seekers. Bhagavan   
has said in His poem: The heat (or miseries of life) is cooled by the moon's rays, the   
riches (or the riches of Self Knowledge), are obtained with Karpaga   
Tree, (the Wishfulling Tree of the Heavans), the sins (or our vasanas)   
are washed away by Ganga, but the Satsangh does all the three   
simultaneously. We need not wait for the full moon, nor go to   
the heavans for Karpaga, nor go to North India for Ganga bath.   
All happens by merely being in the company of such peoplee who   
are nearby.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Dr. Raju,   
The second comes first. I am benefited more by visiting Tiruvannamalai   
and I have not visited many places in the recent past, excepting two   
visits to Tiruvannamalai.   
Dear srkudai,   
This gives rise to a question: Why then Ramana, after self realization   
in Madurai house, went to Tiruvannamalai?   
He could have continued to remain in the Self, in Tiruchuzhi or   
Madurai. If the 'family' was a reason, then a bigger 'family' came   
to Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for non-distrubance from others, thousands of devotees came   
to Him and 'disturbed' Him in Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for 'preaching', first of all, He did not like to 'preach' anything   
to anyone. Even assuming, He wanted to 'preach' something to someone,   
He could have done it in Tiruchuzhi or Tiruvannamalai.   
If it is for anyone reason, it is because He felt that there is some   
power in Arunachala and it would be conducive for His remaining   
life in His body.

Dear Raju,   
Meeting holy people is totally different. if the person has "Seen" the Truth,  
he can convey it. so it is very beneficial.   
But holy places . were you benefited by going there or did you simply feel  
better ?   
I think people just feel better. And those who understand the Truth... may  
spend that time in getting established in that but it is just emotional it  
passes away. Wont remain for long. try staying there for 100 days.   
You stay in BVRM right ? There is that Siva Temple out there which is pretty  
famous. Why therefore do we not consider BVRM as a holy place?

Dear Raju,   
Even a Holy person. .. unless he speaks to you and shows you ur True Nature  
... he is absolutely useless.   
if you go and sit before a holy man, and he speaks nothing. .. you sit there  
for 10 hours every day for days together. .. nothing shall happen.   
If the Jnani radiates peace. .. one may feel peaceful, but that becomes a  
dependent... someone has to tell them and they will have to see within,  
themselves that that peace is their own nature. unless one sees within oneself  
that one is not affected by thoughts. .. what is the use of reducing thoughts  
temporarily.   
Many people went to Ramana and had wonderful experiences. .. but it was His  
Teaching that finally transformed them. An experience is just a state of mind  
... no state of mind can lead to liberation. one needs education that one is  
independent of all states of mind that is liberation when seen by the  
individual within.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true what you are saying. The holy jnani should radiate. people will  
have peace in his presence and they will become silence.They will become  
witness of their own thoughts. As Subramaniyan ji told for my post, people who  
are like Arjuna will get the benifit of jnanai but not all. Others may get  
peace for time being. The true seeker, who aspires can have the benifit of  
jnani's presence. There is nothing wrong. Yes, the seeker should not become  
dependant of his guru or teacher and in the same way the teacher should not  
allow his deciple to follow him always. Bhagavan also sent his devotees to  
practice self enquiry leaving the ashram. When Adi sankra roamed India from  
kashmir to kanyakumari, taught advaita how many soul got liberated. He did his  
duty. Those who had already thirst and were in 3/4of ripened conditon would  
have got jnanam like Mandala misra. It is all play of divine. When a man gets  
satisfaction of food it does not mean to say, the hotels should be closed.  
There may be lots of people who may be having hungry to eat. After having food  
the man can help others to eat in the same hotel. This is my poor knowlege.  
Until we become paripurnam we can have all aids. It may go away itself. Anyway  
all begining will have the end. Is not it? When the person, come to know his  
guru and his teachings all is his own self nothing is outside, he would not  
attend anymore sat sangam

I forgot to add this lines in my post. Adi Sankara sang in his bhajagovindam,  
Sat sangthve nis sanathvam...   
So for jivan mukthi for a common man sat sang, it is essential. To get jivan  
mukthi there are so many ways.Every one cannot practice Raja yoga, This sat  
sanga is very simple even a common man can understand. It is like a kinder  
garten school to begin his spiritual journey. Attending this sat sang, family  
men and women can get education about their spirit.Majority of the people do  
not know Sanskrit to read our veda. All the upanishads are being told by  
powranic stories where common people can easily understand. Slowly he will  
step into bhakti, then vairagya then jnanam. Is not it?

Arjuna Lived With Krishna. .. Walked, Talked, Played. .. He was the best  
Friend of none other than Sri Krishna   
And yet, he had to be told 17 chapters of Gita to reveal the Truth.   
The teaching. .. Verbal. .. is absolutely necessary. There is no alternative.  
The Truth has to be revealed and it has to be seen. Sri Ramana is an  
Exception... but i think he might have been already prepared in previous lives  
or perhaps he is Avtar !

Dear Srk udai,   
 Three types of contact with Jnani are possible depending on the receptive level of the disciple.   
1)Body contact-some people are impressed by the charisma of Jnani but unable  
to understand the meaning of what he says.   
2)Mental contact-Some are able to understand the teachings of the master but  
miss the beauty,silence,bliss of his presence.If the master   
does not speak then they feel it is a waste of sitting near him.   
3)Heart to heart contact-Here the disciple is connected to master's heart and  
enjoys the blissful presence of the master.The words of the   
master are secondary to him.Cow Lakshmi got realised by the presence of  
Bhagawan only.Bhagawan's mother got realised not because of teaching   
of Bhagawan but due to transfer of Bhagawan's sacred energy to his  
mother.Teaching helps for preparing the mind for self realisation   
but it has no power to confer self realisation.In India many mistake learned  
people who has the capacity to teach without any self experience   
as Jnanis.   
Sitting near a Jnani is real satsangh and is highly beneficial for spiritual  
growth.The word Upanishad literally means sitting near a Jnani.

Bhagavan was avatar only. He did not have any prarabdha in his mind except the  
cancer. At the age of 17 he realised and lived his whole life as an example of  
true jivan mukta for coming age.

Dear Ramanaduli, Dr. Raju, srkudai and others,   
Some one wrote in another website quoting a Chinmayananda   
disciple that "Ramana did not attain the Self realization, as he   
was not having Vedanta knowledge." This gave rise to a series   
of comments. There are a few things about this. The Hindus unlike   
certain other Western religions do not believe in one-birth concept.   
There are several births for a living being and it acquires knowledge   
of the Self through them. Hence to say Bhagavan Ramana did not   
have Vedanta knowledge is absolute foolishness. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha sang about Siva at the age of three. Hence Bhagavan   
was a Brahma Jnani and there was no need for Him to read Vedanta   
during His birth. To say He is an avatara is another matter. We   
shall not discuss it now.   
Then, about devotees. Poeple do come to Him with different   
carry bags of vasanas. Some with great Vedanta knowledge.   
Some Western devotees too could have attained Vedanta knowledge   
during their previous births. One does not know. But the point is   
Bhagavan Ramana's Asram and Arunachala by themselves have got   
the power to impart self knowledge because the power of the presence   
there is abundant.   
Again teaching part. Some devotees do not need any teaching. His   
mere looks were sufficient. Some others, by a mere touch of His   
feet attained the state of bliss. There are incidents on these.   
Sri Sadhu Om was once asked by another: How come, you are   
giving so many new insights into Bhagavan Ramana's teachings, when   
you had spent only less than 5 years with Him, though many had   
spent decades with Him?" Sri Sadhu Om answered: "Even five years   
is a concession given to this poor me. A fit recipient would have   
attained His state, even with a mere look!"   
I think, this sums the position.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
The word Upanishad means sitting near SAT. But essentially there is no ASAT  
 so everyone is sitting near SAT. Right now you are sitting near Ramana. ..  
and u cannot get nearer to him! The whole point is to see that you are sitting  
with Ramana Right now. .. If we do not see. .. Teaching is required.   
Lakshmana stayed with Rama, Talked to Rama, Served Rama. .. and yet he had to  
be taught "Rama Gita"   
and was Lakshmana an average person? He himself was extraordinary.   
Same with Arjuna, Hanuman[Hanuma Gita].   
Rama himself had to be taught by Vasishta. Vasishta did not touch him and say: LO u r Liberated.   
Janaka had to be taught by Ashtavakra.   
Just see that even such great people required teaching. Perhaps someone who  
has already got the Truth. .. just trying to remain established in it. .. such  
a person may stay with a Guru and see how he is living it out and himself  
learn. That is how some advanced sadhakas who saw the Truth already remained  
with Ramana and learnt. Even there Body's presence was very important. Only  
case i can remember is that of Dakshinamurthy.   
But a doubt. Right now i stay in Hyderabad. Tell me, how far am i from Ramana  
?   
So why do i need to come to Arunachala ?   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the   
dignity given to us by the existence.What you are following may be better for  
you and what i am following is better for my mind set.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this discussion is sat sangha....   
and the forum is guided by the grace of ramana maharishi...I will go and sit  
and look against a wall for a little bit (in fact 80% of the people I know  
would hate this and would think it is totally silly, but I really do like to  
look against a white wall for an hour or more)

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?   
Love!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?   
Love!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?   
Love!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

Dear Raju,   
 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the   
dignity given to us by the existence.What you are following may be better for  
you and what i am following is better for my mind set.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

Dear Raju,   
 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the   
dignity given to us by the existence.What you are following may be better for  
you and what i am following is better for my mind set.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling

why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.

Dear Raju,   
 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the   
dignity given to us by the existence.What you are following may be better for  
you and what i am following is better for my mind set.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling

why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the   
dignity given to us by the existence.What you are following may be better for  
you and what i am following is better for my mind set.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is

without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.

identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote

ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.   
Love!

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Ramanaduli and others,   
The Presence of a Brahmajnani or a temple, stills the mind and the ego,   
apart from making him to proceed further for self realization. Stillness   
comes first. The quietening of the mind and ego has been experienced   
my many devotees. Paul Brunton came with several questions, with   
a long paper. The mind is made calm and quiet and then the answers   
get revealed without 'asking'. This is the experience of many devotees   
who came to Arunachala and also to the Asram to be with Bhagavan   
Ramana. Chittam dhanai Sivamakki... says Manikkavachagar. A Guru   
or a temple make your mind calm and then make it blissful. Sivam   
is Knowledge and Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this discussion is sat sangha....   
and the forum is guided by the grace of ramana maharishi...I will go and sit  
and look against a wall for a little bit (in fact 80% of the people I know  
would hate this and would think it is totally silly, but I really do like to  
look against a white wall for an hour or more)

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

 So far no two inviduals attained self realisation in a similar manner.Every one treads his own path in his unique way and that is the

Dear Raju,   
 Mind set. .. All mind sets are maya. This is what i am trying to put forth.   
All mind sets. You being Consciousness... you cannot be touched by the state  
of mind.   
As long as one trys to "Set" a mind state... one can never be liberated.  
Somewhere... somehow one   
has to recognize that the state of mind is not going to touch us: We are  
Consciousness.   
Without this Liberation is not possible.   
This is how i see it. People may follow any path : Jnana Viheena sarva mathena  
bajathi na muktim janma sathena. .. unless they obtain Jnana that they are  
Consciousness. .. they will not get liberated. What ever be the path they  
follow.   
Please do not mind my comments. .. i just try to present my view. its for you  
to decide what is appropriate for you.

Once a Muslim gentleman came and asked Bhagavan Ramana: Do you believe in a formless god or god with form?   
Bhagavan replied: I believe in both.   
The gentleman: Then, you are wrong. The god is formless.   
Bhagavan: Now, tell me, do you have a form?   
The gentleman: Yes. I have this body.   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens, when you go to sleep.   
The gentleman: It is not there. But it is there, when I wake up!   
Bhagavan: Then, what happens when you die?   
The gentleman: Then, they take it away and bury it.   
Bhagavan: Who said to bury that?   
The gentleman: I do not know. My wife would say.   
Bhagavan: Then, what does your wife like? Your body or mind.   
The gentleman: ( a little confused in the trap): Both. The body   
 when I am alive and my memories, when I am dead.   
Bhagavan: This is what I am also doing. I believe in form when   
 I have thoughts about the form, and the formless when   
 thoughts cease!   
All loads lead to Tiruvannamalai, or to Bodh Gaya or the Mecca,   
 or to Shirdi, or to the Vatican.

Dear Srk Udai,   
 By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at ease with myself and feel at home.I like Hindu temples   
of Tamilnadu and definitely i could feel presence of the Divine.Bhagawan got  
realisation in Madurai and there is no need for him to go all the   
way to Tiruvannamalai and stayed there uninterruptedly for 54 yrs and he  
identified Siva Lingam in Arunachaleswara temple as Siva himself.   
He declared that Giri is the body of Siva.He and Jnana Sambandhar has idenfied  
the Giri as the effulgence of Siva(Jyoti swaroopa).Many saints   
like Mannikkavachakar who finally dissolved in Nataraja of Chidambaram are  
attached to Arunachala and wrote thousands of poems on Arunachala.   
Arunagiri Nadha,Guhai Namassivair,Guru Namassivair,Virupaksha Devara,are very  
much attached to Arunachala apart from thousands of unknown   
saints.All of them are advaitins but still are attached to Arunachala.Their  
mind set makes them like that.This type of mind set belongs to   
Suddha Manas and it will not interfere in fixing of mind in the self.Probably  
we carry such Sattwic tendencies(Daivee sanskaras) from many   
incarnations and i dont think they are an obstacle to self knowledge.

Dear Raju,   
Quote  
By mind set i mean i have some favorite places and people where i am at   
ease with myself and feel at home   
Yes i understand that. You say, you are at ease with yourself. Now tell   
me... "Who is this ? "   
The Self is at ease where ever it is. Infact, it cannot decide to not   
be at any place it is everywhere.   
The body is dead entity... wherever you drop it, it remains like a log.   
So surely it is the "mind" \- ego. In being at Arunachala, we are   
actually agreeing to ego's demands.   
Please sir, these are very important points and i am taking lot of care   
to present the idea properly. Please see this carefully.   
The ego of a person who is habituated to alcohol is comfortable with   
the bottle of alcohol. He can as well say that with this bottle, i feel   
more at ease with myself. The ego of a person who is attached to Ramana   
feels at east at Ramanashram. The ego of a person who is attached to   
Ramakrishna feels at ease at Dakshineswar / Belur Math. A person who   
does not care for Ramana. .. who is interested, perhaps, in only   
science and hates religions. .. would not find this "ease" at   
Ramanashram.   
Sir, please just see whether what is being presented is truth or not.   
You would like to go to Ramanashram but would not plan to go to Macca   
... that is but natural... coz your ego, born out of your past, is thus   
moulded.   
This is so with me also. I am attached to Ramana, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba   
etc. .. so if i go to those places i would feel very serene.   
Now sir, agreeing to "Ego's" demands. .. this is the root cause of all   
our problems. Let us pick up a place where ego is totally unhappy. Go   
and sit there, and see clearly how ego cannot touch us. This makes ego   
"in-effective". .. the mind gets Firmly established in Being. But if we   
"Agree" to that "Ego" and make its comfort, our comfort... make its   
discomfort our discomfort. .. then ego will continue. .. changing   
colours. .. changing behaviour. .. earlier it was attached to senses,   
now it gets attached to religious texts and then gives an impression s   
if soon we will find liberation.   
that is ego. .. it will present as if "soon" we shall get it.   
with respect to senses it says soon we will become happy through money,   
sex, name and fame etc. With respect to religion it says soon we shall   
be happy through pranayama, going to different places, doing japa,   
doing dhyana etc. it is the same cheating of ego that is continuing. ..   
only in a different grab here.   
I did not speak abt Ramana's going to Arunachala. .. coz i do not know why he  
went. .. but surely he did not ask his disciple to remain at Arunachala !   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I think i have already answered to all your queries in my previous post to you.When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.The ego may feel   
at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling of thought  
process with blissful awareness.You asked me what is that entity   
which is feeling at ease,it is definitely ego.I am not a self realised soul  
but my journey towards Truth is like this.Here jorney is not literal   
because there is no need to travel,i mean by journey is to recognise the  
nonexistence of the ego and this is my unique way for that.   
Finally what counts is self experience whatever is the method,the method may  
look irrational but it works.Bhagawan being an advaitin   
came to Arunachala and went inside the temple and hugged the Linga and said  
"Father,i came here at your order".Here who is uttering those words,   
all pervasive self which has no need to speak like that or the insentient body  
which has no capacity to speak like that.It is the Pure ego   
of a Jnani which speaks like that.Pure ego does not in anyway obstruct the  
effulgence of the self.Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had advaitic   
experience through Trotapuri but never stopped worshipping Kali.Here what is  
the entity that worshipped Kali even after advaitic experience.   
He used to weep if Vivekananda comes a bit late.So the behaviour of a devotee  
need not fit into set standards of sastras,what is important   
is whether he is a genuine Truth seeker or not.Whatever is the approach  
holding on to self conscious being is vital.All methods including   
self enquiry are as real and as false as the "false i" i.e the ego but they  
help in holding on to the self conscious being.

Dear Srkudai ji   
It is true that our ego is satisfied when we obey to its order. When the ego  
tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good? instead of diverting on  
unwanted subjects like gossip, drugs etc. As Raju ji says, when our mind have  
no thoughts, if the stillness comes then we can have that type of ego. like a  
pure mind. By practicing day by day, ego itself go away.   
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position. If he tells then he  
does not become to that state. Anyway your posts are helping lots. Before  
doing the sadhana, it helps to question within ourselves, who makes the  
decision. so we can observe whether it is from our mind or ego, whether it is  
a suggestion or command. I tried many ways in tastes. But after sometimes if  
you go against your ego, it becomes habit only, but does not help to stillness  
of mind.

and look against a wall for a little bit (in fact 80% of the people I know  
would hate this and would think it is totally silly, but I really do like to  
look against a white wall for an hour or more)

Dear Matthias,   
It is not silly. This could be one way of quietening the mind.   
Muruganar, the famous poet-devotee of Bhagavan Ramana used   
to go out to the open ground within the Asram and just look at   
the sky at early nights. These were not, mind you, full moon days!   
He just looked the sky to get piece. This could be, what Buddhists   
call, 'one hand clapping!'   
Bobby Fisher, the famous chess player, who defeated Boris   
Spassky and got the world championship crown in Iceland,   
asked for a room without balcony and without the sight of   
swimming pool, closed the door and simply looked at the door   
or the wall, to quieten his mind or concentrate his mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
Point 1: Behaviour of Realized people need not fit into normal definitions.   
My view: Yes. I agree.   
Point 2: Quote  
The ego may feel at ease with drugs also but there is no spontaneous stilling  
of thought process with blissful awareness  
why ? It is stilling of thought process.   
they also feel blissful.   
All Bliss one experiences. .. whether materialistic or otherwise. .. it is the  
bliss of the Self.   
Point 3: Quote  
When the ego is at ease with itself in the divine   
presence of a place or master there is spontaneous stilling of thought and  
there is revelation of blissful awareness of the self.   
yes, this is revealed in every sensual experience... how has it helped anyone  
?   
Love!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
When the ego tells to go a temple or do a japa, is not it good?   
 The ego, understanding that it cannot find pleasure in senses, is trying to  
find it elsewhere. That is what it is doing in going to Japa. No liberation  
is possible through karama. .. and japa is a karma. Jnana is required.   
Quote  
It is very difficult to come to stillness. It is like walking of sword. The  
person who wins the game he only knows about his position   
On the contrary, its impossible to be anything but "Still". .. its impossible  
to "act".   
In Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna says: The Real can never be made to change as  
even the unreal cannot be stopped from dying. That is the point. What is seen  
as changing, now calm, now agitated. .. now growing in spirituality, now  
lessening. .. that thing is not the Real thing. Coz a Real entity cannot be  
changing, moving etc. it is like a serpent imagined in a rope.   
And that which is Real. .. The Self, is not changing even now... right now. ..  
it is immobile. .. STILLNESS ITSELF. Even if you try ur best... u cannot make  
it move a wee bit!   
Consciousness is ever still... there is no question of its moving at all.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 The divine presence is not a sensual experience and it's effect has to be felt subjectively.There is no use of extending dialogue in this matter.I agree to disagree with you and i am closing this dialogue with you in this particular matter.

Dear Raju,   
 As such i too am saying the same thing... it being not a sensual experience, it has nothing to do with physical presence/place/time! The very fact that someone is associating a physical place with it means its made sense related. .. and that is not right.   
anyways...its ok if you do not want to discuss it further.

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is true. Consiousness is changeless.It is every still. So we do not need to  
change and make it still. It is the mind only feel restless and want  
stillness. But it is also true mind cannot be still and restfulness because  
it is its nature. Just we can observe its play. Here I want to tell you, FOR  
BEGINERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Every body cannot be Bhagavan in this birth. But  
as Krishna says in Gita, slowly we can cultivate to observe the mind. For  
that, all religious experts found some way to follow. People who are in  
comfort in their habit can follow their own path. Until we can observe the  
mind we need some aiids like rituals. There is nothing wrong. It is like  
bringing from impurity to purity,Some people does not need in this birth coz.  
they might have done lots of sadhana in their previous birth. tHEY SAY  
SAMAJDHARWOLOKON ISHARA KAFI HAI. Doing japa also is one karma as you say. but  
it is sat karma. It will lead us to our self. That is all. They say in  
sastras, being a man he should do, Nithya karma, pithru karma, Rishi karma and  
Deva karma. that too yeta sakthi. After geting knowledge from Vashista Ram did  
all His karma. and After learning from Sandeepani He also did all karma. When  
they all did why we are ordinary people shoult stop. You also said, there is  
should not be doer ship. So practicing vichara marga, if we do all the karmas  
without any doership. and without excepting any result is a tapas. I  
understood this way. After all no one is compeling any body. and not possible  
also. After doing vichara we can understand all the problems due to OUR MIND  
ONLY.   
There is no place to be reached and nothing is there to be realised. While  
doing karmas we can observe our ego more deepily.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Its like a person playing role in a Drama. The person unfortunately is getting  
identified with the character he is playing.   
Naturally he cannot enjoy the roles he is playing. He cannot stop playing.   
I was studying Sri Ramana's commentry on Vivekachudamani its beautiful.  
Ramana explains: Abide as the Self.   
Please see. .. The rememberance that i am the Self playing this role of a  
"Software Engineer", with a "wife", with parents and a brother of someone etc  
... this is the role. .. and i am the consciousness in whose presence the role  
is happening. Thus seeing that the body is a grab that is picked up for the  
role... i do not have a body.   
The rememberance is very important. When we forget this that is when the  
problem is.   
For the one who has no conviction. .. who does not see himself as  
consciousness unaffected by the happenings: who thinks he is getting affected  
by the happenings, it is important to see the mind and how we ourselves are  
getting into the thoughts and thoughts cannot touch us without our wrong  
identification. This leads to conviction that i am the Self and that leads to  
firm Abidence in it.   
Japa, Prayer, Meditation are useful. .. but a person can go on doing it life  
long without understanding that he is the Self. .. and such a person will not  
find liberation... unless he learns that he is the Self.   
Love!

Dear everyone,   
Japa, prayer and meditation are all aids to self enquiry, because   
these bring about one thought of the Godhead, instead of many   
thoughts which slowly weaken but spread more and more. This   
is as per Who am I?. Ekakrita is obtained through such activities,   
and it helps to do self enquiry. To say that japa, prayer and meditation   
are not required is like doing pole vault without the pole!

identified with the character he is playing.   
Naturally he cannot enjoy the roles he is playing. He cannot stop playing.   
I was studying Sri Ramana's commentry on Vivekachudamani its beautiful.  
Ramana explains: Abide as the Self.   
Please see. .. The rememberance that i am the Self playing this role of a  
"Software Engineer", with a "wife", with parents and a brother of someone etc  
... this is the role. .. and i am the consciousness in whose presence the role  
is happening. Thus seeing that the body is a grab that is picked up for the  
role... i do not have a body.   
The rememberance is very important. When we forget this that is when the  
problem is.   
For the one who has no conviction. .. who does not see himself as  
consciousness unaffected by the happenings: who thinks he is getting affected  
by the happenings, it is important to see the mind and how we ourselves are  
getting into the thoughts and thoughts cannot touch us without our wrong  
identification. This leads to conviction that i am the Self and that leads to  
firm Abidence in it.   
Japa, Prayer, Meditation are useful. .. but a person can go on doing it life  
long without understanding that he is the Self. .. and such a person will not  
find liberation... unless he learns that he is the Self.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear everyone,   
Japa, prayer and meditation are all aids to self enquiry, because   
these bring about one thought of the Godhead, instead of many   
thoughts which slowly weaken but spread more and more. This   
is as per Who am I?. Ekakrita is obtained through such activities,   
and it helps to do self enquiry. To say that japa, prayer and meditation   
are not required is like doing pole vault without the pole!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Please do not worry. Not much water has flown since your last   
operation. You have come back from US, and you have to get   
re-acclimatize to the Indian diaspora. There are powercuts,   
there are voltage fluctuations, and there are breakdowns which   
are not set right for days and weeks.   
Arunachala Siva.
