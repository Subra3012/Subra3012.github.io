Dear vinita,   
I saw one video which runs for a few minutes in the Asramam.   
Bhagavan Ramana is walking with a few people, a difficult walk,   
with climbing up and climbling down the stairs, sitting on a coir-cot outside,  
people sitting on the floor, and some eats are being distributed. Bhagavan  
takes the cup, and takes the nuts, one   
by one.   
Someone tried to record the audio of Bhagavan Ramana's words   
in conversations in the Old Hall. Bhagavan Ramana said: Why this? The person  
did not bother. Finally, it turned out that nothing was   
recorded on the gramaphone!   
Arunachala Siva.

The rare footages are also available in the Ashram bookstore.   
These may well be the only motion pictures of a spiritually realized person of  
a very high stature.   
There is also a footage showing Paramahamsa Yogananda when he came to visit  
Bhagavan.   
These are very precious treasures which will inspire people and dispel many  
doubts from their minds.

yes, i too saw that footage of yogananda's meeting with ramana maharishi.   
There are some clearer videos that i chanced upon. One of them has even  
captured maharishi's essential teachings in his own voice (i presume). u can  
follow these at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlRkmbqRB88   
There are 3 parts of this video...A,B and C!

Dear silentgreen, vinita.   
This Youtube business, confounds everyone, as Self Enquiry does.   
I have seen in the video showing Parahamsa Yogananda. Here was   
a man, with long silken robes, perhaps with trousers inside and with   
large flowing hairs. Bhagavan Ramana is sitting with only codpiece,   
and shaven head and cheeks, as if saying: "Why all these? Even   
this kaupina and why even this body, is a concession that I have   
assumed!"   
As regards His speech, I still believe that there are no spoken   
messages of Bhagavan Ramana recorded. Once someone tried   
using an empty gramaphone, to record His speech. Bhagavan   
Ramana said: "Why? You cannot record anything!" Nothing could   
be recorded!   
Arunachala Siva.

The first footage on the youtube is also available as a VCD in ashram  
bookstore with some more footages.   
All the footages in the VCD are silent motion pictures.
