Please, could someone translate this to english? Can't find translation.   
Just heard it and tears were flowing very hard.   
Jyota se jyota jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
He yogesvara he gyanesvara   
He saravesvara he paramesvara   
Nija kripa barasavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Hama balaka tere dvara pe aye   
Mangala darasa dikhavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Sisa jhukaya kare teri arati   
Prema sudha barasavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Antara me yuga yuga se soi   
citi sakti ko jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Saci jyota jage hirdaya me   
Sohama nada jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Jivana mukta parama avinasi   
Carana sarana lagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo

Hi amiatall. Very nice song. This is my translation.   
 **Jyota se jyota jagavo**   
Jyota se jyota jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _Take me from Light to Light.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
He yogesvara he gyanesvara   
He saravesvara he paramesvara   
Nija kripa barasavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _O Master of Yoga (Yogesvara), O Master of Jnana (Gyanesvara),   
O All-Powerful (Saravesvara), O Supreme Lord (Paramesvara),   
Shed your own grace,   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
Hama balaka tere dvara pe aye   
Mangala darasa dikhavo

Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _We children have come to your door,   
Show us your Auspicious form,   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
Sisa jhukaya kare teri arati   
Prema sudha barasavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _With bowed heads we perform your Arati (a form of worship),   
Shed the nectar of Prema (Supreme Love),   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
Antara me yuga yuga se soi   
citi sakti ko jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _Within me which is sleeping since ages,   
Awaken that Cit Shakti (Power within Consciousness),   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
Saci jyota jage hirdaya me   
Sohama nada jagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _True Light will shine in the Heart,   
Awaken the Sohama (Natural mantra of consciousness) and Nada (Anahat sound),   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light._   
Jivana mukta parama avinasi   
Carana sarana lagavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
Mera antara timira mitavo   
Sataguru jyota se jyota jagavo   
 _You are Jivana Mukta and Supreme beyond destruction,   
I take refuge at your feet,   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.   
Remove the darkness within me.   
O Sataguru, Take me from Light to Light.

Dear amiatall, silentgreen,   
On this Sri Ramana Jayanti Day, 23rd December, 2010, Dhanur   
month, Punarvasu asterism, there cannot be a better prayer to   
Bhagavan Ramana than this. Thank you, both of you.   
Sri Bhagavan says in Verse 19 of Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana   
Maalai: O Arunachala, You stand and shine before me in the form of   
my Guru, destroy utterly my faults, cure me, and convert me,   
and as your servant govern me.   
Guru is always the Light. Light that removes the darkness of   
ignorance, that comes out of ego.   
Egoism, the separate I, is the cause of all faults, the original   
sin. Disinterestedness, detachment, egolessness is the one   
qualification for the service of God.   
Arunachala Siva.**

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Bhagavan's birthday falls on Arudra darshanam day. For all devotees of Ramana  
maharishi Lord shiva took a human form as Venkataramana to give Arura   
darshanam. At the end we have kaLi a sweet dish which shows ananda kaLippu of  
the devotees.   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Sri Bhagavan was born on 30th December 1880, late in the night,   
i.e. around 2. am in the morning of 31st December. As per Hindu   
calendar, upto sunrise, it is taken as the previous day. So it   
was Dhanur masa, immediately after Ardra, that is Punarvasu I padam. Just  
then in Tiruchuzhi, Siva, Vazhithunai Nathar, Marga   
Sahayar, or Bhoomi Nathar, and Thunai Maalai Amman, Sahaya Valli, had finished  
their night long procession around the streets of Tiruchuzhi and were re-  
entering the Temple. Just then young Venkataraman was born. It was as if  
Siva, retraced His steps and was born as young Venakataraman!   
This year, Ardra Darsan came on 22nd December and Sri Bhagavan's Jayanti came  
on 23rd December.   
In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, [108 Holy Names of Sri Bhagavan],   
three places are mentioned by Viswantha Swami.   
No. 8: Om Sri Bhoominatha sthalotitaya Namah: One who is born in the place of Sri Bhoomi Natha, Tiruchuzhi.   
This is Janma Bhoomi of Sri Bhagavan.   
No. 15: Om Srimad Dwadasantha Mahasthale lapta vidyodaya Namah: Dwadasantham is Sanskrit name for Madurai. There Sri Bhagavan   
attained Vidyodaya, the atma vidya jnanam.   
No. 21: Om Pithurathe sonasailam prapthaya Namah: Due to praptha, ie Father's [Arunachala's] command, He sought   
Sonasailam, Arunachalam, Tiruvannamalai. This is atma vichara   
upadesa bhoomi. He went to Arunachalam to give upadesa of   
atma vichara to thousands of people.   
KaLi - as a verb, means to enjoy. We eat KaLi and enjoy the   
sweetness of Nataraja Siva. The Ezhu kai koottu, the mixed vegetable  
preparation i.e. with seven vegetables, came to add   
taste later! In Asramam, last year, when I had been there, they   
gave prasadam of KaLi along with lunch.   
Arunachala Siva.**
