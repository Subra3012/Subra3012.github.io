## Gopikas and Krishna  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 05, 2009, 12:30:47 PM

The Gopikas, the cow-herdesses, had a great love and devotion   
for Krishna. They forgot their husbands, kids and houses and   
ever in company or contemplation of Krishna. Krishna had to   
leave for Mathura. He told cowherdesses to go back to homes   
as he had to leave. Gopikas said: "What lives are there for us,   
without you?" They reluctantly left him.   
Several years later, Krishna sent Uddhava to go back to Gokulam   
and explain his god-nature to them. Uddhava went and told   
them the fact that Krishna is God and not merely a cowherd boy.   
He told them about Krishna's Brahman-nature, his stay in   
Vaikunta with Lakshmi and Adisesha. The Gopikas said: "O Seer! Keep that Krishna with you. We do not want to see   
his four hands, Adisesha, Lakshmi and all that crap. We are   
happy with that cute little cowherd boy, with peacock feather   
and yellow attire and pearl-necklace and butter oozing lips!   
Everyone's God is quite personal to him. He does not want   
an all-powerful god with a thousand heads and a thousand eyes   
and a thousand hands.   
Saint Tiru Jnana Sambandhar looked upon Siva-Uma as Father-   
Mother. Saint Sundaramurthy treated Siva only as his friend.   
Saint Manikavachagar found him as a great lover whom he   
can marry, nayaki-nayaka bhava. Bhagavan Ramana treated   
Arunachala as His Father, Lover and a Mother too. All these   
bhavas are there in Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Much earlier than Uddava, Gopis knew the Brahman nature of Krishna,still they  
prefered to move with him as a cowherd for the sake of proximity and  
closeness. In Rasa Kreeda, in the hymns Gopika Geetham, they sing in chorus  
-Na kalu Gopika Nandanoth bavan,akhila dehinam Antaratma drik. He is not just  
a child born of Nandan.He is verily the inner soul acting as the Seer in all  
the creatures of the world. There is none to comprehend the devotion and  
knowledge of Gopis; they are matchless and beyond comparison.

Dear arcsekar,   
Yes. You are correct. Srimad Narayaneeyam of Mepathur   
Bhattadri also says that. This may perhaps due to the Gopikas   
preferring the form of Krishna as a cowherd, than his formless   
nature of Brahman or a super-normal Krishna of several heads   
and eyes and hands and a conch shell and a disc. Bhagavan   
Ramana realized the Self at Madurai itself even before His   
arrival to Tiruvannamalai. But He preferred the Hill-form.   
He was never tired of doing pradakshina and gazing at the   
Hill in a tireless regularity many times every day. He used   
to watch the lighting of the lamp on the Mahadeepam Day,   
with the rejoicing of a child! Sometimes, the formful Brahman   
or Sivam, which is Siva, is preferred than the formless Self.   
Incidentally the Siva Lingam is a midway between form and   
the formless. It is called Aru-Uru in Tamil, form & formless.   
All the Saiva saints prayed only to this formelss form. Arunachala   
is also a formless form!   
Arnachala Siva.
