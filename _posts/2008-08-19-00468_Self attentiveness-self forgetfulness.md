## Self attentiveness-self forgetfulness  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: August 19, 2008, 08:37:51 AM

Is it true that in the initial stages of self-enquiry there is constant  
struggle between self-attentiveness and self-forgetfulness?

yes, there is self-attentiveness and self-forgetfulness. .. but how can there  
be a struggle between these two ?   
There is no strugle there are these. The ego which is trying to be self-  
attentive always, tries to create struggle whenever there is self-  
forgetfulness, but what is required is not to create conflicts / struggles in  
the mind but to just become selfattentive whenever we forget! this is my  
opinion

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, In self-attention, if there is   
self forgetfulness, leave it and come back to self-attention.   
However, only when ego is annihilated, the outward thoughts   
will cease. Keep watching the Self. Trying to use the ego   
to merge into the Self, is like asking the thief to find out the thief!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai and Sankar, Self attention is the only key word.   
Thoughts will come, doubts will come, fears will come (becuase   
we do not want to leave the mind, in the mindless state, there   
will be fears, as if, we are 'losing' the mind and getting mad!)   
but one has to pursue self enquriy and self attention. Bhagavan   
has said:- "As if the pearl-diver sinking into the sea, with a   
pearl as his goal." (Who am I? - 1902). This is the keyword.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
 In the initial stages when we try to be self-attentive thought takes us somewhere and we are unaware of the self most of the time.   
Again we will be self-attentive but because of long habit of thinking thought  
again takes us somewhere.It takes quite some time to be self-attentive without  
thought distraction that too after doing self-enquiry sincerely.Thought does  
not leave us so easily.This is what i mean by struggle initially.

Yes Dear Raju, one has to keep bringing back the Self-Attentiveness I agree.

Dear Raju (Oh! non duel saved us from the difficulty of addressing you!)   
and srkudai,   
Bhagavan says in Who am I?: Remaing quite is what is called wisdom insight. To remain quiet   
is to resolve the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing the past,   
present and future happenings, clairvoyance do not constitute   
wisdom-insight.   
Desirelessness is Wisdom. The two are not different. They are   
the same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind   
towards any object. Wisdom means appearance of no object.   
In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is   
Desirelessness. Not leaving the Self is Wisdom.   
Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self. Meditation   
consists in thinking that one's Self is Brahman, Existence-   
Knowledge-Bliss.   
Inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage   
and realizing one's own true nature is release   
Is it not the same as leaving the bag and picking up the bag   
and vice versa?   
Arunachala Siva.
