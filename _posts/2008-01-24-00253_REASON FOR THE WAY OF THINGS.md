Dear Hemaharish, if you know Tamil, you are twice blessed.   
Buy Ramana Nool Thirattu (Complete Works of Bhagavan) and   
start with Naan Yaar (Who am I?)

when you realize that who you think you are is only a story, everything falls  
into place.   
as long as you are searching for something, you are overlooking the truth  
that is already here.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.   
Consequence is an illusion. Reality is the source of all percieved  
consequence.

numbers [and the nature of all things] are the nature of reality.If the END

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including  
perceptions of number and equation, but numbers are not the source of reality,  
infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?  
(ha haaa yes, i'm aware that you are probably already thinking along these  
lines )

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!   
A beacon!!!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

That which lies beyond the Primal Cause can only be experienced and not  
defined by words, call it division or whatever you like, these words are  
calculated and formed within the mind.   
NICE ONE!!

Originally there was Void. (Before void, what was there? We   
do not know. Some play like the one, which I am describing was   
there ). Then the Brahman or God or Shiva breathed out.   
Came the universe. When the play is over, the Brahman or God   
or Shiva, would breath in and everything will go away leaving   
Void. Buddha said there is only Void, Mahasunya. Shankara said,   
it is Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Bhagavan has   
said that after the play is over, only the Screen remains. Screen is   
there, before, during and after the play. Saiva Siddhantists call it: Siva-Oli and Parai-Natham - the Effulgence of Shiva and Sound of   
the anklets of dancing Kali.
