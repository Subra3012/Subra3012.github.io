Verse 1253 of Guru Vachaka Kovai of Muruganar: The Sages want and pray for nothing.   
But their very being is spontaneous   
Penance serving to bring to all   
The people of the world the wealth   
And welfare that they may wish for.   
End of Part III - The Experience - concluded.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai \- completed.   
(Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
