Hello,   
Would anyone be kind enough to post/scan the contents of Sri Ramana Maharshi's  
death experience from Sri Ramana Leela (Telugu version)?   
I have the English version. I am looking for the Telugu version.   
Thanks

Hi JoeM   
I heard from David Godman blog that the telugu version has more accurate  
details.   
Neverthless I personally believe, both english, telugu versions are equally  
authentic as Silence is best expressed by humility and devotion to the sage  
Ramana.   
Others will help to translate it for you, prashant_ramana_maharishi is a  
telugu devotee. you can request him as well.

**A respectable and orthodox gentleman asked about Sri Chakra.**   
 **M.: It has a deep significance. There are 43 corners with sacred syllables  
in them. Its worship is a method for concentration of mind. The mind is wont  
to move externally. It must be checked and turned within. Its habit is to  
dwell on names and forms, for all external objects possess names and forms.  
Such names and forms are made symbolic mental conceptions in order to divert  
the mind from external objects and make it dwell within itself. The idols,  
mantras, yantras, are all meant to give food to the mind in its introvert  
state, so that It may later become capable of being concentrated, after which  
the superb state is reached automatically.
