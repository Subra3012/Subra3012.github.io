## Liberation not possible for everyone?

An excerpt from interview of David Goodman (diciple of Nisargadatta Maharaj):  "We went back in, but I had no idea what to talk about. When everyone had  
settled down, Cary gave me a nudge and I suddenly found myself talking about  
why some people get enlightened and others not.   
'Ramana Maharshi,' I said, 'got enlightened in a few minutes. It took you  
three years from the moment you met you Guru until you realised the Self.  
Other people try for fifty years and don't succeed. Why is it like this? Are  
the people who try all their lives and fail doing something wrong?'   
Most other Hindu teachers would answer a question like this by saying that  
some people had more or less finished their work in previous lives and were  
therefore able to realise the Self very quickly in this life. This wasn't an  
option for Maharaj because he teadfastly refused to accept that reincarnation  
took place at all. This itself was a little strange to me because in the  
period that I used to visit him the dust jacket of 'I am That' reproduced a  
dialogue with him in which he explained in quite some detail how reincarnation  
took place. However, in the era that I visited him I never once heard him  
accept the validity of reincarnation, and he frequently said it didn't happen.  
My question was really, 'If one discounts the theory of reincarnation, which  
you seem to do, how can someone like Ramana Maharshi get enlightened with no  
desire for it, no effort and no practice, while everyone else struggles  
unsuccessfully for decades and fails?'   
 **' It's the chemical,' announced Maharaj. 'Some people are born with a pure  
chemical and some are not. Those with a pure chemical get enlightened, and  
those with an impure chemical don't.'**   
'The chemical' was one of Maharaj's idiosyncratic analogies or metaphors. I  
think it was derived from the chemical on a roll of film. We are all issued  
with a 'chemical' at the moment of conception, said Maharaj, and that is our  
destiny for this life. **In onesense it is like a roll of film, a script that  
has been given to us for this life.** Traditional Hinduism teaches that we  
have prarabdha karma, an unchangeable destiny for this life that is an  
inevitable result of actions that have been performed in previous lives.  
Maharaj couldn't incorporate past-life activities into his 'chemical' theory,  
but he did have an alternative selection of factors to offer.   
I can't remember whether it was during this particular conversation or on some  
other day, but I remember asking him about the components of 'the chemical'.  
He replied that it was a combination of a wide variety of factors: parents'  
genes, astrological configurations at the time of conception, the future  
environment that one was going to be brought up in ? these were just a few  
that he mentioned. These all coalesced at a particular moment and issued a  
body, or rather an embryo, with its appointed destiny.   
'This is all very deterministic,' I said. 'If the purity of the chemical  
determines whether or not we get enlightened, why should we ven care about it  
or not? What is the point of trying or not trying, wanting or not wanting, if  
the purity of the chemical has already decided the matter for us in advance?  
We may as well all go home.'   
Maharaj replied, 'No, it is not completely determined in advance. The vast  
majority of people in the world are born with a dirty chemical. Nothing they  
do or don't do will make any difference. Enlightenment is not for them, and  
most of them won't even care about such matters. At the other end of the  
spectrum there will be an extremely small number of very pure beings who will  
become aware of their true nature without any striving or inclination.'   
He didn't say so, but I assume he would have put Ramana Maharshi in this  
category.   
'Between these two extremes,' continued Maharaj, 'there are a small number of  
people whose chemical is only slightly impure. These people have a chance to  
get enlightened. If they can meet with a Guru who can show them the truth and  
if their earnestness and seriousness are high enough, they can purify their  
slightly dirty chemical and find out who they really are. That is why we are  
all here today. People who come to a teacher with a strong thirst for freedom  
are the ones who have only a few impurities. They are the ones for whom  
liberation is possible."   
I'm totally blown away by this. Maharshi says: You are awareness.   
"Awareness is another name for you.   
Since you are awareness there is no need to attain or cultivate it. All   
that you have to do is to give up being aware of other things, that is   
of the not-Self. If one gives up being aware of them then pure   
awareness alone remains, and that is the Self."   
and also Maharaj says: "Awareness is ever there. It need not be realized. Open the shutter of the  
mind, and it will be flooded with light.   
There is nothing to practice. To know yourself, be yourself. To be yourself,  
stop imagining yourself to be this or that. Just be. Let your true nature  
emerge. Don't disturb your mind with seeking."   
And Jack Kornfield also has an interesting story about Nisargadatta   
"One day we were in a room about this big. People were coming in and asking  
questions. Somebody came in and asked a question and was a little bit  
dissatisfied and left. And another person raised their hand and said,  
"Maharaj, what will happen to that person who came and asked that question and  
left? Is it all over for them in this life? They didn't stay here. You are a  
great guru, and they weren't interested, and they went home." And he twinkled  
at that moment, he really lit up, and he said, "It's too late. Even the fact  
that they put their foot in this room, even if they hadn't asked the question,  
means that somewhere in there there's a seed of really knowing who we are and  
what this life is about. Not what you were taught in elementary school or  
what's on TV or the newspapers, but a deep seed of knowing our true nature,  
that wants to discover; it's like coming home. The fact that he just walked in  
the room means that that seed has started to sprout. **And no matter if he  
tries to forget it and goes back and gets lost, sooner or later that will  
manifest in awakening. "**   
So did Maharshi say anything about this subject? Can anyone "attain  
enlightenment"? And if what Maharaj says is true, how can one know if their so  
called chemical is pure or impure?

dear japo   
Iam not an expert that is for sure, so I can share what I "believe" could be  
an aid...   
you said yourself that awereness is nothing to be attained, because it is  
allready the case right now..   
so on the path you have choosen, a nondual mysical path...it is thought that  
it is allready there..this moment is unfabricated...you dont create this, you  
dont need effort to be right here...it is selfsprung awarness without  
beginning or end...utterly pure and sacred...and this is the truth   
and infact we just need to make a shift from "ordinary" mindstuff or heavy  
convulsive thinking..Into simply beeing (I study dzogchen buddhism and here  
the term non-active meditaiton, or simply relaxing is used....)   
its very easy...you see what hides the allpervading truth, is just a thin  
layer of dualistic thought...thats all...and this layer is nothing more but  
illusion (mithya)   
so nondual mysticism is the easiest and shortest way...but still practice is  
neccessary to be stabel in this realisation..   
anyway as buddhanature or the self is allways here right now allways our  
nature, it is also not impossible (technical) to realize it, all human beeings  
have hte potential (through grace of a great master also animals or plants can  
"achive" liberation, I mean achiving is a little confusing..but english is not  
my mother tongue)..   
but it is true that some will realize some not....the thing is: to dont bother  
wether you realize or not..I mean..you are allready it...so why bother?   
simply meditate and pray...all else is in the hands of the maharshi..   
and in job, relationship etc: best thing is to relaxe into the  
situations..into what is, and take this life easy...and then it becomes  
joyfull, to say the least....   
I wish you a path without obstacles, and full of joy   
matthias

An ounce of practice in the right direction is better than tons of theory.   
Nobody (normally) spends much time in determining whether he is born with the  
right chemicals to get a job. The survival drive itself shows the way.  
Similarly God shows the way to the earnest.

Dear I,   
The one that is enquiring cannot get liberated, this is assured. So long you  
are searching it, you will keep searching it. and then, when you stop  
searching it, and feel you have got it, you will still remain away from it. No  
Chance!   
Who wants to be liberated? is it the Self or you? can you ever be liberated?  
that which does not exist!, can it be liberated? This is only the Chemical!  
and that which exists and does not exist at the same time is awareness. You  
can not know awareness, its sheer waste of time. We can pack our bags and go  
home, rather find the awareness!   
the YOU can never be liberated!   
Liberation is not an act, becoming, or even knowledge!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear everyone,   
Every one has to attain enlightenment. As said, we are already   
enlightened but that ruby is covered with tons of dust. The removal   
of the dust only takes time, may be minutes, days, months and years   
and even several births.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say the example of plaintain stem, dry   
wood and gunpowder. The first one, being ever wet and chill will   
not catch fire. The dry wood may take more time to catch fire.   
The gunpowder catches fire in a few seconds.   
The chemical example of Nisargadutta is also not uncommon.   
The Hi-Octane petrol used for "flying" that is used in aircrafts,   
is nothing but ordinary kerosene, which undergoes several stages   
of purification.   
Talking of chemical, it is said, that a pure pinch of potassium   
cyanide kills a person when tasted, with in 3 seconds. The joke   
is that no one would live to say whether potassium cynaide is   
sweet or salty or bitter!   
Arunachala Siva.

I read recently a quote from sri Bhagavan in which he said that "You and I are  
the same. What I have done is surely possible for anyone". And also Papaji  
said that perfect freedom is everyone's birth right.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. One way of looking at it, is to be at NOW and not expect   
anything descending from heavens, but only removing the dust   
in the Heart. It is due to this "dust", which is huge like galactic   
dust between two zodiacs, that takes time for removal. In some   
cases it is 50 years and in some other cases it is a relatively short   
time. The best thing is to practice Self Enquiry to be in NOW   
and seek His grace to expeditiously remove the dust.   
Kutram mutru aruthu enai gunamaai panithu aaL   
Guru uru vai oLir Arunachala.   
 - Verse 19 of Sri AAMM.   
Please snap all my deficiencies and fill me with all goodness   
and be my Guru and shine in me in all effulgence, O Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.
