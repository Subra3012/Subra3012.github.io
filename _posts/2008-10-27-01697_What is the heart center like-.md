Is the heart center like a expansive emptiness and stillness?

Dear kde,   
Heart Centre, has been prescribed by Bhagavan Ramana, so the   
sake of seekers, even though the Self or the Heart is all pervading.   
This Heart Centre is within the chest of a person, two digits right   
to the midchest. It is described in 'sastras' as in the form of   
inverted lotus, with six colours. Kindly see the Reality in Forty   
Verses of Bhagavan and the Supplement.   
The Self is not an emptiness. It is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Buddhists   
called it Sunya or emptiness, or Void.   
Arunachala Siva.
