Today is the New Year Day, for Tamil and Malaylam people.   
The calendar adopted in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is based on   
the movement of the Sun (Souram) in the zodiac. Today Sun   
has moved into Mesha, Aries and it is the New Year accordingly.   
The month is called Chitra or Chaitra. This is the beginning of   
Vasantham, Spring, before the onset of summer. But nowadays,   
even Spring which is said to be mildly warm, is quite hot like   
regular summer!   
Chaitra is the festival month in various temples in Madurai,   
Tiruchy, Tiruvannamalai and other places.   
The Full Moon which comes after 15 days from today, is called   
Chitra Pournami, which is also the day of celebration Temples.   
Astrologically, persons who are born in Chaitra are said to be   
brave and at the same time interested in Atma Vicharam. Because   
the Sun is in ascendant in Aries and Aries is the house of Sun.   
Sun in Atma karaka, the one who confers Atma Jnana. Moon   
is mano karaka, the controller of mind. Chitra Pournami is the   
day when Sun and Moon are together in Aries.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says God is both with and without form

**Has God any form? Or is He formless? God is both with and without form and  
yet transcends both. He alone can say what else He is. God with form and God  
without form are like ice and water.   
When water freezes into ice it has form. When the same ice is melted into  
water, all form is lost. God with form and without form arc not two different  
beings. He who is with form is also without form.**   
To a devotee, the worshipper of a Personal God,He manifests Himself in various  
forms. Just think of a shoreless ocean an infinite expanse of waterno land  
visible in any direction! Only here and there are visible blocks of ice formed  
by the intense cold, similarly under the intensifying influence of the deep  
devotion of His worshipper,the Infinite reduces Himself, as it were, into the  
Finite and appears before him as a Being with form.   
Again, as on the appearance of the sun the ice melts away, so with the  
awakening of knowledge, God with form melts away into the Formless, The water  
of the ocean, when viewed from a distance, appears to have a dark-blue colour,  
but becomes colourless when taken in the hand; in the same way God is also  
associated with a definite colour and complexion from a distance,but He is the  
attribute-less Truth when the devotee merges in Him.

**Sri Ramakrishna said that once a doll, made of salt, wanted to measure the  
depth of the ocean; but no sooner did it touch the water than it melted in the  
ocean.**   
How could it tell about the depth?   
Similarly, neither the mind nor words can express the real nature of God when  
the aspirant has merged in Him.   
A text of the Vedas says: "The words come back with the mind vainly trying to  
express what Truth is."

In one of the Upanishads, it is said, that "Vedas try to reach   
Brahman and come back losing, crestfallen."
