## Six internal enemies  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 27, 2009, 02:17:54 PM

Any living being has got six external enemies. But the human   
being alone, which can think and consequently create problems   
for him, has got six internal enemies.   
Kamba Ramayanam and Villiputturar Bharatam, two Tamil rendeings   
of Ramayana and Mahabharata speak of six characters who represent   
each, one internal enemy.   
Kama - This is only undeserving desire. Not sexual desire per se.   
An undeserving desire is something like Sanjay Dutt wanting to   
become Prime Minister! Sisubala in Mahabharatam is the example   
for this. In the Rajasuya Yaga, of Dharmaputra, when he wanted   
to give the first offering to Krishna, Sisubala said that he should   
be given the first offering, and quaralled with both Dharmaputra   
and Krishna. He was killed.   
Kobha - unbridled anger. The example is Hiranya Kashyap. He   
got angry with Narayana and got killed by Narasimha who came out   
of the pillar.   
Lobha - not giving even a small portion of one's wealth and riches   
to others. Duryodhana is the example. He did not even want to spare five  
houses to Pandavas. And he died later due to this.   
Matha - limitless arrogance - bloated egoism. Kamsa. Knowing that   
only Vasudeva's eighth child would kill him, he imprisoned Devaki   
and Vasudeva and killed every child from the first child.   
Moha - this is morbid sexual desire towards women other than one's wife.  
Ravana is the unbeatable example.   
Mascharya - enmity towards anyone other than one's enemy. This is Aswathama,  
who killed Pandavas' harmless young children and also tried to kill even  
Utthara's child in the womb. He was killed.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Life of Man  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: April 27, 2009, 10:05:50 AM

Aayurvarshashatam nrunaam parimitam raatrau tadardhan gatam   
tasyaardhasya parasya chaardhamaparam balatvatvrdhatvayoh   
sheham vyaadhiviyogadukha sahitam sevaadibhirniyate   
jeevo vaaritaranchachalatare soukyam kutah praaninaam   
The life of a man (as ordained) is limited to one hundred years; half of it is  
spent in night, and out of the other half one half again is pased in childhood  
and old age and the rest which has its illness, bereavements, and troubles is  
spent in serving (others). What happiness can there be for mortals in a life  
(again) which is even more uncertain than the ripples (on the surface) of  
water?

In Narada Bhakti Sutra we have the following Sutra which describes the  
attributes of Bhakti -   
Kantha avarodha romancha ashrubhih parasparam lapmaanaah paavayanthi kulaani  
prithiveem cha   
Word Meaning   
Kantha avarodha  throats choked with emotion,   
Romancha  hairs are standing to end   
Ashrubhih  eyes covered with tears,   
Parasparam lapamaanaah  converse with each other in broken words;   
Paavayanthi kulaani  (they) purify their tribe (family as well)   
Prithiveem cha  and entire Earth.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Tirupati Balaji Idol is a mystery. Learned people have written   
that it could be Muruga, (because Muruga temples are always   
on a hill), Uma (because large lock of hair is found at the back   
of the image), Siva (because even today the priests do pooja   
with bhilva and not tulsi). But no one has said that it is Buddha.   
Brahman is nameless and formless, we give name and form and   
call it as different gods. Arunachala Ashtakam, Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
