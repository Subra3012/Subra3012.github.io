Sitting in peaceful posture, during nights when all sounds are stilled into  
silence, somehwhere on the banks of the heavenly river which shine with the  
white glow of the bright-diffused moon-light, and fearful of the nuseries of  
birth and death, crying aloud "Shiva, Shiva, Shiva" Ah! when shall we attain  
that ecstasy which is characterised by copious tears of joy held in internal  
control

In Narada Bhakti Sutra we have the following Sutra which describes the  
attributes of Bhakti -   
Kantha avarodha romancha ashrubhih parasparam lapmaanaah paavayanthi kulaani  
prithiveem cha   
Word Meaning   
Kantha avarodha  throats choked with emotion,   
Romancha  hairs are standing to end   
Ashrubhih  eyes covered with tears,   
Parasparam lapamaanaah  converse with each other in broken words;   
Paavayanthi kulaani  (they) purify their tribe (family as well)   
Prithiveem cha  and entire Earth.

That state of mind is called Bhakti (Divine Love) wherein all movements of  
thought go automatically to the lotus feet of the Lord and stick to them for  
ever just as the seed of Ankola tree (on falling) gravitates to the parent  
tree, the iron needle to the magnetic stone the devoted wife to her husband,  
the creeper to the tree and the river to the ocean.

it difficult to accept because the website been a pro-dalit, dalit supremacy  
one.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Tirupati Balaji Idol is a mystery. Learned people have written   
that it could be Muruga, (because Muruga temples are always   
on a hill), Uma (because large lock of hair is found at the back   
of the image), Siva (because even today the priests do pooja   
with bhilva and not tulsi). But no one has said that it is Buddha.   
Brahman is nameless and formless, we give name and form and   
call it as different gods. Arunachala Ashtakam, Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
