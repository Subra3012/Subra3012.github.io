## Arunachala Photos On This Site - my mistakes

The photographs of Arunachala currently available on this site (as of 27th  
September 2009) are over-saturated with colour and contain too much cyan.   
This was due to a problem with monitor calibration last year, something I was  
not aware of until I purchased a new monitor and calibration tool.   
 **Update November 2009** \- 90% of the photos have now been replaced with new  
and better ones. There are now 129 photos available for download.

Dear Sri Graham,   
I totally welcome your plans. Kindly make the date and timing   
on Arunachala web-cam photograph a little larger.   
Thank You,   
With respects and love,   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Subramanian. R
