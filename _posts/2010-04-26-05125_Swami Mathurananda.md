## Kala Bhairava  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 26, 2010, 03:51:57 AM

Kala Bhairava is one of the 8 forms of Siva, some of the others   
being, Nataraja, Kalyana Sundara, Bhikshtana, and Somaskanda.   
Kaila Bhairava is the ferocious form who came out of the plucked   
hair of Siva, when Siva wanted to punish Daksha, when the latter   
disrespected Dakshayani (Uma) during the famous sacrifice for   
which Siva himself was not invited.   
This Kala Bhairava went to Daksha's sacrifice hall and left and right,   
destroyed and injured the participants. Brahma's one of theheads   
was snapped, Saraswati lost her nose, Daksha himself was beheaded.   
Only Narayana was spared, since he had earlier dug out one of his   
eyes to do puja for Siva, when one lotus was short in the puja   
with 1000 lotuses.   
The prayers and meditation on Kala Bhairava are said to be good   
solutions for solving various disputes in life, including marital   
discord. He is prayed with lime fruits garlands and red flowers.   
In the month of Chaitra, (Apr-May), such worships are performed   
more since the boons will be quicker.   
Kala Bhairava image can be seen in any large Siva Temple. This   
time when I went to Tiruvannamalai, I climbed the steps of the   
shrine inside the Eastern Towers of Big Temple and paryed to   
Kala Bhairava. I did not do any special puja but only simple   
prayers.   
He is seen with a mace on his hand and in a standing posture.   
Saint Manikkavachagar makes reference to this, in his Tiru Undiyar   
in Tiruvachakam.   
Arunachala Siva.

I met one gentleman, Swami Mathurananda, during my recent visit   
to Tiruvannamalai. He is in his mid-30s, in simple white dhoti   
and jubba and he is tall and fair complexioned. He is an Indian.   
He told me that he has been living in Tiruvannamalai for the last   
9 years, but in his own little home, and visiting the Asramam frequently but  
otherwise staying at home, meditating and reading.   
What was surprising to me was his earlier history. He joined   
Sri Ramakrishna Math, spent about 11 years there, obtained   
sannyasa diksha as well as mantra diksha. After this in another   
one year, that is totally at the end of the 12th years, he felt   
that he should leave Ramakrishna Order and be independent for   
his sadhana. Thereafter, he felt like staying in Tiruvannamalai   
and he seems to have anchored himself in T'malai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
Atman   
\   
dive deep within   
you can bypass the illusion of nature   
you can learn her secrets   
A very good poem indeed.   
\   
All learning, all personal glory has taken a few steps and turned their faces;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.   
All words, all synonymns have done their jobs and won't move one step further;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.   
A personal life lived and could not come out of its cocoon;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.
