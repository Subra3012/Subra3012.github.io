## What is there in Tirupavai?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 14, 2009, 10:43:13 AM  
---  
Both Manikkavachagar's Tiruvembavai and AndaL's Tirupavai,   
are having the undercurrent of Saranagati or surrender. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say: "If you cannot do self enquriy, then you do   
surrender and keep quiet." But these two compositions are viewed   
in various angles by devotees, as the six blind men seeing the elephant.   
One day, a rasika of music came to a Sri Vaishanva scholar and said: "What is there in Tirupavai, sir? It is all splendid music. I use to lie in  
bed at 6.30 AM (!) in Dhanur month and listen to M.L. Vasantakumari's  
rendering of Tirupavai, while I am half-asleep.   
O What a music sir! All thirty songs are in thirty different ragas!  
Wonderful!"   
Next day, a great Tamil pandit came to that Sri Vaishnava scholar and told  
him: "What is there in Tirupavai, sir? It is all delightful   
Tamil poetry. AndaL herself says 'I am singing thirty songs in Sangam   
Tamil.' Wonderful!"   
A third one came to the same Sri Vaishnava scholar and said: "What is there  
in Tirupavai, sir? AndaL delightfully explains how to prepare sweet pongal on  
the Dharnur month mornings. Take best raw rice,   
best jaggery, best cashews, cardamom, and dry grapes, nicely fry them in ghee.  
And then pour generously pure cow's milk ghee.   
It will be delightful like Brahmananda, sir, "Mooda nei peythu muzhangai  
vazhi vara..." She says, pour ghee as if a film of ghee   
would spread on the sweet pongal and then take it shamelessly that   
the overflowing ghee trickles down your elbow!"   
So every one looks at Tirupavai in their own angle. Like Brahman or   
Siva or Narayana, Tirupavai or Tiruvembavai, is many faceted!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Speaking of Siva  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 14, 2009, 11:18:51 AM

Veera Saiva movement took birth in Karnataka. Its founder Basvanna,   
was a brahmin by birth, but took cudgels against the Brahmin orthodoxy and  
rituals and casteism in 18th Century and started the movement. Their only god  
is Siva. His followers assembled in Kudligi, a place in Northern Karnataka  
and had a hall for their meetings. Their god is Kudala Sangama Deva, the Lord  
of the meeting rivers. In Kudligi, two tributaries of Kaveri go round the  
town. And there is a Siva temple. His main followers are three, who have  
sung   
Vachanas, free blank verses in Kannada. They are Akka Mahadevi,   
the Elder sister, and Desi Ramayya and Allmma Prabhu, the author on  
Prabhulinga Leela, which Bhagavan Ramana mentions many times.   
They were praying to Siva of various temples.   
Akkamahadevi was a revolutionary. She was roaming around naked, with  
treebarks around waist and leaves around her breasts. She often mentioned  
Mallikarjuna of Sri Sailam, the Lord of Jasmine Creeper.   
She sings: 1\. People   
 male and female,   
 blush when a cloth covering their shame   
 comes lose.   
 When the Lord of our lives,   
 lives drowned without a face,   
 in the world, how can you be modest?   
 When all the world is the eye of the Lord,   
 on looking everywhere, sixteen directions,   
 What can you cover and conceal?   
2. I love the Handsome One,   
 He has no death, decay or form   
 No place, or side no end, no birthmarks,   
 I love Him, O Mother, Listen!   
 I love the Beautiful One,   
 With no bond, nor fear, no clan, no land,   
 No landmarks for His beauty,   
 O My Lord, white as Jasmine, is my husband,   
 O Mother, take away these husbands who die,   
 Decay, and feed them to your kitchen fires!   
Sri AK. Ramanujan, a bilingual, has translated some of the verses   
into English.

## How much wealth you may need?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 14, 2009, 12:26:18 PM  
---  
Man's desire for wealth is limitless. Saint Tayumanavar says: "Even   
if one is given to rule the entire land, he would desire to conquer the  
oceans!" Once a devotee prayed to Siva intently for wealth. Siva   
appeared before him and asked: What do you want?" He answered.   
Then Siva pointed his index finger towards the house. The whole house turned  
into a golden palace! The Siva entered his house. What more do you want?"  
The devotee grinned and showed the wooden cupboards, steel cupboards,  
stainless steel vessels, etc., Siva waved   
his index finger towards these objects. All turned into gold. The   
devotee was still grinning at him expectedly! Siva was amused, and he asked  
him: "Anything else?" He said unashamedly: "I want your index finger!"   
Siva already lost half his body to Uma. If someone asked him the index  
finger... What is the end? He disappeared!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Acharya Panchaksharam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 16, 2009, 07:27:24 AM  
---  
Bhagavan Ramana has said on many occasions that Guru and God   
are one and the same. His mantra, Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya Namah: is  
quite famous amongst His devotees. At the same time, if some devotee has  
already been initiated in a mantra,   
He advised them to stick to it. Once when a gentleman came and asked Him,  
whether he could switch over from his Rama mantra, to   
Ramana mantra, Bhagavan categorically said: Why? Are Rama and   
Ramana different? Please continue your mantra as per initiation.   
In Saiva Siddhanta the four great Saints and their names are supreme. There  
are some saints among the 63, who chanted only   
one of the mantras of four and got liberation. Perumizhalai Kurumba Nayanar  
is a case to study. He was devoted to Sundaramoorthy Swamigal and chanted  
only his mantra, that his name. In Tamil,   
if you take the name of Sundaramoorthy's classical name Nambi   
Aroora, and if you omit all dotted consonants, you will get five letters only,  
a Panchakshara as sublime as Nama Sivaya. It is "Na bi A roo ra" Kurumbar  
was following Sivaraja Yoga. He knew that Sundarmoorthy is ascending to  
Kailas in Iravatham, sent by Siva.   
He chanted his name and stopped his breath and his life ebbed out through  
Sahasrara and he reached Kailas, earlier than Sundarmoorthy!   
The other four names as Panchakshara are: (leaving dotted consonants): Tiru Jnana Sambandha - Jna na sa ba dha   
Manikkavachagar - Manivachagar in classical name. Ma ni va cha ga   
Tiru Navukkarasar - Na vu ka ra sa.

## Planning in Spiritual Life. .. some thoughts  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 16, 2009, 03:53:10 PM

**Planning in Spiritual Life. .. some thoughts**   
Spiritual realization is the goal of human life.   
Spiritual sadhana acquaints the seeker with the deeper self which fills him  
with deep joy and peace.   
However the seeker often finds himself under varying situations in life which  
makes it difficult to continue the sadhana.   
Some planning may help the seeker to overcome / mitigate such situations in  
life.   
For example, many spiritual seekers need to earn their living as well as  
support their dependents.   
Therefore some financial planning can help the seeker to continue the sadhana  
with peace of mind.   
Also spiritual sadhana may lead to a situation where the devotion / meditative  
absorption matures to such an extent that it becomes difficult to continue  
work.   
Under such cases, proper financial planning can help the seeker for early  
retirement if needed.   
It is also important to take care of one's health by proper exercise and diet.   
Regular physical exercise improves the blood and air circulation of the body  
and keeps one fresh.   
Mental food is even more important.   
A spiritual seeker should avoid addictions which may prove harmful to the body  
and mind.   
A spiritual seeker should also avoid worldly company as much as possible and  
seek holy company to enrich one's life.   
The divine vibrations of holy company is like a spiritual experience by  
itself.   
Devotional study immensely helps spiritual life.   
So also pilgrimages to holy places.   
By proper balance of freedom and self-imposed disciplines, spiritual life  
becomes a journey of peace and bliss.   
To a sincere soul, the grace of God is always there to direct one's life  
appropriately.   
Om Shanti. .

Yes, voluntary simplicity is great. I feel like I'm in a catch 22 though.  
I'm engaging in certain projects to help get me out of the rat race and to  
free up more time for my spiritual pursuits, but those projects take  
time/effort/unsimplicity.

Very nice...the idea of simplicity.   
Simplicity in life.   
Holding on to this idea itself seems to disentangle complex "knots" in life.   
Working without personal ambition for the sake of God seems to free the mind  
from worry and give an inner joy.   
Om Shanti. .

I feel the goal towards realisation is not something to plan. Early retirement  
or late retirement.   
It will happen automatically and when it happens we will surely begin to doubt  
whether it all   
happened because of our show. But the big truth is NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT his  
WILL.   
One great saintly person told me once. _You don 't go behind Brahmagnanam,  
Brahmagnam will come to you._   
We dont have any show at all. Entirely dependent on God for our next meal, we  
should live. It   
will definitely be taken care of.   
Bhagawan as told us the best course is to remain silent.   
The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their prarabdha  
karma (destiny to be worked out in this life, resulting from the balance sheet  
of actions in past lives). Whatever is destined not to happen will not happen,  
try as you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to  
prevent it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is to remain silent.   
Nagaraj

There seem to be no hard and fast rule as to the conditions for spiritual  
flowering.   
People of different types from different situations of life has scaled great  
spiritual heights: Householder / Ascetic, Rich / Poor, Educated / Uneducated, Men / Women,   
Believers in personal God / Does not care about personal God,   
With personal Guru / Without personal Guru, Fully abled / Physically disabled,   
Living in natural places / Living in crowded places, Followers of a religious  
path / Does not follow any traditional religion,   
Silent / Communicative, Devotees of Siva / Devotees of Vishnu, Organized /  
Spontaneous, From different countries, working class / early retirees / never  
involved in job. ..   
God cannot be bound under any pattern;   
So must be the devotees, who can become devotees only when the element of God  
is manifest in them;   
And they must be guided by the inner Guru directly;   
So whatever can be said about spiritual life cannot be a rule, but only  
alternatives based on someone's experience;   
If anyone finds an alternative striking a chord, one may feel inclined to  
adopt it.   
Deciding whether an action gets done by individual will or God's Will seems to  
be dependent on the dominance of the ego-self in that person; A person with  
strong ego-self may feel that a particular action is done mostly by his  
volition with part help from God whereas another with less ego-self may feel  
the same action to be done mostly by God with him as instrument.   
Speaking of alternatives in the relative world,   
One alternative is to do some planning as part of sadhana;   
Finance and health are two areas which can create obstacles in one's sadhana;   
With some planning it can help in the following way: The most important thing for a spiritual seeker is to be in satsang and one's  
inner guide can tell what is the best satsang for him.   
For example if one feels that visiting Ramanashram is the best satsang for  
him, financial planning and good health can give one more opportunity to be in  
that satsang. Here planning is to be done as a devotional activity to come  
nearer to the divine. It also gives more opportunity to remember God.   
Another alternative in spiritual life is not to think of spiritual life as a  
bipolar thing like whether I get spiritual realization or else I have  
failed....but to proceed in spiritual life only to get peace and joy and  
devotion without any specific goals. In that case one does not bother about  
whether one gets realization or not, but peace and joy is almost assured in  
that journey.   
Yet another alternative is to cultivate deep interest in the phenomenon of  
spirituality itself.   
When one shows interest in God, God guides the soul internally and binds him  
with a cord of devotion.   
Yet another alternative is to leave everything to God with complete surrender.   
Since a person cannot remain without doing work, it is better to turn those  
works Godward as far as possible thus turning work into Karma Yoga.   
In a sense spiritual life has a great admission potential...for example, a  
blind person can become disqualified from a worldly job but remains qualified  
for a spiritual life.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen, Matthew, Nagaraj and others. I was in Arunachala   
for the past three days and was back only last night. The visit and darshan  
were wonderful. I am sharing some thoughts under Sri   
Ramana Darsanam, March 2009.   
As regards, yes, no hard rule for spiritual sadhana and towards that end in  
life. Planning, the ultimate would be to leave it to God, but   
most of us are not able to do that. Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "Since every thing is run by Parameswara Sakti, why should we keep on thinking  
that I would do this or do that? When one travels in a train, which carries  
all the load, should he still carry his small load on his head? Why not place  
in the train and be happy?"   
This is ideal. But we are not able to do since surrender is not complete in  
us. A large outline of planning, may be necessary,   
as in the case of job, our choice of place to live, our style of life etc.,   
As otherwise, we should leave it to God by total surrender.   
Arunachala Siva.

These matters too vary based on the person. We all know some people who would  
benefit greatly from planning things out carefully, and we all know people who  
seem to do best flying from the seat of their pants, so to speak.   
re: "Brahmagnam will come to you." I always remember Krishnamurti using the  
word "uninvited". It comes only uninvited -- so I guess if we really have the  
conviction that nothing we can do will make it come then perhaps that will  
lead us to inaction/silence/stillness.   
My favorite way I have seen it put was when Nisargadatta said: "Nothing you  
can do will make it happen, and nothing you can do will prevent it".   
Nonetheless, we must still give ourselves to these matters, whatever that  
means.   
Subramanian.R : I am happy to hear of your location. Who are you?

Dear Matthew,   
I am in Bangalore, a person, past 40, who voluntarily quit the job,   
because the job did not interest me and money was not a problem   
to some extent. I have ony one son, who is working abroad, who   
will be married off by next year, if Bhagavan wills. Presently, I am   
reading Ramana literature, which is my main occupation and am practising  
meditation and self enquriy. I visit Sri Ramanasramam,   
once in three months or less, from Bangalore. I am a little pot, with   
some water inside, and reflecting the glory of Sun, Bhagavan Ramana,   
the son of Siva.

the son of Siva.

Thank you. It is interesting to know. I'm happy that you've managed to free  
yourself up to follow your heart.

Dear Subramanian,   
It was nice knowing about you. By your absence, I presumed you would have gone  
to Arunachala. Your absence was very much felt here in this forum. I had also  
visited Arunachala 10 days ago and stayed there for a day. Is there any Ramana  
Satsang here in Bangalore?

Dear Nagaraj,   
There is one Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning, in Sanjay Nagar,   
about 5 kms from Makeri Cirle in the Bellary Road. It was established by Sri  
A.R. Natarajan, who merged with Ramana in early 2008. This   
Centre is having a meditation hall, in the same place and there is also a  
Ramana Temple, in Bellary Road, near Makeri Circle. This Ramana Temple  
conducts discourses and satsanghs. Since it is quite far off,   
from my place, and I am not able to attend in recent years.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I am aware of this Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning in Sanjay Nagar. It the  
same reason here too. It very far off. Have you seen the new ashram in Hosur  
road? just few Kilometers after Narayana Hrisayalaya? Its new and very  
beautiful. You must visit it sometime.

Did you book your rooms in Ramanashram a month before? Actually I have never  
stayed in the Ashram till now. Its my deepest desire to stay over there for a  
week and spend all day long in the old hall of Sri Ramana silently. When I  
visited Arunachala, it was also a sudden plan, and we could not get a room in  
Ashram. They told us that we have to book it atleast 25 days in advance.

Dear Nagaraj,   
I have heard about the Ramanasramam, in Hosur Road. It is   
comparatively nearer for me. But I have not made it so far.   
As regards reservation in guest rooms of Sri Ramanasramam,   
you have to book it about three weeks before the stay. They   
may allot rooms if they have vacancies on that day. Extension   
is not possible. You can stay for maximum three days. Two   
people can stay in the room. There is separate bathroom and toilet.   
There are beds for two. There is a fan. But you cannot do anything if there  
is a powercut, which is rampant in Tamil Nadu, already. No TV and so you are  
rid of it for a change. We have only gone as two, and   
I am not sure about more rooms if you want. They do not charge any   
thing and if you so desire, you can give a contribution to the Asramam before  
you leave.   
Arunachala Siva.
