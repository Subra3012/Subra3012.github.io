**3-1-46 Afternoon**   
When I entered the hall Bhagavan was already answering a question which, I  
gathered, was to the effect **Is the theory of evolution true?**   
Bhagavan said: The trouble with all of us is that we want to know the past, what we were,  
and also what we will be in the future. We know nothing about the past or the  
future. We do know the present and that we exist now. Both yesterday and  
tomorrow are only with reference to today.   
Yesterday was called today in its time, and tomorrow will be called today  
by us tomorrow. Today is ever present. What is ever present is pure existence.  
It has no past or future. **Why not try and find out the real nature of the  
present and ever-present existence?**

Dear prasanth,   
The evolution theory stories are told by Vedas, to make the interest   
go past these stories and find out the causeless cause, the primal   
cause that is the Self. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says it is   
like the story of the three sons of a barren woman, as told by mother to make  
the reluctant baby eat its food. The purpose is to make the child eat its  
food. The rest are all imaginations.   
AAMM Verse 28 says: To feed on you, I came, O Arunachala! but I have become your   
food and am now at peace.   
Let us be eaten by Arunachala. Forget about creation theories.   
The creation takes place as we see.   
Arunachala Siva.
