We all hear about universal brotherhood, and how societies stand up especially  
to preach this. I remember an old story. In India, taking wine is considered  
very bad. There were two brothers who wished, one night, to drink wine  
secretly; and their uncle, who was a very orthodox man was sleeping in a room  
quite close to theirs. So, before they began to drink, they said to each  
other, "We must be very silent, or uncle will wake up."   
When they were drinking, they continued repeating to each other "Silence!  
Uncle will wake up", each trying to shout the other down. And, as the shouting  
increased, the uncle woke up, came into the room, and discovered the whole  
thing. Now, we all shout like these drunken men," Universal brotherhood! We  
are all equal, therefore let us make a sect." As soon as you make a sect you  
protest against equality, and equality is no more. _Mohammedans talk of  
universal brotherhood, but what comes out of that in reality? Why, anybody who  
is not a Mohammedan will not be admitted into the brotherhood; he will more  
likely have his throat cut. Christians talk of universal brotherhood; but  
anyone who is not a Christian must go to that place where he will be eternally  
barbecued._   
So far we see that it is hard to find any universal features in regard to  
religion, and yet we know that they exist. **We are all human beings, but are  
we all equal? Certainly not. Who says we are equal? Only the lunatic. Are we  
all equal in our brains, in our powers, in our bodies? One man is stronger  
than another, one man has more brain power than another. If we are all equal,  
why is there this inequality? Who made it? We. Because we have more or less  
powers, more or less brain, more or less physical strength, it must make a  
difference between us. Yet we know that the doctrine of equality appeals to  
our heart.**   
 **The unity of sameness can come only when this universe is destroyed,  
otherwise such a thing is impossible.**   
We must learn that truth may be expressed in a hundred thousand ways, and that  
each of these ways is true as far as it goes. _We must learn that the same  
thing can be viewed from a hundred different standpoints, and vet be the same  
thing. Take for instance the sun. Suppose a man standing on the earth looks at  
the sun when it rises in the morning; he sees a big ball. Suppose he starts on  
a journey towards the sun and takes a camera with him, taking photographs at  
every stage of his journey, until he reaches the sun. The photographs of each  
stage will be seen to be different from those of the other stages; in fact,  
when he gets back, he brings with him so many photographs of so many different  
suns, as it would appear; and yet we know that the same sun was photographed  
by the man at the different stages of his progress._   
Even so is it with the Lord. Through high philosophy or low, through the most  
exalted mythology or the grossest, through the most refined ritualism or  
arrant fetishism, every sect, every soul, every nation, every religion,  
consciously or unconsciously, is struggling upward, towards God; every vision  
of truth that man has, is a vision of Him and of none else. Suppose we all go  
with vessels in our hands to fetch water from a lake. One has a cup, another a  
jar, another a bucket, and so forth, and we all fill our vessels. The water in  
each case naturally takes the form of the vessel carried by each of us. He who  
brought the cup has the water in the form of a cup; he who brought the jar   
his water is in the shape of a jar, and so forth; but, in every case, water,  
and nothing but water, is in the vessel. **So it is in the case of religion;  
our minds are like these vessels, and each one of us is trying to arrive at  
the realisation of God. God is like that water filling these different  
vessels, and in each vessel the vision of God comes in the form of the vessel.  
Yet He is One. He is God in every case. This is the only recognition of  
universality that we can get.**   
I have also my little plan. I do not know whether it will work or not, and I  
want to present it to you for discussion. What is my plan? In the first place  
I would ask mankind to recognise this maxim, "Do not destroy". Iconoclastic  
reformers do no good to the world. Break not, pull not anything down, but  
build. **Help, if you can; if you cannot, fold your hands and stand by and see  
things go on. Do not injure, if you cannot render help. Say not a word against  
any man 's convictions so far as they are sincere. Secondly, take man where he  
stands, and from there give him a lift.  
**Each of us is naturally growing and developing according to his own nature;  
each will in time come to know the highest truth for after all, men must teach  
themselves.**   
What can you and I do? Do you think you can teach even a child? You cannot.  
The child teaches himself. Your duty is to afford opportunities and to remove  
obstacles. A plant grows. Do you make the plant grow? Your duty is to put a  
hedge round it and see that no animal eats up the plant, and there your duty  
ends. The plant grows of itself. So it is in regard to the spiritual growth of  
every man. None can teach you; none can make a spiritual man of you. **You  
have to teach yourself; your growth must come from inside.**   
 **What can an external teacher do? He can remove the obstructions a little,  
and there his duty ends.** Therefore help, if you can; but do not destroy.  
Give up all ideas that you can make men spiritual. It is impossible. There is  
no other teacher to you than your own soul. Recognise this. What comes of it?  
In society we see so many different natures. There are thousands and thousands  
of varieties of minds and inclinations. **A thorough generalisation of them is  
impossible, but for our practical purpose it is sufficient to have them  
characterised into four classes.**   
**To become harmoniously balanced in all these four directions is my ideal of  
religion. And this religion is attained by what we, in India, call Yoga**   
union. To the worker, it is union between men and the whole of humanity; to  
the mystic, between his lower and Higher Self; to the lover, union between  
himself and the God of Love; and to the philosopher; it is the union of all  
existence. This is what is meant by Yoga. This is a Sanskrit term, and these  
four divisions of Yoga have in Sanskrit different names. The man who seeks  
after this kind of union is called a Yogi. _The worker is called the Karma-  
Yogi. He who seeks the union through love is called the Bhakti-Yogi. He who  
seeks it through mysticism is called the Râja-Yogi. And he who seeks it  
through philosophy is called the Jnâna-Yogi So this word Yogi comprises them  
all._   
The first test of true teaching must be, that the teaching should not  
contradict reason. And you may see that such is the basis of all these Yogas.  
We take the Raja-Yoga, the psychological Yoga, the psychological way to union.  
It is a vast subject, and I can only point out to you now the central idea of  
this Yoga. We have but one method of acquiring knowledge. From the lowest man  
to the highest Yogi, all have to use the same method; and that method is what  
is called concentration.   
**Now take Karma-Yoga, the attainment of God through work.** It is evident  
that in society there are many persons who seem to be born for some sort of  
activity or other, whose minds cannot be concentrated on the plane of thought  
alone, and who have but one idea, concretised in work, visible and tangible.  
There must be a science for this kind of life too.   
**Karma-Yoga teaches us how to work for work 's sake, unattached, without  
caring who is helped, and what for.  
There is then the **Bhakti-Yoga** for the man of emotional nature, the lover.  
He wants to love God, he relies upon and uses all sorts of rituals, flowers,  
incense, beautiful buildings, forms and all such things. Do you mean to say  
they are wrong? One fact I must tell you. It is good for you to remember, in  
this country especially, that the world's great spiritual giants have all been  
produced only by those religious sects which have been in possession of very  
rich mythology and ritual. All sects that have attempted to worship God  
without any form or ceremony have crushed without mercy everything that is  
beautiful and sublime in religion.   
We lastly come to the **Jnana-Yogi,** the philosopher, the thinker, he who  
wants to go beyond the visible. He is the man who is not satisfied with the  
little things of this world. His idea is to go beyond the daily routine of  
eating, drinking, and so on; not even the teaching of thousands of books will  
satisfy him. Not even all the sciences will satisfy him; at the best, they  
only bring this little world before him.   
**Upon the same tree there are two birds, one on the top, the other below. The  
one on the top is calm, silent, and majestic, immersed in his own glory; the  
one on the lower branches, eating sweet and bitter fruits by turns, hopping  
from branch to branch, is becoming happy and miserable by turns. After a time  
the lower bird eats an exceptionally bitter fruit and gets disgustful and  
looks up and sees the other bird, that wondrous one of golden plumage, who  
eats neither sweet nor bitter fruit, who is neither happy nor miserable, but  
calm, Self-centred, and sees nothing beyond his Self.   
The lower bird longs for this condition but soon forgets it, and again begins  
to eat the fruits. In a little while, he eats another exceptionally bitter  
fruit, which makes him feel miserable, and he again looks up, and tries to get  
nearer to the upper bird. Once more he forgets and after a time he looks up,  
and so on he goes again and again, until he comes very near to the beautiful  
bird and sees the reflection of light from his plumage playing around his own  
body, and he feels a change and seems to melt away; still nearer he comes, and  
everything about him melts away, and at last he understands this wonderful  
change.**   
The lower bird was, as it were, only the substantial-looking shadow, the  
reflection of the higher; he himself was in essence the upper bird all the  
time. This eating of fruits, sweet and bitter, this lower, little bird,  
weeping and happy by turns, was a vain chimera, a dream: all along, the real  
bird was there above, calm and silent, glorious and majestic, beyond grief,  
beyond sorrow. **The upper bird is God, the Lord of this universe; and the  
lower bird is the human soul, eating the sweet and bitter fruits of this  
world. Now and then comes a heavy blow to the soul. For a time, he stops the  
eating and goes towards the unknown God, and a flood of light comes. He thinks  
that this world is a vain show. Yet again the senses drag hint down, and he  
begins as before to eat the sweet and bitter fruits of the world. Again an  
exceptionally hard blow comes.**   
His heart becomes open again to divine light; thus gradually he approaches  
God, and as he gets nearer and nearer, he finds his old self melting away.  
When he has come near enough, he sees that he is no other than God, and he  
exclaims, "He whom I have described to you as the Life of this universe, as  
present in the atom, and in suns and moons  He is the basis of our own life,  
the Soul of our soul. Nay, thou art That." **This is what this Jnana-Yoga  
teaches. It tells man that he is essentially divine. It shows to mankind the  
real unity of being, and that each one of us is the Lord God Himself,  
manifested on earth. All of us, from the lowest worm that crawls under our  
feet to the highest beings to whom we look up with wonder and awe  all are  
manifestations of the same Lord.**   
Lastly, it is imperative that all these various Yogas should be carried out  
in, practice; mere theories about them will not do any good. First we have to  
hear about them, then we have to think about them. We have to reason the  
thoughts out, impress them on our minds, and we have to meditate on them,  
realise them, until at last they become our whole life.   
No longer will religion remain a bundle of ideas or theories, nor an  
intellectual assent; it will enter into our very self. By means of  
intellectual assent we may today subscribe to many foolish things, and change  
our minds altogether tomorrow. But true religion never changes. Religion is  
realisation; not talk, nor doctrine, nor theories, however beautiful they may  
be. It is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole  
soul becoming changed into what it believes. That is religion.

Bhagavan Ramana says in Verses 11 and 12 of Sri Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai:-   
11\. When those robbers, the five senses, enter my mind, are   
you are not present there at home, to keep them out?   
12\. Youare the one without a second, the sole, real being, O   
Arunachala. Who can hide you or hide from you come in here?   
If strangers come in, it is with your knowledge. All this is but   
your jugglery.   
All multiplicity is the creation of five senses. But in one sense,   
it is the God who does this, create multiplicity to enable only the persons  
who have attained Jnana, the underlying unity.   
Kuraiyum gunamum nee allal... says Sri Arunachala Nava Mana   
Maalai Verse 7: The moment when as Annamalai, you called me and made me   
your own, you took sole charge of my spirit and my body. What   
more do I want? Merit or defect I know none apart from you.   
My very life you are. Do with me what you will. Only, only,   
give me ever increasing love for Your twin feet.   
Arunachala Siva.
