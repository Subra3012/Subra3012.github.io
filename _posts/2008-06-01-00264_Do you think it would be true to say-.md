Do you think it would be true to say that, "The object of the exercise" is to  
realise that there is no "Object" so, therefore there needs to be no  
"Exercise"?

This apparently looks like logic of "reductio at absurdum". But   
I feel, that the exercise is essential to realize that you are   
the Object. The way leads to the goal to enable one to realize   
that you are the Goal. Bhagavan replied, when some one asked   
if there is no mind in sleep, why not we always be in sleep and   
realize the no-mind state:- " that the realization is immensely   
superior to sleep, and it is a sleep-less sleep".
