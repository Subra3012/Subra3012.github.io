## watching movie

A debate was going on whether it was possible to watch a movie and at the same  
time be conscious of oneself. A survey was conducted on the first show of a  
new movie from a random sample of viewers. The movie was both emotional as  
well as thrilling.   
All except one said that they were completely lost in the movie. The movie was  
too good. The person of exception said that he was conscious of himself all  
along the movie. Comments were passed that he was telling lie, showing  
himself, having stomach ache during the movie and to the extent that:"such  
insensitiveness, why come to watch a movie at all if you cannot enjoy it; some  
other person could have enjoyed the first show"   
The surveyor caught the person alone and asked: "Sir, I am a bit surprised. I expected that someone will either like a movie  
or hate it. In either case he should be involved in the movie and lose  
oneself. If you tell me the secret, I promise to keep the reason confidential  
and only publish the result."   
The exceptional person said: "Sir, I am the producer and director of the movie. Being a producer, each  
scene brought me the thought how I will recover the money I invested in the  
movie. Being a director the thought came how others are liking the scene and  
what impressions they are having about me. So I was getting double reminders  
of 'I' with each scene."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent anecdote. Staying in I amness is possible, only when   
we are in the state of that producer. "I am the King of all that I   
survey." Whenever I see some photographs of Bhagavan Ramana,   
smiling widely or laughing, (like the one on the first month of monthly  
calendarof 2010, which I had bought in T'malai during my   
Jayanti visit), He is like telling me: "You fellow! Who cares?"   
Arunachala Siva.
