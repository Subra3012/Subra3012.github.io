## Tiruppavai - 24  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 09, 2010, 05:10:39 AM  
---  
Tiruppavai song no. 24 is sung on 24th day of Dhanur, Margazhi   
month, i.e. this year, on 8th Jan 2010. Here AndaL, the saint   
poetess describes the various avataras of Vishnu.   
O Narayana, the One who measured all the worlds with your feet*,   
glory to your feet! O the One who crossed over the ocean to Lanka   
and destroyed the demons**, glory to your valour! O the One who   
killed Sakatasura, glory to your fame! O the One who who killed   
demon who came as a calf and also killed the demon who came in the form of  
a Indian apple tree. O the One who raised   
the Govardhan mountain as an umbrella (to protect the cowherds   
and cows from torrential rains caused by Indra.). Glory to your   
features of courage. Glory to the Spear that is on your hand which   
is a nightmare to your enemies. We have come this early morning   
to sing your glory and attain your grace. Please take pity on us.   
* Vamana-Trivikarama Avatara.   
 Sri Rama Avatara   
 Krishna as a child killed Sakatasura who came in the form of   
 a fast moving cart-wheel.   
 One demon came as a calf to hit Krishna. He lifted that   
 calf and threw it on an Indian apple tree, which was also a   
 form taken by another demon. Both were killed.   
The lifting of Govardhana mountain as an umbrella to protect   
the cows and cowherds, is again in Krishna Avatara. Indra causes   
torrential rains, since puja was denied to him and instead offered   
to Govardhana mountain. Krishna lifted the Govardhana mountain   
with his little finger and raised it so that in the space below cows   
and cowherds rested without affected by rains. It lasted for 7 days.   
Srimad Bhagavatam says that Krishna also made the cows and cowherds to have no  
appetite or thirst or nature calls during these   
seven days!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 23  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 07, 2010, 11:10:36 AM  
---  
The 23rd song of Tiruppavai, is sung today, the 23rd day of Dhanur,   
Margazhi, month. This is again a simple narrative song, continuing   
the them of waking up Narayana for the early morning bathing.   
The lion in the rainy season, comes out from its sleep, from out   
of the mountain-cave. It makes a roar and looks at the surroundings   
with its fire emitting eyes. O Narayana, the god with hue of blue   
lily, you too come out from your bed and ask us for what purpose,   
we have come to your doorstep, and then bless us.   
The Sri Vaishnava scholars say that the imagery to the lion is indicative of  
Narasimha avatara. Since AndaL has been referring   
to Vamana Avatara, Sri Ramaavatara and Sri Krishnavatara in the next song,  
they say that this song is a discreet reference to Narasimha Avatara.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 25  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 09, 2010, 05:19:05 AM  
---  
The 25th song of Tiruppavai is sung today, the 25th day of Margazhi   
or Dhanur month, this year on 9th Jan. 2010. This describes the   
Krishnavatara again with particular reference to Kamsa's enmity.   
You took birth as one lady's son,   
But lived in secrecy as another lady's son.   
Kamsa who was living in constant jealousy and fear,   
Made all efforts to kill you by various plots, but had failed.   
You became a fire in his stomach.   
We have come to seek your grace, please confer us   
All wealth for a trouble-free joyous life.   
Arunachala Siva.

## watching movie  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 09, 2010, 05:50:46 AM  
---  
A debate was going on whether it was possible to watch a movie and at the same  
time be conscious of oneself. A survey was conducted on the first show of a  
new movie from a random sample of viewers. The movie was both emotional as  
well as thrilling.   
All except one said that they were completely lost in the movie. The movie was  
too good. The person of exception said that he was conscious of himself all  
along the movie. Comments were passed that he was telling lie, showing  
himself, having stomach ache during the movie and to the extent that:"such  
insensitiveness, why come to watch a movie at all if you cannot enjoy it; some  
other person could have enjoyed the first show"   
The surveyor caught the person alone and asked: "Sir, I am a bit surprised. I expected that someone will either like a movie  
or hate it. In either case he should be involved in the movie and lose  
oneself. If you tell me the secret, I promise to keep the reason confidential  
and only publish the result."   
The exceptional person said: "Sir, I am the producer and director of the movie. Being a producer, each  
scene brought me the thought how I will recover the money I invested in the  
movie. Being a director the thought came how others are liking the scene and  
what impressions they are having about me. So I was getting double reminders  
of 'I' with each scene."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent anecdote. Staying in I amness is possible, only when   
we are in the state of that producer. "I am the King of all that I   
survey." Whenever I see some photographs of Bhagavan Ramana,   
smiling widely or laughing, (like the one on the first month of monthly  
calendarof 2010, which I had bought in T'malai during my   
Jayanti visit), He is like telling me: "You fellow! Who cares?"   
Arunachala Siva.

## superset and subset  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 12:40:52 PM  
---  
A student was asked to give an example of superset-subset relationship: He wrote: Superset A = {}   
Subset B = {mind, ego, thought}   
The teacher was angry. He asked: Why did you make the superset null?   
How will you get things from a null superset in a subset?   
The student scratched his head and replied: That is what I am learning.   
The teaching gave him 0, a rejection of null.   
A holy man saw it and gave him 0, a blessing of null.   
(A set is an unordered collection of elements)

A father brought building block toys (triangles and squares) for his child to  
play.   
The blocks are as follows: Triangle:  I   
 I - I   
 I Am - Am I   
Who Am I - I Am Who   
Square: Who Am I   
Am I Am   
I Am Who   
The child used to play in various ways by placing the blocks side by side,  
putting one block above the other etc.   
After playing for a few months the child disappeared.
