Namastey,   
I heard of Sri Bhagwan Ramana Maharsri from many years but never got chance to  
listen his teaching. From the blessing of my guru Sri Sri Sri Sundara  
Chaitanyananda who recently released the CD on Upadesaram. From that day, I  
want to visit Bhagawan ramana Ashram and Arunachala temple.   
I m from Hyderabad planning to visit next month. Can you please help on the  
below questions   
1)I heard that Karthigai Deepam is a 10 day festival. I m Planning so stay  
atleast 1 day aand attend the festival. When is the Karthigai Deepam starting  
, When would be best day for me to visit   
2) Do we normally do giripradshinam and then visit the temple ? When is best  
time to start ?   
3) As I m planning in November, Do I need to book hotel before ?   
4) As I m first time visiting Tamil Nadu, What are the others devotional  
places/temples near which I can visit ? Please suggest ? and How will be  
transport facitlty from temple place   
5) Travel from Hyderabad, I heard of kesini buses mentioned in the forms. Any  
other package tours available so I can visit some more temples nearby.   
Regards,   
Shashi

Dear shiva,   
1\. You can visit Asramam and Temple in the month of November. The Kartigai  
Deepm festival commences on 7th Nov. and the   
ends on 17th Nov. On 17th, the temple authorities light the Holy Beacon on  
the Hill. That day will also be a full moon day.   
Three or four days before and after the Mahadeeapm, there will be hectic  
crowd. No hotel accommodation will be available.   
In the Asramam also, the guest rooms will have been booked in advance. So I  
suggest you start, say on the 5th day after   
Mahadeepam, i.e. 17th Nov. You can get accommodation in the hotels. Asramam  
guest rooms have to be booked three months   
before the date(s) of stay.   
2\. The giri pradkashinam can be done either before or after visiting the  
Temple. No harm. However, one should do giri   
pradakshinam starting at 6.00 a.m. after bath, to avoid crowd and sunny  
weather. Temple can be visited between 6 am   
to 11.30 p.m.   
3\. From Hyderabad, one can choose a volvo bus and come to  
Tiruvannamalai/Chennai. From Chennai you can engage a   
taxi and come to Tiruvannamalai. Only one way. They charge about Rs.  
2500.00.   
4. The Asramam is open for darsan right from 7.00 am to 12.00 Noon. The book stall is open from 8.00 a.m. to 11.00 am.   
5\. One can take food in the Asramam only when you are a guest room resident.  
Only on Mahadeeapam day, the dining is   
open to all.   
6. Nearby, there are not many great places. You can perhaps visit Trivikrama Temple (Vishnu) which is about 30 kms.   
7\. Again climbing the Hill to visit Skandasramam and Virupaksha Cave, you  
have to start at 7.00 am to avoid heat.   
These places can be seen on the Hill with a help of a guide or some known  
person who knows the routes.   
Arunachala Siva.
