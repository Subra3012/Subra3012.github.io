## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 1  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 28, 2010, 09:53:09 AM

**Verse 1**   
 _Shri Guru Charan Saroj Raj   
Nij mane mukure sudhar   
Varnao Raghuvar Vimal Jasu   
Jo dayaku phal char _   
**Meaning** :  **After cleansing the mirror of my mind with the pollen dust of holy Guru 's  
Lotus feet. I Profess the pure,untainted glory of Shri Raghuvar which bestows  
the four-fold fruits of life.(Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha).**   
 **Commentary :**   
So here purification of mind is the preliminary step.There are various ways to  
purify our mind like association with sages,participating in satsangh like  
this forum,renounciation of ego,detachment with general mass of  
people,devotion to god.....   
As RamaKrishna Paramahamsa says,   
 **The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet.The  
needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears wash  
away the mud, which is nothing but lust,anger, greed, and other evil  
tendencies, and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well.   
Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means of  
religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with the  
water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the world.  
Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart from the  
world.**   
Now this is possible with the grace of guru and surrender to guru is very much  
required.   
 **Now coming to the four fruits of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha)  
which we consider four ends or aims of human life.**   
They are (ordered from least to greatest): Kama - "wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure"   
Artha - "wealth, prosperity, glory"   
Dharma - "righteousness, duty, morality, virtue, ethics", encompassing notions  
such as ahimsa (non-violence) and satya (truth)   
Moksha - "liberation", i.e. liberation from Saṃsara, the cycle of  
reincarnation.   
So least preference of Kama,Artha should be given and we should always adhere  
to Dharma and **strive for moksa which is detaching from non-Self and absence  
of ego though complete destruction is not possible as stated by bhagavan  
ramana.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ 50 Divine Thoughts Courtesy Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham

I request readers to access the above link to read all the 50 divine  
thoughts.i will paste here few important ones.   
The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable faith  
in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows. Bhakti  
alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are the  
agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all  
places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our  
gratitude to God.   
In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need must be with  
reference to another **.Let action be out of love. Passions such as desire and  
hatred, anger and malice must be totally eschewed.** If love becomes the  
grounding principle of all deeds. then most of the ills of the world will  
vanish.   
What is the purpose of human birth? To earn, to eat, to undergo misery  
everyday and finally to die? Instead of earning and suffering, can we not die  
now? The purpose of birth is to avoid re-birth. Except man, all animals grow  
horizontally. Only man grows vertically. Instead of growing horizontally, it  
is God's will that he should grow vertically in order to look up. God has  
given to animals devices for self-protection; to man alone He has given  
intelligence. **By doing nothing, we avoid re-birth; By giving up attachment,  
we avoid sins.**   
When any object is consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black residue  
is burnt again, it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain white even  
when burnt again. This shows that white is the ultimate and black is proximate  
to it. Science tells us that diamond and coal are basically one. White and  
black are not colours. The primary colours get separated from the objects to  
which they are attached when subjected to the test of fire and ultimately  
white.Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the Ultimate Reality is  
Siva, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who is dark. When we test  
everything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge, the residue is Siva. Ash  
in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the spiritual plane. **We smear  
our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves of Siva and the fact that  
the ultimate goal of life is Siva.**   
Right education should make us know that God is the Truth. Knowledge must fill  
one with good qualities, through which one can realise the Truth, that is God.  
Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the understanding of the Ultimate Truth.  
The first fruit of education must be humility and self control.   
 **Why so many Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak  
of one God only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to  
satisfy hunger, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger. Then  
why can 't we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side dishes?  
So, if we eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food tasty to  
the palate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a particular God  
he worships that.   
By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty. What is essential for life and  
honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is for  
this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should not  
increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their  
prosperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we  
increase our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it  
will only produce poverty and sorrow.**   
Vedanta which is the peak of the Vedas teaches the way for the removal of  
sorrow. Hatred and desire arise only in respect of the objects other than us.  
That desire will not arise if those objects are rendered identical with us, if  
there is nothing other than us, then desire will not arise. **If there is no  
desire, there will be no effort and no sin. When there is no sin, there will  
be no body and there will be no misery.**   
 **Our religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -  
purification. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and conflict.  
The reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of Hinduism, in  
spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure of money, etc.,  
is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are impressed. We  
develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion. There is a text in  
the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees automatically. If we  
examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect, the world will follow  
him.**   
 **It is clear to us that there is birth and there is death.Passion is the  
cause of birth. Time is the cause of death. What is created by passion is  
destroyed by time.** If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the  
tree dies. Kaalo Jagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate when  
time comes. If there is no passion, there is no production. If there is no  
time then there is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and  
Kaama. Iswara burnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is  
neither birth nor death for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father  
and Mother.   
**Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as iron filings  
are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;  
the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.**   
A mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and  
eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child.  
Similarly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire picture of  
life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the past  
and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper  
perspective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper  
setting.   
Whenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must remember the divine  
source from which he derived the qualifications to receive that honour, and  
feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - importance.   
 **Cultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;   
Look at others as yourself;   
Give up war; give up jealousy;   
Don't commit aggression without reason;   
Mother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;   
The Lord God is like father showering mercy   
People of the World !   
Live with discipline;   
Live with charity;   
Live with mercy;   
May all people attain greater well - being**

Mano Nasam is destruction of the ego, [which also lies in the form   
of mind and thoughts.]. Ahandai uru azhithale mukti, the destrcution   
of the ego is liberation, thus ends ULLadu Narpadu.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju ji   
First of all it is a thought we identify with the body and mind. 2nd thought  
is I am incomplete or unhappiness.   
3rd is without going inside going for truth is also thought. Once we realised  
there we do not require any thoughts   
i.e. thoughtless state. Bhagavan also says. like a stick which helps to burn  
the dead body at last the stick also will get burnt. These types of good  
thoughts are welcome which lead us to thoughtless state.   
(these are all I learned points. That is all. I am always with full of  
thoughtful stage only. Praying Bhagavan to that stage daily)   
Ramanaduli
