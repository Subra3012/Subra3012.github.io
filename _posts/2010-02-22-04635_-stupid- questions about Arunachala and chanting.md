## (stupid) questions about Arunachala and chanting

Hi, in the past I've done a buddhist mantra and my reason for doing it was  
simply to make my voice deeper. I know that there can't be much more dumber or  
materialistic motivation, but otherwise I consider my self a serious seeker. I  
meditate atleast an hour every day and I think about Ramana Maharshi's and  
other Advaita teachers teachings almost all day long. I just suffer from low  
self-esteem and my squeaky voice makes it more difficult to be in social  
situations. So now I've been chanting Arunachala Siva recently but I'm  
wondering is it a little blasphemous to repeat God's name for such unholy  
purposes. So should I just go back to my old mantra?   
And I've been thinking about putting a picture of Arunachala mountain as my  
wall paper. But this computer screen has over 60 icons (it has other users)  
and it would be like a picture of Krishna covered in soil so perhpaps it would  
be a little sacroligous too.(?)

Dear friend,   
You can chant Arunachala Akshramana Maalai or any other works   
of Bhagavan, if it is for a purpose of your good health including good   
voice. There is no blashpemy. My wife chants within her mind, when   
she suffers a bronchial attack. This does not mean that you should   
not take medication. Medicines are given by doctors, the cure is by   
faith in Guru or God.   
If you have been initiated in a mantra, you can also continue that.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think you can have two purposes at the same time.   
To deepen your voice and to deepen your faith.   
You say it might be blasphemous to repeat God's name for such unholy purposes.   
I think Buddhist mantra is as sacred as Arunachala Siva mantra.   
As for Arunachala wall-paper, I understand your point.   
I used Arunachala photo as a wallpaper for my computer,   
in order to keep remembering it,   
but after reading your comment,   
I decided not to use it as a wallpaper.   
It is true that the holy photo seems to be contaminated with worldly  
documents.   
How you feel about this question would be different from person to person.   
You can do whatever seems to purify your mind.

I've been thinking about this too and I wonder how could something totally  
Pure be contaminated by such puny things But I've still not put it as  
wallpaper (because my sister would change it anyway).   
And btw, I also found out that chanting improves breathing which is healthy  
for the brain and the mind.   
Edit: And thank you Subramanian for your answer. I couldn't reply to it before  
for some reason, and my private message to you neither got sent.

How can Atma be contaminated? It is Absolute, nitya-suddhan,   
ever-pure, nirvikaran, ever without change and nirmalan, ever   
in uncontaminated in Itself. I have got Bhagavan Ramana's photo   
as the wallpaper in the comp. and Graham Boyd has placed the   
Hill on the website. Only we think we contaminate it, it will be   
contaminated because our mind enters the picture. The one way   
is to keep it in the photo in the Home Altar which is said to be   
kept pure. And again, it is mental play. I say my mantra Arunachala Siva, if  
I get up at 2 am., for urination and I say this   
mantra while in the toilet. Nothing happens to the Atma. It is   
ever pure.   
Arunachala Siva.

there is only one word you should remember   
during the entire lifespan of your search for reality   
this word is "differentiation"   
people are so far away from reality because they do not know   
how to differentiate   
we must remind each other to differentiate   
and the ones who know very well, to differentiate   
must teach others how to differentiate   
and it does not matter at all in what context   
as long as differentiation is the practice   
a person without faith must differentiate   
a person with faith must differentiate no matter what kind of faith   
differentiation is the whole point! this is natural logic meditation is the  
practice of differentiation   
all three bodies can be revealed as dream, through the practice of  
differentiation   
i should write it on my forehead differentiation for people to see   
the earth body must differentiate in order to avoid danger, the astral body  
must differentiate in order to create dream-objects   
the causal body must differentiate in order to dwell in the bliss of the self,  
burning away desires or enjoy deep intellectual thought   
but who is differentiating?   
the meditation of, who is differentiating or "who am i"   
(human life really..), has the power to reveal the reality behind the dream   
the reality being you, the rest being dream   
so you say, yea, of course.. and in that moment you do not differentiate..   
so, you must look within, sit and differentiate dream from reality   
what you will find, is that you are always differentiating   
it is your nature to differentiate   
when you have differentiated through all dream, you will be free and not a  
moment before that   
you can have anything you want when you are free.. there is no lack of  
differentiation   
oh how it must have bothered Ramana, all this lack of differentiation in front  
of Him, some stories reflect this
