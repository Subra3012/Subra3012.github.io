After a few days, when alone, as a result of his association with saints and  
the good deeds done selflessly   
in the past, he started inquiring thus, 'Who am I?' Who is my Lord? Why does  
one got entangled with the   
chain of births and deaths? How can one get released? From the study of  
scriptures, he realized that the   
karmic actions are the seeds of birth and that the karmic cycle can end only  
with Self Knowledge, and not   
by any other means. He also realized that this Self Knowledge can come only  
through the grace of a Sadguru,   
and he then approached several teachers, but was turned down by them all. He  
became sad and despondent.   
He then heard of a saint on a hillock called Kailasagiri near the village of  
Kadaamoor, near Polur. The Kailasagiri Swami was very ascetic in appearance,  
full of compassion and firm in Self abidance. On hearing about the qualities  
of this saint, Dasar, immediately went to Kadaamoor and saw the saint  
surrounded by a number of disciples. Filled with joy he prostrated at his  
feet. Then rising, he pleaded, 'My father! Give refuge   
to this poor one and uplift him.' On seeing his dispassion and spiritual  
ripeness, the saint gave him a   
gracious look and asked him to be seated.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
