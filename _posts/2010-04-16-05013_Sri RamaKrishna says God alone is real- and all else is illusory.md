Once, several men were crossing the Ganges in a boat. One of them, a  
pandit,was making a great display of his erudition, saying that he had studied  
various booksthe Vedas, the Vedanta, and the six systems of philosophy. He  
asked a fellow passenger, "Do you know the Vedanta?" "No,revered sir." "The  
Samkhya and the Patanjala?" "No, revered sir." "Have you read no philosophy  
whatsoever?" "No, revered sir."   
The pandit was talking in this vain way and the passenger sitting in silence  
when a great storm arose and the boat was about to sink. The passenger said to  
the pandit,   
"Sir, can you swim?" "No", replied the pandit. The passenger said, "1 don't  
know Samkhya or the Patanjala, but I can swim."   
 **What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing needful is  
to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else  
is illusory.**

Both Sri Ramakrishna and Bhagavan Ramana did not encourage   
much of yoga sadhana. No doubt, Bharavi Brahmani taught SRK   
about Sri Vidya Marga, which is also a modification of Yoga marga,   
SRK did not pursue it, since in that Veera Marga, one should   
have copulation with a woman, treating her as Devi. SRK refused   
saying that all women were his mothers.   
About the yogis, we all know that Bhagavan Ramana did not   
approve yogic feats since raja yoga diverts one attention to   
siddhis and prevent the practiser in knowing the Atma.   
Once a yogi was, in the absence of a boat to cross Ganga, used   
his yogic siddhi and walked on the waters of Ganga and reached   
the other shore. He was describing his feat to one of SRK's   
disciples. The disciple came and told SRK. SRK laughed and   
said: See, "he has wasted 12 years of his life to learn this feat.   
If you pay a quarter anna, a boat man will ferry you across Ganga!"   
Once a person who was earlier in the Asramam, went to some   
other place and learnt yogic feats. He brought kumkum and vibhuti,   
for the devotees who complained to him of some difficulties and   
sought cure. Once Kunju Swami went to see him. He was telling   
about his "magics" to Kunju Swami and asked him: "Whether   
your Swami can do all these?"   
Kunju Swami laughed and said: "No. Since my Swami has no   
mind or ego, all these feats which are learnt by ego cannot   
be exhibited by him." Everyone in the crowd laughed.   
Arunachala Siva.
