## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna Parable To Explain What Is Maya

ONCE Narada besought the Lord of the universe,"Lord, show me that Maya of  
Thine which can make the impossible possible." The Lord nodded assent.  
Subsequently the Lord one day set out on a travel with Narada. After going  
some distance, He felt very thirsty and fatigued. So He sat down and told  
Narada, "Narada, I feel much thirsty; please get me a little water from  
somewhere." Narada at once ran in search of water.   
Finding no water nearby, he went far from the place and saw a river at a great  
distance. When he approached the river, he saw a most charming young lady  
sitting there, and was at once captivated by her beauty. As soon as Narada  
went near her,she began to address him in sweet words, and ere long, both fell  
in love with each other. Narada then married her, and settled down as a  
householder. In course of time he had a number of children by her.And while he  
was thus living happily with his wife and children, there came a pestilence in  
the country. Death began to collect its toll from every place. Then Narada  
proposed to abandon the place and go somewhere else.His wife acceded to it,  
and they both came out of their house leading their children by the hand. But  
no sooner did they come to the bridge to cross the river than there came a  
terrible flood, and in the rush of water, all their children were swept away  
one after another, and at last the wife too was drowned.   
**Overwhelmed with grief at his bereavement, Narada sat down on the bank and  
began to weep piteously. Just then the Lord appeared before him, saying, "O  
Narada,where is the water? And why are you weeping?"   
The sight of the Lord startled the sage, and then he understood everything. He  
exclaimed, "Lord, my obeisance to You, and my obeisance also to Your wonderful  
Maya!"**

Once, several men were crossing the Ganges in a boat. One of them, a  
pandit,was making a great display of his erudition, saying that he had studied  
various booksthe Vedas, the Vedanta, and the six systems of philosophy. He  
asked a fellow passenger, "Do you know the Vedanta?" "No,revered sir." "The  
Samkhya and the Patanjala?" "No, revered sir." "Have you read no philosophy  
whatsoever?" "No, revered sir."   
The pandit was talking in this vain way and the passenger sitting in silence  
when a great storm arose and the boat was about to sink. The passenger said to  
the pandit,   
"Sir, can you swim?" "No", replied the pandit. The passenger said, "1 don't  
know Samkhya or the Patanjala, but I can swim."   
 **What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing needful is  
to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else  
is illusory.**

Both Sri Ramakrishna and Bhagavan Ramana did not encourage   
much of yoga sadhana. No doubt, Bharavi Brahmani taught SRK   
about Sri Vidya Marga, which is also a modification of Yoga marga,   
SRK did not pursue it, since in that Veera Marga, one should   
have copulation with a woman, treating her as Devi. SRK refused   
saying that all women were his mothers.   
About the yogis, we all know that Bhagavan Ramana did not   
approve yogic feats since raja yoga diverts one attention to   
siddhis and prevent the practiser in knowing the Atma.   
Once a yogi was, in the absence of a boat to cross Ganga, used   
his yogic siddhi and walked on the waters of Ganga and reached   
the other shore. He was describing his feat to one of SRK's   
disciples. The disciple came and told SRK. SRK laughed and   
said: See, "he has wasted 12 years of his life to learn this feat.   
If you pay a quarter anna, a boat man will ferry you across Ganga!"   
Once a person who was earlier in the Asramam, went to some   
other place and learnt yogic feats. He brought kumkum and vibhuti,   
for the devotees who complained to him of some difficulties and   
sought cure. Once Kunju Swami went to see him. He was telling   
about his "magics" to Kunju Swami and asked him: "Whether   
your Swami can do all these?"   
Kunju Swami laughed and said: "No. Since my Swami has no   
mind or ego, all these feats which are learnt by ego cannot   
be exhibited by him." Everyone in the crowd laughed.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Who is afraid of death?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 16, 2010, 03:05:26 PM

There was a concentration camp and there were prisoners during   
World War II. The prisoners were quite happy, playing cards,   
carrom and chess and laughing and giggling. One journalist came   
to interview them. He became aghast seeing the happy nature   
of the prisoners. He asked them: How come you are all extremely   
joyful. You are going to be executed in a month's time. Are you   
not afraid of the impending death?   
One prisoner looked at the journalist and said: At least our dates   
of execution are known to us in advance. But what about your case?   
You may even be shot dead tomorrow. Why should we worry about   
death at all? It may happen or it may not happen. Either way,   
we don't care. We are happy today. That is all.   
One Sanskrit pandit quoted a sloka from a scripture and said   
that we are not afraid of death because of our ajnana, ignorance.   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye! It is not due to that. It is due   
to the truth that in our intuitive knowledge, we are deathless.   
That is our real state. If this intuitive knowledge becomes, the   
experiential truth, then we shall fully understand that our intuitive   
knowledge is the truth.   
Arunachala Siva.
