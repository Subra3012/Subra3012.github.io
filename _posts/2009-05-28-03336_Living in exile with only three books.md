Dear Ramanaduli,   
In any Sadhana, concentration is the essence of success.   
If it is Puja, cocentrate on the Puja, on the idol to whom   
you do Puja, concentrate on every flower that you offer,   
concentrate on the mantra you chant. Live in total concentration, till you  
offer Arti, place it on your eyes   
and complete the Puja.   
If it is mantra japa, do not count the mantras. If you   
do so, your mind will go only into the counting mathematics.   
Do it without counting, as far as practicable.   
If it is meditation, instead of mediating on Pure Space,   
try to meditate on a symbol, say Bhagavan Ramana's face   
or feet. Chant mantra within your lips and if any thought   
drags you out, you mentally imagine, that you are placing   
a flower on His feet and come back to the meditating mode.   
This is my practice.   
Arunachala Siva.

my sadhana is as follows(I practice tibetan buddism so some terms might be  
new): I start with the 9 breath, a cleansing and focusing meditation,always done in  
the beginning to create afresh mind...   
then I recite prayers to guru padmasambhava (to remove hindrances on the path)   
then I either do a vajrasattva cleansing visualization (that burns away karmas  
and removes hindrances to enlightment) or I directly start with dzogchen  
meditation   
then anyway 15 - 20 mintues dzogchen meditation....sitting relaxed and simply  
triing to relaxe into the moment or presence....thats the easiest explanation  
I can give...anyway one needs contact to a realized teacher in order to get  
benefit from this meditation...   
sometimes I do the blue-hung breath also in this phase...it is a analytical  
dzogchen praxis that slowly weakens the believe that there is something else  
then open space and awereness in the inside or outside (it actually transcends  
the believe that there is a bounery between inside and outside or that  
something like an inside and outside exists in reality...)   
then I recite prayers again   
then comes 15-20 minutes tonglen (giving and taking meditation for opening the  
heart): here I visualize guru ramana maharshi, I visualize him sitting in my heart  
center (the conventionel one not the spot on the right side) I stay with this  
a while, till I feel his grace unfolding   
then I start to breath in my pain, hurt, muscle tensions....all that stand  
between me and total surrender to what arises....this I breath into the heart  
center, there bhagawan tranforms it with his loving gracefullness into love  
and compassion, then I breath out this love and compassionate energy to  
myself...   
then I proceed further, I breath in my pain, and the pain of other seekers  
facing the same problems like me...and I breath out love and compassion to me  
and these seekers...   
then i continue even more and eventually breath in all pain and struggle of  
all sentient beeings and breath out love and compassion in return....(thats  
why it is called giving and taking)....I usually do not proceed so far, as my  
concentration and also my heart capacity is not big enough for htis...and it  
is clearly stated that you should understand your own pain before you take in  
the pain of all samsara   
I cry alot while I meditate in this way, it is a very strong meditation and  
visualizing bhagawan in the heart is a strong heart opener for itself...   
then I calm down and make dzogchen meditation again (sometimes with red hung,  
only I did the blue hung before...this is to destroy all sense of "substance"  
in the inside and outside world)   
tonglen should always be practiced between sittings where one meditated on  
awereness...becasue the emotional turmoil can be very strong so you have to  
remain witness to all of this (therefor the dzogchen meditaiton before and  
afterwards)   
then I recite prayers and send all the benefit out to the world that I may  
have recived through my practice...   
then I mostly lie down on the ground in the "corpse" asana and meditate on  
beeingness itself...as deep as possible, sometimes I enquire like bhagawan  
(what will be left when I die, what is there that is deathless...) I never  
reached nirvikalpa samdhi but I had some kinds of dhyana and the liing on the  
ground is important to "integrate" the insights into the body...letting the  
body go more and more...   
thats it...of course I do not have the time to meditte this long every day,  
but when I have the time I use it..   
when I do not have the time...I just make dzogchen meditation or self enquery  
to start the day..

I remember a saying of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi which means: This world is not your true home, but your sadhana will take you to your true  
Home.   
Sri Ramakrishna said: When you meditate, think that your mind is tied to the feet of the Divine  
Mother.   
Sri Ramakrishna also said: When you worship, think that you and your Lord are the only two persons in the  
world.   
I remember a holy person saying: When the rays of the light from the lamp touches the image of the Lord, the  
Lord blesses it and   
when the reflected rays touches our eyes, we get the touch of the divine.   
I also remember the same person saying: Whenever one prays to God, God appears immediately, but we do not understand  
it.   
Also a saying,   
Do not get up immediately after worship, for the divine blessings descend  
during that time.   
One of my friend once said that: During meditation he once felt that Goddess is keeping her feet on his head,  
so his concentration   
did not waver.   
For self-enquiry,   
Put the head to sleep and keep the heart awake.   
Feel the I-I consciousness shining within the cave of the heart.   
Om Shanti. ..

Hi   
I always remember that this (everything) is God now.   
Practice implies that something is lacking, that there is something better in  
the future,   
and you could keep postponing forever.   
Get here, this is God now.

yes very true sky person   
but if it is the truth then why not practice? as practice is also arising in  
the here and now, so why stop practicing if it is not different from god?   
of course one can think that practice is an expression of something  
lacking...but thats also ok isnt it? so why stop practicing?   
natural perfection is the here and now, and if everything is always natural  
and perfect then why say that when I sit down and meditate, the natural  
perfection is not present...the scriptures indicate that something like this  
is not possible...no little self has the power to eliminate the fact that  
everything is always selfliberated activity of conciousness...including  
practice, arising in it, so it would be a very strange thing if meditation is  
the direct means to make natural perfection disapear....(it is always there  
but when I sit down to meditate upon this fact--> then it is gone?)   
so if the mind-set now starts to say: practice is an expression of my ego  
saying that it is not complete and whole,so I should stop with it and be in  
the here and now...(beeing here and now is no activity anyway)   
then who says it?   
anyway hello to the forum and please clearify

Finding ourselves looks like going merry go around. The question "Who am I" if  
we ask ourselves, then who is asking,   
supposing if I do not ask this question, there are lots of chating within my  
head, If I open my mouth and tell what is going on, I have to do with   
the mind. Therefore I think the questioner and the question both are the same  
mind. The question also arises from the mind. The answer also lfrom the  
mind.Is not it. At the same time some one is witnessing all the happenings.   
So the person who is seeing all the happening is THE SO CALLED CONSIOUSNESS.   
Am I right?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes, what is aware of everything going on but doesn´t react nor act on it, is  
consciousness and the inner guru. The I is a thought, if mind gets  
concentration on it, thinking´s movement stops and there is only this primal  
thought which has a component of consciousness as well, so you leave aside the  
thought and concentrate on the consciousness aspect of the I. This  
consciousness is not different from the Self Itself, since there aren´t two  
self nor two consciousness but only one. Practice, as Bhagavan taught us, is  
an instrument for stilling and cleaning up the mind in order to be what we are  
without identifications with what has been added which is body and thoughts.  
So, practice is not for getting something we lack of but, au contraire, to  
leave aside what is leftover. It is like cleaning a gold object covered by  
rust, uncontrolled thinking without attention or awareness is what generates  
the rust but gold is there already. We can´t meet gold through an act of  
willing, this meeting is something that just happens. All we can do is to  
clean the mind and we do it because we are impelled by the Self to do it.  
That´s enough, for me at least. Problem is that our habit is to do everything  
in order to get something else and not to do just for the sake of doing, when  
true is that the first doing slaves and the second one frees.

Hi,   
This is what I feel: Yes, during self-enquiry one abides in the underlying awareness.   
The awareness is behind all thoughts, emotions, feelings etc.   
Initially thoughts seem to take the upperhand and the awareness may appear  
feeble,   
but with practice the deeper self becomes more and more prominent and an inner  
tranquil void results.   
During that state one senses the presence of "I-I" consciousness.   
When this state becomes stable, it is no more required to mentally ask "Who am  
I?".   
The attention by itself stays put in the deeper self as a honey-bee remains  
engrossed in seeping honey from the flower.   
This state gives an inner calmness.   
Thoughts, emotions etc disturb us less.   
One can carry on with the daily works with a calm mind.   
A yogi however goes much beyond this state.   
For that full-time sadhana is required in a solitary place.   
The engagements in the life of a normal working person will not permit this.   
Om Shanti. ..

Hello again.   
When i was a child we used to sing a hymn which went   
All things bright and beautiful   
The Lord God made them all.   
So I always thought God was seperate, out there somewhere and seperate from  
his creation.   
In adult life I spent many years trying different methods to try to attain  
enlightenment.   
One day I realised that God cannot create anything that was not part of  
himself. Where would he get the stuff   
from ? Borrow it from another God ? Then I realised that I must be part of  
this too.   
So. There isn't anything that isn't God in existence. Even thoughts are  
created and supported and are part of God.   
But having read the above posts I realise that practice is very important too  
in many ways.   
I'm a musician and have to practice a lot otherwise I get rusty too.   
Thanks. Sky.

Dear sky, Welcome to the Forum.   
Dear matthias, silentgreen, shadak, ramanaduli and others: Why bad thoughts? If the Self is everything, one without   
the second, why bad thoughts, then bad thoughts are also   
the Self. Yes, no quarrel. But who created bad thoughts?   
Is it God? Bad thoughts and good thoughts, both are   
created by us, due to our karmas. God is simply is. He   
has no thoughts. Then who brought all the thoughts. It is we.   
Not definitely god.   
Dear matthias and silentgreen, Wonderful explanations   
of the practices adopted by you. The cleansing process   
is called Chittasuddhi in Hinduism. One cannot simply   
say, I am Brahman and keep on nourishing thoughts. The   
practice is only to ward off the thoughts and try to become   
thoughtless. It is also, I can add, to remove the duality,   
thinking god is somewhere outside in the Heavens. This   
duality, brings about other dualities also in life. I am good,   
he is bad, I am miserable, he is happy, I am handsome, she   
is not beautiful, all these crap. The practice as Bhagavan   
Ramana said is of twofold: 1\. Vichara is one where one keeps his mind in Atma Swarupa.   
2\. Dhayana is one where one considers himself with   
conviction, bhavana, that he is Brahman and Sat Chit   
Anandam. Here, it is consideration, not thinking, with   
bhavana.   
 \- Who am I?   
Practice helps to ward off thoughts other than godhead.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi Munagala   
Thought has also produced all the worlds literature and music, not to mention  
medical science and all the   
other sciences. Thought created the internet which allows us to talk now etc  
etc.   
Back to practice   
In Sri Shankara's Vivekachudamani he says   
That truth cannot be realised through purificatory baths, offerings, breath  
control, or any other   
practice. He who seeks liberation through knowledge of the Self must enquire  
into the Self with the help   
of the perfect Guru. ......

Dear munagala,   
Thoughts are product of sin. Here, the sin means ego,   
which is the first principle, that divides man and godhead.   
This thought can be good or bad. Bad thoughts, we all   
agree create bad actions. Even these bad actions are   
called bad according to circumstances. A soldier can   
kill any number of soldiers of enemy camp, and get   
appreciation. But if he kills a civilian on the road, he   
is punished. A king can marry any number of girls   
and bring them to his harem. A citizen cannot marry   
many girls. So all good thoughts also produce evil. Take   
atom bomb. It came out of a detailed experiment in scince,   
whose basic laws of relativity and thermodyanamics are   
quite good for peaceful purposes. But the same principles   
created an atom bomb and killed lakhs of people.   
Now to bad thoughts, bad thoughts apparently produce   
bad actions which are sin. But there could be some bad   
thoughts [very rare indeed], which can produce good   
results. Like the rishi who decided to bluff to the hunter   
who had come chasing a deer, saying that there was no   
deer on that side. The deer was saved. All said, it is a lie.   
That is why, Bhagavan Ramana said: Summa Iru, Be Still,   
Be thoughtless. But it is quite difficult for most of us.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ajanani"s actions are thoughtfullness whereas Jnani's actions are thoughtless  
actions. In their presence actions (good) all are taken places.   
He does not plan or expect the results. An ordinary person think hundred times

How pleasant! A year old mail from last Spring that sprouts new leaves!   
I loved in particular the humor bubbling in the choices and reasons for  
choices, but it was Subramaniam's choice of a 4th book that sparked a reply  
from me.   
D. T. Suzuki's "Essays in Zen Buddhism" was a mainstay for me for many years.  
It's odd, in a way the texts are tedious to read with words and concepts I  
could barely grasp, like a slow sonorous chanting of sutras I saw on TV once,  
then -- suddenly -- a flash of light of insight of understanding that  
disappear almost before I could recognize them.   
Then, one morning, alone on a night shift, about 3 in the morning, I closed  
the copy of the essays I was reading - suddenly, I was up out of my chair  
dancing across the room, on the floor, on the table tops, singing a song.  
Surprised, I then scratched the words down on a manila envelope I pulled out  
of a waste basket:  **You are reality, beyond all belief   
You are the living tree, nourishing my green leaf   
You are the hight, the footstep and the path   
You are the answer, with no questions asked   
You are the beauty shining in each lover's face   
You are that certain place of no time or space   
 Smaller than an atom   
 Bigger than a star   
 Able to go slowly fast,   
 You stay quickly far   
You are, you are, you are...   
You are the holy rock   
You are the distant shore   
You are life itself and even death   
 pales before   
Your emptiness   
Ah, but my books? I dunno, I really don't know, many clamor for attention,  
the thick ones claim they have more to say and the thin ones say that their  
conciseness and brevity is what increases their value -- so, a couple of  
books, one thick, one thin, and a picture of Ramana -- sigh -- but which  
picture?

I have to search for the three volumes of Essays in Zen Buddhism.   
I feel like reading them once again. I bought it in Adyar Library   
of JK in Chennai about ten years back. The new copies would cost me at least  
Rs 2000/=.

Subramiam R.,   
I just checked Amazon for the heck of it - series 3 (the three volumes) costs  
25£ (used) and series 2 (the one I have) 5£.   
A little known work which I got almost by accident is his "Swedenborg, Buddha  
of the North", goes for 3.60£ - it's one of his earliest works and  
introduced me to Swedenborg, a difficult fellow to get to know.   
love - being -aware

Is he the Immanuel Swedenborg, the author of Uncertainty   
Principle?

Dear srkudai,   
Thanks. I think some "unlearning" has already started in me!
