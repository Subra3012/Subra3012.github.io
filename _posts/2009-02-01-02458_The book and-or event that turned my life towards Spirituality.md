Pranam,   
I am always fascinated to read about how people turn to the spiritual path. It  
is usually an event or a book or a passage or some utterance by some person  
that changes ones life completely. I would like to know from our forum  
members, what was it that turned your life towards the spiritual pursuit.   
In my case it was reading the book Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.   
Om sri Ramana

I grew up in an atmosphere of Muruga bhakti, because my father   
used to chant Tiruppugazh songs everyday in the pooja. Muruga   
is also our family deity. My father turned to Sri Satya Sai Baba and stopped  
all reading and rituals in his later years, but that is another matter. I  
started reading Tiruvachakam, from late 1980s and this book attracted me very  
much. I was reading one decad everyday and the whole of 566 songs of  
Tiruvachakam on Sundays. When later, I was given the Tamil book, Bhagavad  
Vachnamrutam, Tamil   
translation of Talks of Munagala Venkatramiah by Sri A.R. Natarajan in  
Bangalore. And this made me to arrive at Sri Ramana. The equation, Muruga  
(six faced Siva) = Siva (five faced) = Sri Ramana, fitted very well.   
Arunachala Siva.

When I was a boy of about 7 I can remember pressing the palm of my hands  
against my eye lids and trying to focus on the colours and shapes that  
appeared. Sometimes it happened in lessons at school for a few minutes. The  
reason why has gone now. Looking at it now, it was a small pointer towards  
internalisation.   
The Kung Fu series with David Carridine in the 1970s had an impact. It was  
the characters peaceful state of mind.   
It wasnt until my early twenties that I said there must be something more  
than this. I have a recollection of asking GOD for help. There was some  
unhappiness at the time and having read a couple of basic books on yoga, went  
to the towns library to find some more books on it. There in front of me was a  
stand containing some leaflets for the Institute of Classical Yoga. I called  
the number and spoke to Philip Chirgwin who taught (if that is the right word)  
the classes. Those classes meant so much. It confirmed to me that the answer  
is internal. There were some names that were passed on from those classes they  
were Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna, Sri Yogendra and the Shivapuri Baba.  
Eventually the classes stopped.   
I read a book about the Shivapuri Baba and he talked about right life but it  
was difficult to get the real meaning of it. There was one on Ramana Maharshi  
that talked about self enquiry but the technique for it did not jump out.  
There was one on Ramakrishna. Some of these books I read from time but  
couldnt grasp their meaning.   
Sometime in my mid thirties we were on holiday near a little market town that  
had more book shops than I had ever seen before. One of the shops was closing  
down but it looked inviting because there appeared to be books of a spiritual  
nature. The one book I left the shop with was The Path of Sri Ramana  part  
one by Sri Sadhu Om. Slowly over a number of years the book began to have some  
meaning.   
The name of Sri Ramana Mahasrhi began to mean something. The internet brought  
me to this website and to Self enquiry and to Arunachala. I hope one day to  
see the Mountain ItSelf.   
All those years and I am still at the bottom of the Spiritual hill. But I am  
at the right hill.

The book or utterances by a holy person are just excuses,it is our innate  
spiritual tendencies(Daive vasanas) which turn us to   
spiritual path when time is ripe.However this will not happen without the aid  
of grace.Eswaranugraha,swaprayatna and   
kalaparipakva act in determining the course of our spiritual life.

Pranam,   
Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
You are right in as much as, it is our innate spiritual tendencies which turn  
us towards the spiritual path. But these tendencies need a trigger and the  
book or utterances or events although just excuses are quite inspirational and  
turn us inwards.   
Om shri Ramana

My parents were from hindu and catholic backgrounds and encouraged spiritual  
enquiry without ever pressing the matter. I have always been intrigued by the  
spiritual aspect of religion and began earnest enquiry in my early twenties.  
Suffice to say, I explored many traditions and practices from the East, always  
making progress, modifying my practice and taking the wisdom from each school,  
and then, a few months ago I came across a picture of Bhagavan that my mother  
had placed on her shrine. I found I could not take my gaze away from the  
image, I recognised his qualities and couldn't quite believe that I had found  
the true guru. His teaching is indeed silent.

Dear munagala, I am happy to read your post. For a sincere aspirant, the  
Guru and the mantra comes of its own accord at the appropriate time. Bhagavan  
Ramana heard the word "Arunachalam" from one of His uncles. Later He came to  
know that It is Tiruvannamalai. The mantra and the Guru (the Hill) came to Him  
at the appropriate times.   
Arunachala Siva.

I had read books on psychology that introduced me to altered stats of  
consciousness. During these altered states people would have spiritual  
experiences. This was my first introduction to spirituality, apart from the  
superficial kind that is prevalent in Western/Eurocentric culture.

It was a strong feeling of being or self consciousness what turned my life  
towards spirituality, I was very young then and I used to play what to me was  
just a game, I.e: to look at my thoughts and all the events of the day without  
reaction but just keeping the feeling of being or self as the only important  
thing. Soon I changed my prayers by this game every night, before going to  
sleep, for years. I loved those moments and each time I sat down to play my  
game I felt I was coming back home, which was inside. One day, I found to be  
at home every time, even during the day. It was very normal and natural to me  
till the point that I believed it was the same for everyone, but years later I  
discovered that it wasn´t so. People used to say that I was different and I  
wanted to know why I was different but I couldn´t guess it, till I left my  
practice and started to live a mundane life. I thought that that thing  
would be always there, and it was for many years even at the time I didn´t  
practice and had a mundane life, but one day that I was tired of the mundane,  
I wanted to come back home and I found that the door was closed, that  
thing, the self, was still there, I could feel it, somehow, but I couldn´t  
get at it anymore. What had been my joy, became a great suffering. Then begun  
my search, I spent years and years looking for someone to show me the way  
home, meeting people, reading and so on. This way, I arrived from Europe to  
Pondichery where I spent 20 days. Two days before to come back to my country I  
remembered a book by Paul Brunton that I had read long time ago and asked for  
the Ramanashram, I was happy to hear it was near and that I could visit it in  
the return journey, before arriving to the airport. At the very moment I  
entered in Ramanashram I knew that I had been loosing my time in India and  
that that was the place I was looking for, but I had to leave I haven´t cried  
so much in all my life as I cried when I finally sat down in the airplane,  
and I couldn´t explain myself such a strong reaction, totally out of my  
control. After that, I read all the books I could get about Bhagavan. When I  
recognized my game in His teachings, many things became quite clear to me  
about what I had been doing when almost a child. Then I knew that it wasn´t a  
game. Not at all. I have had to pass over many things, troubles, doubts,  
fears, culpability and so on before to start again with practice. To know what  
I´m doing and all what it implies makes it quite difficult for me, but  
sometimes I can forget everything and then I can find myself again at home.  
One of these difficulties was that I was alone in this, so when I found a  
budist monk I started to follow his teachings, I liked it, it was fine but  
that wasn´t for me. I had to come back to Bhagavan, in spite of my loneliness.  
I was complaining about it some weeks ago when I clicked Ramana Maharshi in  
google and, suddenly, I found a lot of recent information about Him: new books  
coming out thanks to some people now living at the Ramanashram, several blogs,  
and this forum as well. I couldn´t believe it, I made this search many times  
before and I only could find the main website and some others, but nothing  
interactive, actual and alive. Nothing that could tell me that I´m not alone  
and that many other people is, right now, living and practicing His teachings.  
Don´t know why I have to go round and round always, but nevermind. Here are  
you all. Is it my impression or is it that Bhagavan´s teachings and He Himself  
are now emerging again with a special force? It is such the capacity of  
attraction He has   
Om Namo Ramana.

Dear sadhak,   
It is nice to read your post. There will be some breaks like   
this in many people's lives. The Self within is forgotten,   
[it is there always, no doubt], due to 'other' distractions.   
But for a sincere sadhak, there is always a reminder from   
Bhagavan Ramana within, to come back and arrive.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Thanks for your kind words.   
It is not enough to have a strong feeling of the Self, nevermind how joyful  
this feeling maybe, if one doesn´t inquire what or who is It nor look for His  
source. That was my ignorance and what Bhagavan taught me.
