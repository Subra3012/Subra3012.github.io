**BUDDHISTIC INDIA   
(Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, on February 2,  
1900**)   
With Buddhism first begins that peculiar phenomenon of religion boldly  
starting out to conquer the world.   
**But in India this gigantic child was absorbed, in the long run, by the  
mother that gave it birth, and today the very name of Buddha is almost unknown  
all over India.** You know more about Buddhism than ninety-nine per cent of  
the Indians. At best, they of India only know the name  "Oh, he was a great  
prophet, a great Incarnation of God"  and there it ends. The island of Ceylon  
remains to Buddha, and in some parts of the Himalayan country, there are some  
Buddhists yet. Beyond that there are none. But [Buddhism] has spread over all  
the rest of Asia.   
There was already in India a vast religion with an organised scripture  the  
Vedas; and these Vedas existed as a mass of literature and not a book  just  
as you find the Old Testament, the Bible. **Now, the Bible is a mass of  
literature of different ages; different persons are the writers, and so on. It  
is a collection. Now, the Vedas are a vast collection. I do not know whether,  
if the texts were all found  nobody has found all the texts, nobody even in  
India has seen all the books  if all the books were known, this room would  
contain them.**   
It is a huge mass of literature, carried down from generation to generation  
from God, who gave the scriptures. And the idea about the scriptures in India  
became tremendously orthodox. You complain of your orthodoxies in book-  
worship. If you get the Hindus' idea, where will you be? The Hindus think the  
Vedas are the direct knowledge of God, that God has created the whole universe  
in and through the Vedas, and that the whole universe exists because it is in  
the Vedas. The cow exists outside because the word "cow" is in the Vedas; man  
exists outside because of the word in the Vedas. **Here you see the beginning  
of that theory which later on Christians developed and expressed in the text: "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God " It is the old,  
ancient theory of India.  
Upon that is based the whole idea of the scriptures. And mind, every word is  
the power of God. The word is only the external manifestation on the material  
plane. So, all this manifestation is just the manifestation on the material  
plane; and the Word is the Vedas, and Sanskrit is the language of God. **God  
spoke once. He spoke in Sanskrit, and that is the divine language.**   
Now, the Vedas were not written by anybody; they were eternally coexistent  
with God. God is infinite. So is knowledge, and through this knowledge is  
created the world. Their idea of ethics is [that a thing is good] because the  
law says so. Everything is bounded by that book  nothing [can go] beyond  
that, because the knowledge of God  you cannot get beyond that. That is  
Indian orthodoxy.   
In the latter part of the Vedas, you see the highest, the spiritual. In the  
early portions, there is the crude part. You quote a passage from the Vedas   
"That is not good", you say. "Why?" "There is a positive evil injunction"   
the same as you see in the Old Testament. There are numbers of things in all  
old books, curious ideas, which we would not like in our present day. You say: "This doctrine is not at all good; why, it shocks my ethics!" How did you get  
your idea? [Merely] by your own thought? Get out! If it is ordained by God,  
what right have you to question? When the Vedas say, "Do not do this; this is  
immoral", and so on, no more have you the right to question at all. And that  
is the difficulty. If you tell a Hindu, "But our Bible does not say so", [he  
will reply] "Oh, your Bible! it is a babe of history.   
What other Bible could there be except the Vedas? What other book could there  
be? All knowledge is in God. Do you mean to say that He teaches by two or more  
Bibles? His knowledge came out in the Vedas. Do you mean to say that He  
committed a mistake, then? Afterwards, He wanted to do something better and  
taught another Bible to another nation? You cannot bring another book that is  
as old as Vedas. Everything else  it was all copied after that." They would  
not listen to you. And the Christian brings the Bible. They say: "That is  
fraud. God only speaks once, because He never makes mistakes."   
It is a hereditary trade [for] the Hindu. The Hindu said in olden times that  
life must be made easier and smoother. And what makes everything alive?  
Competition. Hereditary trade kills. You are a carpenter? Very good, your son  
can be only a carpenter. What are you? A blacksmith? Blacksmithing becomes a  
caste; your children will become blacksmiths. We do not allow anybody else to  
come into that trade, so you will be quiet and remain there. You are a  
military man, a fighter? Make a caste. You are a priest? Make a caste. The  
priesthood is hereditary. And so on. Rigid, high power! That has a great side,  
and that side is [that] it really rejects competition.   
**You see that non-killing of animals and charity towards animals was an  
already existing doctrine when Budda was born; but it was new with him  the  
breaking down of caste, that tremendous movement.** And the other thing that  
was new: he took forty of his disciples and sent them all over the world,  
saying, "Go ye; mix with all races and nations and preach the excellent gospel  
for the good of all, for the benefit of all." And, of course, he was not  
molested by the Hindus. He died at a ripe old age.   
All his life he was a most stern man: he never yielded to weakness. I do not  
believe many of his doctrines; of course, I do not. I believe that the  
Vedantism of the old Hindus is much more thoughtful, is a grander philosophy  
of life. I like his method of work, but what I like [most] in that man is  
that, among all the prophets of mankind, here was a man who never had any  
cobwebs in his brain, and [who was] sane and strong. When kingdoms were at his  
feet, he was still the same man, maintaining "I am a man amongst men."   
 **Those last dying words of his always thrilled through my heart. He was old,  
he was suffering, he was near his death, and then came the despised outcaste   
he lives on carrion, dead animals; the Hindus would not allow them to come  
into cities  one of these invited him to a dinner and he came with his  
disciples, and the poor Chanda, he wanted to treat this great teacher  
according to what he thought would be best; so he had a lot of pig 's flesh  
and a lot of rice for him, and Buddha looked at that. The disciples were all  
[hesitating], and the Master said: "Well, do not eat, you will be hurt." But  
he quietly sat down and ate. The teacher of equality must eat the [outcaste]  
Chanda's dinner, even the pig's flesh. He sat down and ate it.**   
He was already dying. He found death coming on, and he asked, "Spread for me  
something under this tree, for I think the end is near." And he was there  
under the tree, and he laid himself down; he could not sit up any more. And  
the first thing he did, he said: "Go to that Chanda and tell him that he has  
been one of my greatest benefactors; for his meal, I am going to Nirvâna." And  
then several men came to be instructed, and a disciple said, "Do not go near  
now, the Master is passing away".   
And as soon as he heard it, the Lord said, "Let them come in". And somebody  
else came and the disciples would not [let them enter]. Again they came, and  
then the dying Lord said: "And O, thou Ananda, I am passing away. Weep not for  
me. Think not for me. I am gone. Work out diligently your own salvation. Each  
one of you is just what I am. I am nothing but one of you. What I am today is  
what I made myself. Do you struggle and make yourselves what I am.. . . "   
These are the memorable words of Buddha: "Believe not because an old book is  
produced as an authority. Believe not because your father said [you should]  
believe the same. Believe not because other people like you believe it. Test  
everything, try everything, and then believe it, and if you find it for the  
good of many, give it to all." And with these words, the Master passed away.   
 **And, of course, with all this I can [not] understand his doctrine. You know  
he denied that there was any soul in man  that is, in the Hindu sense of the  
word. Now, we Hindus all believe that there is something permanent in man,  
which is unchangeable and which is living through all eternity. And that in  
man we call Atman, which is without beginning and without end. And [we  
believe] that there is something permanent in nature [and that we call  
Brahman, which is also without beginning and without end]. He denied both of  
these. He said there is no proof of anything permanent. It is all a mere mass  
of change; a mass of thought in a continuous change is what you call a mind.  
... The torch is leading the procession. The circle is a delusion. [Or take  
the example of a river.] It is a continuous river passing on; every moment a  
fresh mass of water passing on. So is this life; so is all body, so is all  
mind.   
Well, I do not understand his doctrine  we Hindus never understood it. But I  
can understand the motive behind that. Oh, the gigantic motive! The Master  
says that selfishness is the great curse of the world; that we are selfish and  
that therein is the curse.** There should be no motive for selfishness. You  
are [like a river] passing [on]  a continuous phenomenon. Have no God; have  
no soul; stand on your feet and do good for good's sake  neither for fear of  
punishment nor for [the sake of] going anywhere. Stand sane and motiveless.   
 **Thus Buddhism was and did become a great political power in India.  
Gradually it also fell to pieces  after all, this tremendous missionary  
enterprise. But to their credit it must be said, they never took up the sword  
to preach religion.** Excepting the Buddhistic religion, there is not one  
religion in the world which could make one step without bloodshed  not one  
which could get a hundred thousand converts just by brain power alone. No, no.  
All through. And this is just what you are going to do in the Philippines.  
That is your method. Make them religious by the sword. That is what your  
priests are preaching. Conquer and kill them that they may get religion. A  
wonderful way of preaching religion!   
When Buddhism went down that way, there came they inevitable reaction. There  
is but one entity in the wholes world. It is a unit world. The diversity is  
only eye-service. It is all one. The idea of unity and what we call monism   
without duality  is the idea in India. This doctrine has: been always in  
India; [it was] brought forward whenever materialism and scepticism broke down  
everything. When Buddhism broke down everything by introducing all sorts of  
foreign barbarians into India  their manners and customs and things  there  
was a reaction, and that reaction was led by a young monk [Shankarâchârya].  
And [instead] of preaching new doctrines and always thinking new thoughts and  
making sects, he brought back the Vedas to life: and modern Hinduism has thus  
an admixture of ancient Hinduism, over which the Vedantists predominate.   
The Vedantist has patience to wait for everybody. Wherever you are, this is  
the highest: "I and my Father are one." Realise it. If an image helps, images  
are welcome. If worshipping a great man helps you, worship him. If worshipping  
Mohammed helps you, go on. Only be sincere; and if you are sincere, says  
Vedantism, you are sure to be brought to the goal. None will be left. your  
heart, which contains all truth, will unfold itself chapter after chapter,  
till you know the last truth, that "I and my Father are one". And what is  
salvation? To live with God. Where? Anywhere. Here this moment. One moment in  
infinite time is quite as good as any other moment. This is the old doctrine  
of the Vedas, you see. This was revived. **Buddhism died out of India. It left  
its mark on their charity, its animals, etc. in India; and Vedantism is  
reconquering India from one end to the other.**

Buddhism is the rebel brother of Hinduism. It has not died. It is   
still there for which there are followers, but in small numbers. Buddhism is  
more prevalent in East Asia, because, there, the real   
caste-less society [by birth] concept was readily accepted. But   
the Chinese and Japanese left out the other important teaching   
of Buddhism, viz., non injury to other living beings. Jainism took   
this along with caste less society concept and so there are more   
Jains today, than Buddhists in India. Jainism today is not in rebellion with  
Hinduism. They worship Saraswati and some other gods also,   
like Hindus.   
Arunachala Siva.

Question : "Sir, is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of  
the Impersonal God?"   
Sri Ramakrishna : "Yes, there is. But the path is extremely difficult. After  
intense austerities the rishis of olden times realized God as their innermost  
consciousness and experienced the real nature of Brahman. But how hard they  
had to work! They went out of their dwellings in the early morning and all day  
practised austerities and meditation. Returning home at nightfall, they took a  
light supper of fruit and roots.   
 **" But an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if  
his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree. The mind  
must withdraw totally from all objects of form, taste, smell, touch, and  
sound. Only thus does it become pure. The Pure Mind is the same as the Pure  
Atman. But such a mind must be altogether free from 'woman and gold'. When it  
becomes pure, one has another experience. One realizes: 'God alone is the  
Doer, and I am His instrument.' One does not feel oneself to be absolutely  
necessary to others either in their misery or in their happiness.**   
"Once a wicked man beat into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a monastery.  
On regaining consciousness he was asked by his friends, 'Who is feeding you  
milk?' The monk said, 'He who beat me is now feeding me.'"   
M : "Yes, sir. I know that story."   
Sri Ramakrishna : "It is not enough to know it. One must assimilate its  
meaning. **It is the thought of worldly objects that prevents the mind from  
going into samadhi. One becomes established in samadhi when one is completely  
rid of worldliness.** It is possible for me to give up the body in samadhi;  
but I have a slight desire to enjoy the love of God and the company of His  
devotees. Therefore I pay a little attention to my body.   
"There is another kind of samadhi, called unmana samadhi. One attains it by  
suddenly gathering the dispersed mind. You understand what that is, don't  
you?"

the highest: "I and my Father are one." Realise it. If an image helps, images  
are welcome. If worshipping a great man helps you, worship him. If worshipping  
Mohammed helps you, go on. Only be sincere; and if you are sincere, says  
Vedantism, you are sure to be brought to the goal. None will be left. your  
heart, which contains all truth, will unfold itself chapter after chapter,  
till you know the last truth, that "I and my Father are one". And what is  
salvation? To live with God. Where? Anywhere. Here this moment. One moment in  
infinite time is quite as good as any other moment. This is the old doctrine  
of the Vedas, you see. This was revived. **Buddhism died out of India. It left  
its mark on their charity, its animals, etc. in India; and Vedantism is  
reconquering India from one end to the other.**

Buddhism is the rebel brother of Hinduism. It has not died. It is   
still there for which there are followers, but in small numbers. Buddhism is  
more prevalent in East Asia, because, there, the real   
caste-less society [by birth] concept was readily accepted. But   
the Chinese and Japanese left out the other important teaching   
of Buddhism, viz., non injury to other living beings. Jainism took   
this along with caste less society concept and so there are more   
Jains today, than Buddhists in India. Jainism today is not in rebellion with  
Hinduism. They worship Saraswati and some other gods also,   
like Hindus.   
Arunachala Siva.
