There are lots of spiritual gurus in our India. Some may have real taste in  
spiritualism but if they want to be a guru for at least they should aware of  
Bhagavan Ramana. Even though He is a jewel of advaita He never told himself a  
guru or He never accepted any body as a devotee. Why these modern gurus never  
learn from Bhagavan Ramana.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are no parallels in recent times for Bhagavan Ramana. He   
never asked anything from anyone. He never takes also anything   
from anyone, unless such offerings could be shared with other devotees  
present. He took persons as they are, no preconditions,   
no pre qualifications. He was available 24 hours of the day. There   
were some devotees, who came late night, and when attendants   
refused permission, He came out and asked the attendants to let   
them in. He never did any materializations, making vibhuti, kumkum   
or gold pendants. When devotees were sincere, He conferred them   
the glimpse of the Self to take further interest and proceed in their   
sadhana. And last but not the least, He never discriminated   
between brahmins and non brahmins. He is very unique and can   
never be compared with anyone in recent times.   
There is a line of poem: As civilization advances, the poetry   
declines. That is in modern days, one cannot get a Kalidasa   
or Shakespeare or Milton or Kamban. The poetry has declined   
And so is the case of 'standards' of gurus. Tirumoolar says that   
one who has not realized the Siva himself, if he wants to direct   
others for liberation, it will be like a blind leading the blind to   
go on a particular path. Both will fall into the pit!   
Arunachala Siva.
