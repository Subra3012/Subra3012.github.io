Dear I,   
We have heard a lot about the Pancha Bhutas: Space, Water, Air, Earth, Fire.  
Today, I had been to Shirdi Baba temple and when I went near to the Dhuni -  
the fire, I was lost in contemplation, and then it flashed to me the essense  
of the Pancha Bhutas.   
The very essence of these 5 Elements is the significance of God, Brahman,  
Aatma, Chaitanya, we just cannot measure it. But what the Mind/Ego/I/Thought  
does is that it keeps tying to measure these 5 elements, tries to understand  
it, tries to define the Aatma, Brahman, which is Pancha Bhuta Tatva. That is  
why the Vedas say, it is none of the Pancha Bhutas as well, because we try to  
fill the Pancha Bhutas.   
Space - Whatever we try and fill the space, it will still remain unfilled. The  
Space can never be filled, no matter how much ever one tries to. Whatever we  
try to understand about the Space always remains Space, it cannot be filled.  
But the ego/mind/I/thought always keeps trying to occupy the space, but it  
will not succeed. The Tatva is that the Space consumes all -  
Ego/Mind/Thought/I, all Concepts, thoughts, knowledge, ignorance, everything.   
Water - Whatever we try to consume the water, the water dissolves it all,  
Water known as a universal solvent, just dissolves everything one tries to  
define it. The Tatva is that Water dissolves everything - Ego/Mind/Thought/I,  
all Concepts, thoughts, knowledge, ignorance, everything.   
Air - Whatever we try to define the Aatman, Brahman, Chaitanya, i.e. to define  
it. we try to forcibly push the Air in one direction. Will the air ever listen  
to you which is Ego/Mind/I/Thought? who just wants to define it based on its  
own knowledge, thoughts, idea, concepts. It just wont listen. The Tatva is  
that the Air just takes all - Ego/Mind/Thought/I, all Concepts, thoughts,  
knowledge, ignorance, everything in its own direction, and not the other way.   
Earth - The Tatva is very simple, the earth is the eternal Aatman, Brahman,  
Chaitanya - No matter how much the Mind/Ego/Thought/I tries to live  
permanently, it will eventually be consumed by the Earth. i.e. everybody-  
Mind/Ego/I/Thought will become ashes, become one with the Earth.   
Fire - Fire consumes you - Mind/Ego/I/Thought. Can anything, any concept,  
understanding, knowledge stand near the fire? It will destroy you -  
Mind/Ego/I/Thought.   
Like this, whatever we try to know and profess to know as the reality will  
always be nothing near the Aatman, Brahman, Chaitanya. The essence of these  
Pancha Bhuta Tatvas is this that you, which is just Mind/Thought/I/Ego can  
never ever understand the Brahman.   
And this is exactly what the third eye of Shiva signifies, when the third eye  
opens, it just burns everything into Bhasma - all thoughts, knowledge,  
understanding, everything. It strips you absolutely naked, without anything to  
cling on. That hopelessness, Hopeless state, totally giving up. This is true  
Bhakti. This is Sharanagati.   
The Pancha Bhutas signify this. Every temple, the deity in the sanctum  
sactoriam is just aa "Prathi Bimba" or Mirror image of your true Self. But  
what we see is only an image of our own little self in the mirror, an image of  
body, shirt, pants, body, eye, limbs, etc...   
This is the real concept of Temples, the God in the temples is just our own  
real real reflection, this is the real mirror and not the ordinary mirror that  
only gives the reflection of Ego/Mind/Thought/I. The real mirror gives us the  
reflection of Godhood, Brahman, Aatman, Chaitanya, which we pray, Blindly. We  
should reflect more about this. The Pancha Bhutas are an excellent  
illustrations that gives us the Real Mirror-Image of our real Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. When we go to these temples, the ones which represent the   
five elements, we feel very small in their presence. Though I have   
visited all including Kalahasti which I did only once, so far, the temples  
have got their special vibrations. I think, as per Agama   
sastras, these have been built with full understanding of such   
agama sastras. Chidambaram, the Space and Tiruvannamalai, the   
Fire or Light or Agni - attract me most. Whenever I stand near   
Annamalai and Unnamulai, I am not able to do anything, even to   
pray, but keep on weeping before my Cute Little Father and Cute   
Little Mother. In Chidambaram, the metal image, I am told it is   
pure gold, Pon-ambalam, simply stops my mind. I get a feeling that Vyakrapada  
and Patanjali would never get tired of that image. They have been watching  
this Cosmic Dance, for eons.   
One Tamil poet has written humouresly: Vyakrapada, the Tiger is watching Nataraja to ensure that the   
deer on His hand does not eat away the grass (arugam pul) on   
His matted locks.   
Patanjali, the Serpent is watching that the other serpents on   
Siva's locks do not consume the baby-moon!   
Sivakamavalli is angry because she is constantly disturbed by   
the pleasant-sounding anklets on Siva's feet. which sounds ding...   
ding...ding... ding...., which affects her inner tranquility.   
Manikkavachagar who stands to Siva's right (Nayaki-mistress!)   
is worried that Siva's legs would become tired due to such an   
un-ending dance.   
Nataraja seems to say: I do not care for anything. I am dancing   
because my Amma, Karaikal Amma is watching it joyfully.   
Arunachala Siva.
