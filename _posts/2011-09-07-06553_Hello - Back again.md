Dear I,   
Hello to you all once again. I am back after a long hibernation to the forum.  
There was a need from within to be by myself, hence I had taken a break! I  
felt like Bhagavan's call from within that I should be back here now to be  
able to spend some valuable time in the thought of Bhagavan and his teachings.   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Again, is this also destiny. The thought which arised to be with this forum  
once again, or is this Bhagavan's call.

Dear Ramanduli,   
Sri Bhagavan's call merged with destiny. Sri Bhagavan says   
in Arunachala Akshara Manamaalai: Chai enath thaLLil sei vinai   
sudhum adhaal, uyvahai ethu urai arunachala. It if is mere destiny,   
which happens without intervention of Sri Bhagavan or Arunachala,   
then it will scorch us [sudum]. But this rejoining of Nagaraj to the Forum is   
helping him and helping us. So it is Arunachala's / Sri Bhagavan's   
grace only coupled with conventionally called "chai vinai" \- destiny.   
It will help all of us to progress, uyvahai.   
Arunachala Siva,**
