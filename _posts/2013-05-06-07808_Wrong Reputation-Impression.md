## Re:[2]Alligator blood may hold the key to cure a lot of diseases

**" Scientists have often been puzzled as to why alligators never seem to get  
infections. They often get into violent fights over territories and mates, and  
they get wounds that should be easy targets for infection. Their blood might  
be the key.   
Chemists have isolated blood from the American alligator and have successfully  
destroyed 23 strains of bacteria, including ones known to be resistant to  
antibiotics. In fact, the blood has proven strong enough to destroy a  
significant amount of HIV. They're now working in isolating the active  
compounds that help the alligator and put it into medicine for human use. This  
is a really exciting development, especially with news of new antibiotic  
resistant strains of certain diseases like gonorrhea that are starting to  
spread."**

## Re:[3]Bats represent 20% of all mammals!

**" Bats get a bad reputation. Due to their nocturnal nature and their  
association with vampires, some people may be afraid of them. And since they  
can fly, thye may be mistaken for birds. Bats are actually fairly harmless  
mammals though. They actually make up 20% of all mammal species worldwide.  
There are about 1,240 species.   
These are divided into two suborders: The largely fruit-eating megabats and  
the echolocating microbats. As noted before, bats are fairly harmless. Seventy  
percent of them are insectivores Most of the rest are fruit-eaters, and a few  
feed on animals, such as the fish-eating bat. And vampire bats do in fact  
drink the blood of animals.   
These 1,240 species are scattered throughout the world. They perform vital  
ecological functions such as pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds. They  
are also important in eating insects and reducing the need of pesticides. So  
all in all, bats are helpful creatures."**

## Re:[7]Elvis Presley and Sri Paramahansa Yogananda  
Author: Hari                Date: May 06, 2013, 05:10:46 PM

**" Elvis favorite spot on earth was a spiritual oasis on Sunset Boulevard in  
notoriously shallow L.A. Founded over 50 years ago by the late Hindu holy man,  
Paramahansa Yogananda, all the worlds religions are enshrined in its natural  
setting. The Lake Shrine of the Self-Realization Fellowship is a magical,  
secret garden. A rainbow of humanity visits this outdoor cathedral to become  
one with Nature, one with each other, and one with God.   
Elvis, a true seeker, was a devoted student of Yoganandas teachings. Elvis  
often walked around the mirrored lake at the Shrine to the World Peace  
Memorial. He reverently kneeled at the stone sarcophagus containing a portion  
of the ashes of the martyred Gandhi. The founder of this New Age retreat was  
also Gandhis yoga teacher.   
Elvis asked his friend who headed the Self-Realization Fellowship: Why did  
God make me Elvis Presley? She responded by giving him some ancient  
manuscripts, hinting that the answer to his question might be in them. The  
King of Rock n Roll, like the great Mahatma, shook his soul awake through  
Kriya Yoga, a millenniums-old sacred spiritual science that emphasizes the  
underlying unity of all the worlds great religions.   
There must be world brotherhood if we are to be able to practice the true art  
of living, the yogi wrote in his autobiography, one of Elvis favorite books.   
Elvis loved everything New Age. Metaphysics. Numerology. Cosmology.   
He was a great fan of the Russian born occultist, Madame Blavatsky, known as  
The Mother of New Age. Gandhi and Einstein were fans, as well.   
Gandhi left his well-heeled secular lawyers life because of Blavatskys The  
Key to Theosophy. Gandhi credited the Jewish born sage with disabusing me of  
the notion that Hinduism was rife with superstition. She showed me Hinduism at  
its best. He kept her book nearby until his death by an assassins bullet.   
Einstein fell in love with Blavatskys mind after reading The Secret  
Doctrine published in 1888. In this book, the Madame foresaw Einsteins 1905  
theory of relativity. She wrote of the infinite divisibility of the atom. She  
affirmed that the infinite vibratory motion of everything is a natural law of  
the universe. She also wrote that the moon was older than the earth. There  
were gaffaws heard round the world on that one! Scientists were amazed when  
the astronauts who landed on the moon brought back rocks that were older than  
those on earth. Einstein kept a copy of The Secret Doctrine on his desk  
until the day he died.   
Elvis named his gospel group Voice after being mesmerized by Blavatskys  
book The Voice of Silence, which contains the translation of ancient, secret  
Tibetan incantations.   
The work of the long dead Jewish lady from Russia excited the Southern  
choirboy from the First Assembly of God Church so deeply that he sometimes  
read passages from it on stage. The audiences reaction has never been  
disclosed. After Elvis heart stopped, The Voice of Silence remained opened  
on his nightstand.   
Until the end of his days, Elvis had a strong belief in God. Elvis loved  
Jesus, yet was never baptized and never joined a church. He had a passion for  
gospel music and performed and recorded many gospel songs.   
While filming Harum Scarum in Hollywood in the mid 60s, a disenchanted Elvis  
sought solace at the Lake Shrine retreat. Yogananda said that, This shrine  
has been created for all religions, that all may feel the unity of common  
faith. Elvis meditated daily for many years and followed the ecumenical  
approach to enlightenment.   
Elvis spiritual beliefs were woven like an intricate, highly personal  
tapestry, culled from his voracious appetite to learn everything about  
Hinduism, Judaism, theosophy, positive thinking and Christianity. His reading  
on Judaism, inspired by his mothers Jewish great grandmother, led to Elvis  
adding a Star of David to his mothers headstone. He also wore a chai, the  
Jewish symbol for life, the last year of his life, along with a cross.   
Elvis lamented: I know some of the things I think are kind of far out and I  
dont meet a lot of people that I can relate to, and those that I do meet need  
to know more about their spiritual selves.   
The legendary Elvis knew that the Cosmic Golden Web we all tread on is far  
more intricate and powerful than anything we can imagine. Through the gossamer  
strands of light on this web, everything, everybody and every place since the  
beginning of time are interconnected.   
The world is a playground of God and a reflection of His glory, exulted  
Gandhi.   
If only Elvis could have frolicked in that playground unfettered by the fame  
and fortune that imprisoned him "**

Vinodji   
It is unfortunate that a few who are misguided in their spiritual practices  
bring dishonor to a whole pure tradition.   
The answer to such people is to talk of the great Nayanmars, Adi Shankara,  
many Siddhars, and even our Bhagawan. In every religion, sect, cult, there are  
the ones who worship/follow right practices and the ones who follow erroneous  
practices.   
In any case, Swami Paramarthananda says that even such distasteful practices  
like animal sacrifice, madhu pana was allowed within the Hindu fold for some  
people who were not able to follow more sattvic practices due to their innate  
tendencies. For e.g., a person accustomed to alcohol/smoke was allowed to use  
them, but as an offering to God. However, this initial practice was expected  
to lead to more sattvic practices. The religious setup had to accommodate such  
people also without setting a very high goal for them and driving them away.   
Om Namah Shivaya!
