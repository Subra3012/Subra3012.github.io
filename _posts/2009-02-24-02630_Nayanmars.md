## Nayanmars

There is no par to the devotion to the devotion shown by Nayanmars. Bhagawan  
Ramana used to have tears instantly when he used to read the glorious stories  
of the Nayanmars.   
 **PERUMIZHALAI KURUMBA NAYANAR**   
Guru is God. The same Lord Who is never separate from us, Who is our sustainer  
and   
support appears to us as the visible form of the Guru. He who adores the Guru  
with faith and   
devotion will attain all Siddhis (psychic powers) and eternal bliss.  
Perumizhalai Kurumba Nayanar   
excelled in Guru Bhakti. He was an ardent devotee of Lord Siva and Siva  
Bhaktas, too. He heard of   
Sundaramurthi Nayanars greatness and mentally accepted him as his Guru. To  
him, Sundarar was   
the sole refuge. He adored the Guru in thought, word and deed. By the Gurus  
grace, he attained all   
the Siddhis. He was immersed in Siva Bhakti and Guru Bhakti.   
In the meantime, Sundarar came to Tiruvanchaikalam from where he was taken to  
the   
Lords Abode. Kurumba Nayanar, through his Yogic powers, came to know that  
this would happen.   
He did not like to remain in this world after the Guru: and, therefore,  
through the method of Siva   
Yoga, Nayanar cast off his mortal coil and reached the Abode of Siva, a day  
before Sundarars   
departure.   
Salutations to the 63 Nayanmars

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
The stories of all the 63 Siva Saints are heart-melting. They belonged   
to different classes of social order at that time. A few were brahmins, a few  
were kings, a few were traders, and the rest   
were other classes. What bound them together was their love and   
devotion to Siva. Saint Manikkavachagar particularly refers to Kannappar, the  
hunter and Chandikeswara, the brahmin boy. Kannappar got liberation in six  
days. Bhagavan Ramana has wept while narrating the story of Kannappar.  
Chandikeswara, is the one   
who cut his father's legs because the father kicked the milk pot and the Siva  
linga. Siva came to Chandikeswara and says: "We are proud of your devotion.  
You come to our abode, and be the guard for my temple. The food that is  
submitted to me, the flowers that are adorned on me and the dress I am given  
to wear, will be shared with you! Chandikeswara was born on Seynjalur on the  
banks of Kaveri river. This place is famous on many counts. I shall write  
separately about this place.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
One cannot avoid but reading the stories of Nayanmars really touch the heart.  
No matter how many hardships one faces whole day if one reads these stories,  
they pacify the heart and calm down entire system. Breathing becomes very  
normal, a divine feeling arouses, the room vibrates with divine presence, you  
can feel the air touching your skin and communicating with you. We can  
hear/feel silence within us, all objects appear to be the residing place of  
Parameshwara.   
 **IDANGAZHI NAYANAR**   
This saint was the king of Velas in Kodumbalur. He was a staunch devotee of  
Lord Siva. He   
had made arrangements with all the Siva temples to perform worship according  
to the Siva Agamas.   
There was another Siva Bhakta in the same locality doing Maaheshwara Puja. He  
became very poor   
and so he could not continue his Puja and feeding of Bhaktas. So, one day he  
entered Idangazhi   
Nayanars granary at night and began to steal paddy. The watchman caught him  
red-handed and   
took him to the king. The king learnt on enquiry that the Siva Bhaktas motive  
for stealing was to   
feed the devotees of the Lord. The king let him go.   
This incident opened the eyes of the king. He realised that nothing belonged  
to him and that   
the real owners of his property were Lord Siva and His Bhaktas. So, he gave  
permission to all Siva   
Bhaktas to enter his palace and granary and take whatever they wanted. Thus he  
displayed his zeal   
for the spread of Saivism. Thus he earned Lord Sivas grace, too.   
Prostrations to the 63 Nayanmars and our Beloved Bhagawan.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
I read your story of Idangazhi Nayanar. With intense devotion and   
total surrender to Siva, any crime is pardonable. This is one of the   
underlying themes of Periya Puranam. Someone asked a discourser: How come, Chandikeswara's crime and sin of cutting his father's   
legs, get pardoned. The discourser then said what I mentioned above.  
Parasurama killed his mother, for the sake of his father.   
Narasimha killed Prahlada's father for the sake of Prahlada's devotion. Some  
of the Nayanmars have done such heroic deeds, though they may appear as  
crimes, for the sake of intense devotion to Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Today, It is Gods will that the story of Chadikeshwarar is posted. you have  
been writing about this great Nayanmar and also today in Shankara TV, a  
discourser gave a discourse on Chandikeshwarar. I began to read this great  
story, its very powerful - Ughram - devotion to Shiva.   
 **CHANDESVARA NAYANAR**   
Vichara Sarman (who was later known as Chandesvara Nayanar) was born in   
Tiruchaijnanallur, which was famous for Vedic recitations, Tapas, and Siva  
Bhakti. He was a   
prodigy. At the age of five he had learnt the Vedas, and all the Agamas, by  
himself, on account of   
previous Samskaras. After his Upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony), he learnt  
the Vedas, under a   
Guru: but the Gurus were wonder-struck at the intelligence of the disciple. He  
wanted to attain Final   
Emancipation in that birth.   
One day Vichara Sarman, with his friends, was walking along a road. He noticed  
a cowherd   
severely beating a cow because it had slightly pushed him with its horn.  
Vichara Sarman could not   
endure this. He was greatly moved and spoke to the cowherd: Oh ignorant man?  
Do you not know   
that the cow is worshipful and divine. All the Devas dwell in her. She is  
indispensable for all   
religious activities. It is our sacred duty to tend and protect the cows.  
Whoever harms the cow is   
hurled into the Naraka. Whoever worships the cow wins a place in heaven or in  
Sivas Abode. You   
have committed a great sin today. Hereafter, you need not tend to the cows: I  
will do that myself.   
Vichara Sarman took the work upon himself from that day.   
The cows grew healthier. They liked Vichara Sarman very much. The Brahmins who  
got   
more milk thereafter were able to fulfil their religious duties very well, and  
they were pleased with   
Vichara Sarman. There was so much of surplus milk now, that Vichara Sarman,  
who loved Lord   
Siva and His worship, decided to perform Abhishekam for Lord Siva. He used to  
sit under an Atti   
tree on the bank of the river, construct a temple from the mud, and also make  
a mud-image of Siva   
Lingam and offer the milk, to bathe the Lingam. Then he would perform Archana  
with the Atti   
flowers. The cows were giving plenty of milk both to Vichara Sarman and to the  
Brahmins.   
One day, when Vichara Sarman was doing this Puja, a villager happened to pass  
by, and he   
watched all this. He reported the matter to the owners of the cows, and  
complained that Vichara   
Sarman was pouring precious milk on mud and river sand. These Brahmins  
summoned Vichara   
Sarmans father, Echhadattan, and passed the complaint on to him in rather  
strong terms. The father   
was naturally shocked. He came home, but did not speak to Vichara Sarman. He  
wanted to find out   
for himself. So, the next day, he followed Vichara Sarman at a distance  
without his knowledge.   
When Vichara Sarman began pouring milk on the improvised Siva Lingam, the  
father, without   
understanding the sons wonderful devotion, hit him with a stick. The boy was  
so much absorbed in   
his Puja that he did not even feel pain. Then, the father, getting still more  
angry, knocked the   
milk-pot down. It was then that Vichara Sarman realised that his father was  
interfering with his   
worship and had committed an unpardonable offence against Lord Siva (Siva  
Aparadham). He at   
once took a stick and hit his fathers leg: by the will of the Lord, the stick  
was transformed into an   
axe. Again, by His will, it killed the father. It was to test the depth of  
Vichara Sarmans devotion. He   
was so engrossed in the worship, that he did not mind what had happened and  
continued the   
worship.   
Lord Siva was immensely pleased with the intensity of Vichara Sarmans  
devotion and   
appeared before him, with Parvathi. Vichara Sarman prostrated before the Lord.  
The Lord   
embraced Vichara Sarman and fondled him. That very instant, Vichara Sarman  
attained the divine   
Form of Lord Siva. The Lord removed a garland from His own neck and put it  
around Vichara   
Sarmans. He had attained Saroopya Mukthi (liberation, with the attainment of  
the form of the   
Lord). The Lord said: My child, you cut your own fathers leg for My sake.  
Now, I am Your Father.   
You will soon attain Chandikesvarars Abode. You worshipped Me with food,  
clothes and flower   
garlands. In the same manner, you will also be worshipped. The Lord  
disappeared. Vichara   
Sarman also went to the Abode of Chandesvarar. No sin attached to him, for  
having killed his own   
father, because of his supreme devotion to the Lord. His father, too, because  
he was killed by such a   
great devotee of the Lord, was purged of the sin of interfering with His  
worship, and reached the   
Abode of Lord Siva.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Chandikeswara was made as a guardian angel of Siva's temple.   
This is a post. Chandeswara Nayanar will be in that post till   
the end of Kali Yuga. His shrine will be near the Tirmanjanam   
outlet, (from where the abulations of water, panchamirtam,   
coconut water, milk, turmeric water, honey etc., pour out.)   
The devotees visiting the temple are expected to take this water,   
a little bit from the outlet and then take leave of Chandikeswara.   
We have to tell him to mark our presence, by tapping with three   
middle fingers of the right hand on the left palm. The tapping   
should be done, in a low noise. People clap heavily as if Chandikeswara is  
deaf. It should not be done. The practice   
of pulling out two thread from our clothes and giving them to him,   
is again a practice which is not there in scriptures. We should only tell him  
that we are not taking anything from the Siva temple, excepting prasadams like  
vibhuti, kumkum, cut coconut, fruits, flowers etc., given by the priests.   
Chandikeswaras are there for Ganapati and Muruga too. For Uma,   
she has got female guardian angels like Tara and Matangi and   
Kurukulla Devi.   
In Arunachala temple, there is a Periya Puranam verse, on a small   
board, which states: O Son, I have given you a post, in which you   
are eligible for my food, flowers and clothes....   
Arunachala Siva.
