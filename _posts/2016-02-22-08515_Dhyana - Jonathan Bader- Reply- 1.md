It is only in the Bhagavad Gita and the Svetasvatara Upanishad that dhyana  
begins to develop its   
characteristic connotation. It is also recognized as an essential component  
of a yoga practice which   
will be more fully elaborated in the Yoga Sutra (YS). When commenting on  
yoga, Sankara generally   
cites the authority of these three works, but relies especially on the Yoga  
Sutra. This is what we would,   
of course, expect if the vivarana on Vyasa's Yogasutra Bhashya (YSBh) was  
indeed composed by Sankara.   
Many of his remarks on yoga and meditation reflect the influence of Vyasa.   
Sankara illustrates the specific usage of the term dhyana, in a manner  
remiiscent of the Yoga Sutra: 'The word 'meditative' refers to those whose minds are concentrated upon a  
single object, whose gaze\   
is fixed, and whose limbs scarcely move.' (Brahmasutra bhashya, 4.1.   
The Yogasutra describes the practice of meditation as beginning with a firm  
and steady posture (asana).   
The steadiness is reinforced by control of breath (pranayama). Each moment of  
the breath,   
comprising an inhalation, exhalation and cessation, is regulated and  
protracted. As the breath becomes   
over more subtle, external movement is brought to a virtual halt.
