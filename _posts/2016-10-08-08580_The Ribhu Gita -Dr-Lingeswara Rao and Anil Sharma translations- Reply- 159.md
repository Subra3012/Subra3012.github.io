36. I alone am my reality, verily. Besides me there is nothing at all. The state of 'that' is not apart from me.   
The state of 'Thou' is not apart from me.   
37. There is never anything as merit. 'Sin', there is none of it. Nor there are differences such as 'this thing',   
differences as 'this person' or differences of real and unreal.   
38. There is nothing that is yours, truly, truly, truly - again and again. Everything is naught, ever -   
nothing, nothing at all.   
39. This alone is supreme Brahman. I alone am Brahman which is you alone. Time is Brahman. A fraction   
is Brahman. Action is Brahman and so is a moment.   
40. All is Brahman indeed. I am Brahman. There is no doubt that I am Brahman. Thought is Brahman.   
Mind is Brahman. Truth is Brahman - that I ever am.   
41. Attribute-less Brahman, eternal, pause-less, and the supreme am I. I am only Brahman from   
beginning to end. There is not a whit of beginning or end.   
42. There is not even a statement such as 'I am', remembrance or utterance. All is Brahman alone--   
there is no doubt of this. There is not a trace of 'you' ever.   
43\. There is none who can expound this -- there is no doubt. This  
explanation is so hard to find. This is   
capable of bestowing instant liberation. It confers immediate liberation.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
