I AM!!!! going to Arunachala ashram sometime near the end of this year -  
Nov/Dec? Require info. My heart yearns. I would like to get together with  
Perth devotees 'in the know' about Ramana & his teachings. Thank you all.

Dear aio, the details regarding Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai,   
have been extensively posted by me and others in response to   
similar questions by others. Please see the points given by   
various Forum members under 'Arunachala Ramana - Ashram'.   
Arunachala Siva.
