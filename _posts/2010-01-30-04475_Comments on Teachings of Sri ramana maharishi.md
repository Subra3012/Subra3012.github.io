I came across in internet, an interesting video interview titled Blue Prints  
For Awakening wherein 15 Indian Masters give their comments to 12 questions  
put by Sri.Premananda on teachings of Sri Ramana Maharishi.The answers given  
by these great masters are quite interesting.The web site is as under:  **http://conscious-websites.com/blueprints/low/index_en.html**

Not trying to offend anybody or deny all claimants, but it is amazing to see  
so many 'awakened', 'realized' or 'liberated' people at a single web site!  
Most parroting the same 'i am not the body' line of Bhagawan. Reminded me of  
the mushrooms that sprout overnight after a burst of rain.
