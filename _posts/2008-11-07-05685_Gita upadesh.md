Krishna and Arjuna both were relatives and quite often they met each other.  
Still why did not Krishna give   
Gita lesson to Arjuna. He waited for Kurshetra war to reveal Gita.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Why Krishna chose Arjuna,   
Arjuna represents an admixture of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas,   
all the three gunas, while Dharmaputra represents pure Sattva,   
(hence no need for any advice), and Bhima represents pure   
Tamas (hence no use telling anything). So Krishna chose Arjuna.   
Why Krishna chose Khurukshetra War front?   
The war front represents the place, where Arjuna had the   
delusion and doubts, Arjuna Vishadham. Only a seeker who is   
deluded about the life and is having doubts about the purpose of   
a human life, is fit for self enquiry or self surrender. When one   
keep "enjoying" life and has no doubts about his happiness from   
such a life, cannot be given self knowledge. "Let his play be over,   
and then he can come, " said Bhagavan Ramana to some one.   
And so the reason for Krishna choosing the war front.   
Why did Krishna choose, amongst various others?   
Arjuna only felt his helplessness, not Bhishma nor Dharmaputra,   
nor anyone in the opposite camp, like Duryodhana and Karna,   
because all these people 'trusted' their own abilities and had no   
helplessness! Only to a seeker who is helpless, will be helped   
by a Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Lord Krishna told Arjuna that he is impressed by his nonjealousy(Anasuya) character, so he is telling Atma Vidya to him.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for your wonderful explaination. I came to know many points why Arjuna  
was told gita. It was told in the field of war.How he could be able to  
understand. After hearing, he fought and won the war. But did he become jnani  
or liberated. Because in the end, I read only Dharma raja went to heaven where  
he was asked 7 questions.   
2ndly, along with Arjuna, Sanjay got the opportunity to listen full gita and  
Dhrithrashtra also listen but he was not realised due to his tamo guna. What  
about Sanjay.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Sanjay was given only a binocular to watch the war front and   
report the position to a blind king. He was like a cricket commentator   
in TV or radio. The cricket commentator does not scrore century.   
Only the batsman playing on the crease, scores the century!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Significant points are: a) Krishna did not teach until Arjuna asked for the teaching.   
b) Krishna taught. .. did not transmit. Did not say, u sit in silence and  
"Catch it". Did not say "ill touch you and u will get it". .. he explained  
each point like a teacher. Now Arjuna was a very intelligent disciple. .. Far  
more advanced than our ordinary Sadhus and Swamis. Not only that he was in the  
company of Krishna since childhood. yet, he had to be taught. This is such a  
significant point.   
c) Even we have heard it. .. did we get liberated ? Same with Sanjay and  
Dritrastra. Those who "Get" the true import are liberated. Those who dont,  
will keep going round the bush.   
d) I think, Arjuna was liberated. I am not sure of the descriptions in  
Mahabaratha[i did not read it] but i do not think a Jnani would go to heaven.  
Someone asked Ramana when he was leaving his mortal body: Where would you  
go...and he replied, that there was really no where to go. A Jnani IS. .. he  
just cannot go anywhere even if he wants to... coz there is no place where he  
is not present.   
Love!   
Silence

Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami garu says Jnana will not come even though a jnani  
like Adi sankara comes and teaches us unless **we are a sincere in our  
sadhana**   
Hence even though Bhagavad gita was told to Dhutarastra by Sanjaya but  
Dhutarastra failed to get the essence.

Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says:-   
In Srimad Bhagavatam it is said that Arjuna forgot the essence of   
Srimad Bhagavad Gita after the war. One evening much later, he   
asked Krishna to say it again!

Quite natural. Who could remember such a subtle matter was told at the time of  
battle. It is a surprise why Krishna waited to give this upadesa to Arjun for  
long time.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Not only that. The Upadesa had gone to Arjuna's Heart. The mind   
might not remember it. But it is in the Heart, and shall come out   
for help at the time of need.   
Arunachala Siva.
