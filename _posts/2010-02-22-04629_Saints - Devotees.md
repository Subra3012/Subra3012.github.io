**Anandamayi Ma** (30 April, 1896 - 27 August, 1982)   
 **Anandamayi Ma** was born **Nirmala Sundari** on **30 April, 1896** to  
Bipinbihari Bhattacharya and Mokshada Sundari Devi in **Kheora, Brahmanbaria  
District**, British India, in what is now **Bangladesh**. Her father,  
originally from Vidyakut in Tripura, was a Vaishnavite singer known for his  
devotion. His daughter had frequent experiences of the divine in childhood and  
often went into a state of ecstasy on hearing kirtan (devotional chanting).  
She attended the village school for barely two years.   
In 1908, at the age of thirteen (in keeping with the custom at the time), she  
was married to Ramani Mohan Chakrabarti of Vikramapura, who she called  
Bholanath and Pitaji. She spent 5 years after her marriage at her brother-in-  
law's home, where she was in a withdrawn meditative state much of the time. It  
was here that a devout neighbour, Harakumar, developed a habit of addressing  
her as "Ma", and prostrated before her morning and evening. In 1918, she moved  
to **Bajitpur**, where she stayed until 1924, during which time Nirmala went  
deeper into her spiritual states. When Nirmala was about 17, she went to live  
with her husband in **Ashtagram**. It was a celibate marriage - whenever  
thoughts of sexuality occurred to Bholanath, Anandamoyi's body would take on  
the qualities of death and she would grow faint. On his return from the office  
at the end of the working day, Bholanath often found Nirmala lying on the  
kitchen floor, the food half cooked or burnt.   
On the full moon night of **August 1922**, at midnight, 26-year old Nirmala  
went through the actions of **spiritual initiation** \- initiating herself,  
rather than following the tradition of initiation by a Guru or priest. She  
later stated, " _As the master (guru) I revealed the mantra; as the disciple  
(shishya) I accepted it and started to recite it._ " Because of his wife's  
condition, members of Bholanath's family suggested that he remarry. Instead,  
he asked her when and from whom he should be initiated. She gave him a date  
five months in the future when she would initiate him. After an acquaintance  
asked her for proof that she was qualified to do so, she touched Bholanath on  
the top of the head. He went into a deep withdrawn state for several hours,  
declaring later that he was feeling "indescribable bliss."   
At that time, her sadhana (spiritual practices) took on more concrete form.  
She began spontaneously chanting Sanskrit hymns, even though she was  
completely uneducated. She also performed intricate yoga postures and went for  
days at a time without food or drink. At one point, Bholanath called an  
exorcist to 'cure' her - those attempts failed, and finally a physician told  
him that she was experiencing God intoxication rather than mental illness. It  
was during that period that she began exhibiting various spiritual powers, or  
siddhis. In **January, 1923**, she began three years of complete silence, or  
**mauna**.   
Nirmala moved to **Shahbag** with her husband in **1924**, where he had been  
appointed caretaker of the gardens of the Nawab of Dhaka. During this period  
Nirmala used to experience ecstasy similar to that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.  
Nirmala continued to perform household tasks, though she often practiced  
silence and was in a withdrawn state of ecstasy much of the time. These states  
began to interfere with her work. In **1926** she set up a **Kali temple** in  
the **Siddheshwari** area and devoted herself to spiritual practices. Nirmala  
underwent a mystic experience while praying in the temple one day. In a deep  
meditative state, she held difficult yogic positions for long periods and  
spontaneously formed complex tantric hand positions and gestures.   
During the time in Shahbag, more and more people began to be drawn to what  
they saw as a living embodiment of the divine. Jyotiscandra Ray, known as  
"Bhaiji" was an early and close disciple - he was the first to suggest that  
Nirmala be called **Anandamayi Ma**, meaning " **Joy Permeated Mother** ", or  
" **Bliss Permeated Mother** ". He was chiefly responsible for the first  
ashram built for Anandamayi Ma in 1929 at Ramna, within the precinct of the  
Ramna Kali Mandir.   
Scholars were attracted to Anandamoyi Ma's spirituality and teaching, though  
she called herself " _a little unlettered child_ ".   
Her early followers included Mahamahopadhyay Gopinath Kaviraj, Sanskrit  
scholar, philosopher, and principal of Sanskrit College in Kolkata, and the  
physician Triguna Sen. Uday Shankar, the famous dance artist, was impressed by  
Anandamoyi Ma's analysis of dance, which she used as a metaphor for the  
relationship between people and God.   
In **1932**, Anandamoyi Ma moved to **Dehradun** with her husband. From that  
time, until her death in 1982, she traveled across the subcontinent, never  
staying more than two weeks in the same place. Several ashrams and teaching  
hospitals were established in her name at Ramna (near Shahbag) and Kheora in  
Bangladesh, and Benares, Kankhal and other parts of India.Twenty-five ashrams  
are named after her. She also renovated many dilapidated holy places,  
including the Naimisharanya, where she set up a temple and arranged for the  
recitation of holy names and the performance of kirtan and other religious  
rites. During this period, many people like Arnaud Desjardins, the French  
producer of spiritual films, Melita Maschmann, the German novelist, and Dr.  
Colin Turnbull, the English author, became her disciples.   
Kamala Nehru, wife of the future Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, became a  
devotee in 1933. Anandamayi Ma was then staying at a small temple in Dehradun,  
while Jawarharlal Nehru was incarcerated by the British in Dehradun jail.  
Later she took Kamala to the Ambika temple in Kajpur to perform a three-day  
yajna. She gave to her daughter Indira the rosary which Mataji had given her.  
Mahatma Gandhi came to hear of Anandamayi through Kamala and sent his aid,  
Jamnalal Bajaj, to see her. He in turn became a devotee. After the unexpected  
death of Bajaj, she went to Wardha to console Mahatma Gandhi.   
Paramahansa Yogananda wrote about her in his Autobiography of a Yogi. His  
meeting with her is recounted in the chapter titled The Bengali "Joy-Permeated  
Mother", where she explains her background: _" Father, there is little to tell."_ She spread her graceful hands in a  
deprecatory gesture. _" My consciousness has never associated itself with this  
temporary body. Before I came on this earth, Father, I was the same. As a  
little girl, I was the same. I grew into womanhood, but still I was the same.  
When the family in which I had been born made arrangements to have this body  
married, 'I was the same... And, Father, in front of you now, I am the same.  
Ever afterward, though the dance of creation changes around me in the hall of  
eternity, I shall be the same."_   
She died on **27 August, 1982** in **Dehradun**, and subsequently on 29th  
August, 1982 was given Samadhi in the courtyard her Kankhal ashram, situated  
in Haridwar in North India, a shrine was later erected over the samadhi, now  
known as the "Ananda Jyoti Peetham".   
Teachings   
" _As you love your own body, so regard everyone as equal to your own body.  
When the Supreme Experience supervenes, everyone 's service is revealed as  
one's own service. Call it a bird, an insect, an animal or a man, call it by  
any name you please, one serves one's own Self in every one of them._"   
Swami Sivananda (Divine Life Society) described her as " _the most perfect  
flower the Indian soil has produced._ "

**Brother Lawrence** (1614 AD to 1691 AD)   
 **Brother Lawrence** ( **1614 AD** ) was born **Nicholas Herman** in  
**Herimenil**, near **Luneville** in the region of Lorraine, located in  
modern day eastern **France**. He received a revelation of the providence and  
power of God at the age of 18, but it would be another six years before he  
joined the Discalced Carmelite Priory in Paris. In this intervening period he  
fought in the Thirty Years' War and later served as a valet.   
Nicholas entered the **priory** in **Paris** as a lay brother, not having the  
education necessary to become a cleric, and took the religious name, "Lawrence  
of the Resurrection". He spent almost all of the rest of his life within the  
walls of the priory, working in the **kitchen** for most of his life and as a  
**repairer of sandals** in his later years.   
Yet despite, or perhaps because of, his somewhat lowly position, his character  
attracted many to him. He was known for his profound peace and many came to  
seek spiritual guidance from him. The wisdom that he passed on to them, in  
conversations and in letters, would later become the basis for the book, **The  
Practice of the Presence of God**. This work was compiled after Brother  
Lawrence died by one of those whom he inspired, Father Joseph de Beaufort,  
later vicar general to the Archbishop of Paris. It became popular among  
Catholics and Protestants alike, with John Wesley and A. W. Tozer being among  
those who recommended it.   
As a young man, Herman's poverty forced him into joining the **army**, and  
thus he was guaranteed meals and a small stipend. During this period, Herman  
had an experience that set him on a unique spiritual journey; it wasn't,  
characteristically, a supernatural vision, but a supernatural clarity into a  
common sight.   
In the deep of **winter**, Herman looked at a **barren tree, stripped of  
leaves and fruit**, waiting silently and patiently for the sure hope of  
summer abundance. Gazing at the tree, Herman grasped for the first time the  
extravagance of God's grace and the unfailing sovereignty of divine  
providence. Like the tree, he himself was seemingly dead, but God had life  
waiting for him, and the turn of seasons would bring fullness. At that moment,  
he said, that leafless tree " _first flashed in upon my soul the fact of God,  
and a love for God that never after ceased to burn_ ". Sometime later, an  
injury forced his retirement from the army, and after a stint as a footman, he  
sought a place where he could suffer for his failures. He thus entered the  
**Discalced Carmelite monastery** in **Paris** as Brother Lawrence.   
He was assigned to the monastery **kitchen** where, amidst the tedious chores  
of cooking and cleaning at the constant bidding of his superiors, he developed  
his rule of spirituality and work. In his Maxims, Lawrence writes, " _Men  
invent means and methods of coming at God 's love, they learn rules and set up  
devices to remind them of that love, and it seems like a world of trouble to  
bring oneself into the consciousness of God's presence. Yet it might be so  
simple. Is it not quicker and easier just to do our common business wholly for  
the love of him?_"   
For Brother Lawrence, " _common business_, " no matter how mundane or routine,  
was the medium of God's love. The issue was not the sacredness or worldly  
status of the task but the **motivation** behind it. " _Nor is it needful that  
we should have great things to do.. . We can do little things for God; I turn  
the cake that is frying on the pan for love of him, and that done, if there is  
nothing else to call me, I prostrate myself in worship before him, who has  
given me grace to work; afterwards I rise happier than a king. It is enough  
for me to pick up but a straw from the ground for the love of God._ "   
Brother Lawrence retreated to a place in his **heart** where the love of God  
made every detail of his life of surpassing value. " _I began to live as if  
there were no one save God and me in the world._ " Together, God and Brother  
Lawrence cooked meals, ran errands, scrubbed pots, and endured the scorn of  
the world.   
He admitted that the path to this perfect union was not easy. He spent years  
disciplining his heart and mind to yield to God's presence. " _As often as I  
could, I placed myself as a worshipper before him, fixing my mind upon his  
holy presence, recalling it when I found it wandering from him. This proved to  
be an exercise frequently painful, yet I persisted through all difficulties._  
"   
Only when he reconciled himself to the thought that this struggle and longing  
was his destiny did he find a new peace: his soul " _had come to its own home  
and place of rest._ " There he spent the rest of his 80 years, dying in  
relative obscurity and pain and perfect joy.

**Bammera Pothana** (1450-1510)   
 **Pothana** was born into a Niyogi Brahmin family in **Bommera Village**,   
**Warangal, Andhra Pradesh**. His father was Kesanna and his mother  
Lakshmamma. There is a popular myth that he was related to Srinatha, another  
famous Telugu poet.   
He was considered to be a natural Poet ( **Sahaja Kavi** ), needing no  
teacher. He was known to be very polite and was an **agriculturist** by  
occupation. Though he was a great scholar, he never hesitated to work in the  
agricultural fields.   
At an early age he wrote **Bhogini Dandakam** a poem wrote in praise of king  
Sri Singa Bhoopala's concubine Bhogini. This was his first poetic venture  
which had the seeds of his great poetic talents. Bhogini Dandakam is the  
earliest available Dhandaka (rhapsody which uses the same gana or foot all  
through) in Telugu. His second work was **Virabhadhra Vijayamu** which  
describes the adventures of **Lord Virabhadhra**, son of **Lord Shiva**. The  
main theme was the destruction of a yagna performed in absence of Lord Shiva  
by Daksha Prajapathi.   
As a young man, he was a devotee of **Lord Shiva**. Later, Pothana became a  
devotee of **Lord Rama** and more interested in salvation. His conversion from  
Shaivism to Vaishnavism was triggered by an incident. One early morning during  
a lunar eclipse, on the banks of river Godavari, Pothana was meditating on  
Lord Shiva. At that auspicious moment, Lord Rama appeared dressed like a king  
and requested Pothana to translate **Bhagavatam** into **Telugu** and dedicate  
it to Him. This inspired him to translate Vyasa's Sanskrit Bhagavatam into  
Telugu.   
The following story is a popular myth. The Padma Nayaka king of Rachakonda,  
Sarvajana Singha Bhoopaala, wanted Pothana to dedicate 'Andhra Maha  
Bhagavatham' to him. The king himself is a scholar and wrote many works  
including Rudranavasudhakara, a well known Sanskrit drama. But, Pothana  
refused to obey the king's orders and dedicated the Bhagavathamu to Lord Rama,  
whom he worshiped with great devotion. It is said that Pothana remarked, " _It  
is better to dedicate the work to the supreme Lord Vishnu than dedicate it to  
the mortal kings._ " He was of opinion that poetry was a divine gift and it  
should be utilized for salvation by devoting it to the God.   
He was quite fond of using rhythm and repetition of sounds giving a majestic  
grace to the style of writing. He was very skillful in using alankaras  
(figures of speech) like similes and metaphors. Potana imparted the knowledge  
of the divine to the Telugu people along with lessons in ethics and politics  
through **Andhra Maha Bhagavatamu**. He lived for **sixty years**.   
Even illiterate Telegus readily quote verses from chapters ' **Gajendra  
Mokshamu** ' and ' **Prahlada Charitra** ' of his work, ' **Andhra Maha  
Bhagavathamu**, ' the crown jewel of Telugu literature.   
 _ala vaikuMThapuraMbulO nagarilO nAmUla soudhaMbu dApala_......   
This is a verse which describes the palace of **Lord Vishnu** in his divine  
abode ( **VAIKUNTHA** ), at the time the elephant king prayed for the Lord's  
kindness to deliver him out of the deadly grip of crocodile in a lake.   
The story goes that Pothana wrote the first line of the verse, but could not  
continue (because he did not know how Vaikuntha looks!). So he paused the  
writing at that point, and went to farm. When he came back in the evening, he  
saw the verse completed. He enquired his daughter about who wrote the other  
three lines. The daughter replied - "You yourself came in the afternoon and  
wrote some thing!". So Pothana understood that Lord Sri Rama himself came and  
completed the verse.   
In fact, Pothana himself ascribed in the following poem, the purpose of his  
writing the Bhagavatam:  _palikeDidi bhAgavathamata palikincheDivADu rAmabhadhrunData palikina  
bhavaharamagunata palikedavEronDu ghAdhapalukaganEla_   
Translated it means (approx. translation): " _That which is spoken is the  
Bhagavatam and the one who enthuses this speech is Lord Rama, Himself. The  
result of speaking which is the ultimate freedom, the Liberation of life. So,  
let me sing it, since there is no other story as great as this (Bhagavatha)_."

## Re:[4]Baba Lokenath  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 23, 2010, 01:12:00 PM  
---  
**Baba Lokenath** (1730-1890)   
 **Baba Lokenath Brahmachari** (1730-1890) was born on **Janmasthami**, the  
birthday of **Lord Krishna** in the village of **Chaurasi Chakla**, a couple  
of miles from **Kolkata** to father Ramanarayan Ghosal and mother Kamala Devi.  
Ramnarayan Ghosal wished to dedicate one of his child to the path of  
renunciation to the God but could not do so with the earlier three sons due to  
the motherly attachment of his wife Kamala Devi. When the fourth son was born,  
by divine providence his wish was fulfilled and Kamala Devi finally agreed. He  
requested earnestly **Pandit Bhagawan Ganguly**, a householder (Grihi)  
sanyasi and a scholar of great reputation of the nearby village of **Kochuya**  
to be his son's guru and teach him the wisdom of the Shastras. Young Lokenath  
left home with His guru at the **age of 11** along with his bosom friend,  
**Benimadhav**.   
Travelling for many miles, they came to **Kalighat**, near Kolkata, a holy  
pilgrim site in eastern India, and the seat of **Shakti**. At that time, the  
place was a jungle and full of sadhus and sanyasis, with long matted hair, and  
wearing loincloths. Lokenath and his friend started feeling at home right from  
the beginning in the midst of these holy men - who never told them anything  
even when they would disturb them in their meditation by pulling at their hair  
and their loincloths.   
From Kaligahat they proceeded to deeper jungles for performing austerities.  
Like a loving mother Guru Bhagwan Ganguly prepared the two boys for the hard  
life of austerity and renunciation. Under his able guidance, the boys, in  
addition to the practice of deep meditation, also observed various fasting  
vows that lasted - starting from a single day - to two days, then for three,  
five, nine and twelve days and then a fortnight. When the fasting lasted for a  
full month, twice in a row, Benimadhav could not complete his vow the second  
time, while Lokenath could do it easily. During the long years that these vows  
were being observed, Guru Bhagwan took complete care of his two disciples,  
from begging alms, to preparing their food, and even attending to their calls  
of nature. Afterwards, Baba Lokenath would always speak of his Guru with tears  
in his eyes and his voiced choked with emotion.   
It was known to Guru Bhagwan that Baba Loknath would attain the magnitude of  
enlightenment. The Guru guided Lokenath for a period of thirty to forty years,  
in the practices of the necessary yogic disciplines and hatha yoga. Baba stood  
firm repeatedly, almost unimaginable austerities, under the guidance of His  
beloved Guru.   
When Lokenath asked his Guru about the need to study the scriptures, His  
Gurudev replied,   
" _If You know who You are, You will come to know everything. There is nothing  
in this external, manifested world, which is not within you. Believe My words;  
there is no truth without, because your atman is 'sarvatbhutatman', the Atman  
seated in the hearts of all creatures. In You is the dormant seed form of all  
the knowledge, power and wealth of this entire creation. Why should You leave  
the diamond and waste time on pieces of glass?_"   
Lokenath travelled to the **Himalayas** and meditated in the nude for nearly  
five decades. Finally, at the age of **ninety** He attained enlightenment.   
Recalling His time in the Himalayas, Baba Lokenath said,   
" _While in samadhi, heaps of snow would cover My body and would melt away. In  
that sublime state I had no feeling of the existence of My body. I was in that  
state of samadhi for a long time. Then, finally the effortless state of the  
Ultimate Truth was revealed. In that state of consciousness, there was no  
difference between me, the rest of the cosmos and all its manifestations. The  
inner and the outer all merged into each other as an expression of ultimate  
bliss, absolute joy. There is no state beyond this to be achieved in human  
life with total effort and divine grace._ "   
There were a number of times when Baba did speak of the enlightened state: " _Words are such poor vehicles to express the inner experience. Any attempt  
to reduce it to words only belittles the Ultimate Truth. It is like the mute  
trying to express the taste of nectar._ "   
" _Everything that exists in the infinite creation exists within Myself. The  
whole Universe is within Me. I am existence beyond space, time and causation.  
My existence is without beginning or end. I exist in eternal expansion. These  
words are not meant to be shared. That is the reason you see Me spending time  
with the householders, granting their mundane demands. Do not think when I am  
busy with you all in worldly matters, that I lose touch with that blissful  
state. No. Whoever achieves that state can never fall from it. Nothing can  
ever again be seen in isolation. Everything is seen as the expression of the  
One. In variety is the taste of Unity._ "   
" _Because I eat, drink, attend to the call of nature and live like any one of  
you, you think of Me as one like you. Your greatest mistake is to think of Me  
as a body. How am I to explain who I am? Everyone is so involved in the  
fulfillment of small desires, so unconscious, so forgetful of the true 'I'._   
After spending fifty years among the snows of the Himalayas, Loknath, along  
with his Guru and his friend, proceeded towards **Mecca** and **Medina**,   
wishing to study the **Holy Koran** under an able teacher. Walking all the  
way, they reached **Kabul**, where they stayed for some time with  
**Mullahsadi**, who was known for his poetry and his brilliant commentaries  
of the Koran. From Kabul, the three yogis went to Mecca and thence to Medina.  
While walking through the desert to Medina, they met with **Abdul Gaffar** who  
was himself a yogi of high attainment. Baba Loknath would later say the  
following about this great man -   
" _I have travelled extensively all over the world and could find only two  
real Brahmans beside myself - one is Abdul Gaffar, and the other - Trailangya  
Swami._ "   
While staying at Mecca, Guru Bhagwan decided it was time for him to leave his  
old and worn out mortal body behind and for that purpose, they came back to  
**Varanasi**, the holiest of all pilgrim sites, on the bank of the River  
Ganga. Here, Guru Bhagwan placed the caring of Lokenath and Benimadhav into  
the hands of Sri Hithlal Mishra, also known popularly as **Trailangya Swami**.  
Thus being free from his only worry in the world - that of placing his two  
beloved disciples under an able teacher and guide - Guru Bhagwan left his  
physical body while in deep meditation at **Manikarnika Ghat**.   
Baba Lokenath traveled extensively on foot to **Afghanistan**, **Persia**,   
**Arabia** and **Israel**, making three pilgrimages to Mecca after his  
enlightenment.   
Baba Lokenath was all alone when he walked into the village of **Daudkandi in  
Tripura**, where, through his divine grace, he rescued a man called Dengu  
Karmakar from the clutches of death. Dengu instantly became an ardent devotee  
of Baba Lokenath, and it was he who was responsible for bringing Baba to  
**Baradi**, which was Dengu's home. He gave Lokenath a place to stay in his  
home, despite the admonitions of his family members. Baradi was destined to  
become the seat of Baba's divine play, because it was here that Baba Lokenath  
revealed his divinity and infinite grace to the people of the world.   
Baba Lokenath performed many miracles during his life with the Divine Power  
and seeing and feeling the unbearable suffering of others as His own  
suffering.   
Finally, on the **19th day of Jyeshtha, 1890** (1297 in Bengali), Baba was  
meditating and he slided into trance. His eyes were still open and he left his  
physical body forever. He was then **160 years** of age. He had said before  
his death : " _I am eternal, I am deathless. After this body falls, do not think that  
everything will come to an end. I will live in the hearts of all living beings  
in my subtle astral form. Whoever will seek my refuge, will always receive my  
Grace._ "   
As an Embodiment of Love, Baba Lokenath promises us, " _Whenever you are in  
danger, whether in war, forest, ocean or jungle, remember Me. I shall save  
you. You may not know me. You may not realize who I am. Just pray to me with a  
little touch of your heart and I shall free you from gripping sorrows and  
miseries._ "

**Bhadrachala Ramadasu** (1620 AD - 1680 AD)   
 **Ramadasu** was born in a Brahmin family to Linganna Murthy and Kamamba in  
Nelakondapalli village of **Khammamett Taluk** ( **Warangal** Division of  
erstwhile **Hyderabad** State) of northern **Andhra Pradesh** (Deccan region).   
 **Ramadasu** was appointed as the **Tahsildar** (revenue collector) of  
'Palvoncha Paragana' by Akkanna, his uncle and the administrative head in the  
court of Qutub Shahi Sultan Abul Hassan Tana Shah. He discharged his official  
duties earnestly and collected revenues due to the Sultan - while continuing  
his unswerving service to **Lord Rama** by chanting his name and feeding the  
poor.   
One day, he visited **Bhadrachalam** for a Jatara (fair) and was disturbed by  
the dilapidated state of the temple there. Bhadrachalam was significant to  
devotees of Rama for many reasons. Lord Rama is said to have stayed near the  
**Parnasala** there with **Sita** and **Lakshmana** during his exile and also  
to have visited **Sabari** near Badrachalam. **Pothana** is believed to have  
been given direction by Rama to translate the **Bhagavata Purana** into Telugu  
here. In spite of its significance, the temple was utterly neglected. So,  
Ramadasu started to raise funds for the renovation and reconstruction of the  
temple. After he emptied his coffers and could raise no more money, the  
villagers appealed him to spend his revenue collections for the reconstruction  
and promised to repay the amount after harvesting crops. As such, Ramadas  
finished the reconstruction of the temple with six hundred thousand rupees  
collected from land revenues - without the permission of the Abul Hasan Qutb  
Shah.   
As the temple was nearing completion, he was perplexed one night about fixing  
the **Sudarshana Chakra** at the crest of the main temple. On the same night,  
it is believed that he saw Rama in his dream and asked him to have a holy dip  
in the Godavari River. When Gopanna did so the next day, he found the holy  
Sudarshana Chakra in the river very easily.   
Soon after the reconstruction though, his miseries started. He was dismissed  
from his job for misusing the Sultan Abul Hasan Qutb Shah's revenues and was  
imprisoned in the Golconda Fort (near Hyderabad) with orders that he be  
released only after the exchequer received all the taxes in full. Unable to  
withstand his miseries, Ramadas implores Rama to relieve him through many  
emotional songs that were popularised from the stanzas of ' **Dasaradhi  
Sathakam** ' and ' **Keertanas** ' of **Bhakta Ramadasa**. They praise the  
Lord for all his mysterious ways in testing his devotees and Ramadasu  
regularly pleads the Lord to ease his suffering. When that doesn't work, he  
pleads Sita to recommend her husband to ease his devotee's pain. All else  
failing to invoke a response, Ramadasu resorts to accusing God of being  
indifferent to his suffering. Of course, the songs quickly apologize for the  
harsh language and end in a state of total and unconditional surrender to the  
will of the **Almighty**.   
After **11â12 years** of imprisonment, it is said that Lord Rama decided  
that his devotee's suffering had reached its pre-ordained ending (because of a  
certain transgression his soul had committed in a previous birth). Rama and  
Lakshmana, disguised as two young warriors, entered the bed-chambers of the  
Sultan Tana Shah in the middle of the night. They give the king the spent  
money in gold coins imprinted with Rama's own seal. The king was bewildered at  
the presence of these charming but strange youngsters in his inner quarters.  
They demanded and obtained on the spot, a written receipt for the money. The  
receipt was shown to the jailer who released Gopanna the same night. The next  
day, both Gopanna and the Sultan realized what had happened. Gopanna did not  
care much for his release but was inconsolable at his not having seen his Lord  
even with all his devotion while the Sultan was visited by the Lord. The Lord  
then appeared to Gopanna in a dream and explained him the real reasons for his  
actions and promised him salvation at the end of his natural life. The king  
was convinced that what had happened was a miracle of Allah. He returned the  
entire money to the **Bhadracalam temple**. Since then, it has been the royal  
custom of the Hyderabad State (now part of Andhra Pradesh State) to send gifts  
to the temple on the occasion of **Sree Rama Navami** celebrations every year.   
Ramadasu composed nearly 300 songs. Some Carnatic compositions of his songs  
are: \- Tarakamantramu in Dhanyasi   
\- Ye Teeruga Nanu in Nadanamakriya   
\- Adigo Bhadradri in Varali   
\- Anta Ramamayam in Mohanam [5]   
\- O Rama Ni in Poorvi Kalyani[6]   
His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in Andhra Pradesh as **Ramadaasu  
Keertanalu**.

**Andal** (8th century or earlier)   
 **Aandaal** is believed to have been discovered under a **Tulsi** (Basil)  
plant in the temple garden of **Srivilliputtur**, by a person named  
**Vishnucitta** who later became one of the most revered saints in Hinduism,  
**Periyalvar**. The child was named **Kodhai** (meaning, a **beautiful  
garland**, in Tamil) and she was raised by Vishnucitta. **Goda** (Sanskrit  
version of Kodhai) grew up in an atmosphere of love and devotion. Vishnucitta  
doted on her in every respect, singing songs to her about **Lord Krishna** ;  
teaching her all the stories and philosophy he knew; and sharing with her his  
love for Tamil poetry. As Goda grew into a beautiful maiden, her love and  
devotion for the Lord grew to the extent that she decided to marry none but  
the Lord Himself. As days progressed, her resolve strengthened and she started  
to live in a dream world with her beloved Lord and was constantly fantasizing  
about marrying Him.   
Vishnucitta had the responsibility of delivering flower **garlands** to the  
Lord's temple, everyday. Goda made these garlands and sent it to her beloved  
Lord through her father. Eventually she started acting unusual by wearing the  
flower garland which was meant to be offered to the Lord. This is generally  
considered sacrilege in Hinduism because the scriptures teach the devotees not  
to offer to the Lord, a thing that has already been used by a human being.  
However, Goda felt she should test to see how the garland suited her and only  
if it did, she should offer it to the Lord. One day, she was caught red-handed  
by her father in this strange act, and as an orthodox devotee he was extremely  
upset. He rebuked her and told her not to repeat the sacrilegious act in the  
future. Frightened and apologetic, Goda made a new garland for the offering  
that day. Legend says that that very night the Lord appeared to Vishnucitta in  
his dream and asked him why he had discarded Goda's garland instead of  
offering it to Him. The Lord is believed to have told Vishnucitta that He had  
whole-heartedly accepted Goda's offering all this time. This moved Vishnucitta  
so much even as he started to realize the **Divine Love** that existed between  
the Lord and his daughter. From this day on, Goda is believed to have been  
respected by the devotees and came to be known as " **Aandaal** ", **the girl  
who "ruled" over the Lord**. She is also known by a phrase " **Soodi kodutha  
Sudarkodi** " which means " **The bright creeper-like woman who gave her  
garlands after wearing them** ".   
As Aandaal blossomed into a **fifteen-year** -old beautiful young woman of  
marriageable age (girls were married at a much younger age in those days), her  
father prepared to get her married to a suitable groom. Aandaal, however, was  
stubborn and insisted that she would marry only the Lord at **Srirangam**.  
This perplexed and worried her father. Legend has it that he had a vision  
given by the Lord, once again, and was instructed to send Aandaal to  
Srirangam; the lord simultaneously commanded the priests at Srirangam, in  
their dreams, to prepare for the **wedding**. Aandaal who was anxious to reach  
Srirangam was unable to control herself in her urgency to meet her beloved  
Lord. She ran into the sanctum sanctorum of the Lord and is believed to have  
merged with Him completely at that point.   
Aandaal composed two works in her short life of **fifteen years**. Both these  
works are in Tamil verse form and are exceptional in their literary,  
philosophical, religious, and aesthetic content. Her contribution is even more  
remarkable considering that she was a girl of fifteen when she composed these  
verses and her prodigiousness amazes readers till date.   
Her first work is the **Thiruppavai**, a collection of **thirty verses** in  
which Aandaal imagines herself to be a **Gopi** or cowherd girl during the  
incarnation of **Lord Krishna**. She yearns to serve Him and achieve happiness  
not just in this birth, but for all eternity, and describes the religious vows  
( **pavai** ) that she and her fellow cowherd girls will observe for this  
purpose.   
The second is the **Nachiar Tirumozhi**, a poem of **143 verses**.  
**Tirumozhi**, literally meaning " **Sacred Sayings** ", is a Tamil poetic  
style. " **Nachiar** " means **Goddess**, so the title means " **Sacred  
Sayings of the Goddess.** " This poem fully reveals Aandaal's intense longing  
for **Vishnu**, the Divine Beloved. Utilizing classical Tamil poetic  
conventions and interspersing stories from the Sanskrit Vedas and Puranas,  
Aandaal creates imagery that is possibly unparalleled in the whole gamut of  
Indian religious literature.   
The impact of these works on the daily religious life of the South Indian has  
been tremendous. Just like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Thiruppavai  
is recited with great religious fervor by women, men, and children of all  
ages, particularly in Tamil Nadu. The daily services in most Vaishnava temples  
and households include this recitation. Both of these works, particularly the  
Thiruppavai, has been studied extensively by innumerable scholars. It has also  
been translated into a number of languages over the centuries.   
Aandaal is now one of the best-loved poet-saints of the Tamils. She is one of  
the twelve **Alvars** (saints) and the only woman Alvar of **Vaishnavism**.  
Pious tradition reckons her to be the veritable descent of **Bhumi Devi**  
(Mother Earth) in bodily form to show humanity the way to His lotus feet. She  
is present in all Sri Vaishnava temples, in India and elsewhere, next to her  
Lord, as she always desired. During the month of **Margazhi**, discourses on  
the Tiruppavai in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and English take place all  
over India.

Dear friend,   
Is is the same Lawrence, the Lawrence of Arabia? The person who wrote   
Three Pillars of Wisdom?   
Arunachala Siva.

No, Brother Lawrence is different from T.E Lawrence who wrote the "Seven  
Pillars of Wisdom".   
Brother Lawrence is known for his sayings recorded in the small piece of  
priceless book "The Practice of the Presence of God". He did not write it  
himself but his conversations are recorded by a father. Brother Lawrence spent  
most of his life in the kitchen in silent devotion to God and would have never  
been known, but God's wished otherwise.   
Here are some recorded conversations: Brother Lawrence told me he had always been governed by love without selfish  
views. Since he resolved to make the **love of God the end of all his  
actions**, he had found reasons to be well satisfied with his method. He was  
pleased when he could take up a straw from the ground for the love of God,  
seeking Him only, and nothing else, not even His gifts.   
He said he had been long troubled in mind from a certain belief that he should  
be damned. All the men in the world could not have persuaded him to the  
contrary. This trouble of mind lasted four years, during which time he  
suffered greatly.   
Finally he reasoned: I did not engage in a religious life but for the love of  
God. I have endeavored to act only for Him. Whatever becomes of me, whether I  
be lost or saved, I will always continue to act purely for the love of God. I  
shall have this good at least that until death I shall have done all that is  
in me to love Him. From that time on Brother Lawrence lived his life in  
perfect liberty and continual joy. He placed his sins between himself and God  
and told Him that he did not deserve His favors, yet God still continued to  
bestow them in abundance.   
Brother Lawrence said that in order to form a **habit of conversing with God**  
continually and referring all we do to Him, we must, at first, apply to Him  
with diligence. Then, after a little care, we would find His love inwardly  
draw us to Him without any difficulty.   
He expected after the pleasant days God had given him, he would have his turn  
of pain and suffering. Yet he was not uneasy about it. Knowing that, since he  
could do nothing of himself, God would not fail to give him the strength to  
bear them.   
When an occasion of practicing some virtue was offered, he addressed himself  
to God saying, "Lord, I cannot do this unless Thou enable me". Then he  
received strength more than sufficient. When he had failed in his duty, he  
only confessed his fault saying to God, "I shall never do otherwise, if You  
leave me to myself. It is You who must hinder my failing and mend what is  
amiss." Then, after this, he gave himself no further uneasiness about it.   
Brother Lawrence said we ought to act with God in the greatest **simplicity**  
, speaking to Him frankly and plainly, and imploring His assistance in our  
affairs just as they happen. God never failed to grant it, as Brother Lawrence  
had often experienced.   
He said he had been lately sent into Burgundy to buy the provision of wine for  
the community. This was a very unwelcome task for him because he had no turn  
for business and because he was lame and could only move around the boat by  
rolling himself over the casks. Yet he gave himself no uneasiness about it,  
nor about the purchase of the wine. He said to God, it was **His business** he  
was about, and that he afterwards found it very well performed. He mentioned  
that it had turned out the same way the year before when he was sent to  
Auvergne.   
So, likewise, in his work in the **kitchen** (to which he had, at first, a  
great aversion), having accustomed himself to do everything there for the love  
of God and asking for His grace to do his work well, he had found everything  
easy during the **fifteen years** he had been employed there. He was very well  
pleased with the post he was now in. Yet, he was as ready to quit that as the  
former, since he tried to please God by doing little things for the love of  
Him in any work he did. With him the set times of prayer were no different  
from other times. He retired to pray according to the directions of his  
superior, but he did not need such retirement nor ask for it because his  
greatest labor did not divert him from God.   
Since he knew his obligation to love God in all things, and as he endeavored  
to do so, he had no need of a director to advise him, but he greatly needed a  
confessor to absolve him. He said he was very aware of his faults, but not  
discouraged by them. He confessed them to God and made no excuses. Then, he  
peaceably resumed his usual practice of love and adoration.   
In his trouble of mind, Brother Lawrence had consulted no one. Knowing only by  
the light of faith that God was present, he contented himself with directing  
all his actions to Him. He did everything with a **desire to please God** and  
let what would come of it.   
He said that **useless thoughts spoil all** \- that mischief began there. We  
ought to reject useless thoughts quickly and return to our **communion with  
God**. In the beginning he had often passed his time appointed for prayer in  
rejecting wandering thoughts and falling right back into them. He could never  
regulate his devotion by certain methods as some do. At first, he had  
practiced meditation but, after some time, that went off in a manner of which  
he could give no account.   
Brother Lawrence emphasized that all physical and mental disciplines and  
exercises were useless, unless they served to arrive at the union with God by  
love. He had well considered this. He found that the shortest way to go  
straight to God was by a continual exercise of love and doing all things for  
His sake.   
Also, he noted that there was a great difference between acts of the intellect  
and acts of the will. Acts of the intellect were comparatively of little  
value. **Acts of the will** were all important. Our only business was to love  
and delight ourselves in God.   
He then said that all possible kinds of self-sacrifice, if they were void of  
the love of God, could not efface a single sin. Instead, we ought, without  
anxiety, expect the pardon of our sins from the blood of **Jesus Christ**,   
endeavoring only to love Him with all our heart. He noted that God seemed to  
have granted the greatest favors to the greatest sinners as more proof of His  
mercy.   
Brother Lawrence said the greatest pains or pleasures of this world were  
nothing compared to what he had experienced of both kinds in a spiritual  
state. As a result he feared nothing, desiring only one thing of God - that he  
might not offend Him. He said he carried no guilt because, "When I fail in my  
duty, I readily acknowledge it, saying, I am used to do so. I shall never do  
otherwise if I am left to myself. If I do not fail, then I immediately give  
God thanks, acknowledging that it comes from Him."

## Re:[10]Akka Mahadevi  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 26, 2010, 07:35:22 AM  
---  
**Akka Mahadevi** (12th century)   
 **Akka Mahadevi** was born in **Udatadi** (or Udugani) near the ancient city  
of **Banavasi** (in Shikaripura taluk Shimoga district). Much about her early  
life is not known, nor did she live long.   
Akka Mahadevi whole-heartedly accepted **Lord Shiva** (' **Chenna  
Mallikarjuna** ') as her mystical husband. It is said that she was married by  
arrangement to Kausika, a local king. There were immediate tensions, however,  
as Kausika was a Jain, a group that tended to be wealthy and was, as a result,  
much resented by the rest of the population. Much of Akka's poetry explores  
the themes of rejecting mortal love in favor of the **everlasting love of  
God**.   
She ran away from her life of luxury to live as a wandering poet-saint,  
traveling throughout the region and singing praises to her **Lord Shiva**.   
She travelled widely in search of emancipation and finally became a  
**Sanyasini** (woman saint) before settling down in **Basavakalyana**, Bidar  
district. Her non-conformist ways caused a lot of consternation in a  
conservative society and even her eventual guru Allama Prabhu had to initially  
face difficulties in enlisting her in the gatherings at Anubhavamantapa. A  
true ascetic, Mahadevi is said to have refused to wear any clothing -- a  
common practice among male ascetics, but shocking for a woman. Legend has it  
that due to her true love and devotion with God her whole body was protected  
by hair. One of her famous vachana has a reason for this which translates as:  _People,   
male and female,   
blush when a cloth covering their shame,   
comes loose.   
When the lord of lives,   
lives drowned without a face,   
in the world, how can you be modest?   
When all the world is the eye of the lord,   
onlooking everywhere, what can you,   
cover and conceal?_   
She is a prominent figure in the field of female emancipation and a person of  
mystical vision. A household name in Karnataka, she had said that she was a  
woman only in name and that her mind, body and soul belonged to Lord Shiva.  
During a time of strife and political uncertainity in the 12th. century, she  
launched a movement that made her an inspiration for woman empowerment and  
enlightenment. It is commonly known that she took part in many gatherings of  
learned at the **Anubhavamantapa** in **Kudala sangama** to debate about  
philosophy and attainment of spiritualism. In search for her eternal soul  
mate, she made the animals, flowers and birds her friends and companions,  
rejecting family life and worldly attachment. The time was marked as height of  
foolishness of varnashrama dharma which only supported the three upper castes  
of Hindu society in India and suppressed the shudras and women. Akka was a  
revelation here in that she not only rose for emancipation but also has sung  
vachanas which are so simple but of highest order.   
She Sang:  _For hunger, there is the village rice in the begging bowl,   
For thirst, there are tanks and streams and wells,   
For sleep temple ruins do well,   
For the company of the soul I have you, Chenna Mallikarjuna._

Akka Mahadevi, (The elder sister, Mahadevi) is one of the originators of   
Veera Saiva Movement in Karnataka, started by the famous Basvanna.   
(17 the Century?). They all composed ex-tempore blank verses.   
Akka Mahadevi moved around naked with some leaves around her breasts   
and waist. She is a very virulent devotee of Siva. She remained a spinster   
and considered Siva as her husband. Her poems are shockingly beautiful.   
In one poem she says: I am waiting for my mother in law to sleep.   
In this dark night, I shall go out with Siva and cuckold my husband.   
Siva is my true husband, who else is there for me?   
I do not want any mortal husbands.   
Throw them all into kitchen fires   
And go to bed with Siva.   
There is a small penguin book, having some blank verse translations   
of Basvanna, Akka Mahadevi, Desi Ramiah and Allamma Prabhu. It   
is written by A.K. Ramanujan, the late Professor of Comparative   
Thelogy, University of Chicago. He is a Sri Vaishnavite and a bilingual   
who can speak both Tamil and Kannada. This book is titled Speaking   
of Siva.   
He has written also another book, with some translations of Azhwars,   
the Vaishnava Saints. The title is Hymns for the Drowning!   
Azhwar literally means one who is drowning in the bliss of Narayana.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Alandi**, near Pune in **Maharashtra**. His elder brother was **Nivrtthi**  
(1278 AD) and younger brother and sister was **Sopana** (1277 AD) and  
**Muktabai** (1279 AD).   
Several years before Jnaneshwar was born, Viththalapant, the father of  
Jnaneshwar had left his wife Rakhumabai, renounced the world and left for  
Varanasi for God realization. At Varanasi, he became a sannyasin by taking  
initiation from Sripada Ramasrama. His guru gave him the name Chaitanyasrama.  
To take sanyasa Viththalapant told a lie to his guru that he did not have any  
dependents.   
Soon after this, Ramasrama, the guru of Viththalapant on his way to a  
pilgrimage in South India stopped at Alandi. There, by God's providence,  
Rakhumabai, the wife of Viththalapant bowed down to him and he gave her the  
usual blessing, "May you be the mother of sons". Rakumabai replied that his  
blessings are useless as her husband had gone to Varanasi and taken sannyasa.  
On further enquiries, Ramasrama understood the whole story, immediately went  
to Varanasi and commanded Viththalapant to return home.   
When Viththalapant returned to Alandi, the villagers did not accept him  
because he left the path of sannyasa. They not only made him an outcaste but  
also persecuted him. Living in this surroundings, after twelve years Nivrtthi,  
his first son was born, followed by Jnaneshwar, Sopana and Muktabai. Nivrtthi  
was said to be an avatara of Shiva, Jnanadeva of Vishnu, Sopana of Brahma and  
Muktabai of Adimaya. Viththalapant taught them all of the scriptures he knew  
and they had an extraordinary ability to assimilate all they learned.   
Once the family went on a pilgrimage to **Tryambakesvara** and while  
circumambulating the **Brahmagiri mountain** came upon a tiger. In the  
confusion, as they fled, Nivrtti became separated from the family, took  
shelter in a cave where the **yogi Gahininatha**, the disciple of  
**Goraksanatha** (of Natha yoga tradition) was meditating. Gahininatha  
welcomed him and indicated that he had known that Nivrtti will come.  
Gahininatha initiated Nivrtti and told him to initiate his younger brother  
Jnaneshwar, who he said has a great mission to fulfil. After a week Nivrtti  
returned to his family with the great saint and initiated Jnanadeva. Jnanadeva  
in turn initiated Sopana and Muktabai.   
When Viththalapant felt his sons should be invested with the sacred thread, he  
approached the Brahmins at Alandi for permission. He pleaded to them to  
prescribe a penance for him so that his children would not be outcastes.  
However the Brahmins replied that there was no other penance for him except  
death. Viththalapant left the village and it is believed that he went to  
Prayaga, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati to drown himself.   
Nivrtti then pleaded the Brahmins to prescribe a penance for them, but the  
Brahmins were reluctant. At last they advised the four children to go and  
obtain a certificate of purification (suddhipatra) from the Brahmins of  
Paithan who were more learned in the scriptures. After discussing the issue  
amongst themselves, the children at last went to Paithan to meet the Brahmins.   
The Brahmins at Paithan read their letters they brought from the Brahmins of  
Alandi and replied that there is no penance which can make them pure enough to  
wear the sacred thread. However they suggested a remedy that they should bow  
down with love and reverence to every living being - including donkeys, dogs,  
elephants, pigs, outcastes and so on, with the thought that Lord dwells in all  
of them. The children were delighted and agreed. However they still would not  
give them the certificate and instead ridiculed them.   
Just then a buffalo was driven past the assembly and Jnanadeva said that he  
did not see the slightest difference between himself and the buffalo; the same  
atman is dwelling in all the creatures. One of the Brahmins became furious and  
when he struck the buffalo with a whip, Jnanadeva winced in pain and a large  
welt appeared on his back. Still not convinced, the Brahmins dared Jnanadeva  
to make the buffalo recite the Vedas. Jnanadeva went to the buffalo and asked  
it to recite and the buffalo started reciting with proper intonation from the  
Rigveda. Everyone was stunned. The Brahmins saluted Janandeva and said that  
these children are the Avataras of Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma and Adimaya. There is  
no need for any purification for them.   
On their way to Alandi, the children reached a town named Mahalaya where  
Jnanadeva began teaching the people **Bhagavad-Gita** in their own language,  
Marathi in a simple and devotional style. This discourse was given by  
Jnanadeva when he was only 15 years old and the recorded commentary is now  
known as **Jnanesvari or Bhavartha Dipika**.   
After the discourse, Nivrtti asked Jnanadeva to compose an original work based  
on his own spiritual experiences. This work, written in Marathi is known as  
**Amrtanubhava** ( **Sweet Nectar of Experience** ).   
After this they resumed their journey to Alandi and shortly before reaching  
there the buffalo which they brought from Paithan (which recited the Vedas)  
died. It was buried with great respect. The place where its tomb is located is  
called **Mhasoba**.   
At Alandi, all the villagers who already got the news of their accomplishments  
welcomed them with great respect except Visoba Chati, a cruel and arrogant  
man.   
Once during a festival when Muktabai tried to procure an earthen pan for  
baking some cakes; Visoba warned the potter not to sell anything to her. When  
Muktabai returned dejected, Jnanadeva upon knowing the reason asked her to  
bake the cake on his back which he made blazing hot. Meanwhile Visoba who  
followed Muktabai to their house witnessed this spectacle through a window.  
Filled with remorse, Visoba decided to purify himeself by eating the crumbs  
from their plates. From then on Visoba was known as **Visoba Khechara**  
(scavenger). He became a disciple of Muktabai and was one of their most  
devoted followers. (He became the guru of Namadeva).   
Changadeva, a hathayogi said to be 1400 years old with many supernatural  
powers and filled with pride, desiring to meet Jnanadeva send him a blank  
piece of paper as a message. In reply, Jnanadeva sent him 65 verses which  
became known as **Changadeva Prasasti**. Changadeva could not grasp the  
meaning of the verses but set to meet Jnanadeva with egoistical pride, riding  
on a tiger, holding a snake for a whip followed by a huge retinue of disciples  
beating drums and blowing conches.   
Nivrtti, Jnanadeva, Sopana and Muktabai were seated on wall. Jnanadeva asked  
the wall to rise and take them to Changadeva. When the wall flying through the  
air took them to Changadeva, Changadeva fell at Jnanadeva's feet and decided  
to remain at Alandi to learn from these four saints. An old banyan tree still  
exists under which Jnanadeva taught him. Muktabai however is said to be his  
actual guru. In his abhangas (songs), **Changadeva** reveals his deep devotion  
for this family.   
Janandeva hearing the great devotion of **Namadeva** to Viththala, left for  
**Pandharpur** along with his brothers and sister. Namadeva was extremely  
happy to meet them and became greatly devoted to them. They spent their time  
singing the Lord's praises and the group gained from Jnanadeva's philosophical  
outlook born of Self-Realization. After some time Jnanadeva begged Namadeva to  
go on a pilgrimage with him. Namadeva agreed and it is said that they visited  
Ujjaini, Prayaga, Kasi, Ayodha, Vrindava and Dwaraka among other places.   
Soon after their return to Pandharpur, Jnanadeva expressed his desire to enter  
into mahasamadhi at Alandi. The devotees were very upset but they understood  
his wish. A pit was dug on the left side of Siddhesvara Shiva temple at Alandi  
and for three days and three nights there was continuous kirtana. On the  
thirteenth day of the dark half of Kartika (Oct-Nov), Namadeva's four sons  
cleaned the pit, spread some bilva and tulasi leaves, and flowers, laid some  
kusa grass and a deer skin over which Jnanadeva would sit. After Jnanadeva had  
bathed in the river, Namadeva worshipped him with garlands, sandal paste and  
light. The villagers also prostated and offered garlands. Jnanadeva took leave  
of everyone, entered the place of samadhi, sat for his final meditation and  
soon afterwards entered into mahasamadhi. His soul pierced the crown of his  
head and he became one with the Infinite. With shouts of "Jaya" (Victory),  
everyone threw flowers over him and bowed down. Finally Nivrtti sealed the pit  
with a large stone. It was 1296 AD and Janadeva was only 21 years old. Since  
then a religious festival has been held there every year in the month of  
Kartika. About three hundred years later, a temple was built on the spot by  
Ekanatha.   
Considered one of the masterpieces of Marathi literature, the Jnanesvari's 18  
chapters of Bhagavad Gita are composed in a metre called "ovi". Jnaneshwar  
liberated the "divine knowledge" locked in the Sanskrit language to bring that  
knowledge into "prakrit" (Marathi) and make it available to everyone.  
Amrutanubhav, written some time after, contains 10 chapters and 806 ovi. The  
basis of this book is non dualism (advaita siddhanta). The seventh and biggest  
chapter (295 ovi) is the most important.

In the Bhakta Vijayam parampara, lineage, they are all advaitis. In fact,   
they prayed to Panduranga Vittal as their only God and nothing else mattered.   
Of course, they all went to pilgrimages but there in different temples they   
saw the images of Siva or Uma only as Panduranga Vittal. I am told the   
Panduranga image in Pandharipur is the combined form of Siva and Narayana.  
There is matted hairs on the head. The hands do not possess disc and conch-  
shell etc., Amrutanubhava is an advaitic work. Even Jnanewari, the  
commentaries are based on advaita path only.   
Arunachala Siva.
