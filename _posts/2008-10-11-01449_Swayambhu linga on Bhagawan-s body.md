Around 1948 one small nodule appeared on Bhagawan's left arm and started  
growing.Somebody who sat before him curiously asked what is that nodule on  
your arm.   
Bhagawan jokularly said it is swayambhu linga because it is coming up by  
itself.Bhagawan told them all of you sat before me but the nodule loves me so  
much that it sat on my arm.It is also my guest.It will do it's work assaigned  
to it and then only it will go.See how detached is Bhagawan toward's his own  
body.

Dear Dr. Raju, Yes. Only a Brahma-Jnani can utter words like that.   
Similarly when leeches were placed on the wound, to suck the   
bad blood, oneday someone forgot to remove them and they were   
going on sucking blood and were lying silent on the wound. Bhagavan   
said: The leeches have attained Samadhi!   
Arunachala Siva.
