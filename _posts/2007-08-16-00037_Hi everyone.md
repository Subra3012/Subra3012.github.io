Dear All,   
I am miles away from India in Geneva switzerland. The website and the forum  
has helped me overcome my loneliness and I feel Bhagvan presence everyday in  
and out. But I really miss the ashram and doing girivalam.   
Love   
Pradeep Kumar

Hey,   
I live far away to in the U.S.   
I strongly believe arunachala is within us.When I say Ramana, ramana with my  
mouth closed, I can feel it in my heart and makes me feel close to HIM.   
" Namindri nadethu nalethu"....Ulladhu narpadhu!   
Means without the thought I, where does the place and time exsits...from the  
forty verses on reality..   
ciao
