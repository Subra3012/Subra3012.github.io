## Suruttapalli Siva

There is a small town called Suruttapalli, near Kanchipuram.   
There is a Siva temple there. Here Siva is in a different form,   
which is rare. Here He is lying like Mahavishnu, on the laps   
of Uma. The Puranic story goes that after consuming halahala   
poison, Siva became tired and was resting, keeping his head   
on the laps of Uma. This Siva temple also follows some   
different procedure. They place shadari [paduka] on your   
head and give you only spoons of water. No vibhuti. No   
breaking of coconuts.   
This Siva temple was renovated some years back, by Kanchi   
Kamakoti Math. When Kanchi Sri Chandrasekhara went to   
that temple, he composed a Sanskrit verse: "O Father!   
Please take rest. You have done something which even   
Vishnu could not do. You have driven out the fears of devas   
about the poison. Please wake up early and bless us all."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir,   
Adi sankara sings the glory of Uma. Due to Uma her husband is saved. It comes  
in sowdharyalahari. He says "Thatanka mahima".   
There is another story also. Some poet was asked to sing on the glory of the  
king pallavan. He said he would not sing except the Lord.   
King became angry and asked the poet to leave his village. When lord's devotee  
was leaving the town, the Lord also collected his bed   
and came along with his devotee (poet). IN TAMIL THEY SAY, PAIYAI (MAT)  
CHURUTIYADAL it is called churuttapalli.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. This is a story from Sri Vaishnava devotees. There   
was one devotee by name Kani KaNNan. He was in   
Kanchipuram. The Pallava King wanted him to write a   
poem on him. Kani KaNNan said that he would not sing   
on any mortals but only on Narayana. [Remember Muruganar   
refused to write anything other than Bhagavan Ramana after   
he became His devotee]. The king wanted him to out of   
Kanchipuram. The devotee Kani KaNNan told Narayana   
who was lying on Adisesha also to go with him. Narayana   
also left Kanchipuraam, fold his mat [Adisesha]! The devotee   
and Narayana stayed for one day in a near by village called   
Or-Irukkai [one day seat!]. The king came to the devotee   
and prostrated before him, requesting him to come back. Kani KaNNan composed  
another song asking Narayana to fold back   
his mat and come back with him. Narayna promptly agreed!   
This story comes in Kanchi Puranam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir.   
Thank you very much. Long time back I read so I could not recollect the names  
of the Bhakta.   
It takes so many births to become a good bhakta. After that everything is  
over. God becomes adiyarkku adiyen and listens every thing. I remember   
Bharathiyar song. Engirudo vandhan iddaichadhi nan enran... God does all the  
work for the sake of His devotee.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. God always likes a person who is devoted to His   
devotees. Many saints in Periya Puranam, [e.g. Appoothi   
Adigal] prayed only to Siva's devotees, like Tiru Navukkarasar.   
Yazhapanar, a low caste violinist prayed only to Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar and played his violin only for his songs. Bhagavan   
Ramana says in Verse 104 of Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai: Let me be a devotee of the devotees of the devotees,   
who listen to Your name with love!   
Please bless so, O Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.
