Dear Subramanianm   
Its great of you that you are posting Sri Sankara Vijayam in these forums.   
But a forum user like me, its could be better if you give some nice speeches  
on these works rather than wasting time on putting something on the net and  
expect some one to read them.   
Why don't give some speeches in Raman Ashram, near the hill side ??   
Thanks

This post is insensitive to Subramanian.R's feelings and the effort that goes  
into those posts.

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
I am living in Bangalore. I go to Sri Ramanasramam once in   
two or three months to be in the Presence. The Asramam is   
a burning coal. Flies like me cannot give speeches there.   
But we can think of some chatting, at the Hill side. But me   
and those who want to listen to me should be there. It would   
be possible to work out this, if Bhagavan wills.   
I am writing Sri Sankara Vijayam, based on reliable books in   
English and with the help of Brahmasri Nochru Venkataraman's   
discourse in Chennai/Coimbatore which had lasted for 10 hours.   
This Satsangh of Brahmasri contains many informations that are   
not available in a 300 page book. And that is the reason, why   
I am taking pains to give the total Sankara Vijayam, with translations of some  
of Sankara's works. I am doing it for my satisfaction   
and if a few could read these posts, it will only add to my satisfaction.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear paul,   
Thanks for your feelings. As I told Aham Brahmasmi, these   
posts give me immense satisfaction. If a few could read these,   
it will only add to my satisfaction. I am aware that there are   
hardly 10 active members out of the total 400+ members.   
Arunachala Siva.

Please do not hurt somebodies sentiments. If any body wants to comment he can  
go head and message him personally...   
The efforts that Subramanian.R is taking is outstanding and I thank him and  
request him to continue...

Devotees of Bhagavan Ramana want some one to teach the Hindu principles as  
told be Bhagavan Ramana to the world (not some one who is sitting some where  
in the World logging to internet forum, reading books or keeping books on the  
side and typing countless post)   
Nobody cannot say that he or she is great devotee of Bhagavan Ramana, all are  
equal under the person(Bhagavan) who is sitting under the great Dakisna  
Moorthy.   
I see no point at all in Subramanian R posting so many posts and expect them  
to be read, If Subramanian R is still a person not a jnani or yogi he is  
should try to achieve to become a jnani or yogi, just becomes one has read all  
the vedas and vedanta and books one doesn't become jnani or yogi _either you  
have to showers the knowledge you have obtained to people who SEEK IT and NOT  
POUR IT._   
 **What is the use of rainfall in desert where just one or three plants are  
there? Rainfall is needed where it is needed.**   
It is the same here in the forums we the forums members are plants in desert,  
there are infinity plants outside that seek the rainfall   
One could argue that why cannot make more plants to grow in desert and thereby  
destroy the desert to make agreat rain forest with plenty of trees and  
plants-- but you see that is nature, there should be oceans containing water,  
land contain trees as well as land contain nothing.   
I request Subramanian.R to please stop posting and if he is really into such  
thing as strong devotee Bhagavan, there is no better place than Arunachala.

If a few could read these,   
it will only add to my satisfaction. I am aware that there are   
hardly 10 active members out of the total 400+ members.   
I ask Subramanian R himself a strong devotee of Bhagavan is it enough that if  
10 people read your message compared to innumerable people to listen to you  
speeches preaching Ramana's teachings and works.   
 **Wait, I 'm nobody to force such a thing on him**, but again countless posts  
and for what sake, expecting someone to read it?   
Why don't you create a website such as **indiadivine.org** which as tons of  
Hindu Dhrama related articles.   
You can separte your articles to different channels such as Saints, Siva,  
Vishnu related topics and others and there by a Hindu reader can easily access  
those. There is a huge difference between forum and a website. There is such  
website as **Templenet.com** created by K. Kannikeswaran and he as even sung  
some Tevaram hymns rendered by him (have you listen to them, the music and  
verse simply brilliant)(i am not prompting website, but you see i'm also a  
devotee, want to spread Hindu Dhrama, just visit indiadivine.org and explore  
countless articles.   
Wait again, you can rather create one more website on Bhagavan Ramana and  
gather and put articles on Hindu philosophy under numerous sections. so that  
here people look for striaght and direct searches, this is where the  
differences between forum and a website comes.   
Forums is where people interact but a straight website articles puts the  
matter striaght forward.   
I know it is really difficult to conduct speeches at the Ashram with or  
without the presence of the Management.   
I'm not againts this forum nor Subramanian R but you see there is difference  
in 10 active members and a website on articles

Dear tradere,   
Nature shall ask the full-moon to send its cool rays also on the   
desert, whether there are people or not. Nature shall ask the   
rains to drop its cool water also desert. It is not the desert to   
decide or the full-moon to decide or the rains to decide. It is Nature's   
decision and I am the instrument of Nature. No one can step into   
the shoes of Nature. Every post I write, is Bhagavan's Will and   
not mine or anybody else's.   
Dear amiatall and others,   
It is Nature that makes you read and respond, and not me or   
tradere. Thanks to you through Nature.   
Arunachala Siva.
