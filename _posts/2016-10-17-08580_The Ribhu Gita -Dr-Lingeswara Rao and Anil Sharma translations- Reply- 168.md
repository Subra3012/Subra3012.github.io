53. If anything shines apart from me, it is due to illusion. Anything apart from me is like magic. There is   
no doubt apart from me, nor there is 'cause and effect' apart from me.   
54. All this is just Brahman; I am He - this is the meditation. All this is spoken by the Lord. Such alone   
must be the certitude.   
55. Why repeat this so much. O Yogi? Have this certitude ever. The rare one who attains this conviction   
becomes Brahman oneself.   
56. This world of forests and hills is not apart from Sankara. This world of demons is verily that Lord of gods.   
It is revealed to the subtle intellect that the body, mind and movements, the  
sheaths and the one who   
shines amidst there is but He, the supreme Siva.   
57. The eyes, the ears, the mind and the vital airs manifest from the expanse of the heart within. Inspired   
by the latent tendencies they course through and in the end merge therein  
alone. Then the mind becomes   
illumined as the Heart that is inaccessible to the senses, the speech and the  
mind. Such nectar of Brahman   
alone is referred to as the consort of mountains born Girija (Siva).   
Thus concludes the chapter 18, a dialogue between Ribhu and Nidagha entitled  
'The dialogue between   
Ribhu and Nidagha in the 6th amsa called Sankara in Sri Siva Rahasyam.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
