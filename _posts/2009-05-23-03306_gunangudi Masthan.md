Recently I had a chance of reading Gunanagudi Masthan's life story and His  
poems. People who can understand tamil, they will be wonder struck   
reading his peoms. he got enlighted at the age of 17 and wandered in tamil  
nadu. Being a muslim He wrote more than 1000 songs.He talks about the  
kundalini, his songs are like nayaki nayaka bhava. He cries for the union with  
God. like thayumanavar. which ends paraparame....   
You can get the books from Giri trading com. His samadhi is in thondayar pet.

Dear ramanaduli,   
Gunangudi Mastan Swami is one of the famous Siddha   
Purushas, who lived much later than the famous 18 Siddhas   
of Tamil, who lived several centuries before today. Gunangudi   
Mastan is also known for his nice songs that speak of Siva as   
his (her?) husband. There is one yogi who attained Samadhi,   
in Bangalore and his shrine is in Ulsoor. He is called Odukathoor Swami. He  
was from Vellore, but was brought to Bangalore in   
early 19th century by a lady, who took pity on him, because he   
was very ill. He is also said to have composed songs in Tamil,   
but they are not available. For that matter Mastan Swami who   
took Bhagavan Ramana as his Guru is also a Siddha and he has composed a few  
songs on Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subrahmaniyan ji   
Thanks for the information. When I was in us. I came to know about His samadhi  
in chennai. I asked so many people including muslims but no one knew,   
Then myself went to search and by the grace of God I could go to His samadhi.  
I was very happy. When I told my friend about Him she could find His books.   
They gave short history. There was no information about Bhagavan. Now you gave  
me additional information.   
All His poems look like a siddar padalkal. in very simple tamil. There in that  
samadi people told He did lots of miracles when He was in His physical body.   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Gunangudi Mastan Swami is different. Mastan Swami whom   
I also referred to was from Desur, near Tiruvannamalai, about   
40 kms. There was one Desur Akhilandammma who became   
Bhagavan Ramana's devotee first. She only introduced Mastan   
Swami of Desur to Bhagavan Ramana. This Mastan Swami got the glimpse of the  
Self in his first meeting with Bhagavan Ramana on the Hill. He stood 7 hours  
standing with that   
exhilaration. He met Bhagavan Ramana a few times after that   
and attained samadhi after some years. It is he, who has   
written a few poems on Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
