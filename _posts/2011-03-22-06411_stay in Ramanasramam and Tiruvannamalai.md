Namaste   
Next August I will be in Ramanasramam for a few days.   
After I'd like to stay in Tiruvannamalai for 15 more days.   
Can you tell me if you know some addresses (guest house, others. .. not too  
expensive.) to be able to make a reservation.   
Thank you.

Dear vishnave,   
If you are from out of India country, you will be permitted in one of   
the Asramam guesthouses for about 7 days. You may seek permission   
from the Asramam, by giving full details to www.sriramanamaharshi.org. Beyond  
7 days, you have to only find   
accommodation in some hotels or in Seshadri Swami Ashram, for which there is  
payment on daily basis. If you are not staying in Sri   
Ramanasramam guest house, you are not permitted to eat food there,   
unless it is a festival day, where anyone can eat.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R   
Thanks for your quick answer.   
I have already ask for permission to stay in Ramanasraman for a week and it is  
ok.   
But after I want to stay more (I come from France)   
Do you think there will be some place in Seshadri Swami Ashram or will I need  
to make a reservation in advance ? And how long can I stay in Seshadri Swami  
Ashram ?   
Thanks

Dear vishnave,   
Seshadri Swami Ashram normally permits for 3 days against payment of some  
reasonable charges, for bathing, morning coffee/tea etc.   
In hotels, when there is off-season, they charge Rs 500 to Rs 1000 per day.  
Choose a hotel inside the town. There are some cottage type hotels outside  
Tiruvannamalai, in Bangalore road and also in Girivalam route, but they are  
more expensive, not safe, and commuting to the Asramam will be difficult.

Dear vishnave,   
I think this refers to one hotel called Hotel Arunachala. This is quite   
a few kms. away from the Asramam. If you stay there, you cannot   
have food in the Asramam, since such facility is given by the Asramam only for  
those who stay in one of their guest houses. I do not know about the safety  
and commuting aspects from this hotel.
