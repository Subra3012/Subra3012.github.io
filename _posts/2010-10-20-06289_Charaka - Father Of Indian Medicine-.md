http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charaka   
Charak, sometimes spelled Caraka, **born c. 300 BC was one of the principal  
contributors to the ancient art and science of Ayurveda, a system of medicine  
and lifestyle developed in Ancient India.**   
He is **sometimes referred to as the Father of Indian Medicine.**   
The term Caraka is a label said to apply to âwandering scholarsâ or  
âwandering physicians.â   
According to Charaka's translations health and disease are not predetermined  
and life may be prolonged by human effort and attention to lifestyle. As per  
Indian heritage and science of Ayurvedic system, prevention of all types of  
diseases have a more prominent place than treatment, including restructuring  
of life style to align with the course of nature and four seasons, which will  
guarantee complete wellness.   
The following statements are attributed to Acharya Charak:  **A physician who fails to enter the body of a patient with the lamp of  
knowledge and understanding can never treat diseases. He should first study  
all the factors, including environment, which influence a patient 's disease,  
and then prescribe treatment. It is more important to prevent the occurrence  
of disease than to seek a cure.   
These remarks appear obvious today, though they were often not heeded, and  
were made by Charaka, in his famous Ayurvedic treatise Charaka Samhita.** The  
treatise contains many such remarks which are held in reverence even today.  
Some of them are in the fields of physiology, etiology and embryology.   
 _Charaka was the first physician to present the concept of digestion,  
metabolism and immunity. According to his translations of the Vedas, a body  
functions because it contains three dosha or principles, namely movement  
(vata), transformation (pitta) and lubrication and stability (kapha). The  
doshas are also sometimes called humours, namely, bile, phlegm and wind. These  
dosha are produced when dhatus (blood, flesh and marrow) act upon the food  
eaten. For the same quantity of food eaten, one body, however, produces dosha  
in an amount different from another body. That is why one body is different  
from another. For instance, it is more weighty, stronger, more energetic._   
Further, illness is caused when the balance among the three dosha in a human  
body is disturbed. To restore the balance he prescribed medicinal drugs.  
Although he was aware of germs in the body, he did not give them any  
importance.   
 **Charaka knew the fundamentals of genetics. For instance, he knew the  
factors determining the sex of a child. A genetic defect in a child, like  
lameness or blindness, he said, was not due to any defect in the mother or the  
father, but in the ovum or sperm of the parents (an accepted fact today).**   
Charaka studied the anatomy of the human body and various organs. He gave 360  
as the total number of bones, including teeth, present in the body. He wrongly  
believed that the heart had one cavity, but he was right when he considered it  
to be a controlling centre. He claimed that the heart was connected to the  
entire body through 13 main channels. Apart from these channels, there were  
countless other ones of varying sizes which supplied not only nutrients to  
various tissues but also provided passage to waste products. He also claimed  
that any obstruction in the main channels led to a disease or deformity in the  
body.   
Under the guidance of the ancient physician Atreya, Agnivesa had written an  
encyclopedic treatise in the eighth century B.C. However, it was only when  
Charaka revised this treatise that it gained popularity and came to be known  
as Charakasamhita. For two millennia it remained a standard work on the  
subject and was translated into many foreign languages, including Arabic and  
Latin.   
According to the Charaka tradition, there existed six schools of medicine,  
founded by the disciples of the sage Punarvasu Ātreya. Each of his disciples,  
Agnivesha, Bhela, Jatūkarna, Parāshara, Hārīta, and Kshārapāni, composed a  
Samhitā. Of these, the one composed by Agnivesha was considered the best. The  
Agnivesha Samhitā was later revised by Charaka and it came to be known as  
Charaka Samhitā. The Charaka Samhitā was revised by Dridhbala.   
Āyurveda is traditionally divided into eight branches which, in Charaka's  
scheme, are: Sūtra-Sthāna, general principles   
Nidāna-Sthāna, pathology   
Vimāna-Sthāna, diagnostics   
Sharīra-Sthāna, physiology and anatomy   
Indriya-Sthāna, prognosis   
Chikitsā-Sthāna, therapeutics & Internal Medicine   
Kalpa-Sthāna, pharmacy   
Siddhi-Sthāna, successful treatment   
The Charak Samhita contains 120 adhyayas (chapters), divided into 8 parts.   
Sutra Sthana   
Nidan Sthana   
Viman Sthana   
Sharir Sthana   
Indriya Sthana   
Chikitsa Sthana   
Kalpa Sthana   
Siddhi Sthana

Dear prasanth,   
Thanks for good information about Charaka. Charaka was basically   
a physician. Saint Tirumular who has given some details about   
what type of a baby is born to a couple, was a Sivaraja Yogi and   
perhaps a siddha medicine expert too.   
See these verses in Tanta II of Tirumandiram: Verse 478: The masculine flow dominates, the infant is male born,   
The feminine dominates, the infant is female born;   
When the two are equal, a hermaphrodite is born,   
When masculine flow gushes in plenty,   
The infant born will sway the world entire;   
When masculine flow is scanty,   
Naught indeed conception is.   
Verse 479: If after emission,   
The male's breath five finger length extends,   
The infant born lives a hundred years,   
When breath to four finger measure stretches,   
To age eighty the infant lives,   
The Yogi who knows the science of breath control,   
If in sex act, he indulges,   
He, the vital flow, according regulates.   
Verse 480: When after the union, the man is short of breath,   
The infant born a dwarf will be,   
When breath blows feeble,   
The issue may of defective limbs be born,   
When breath halts in mid act,   
A hunch back will be born;   
All these apply not,   
To a woman's breathing norm.   
Verse 481: When at the time of union,   
The mother's bowels are heavy exceeding,   
A dullard will be born;   
If urine exceeds   
A dumb will be born,   
If both exceed   
A blind will be born   
Thus is it for the infant born   
The mother's condition according.   
Verse 482: If breath flows leading on nostril right,   
The infant born will a male be,   
If on the nostril left,   
A female will be born,   
If the describing current apana,   
Opposes the ascending current prana,   
Twins there shall be;   
If in measure equal the breath rhythm runs,   
Through nostrils right and left,   
Hermaphrodite shall be the baby born.   
Verse 483: If in male and female breath runs,   
In measure equable   
The infant born will exceeding handsome be.   
When in both breath rhythm falters,   
No conception will there be.   
Verse 485: In months ten it forms full   
And then on earth in time appointed, it lands,   
And grows, Maya fostering;   
But who knows that formless Maya?   
[Tr. Dr. B. Natarajan.]   
Arunachala Siva.

We think that only in recent centuries, the Temples are destroyed   
and some other places of worships are built by people of different   
faiths. It was there even in Tirumular's times. Tirumular in his   
Tantra II, Chapter 19 speaks about such evils.   
Dangers of Transplanting Linga [from some other place]   
Let them beware who transplant   
A Linga at a Shrine established   
Even before the transplant is completed   
The Kingdom will fall;   
And foul leprosy will torture him   
Thus did He declare   
Nandi the Divine Protector.   
Dangers of Destruction of a Temple   
As they move away,   
A single stone from temple wall   
That shall spell the Crowned King's ruin;   
Be he a sage, certain the ruin;   
\- So ordained the Lord.   
Dangers of skipping the performance of Puja   
Rains fail; epidemics spread;   
The mighty king his prowess loses;   
All this sure happens,   
If worship in Lord's temples falters,   
The Lord who has spurned the very God of Death.   
Dangers of Puja ceasing   
When in Siva's temple worship ceases,   
Harm befalls the ruler;   
Scanty become the rains;   
Theft and robbery abound in the land,   
Thus did my Holy Nandi declare.   
Puja to be performed only by a qualified priest   
If he is but only a priest in name   
Who, Lord's worship performs,   
Deathly wars rage in fury   
Fell diseases spread;   
Famine stalks the land --   
Thus did the great Nandi in truth declare.   
Arunachala Siva.**

this is surprising Subramanian garu. So this temple destruction is going on  
from long back.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Construction of temples are there right from 3rd C.A.D. in   
Tamizh Nadu. One of the earliest temple was Murugan temple,   
in Tiruchendur. It is one of the most ancient temples because   
Nakkirar says about this in his Tirumurugatru Padai. It is the second   
of the six Abodes of Muruga. The kings constructed Siva and Vishnu   
temples right from early Pandyan rule. Though Saivites and Vaishnavites had  
constant quarrel among themselves, they did not   
destroy each others' temples. Kochengat Chozhan alone has constructed 70  
temples and this is mentioned by a Vaishanava   
Saint, Tiru Mangai Azhwar. Kanchipuram Kamakshi Temple is also   
one of the ancient temples. Thillai Nataraja temple should have   
come about around 4th C. A.D. In the North India, it is said that   
Puri Jagannath Temple and Kasi Viswanatha Temple are among the oldest temples.  
Sri Sankara who lived in 7th C. A.D. has sung about many of these temples.   
Arunachala Siva.
