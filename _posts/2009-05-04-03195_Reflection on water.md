Dear karthikeyan. M,   
There are several small lakes (forming out of rain waters) and one   
big lake called Samudram Lake, (almost perennial and overflowing   
in monsoon time) around the Hill. The photograph that you mention   
must have been the Hill's reflection on the Samudram lake.   
Arunachala Siva.
