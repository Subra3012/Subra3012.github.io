Hastamalaka Stotram is said to have been recited by Hastamalaka when he met  
Sankara.   
Hastamalaka was the name given to him by Sankara himself. Sankara, it is said,  
was so impressed by Hastamalaka stotram that he wrote a commentry on it and  
even refers to Hastamalaka as master in it!   
The name comes from the fact that it reveals the Truth as clearly and  
straightly as an amalaka fruit [amla in hindi] shown in one's hand.   
Hastamalaka, as a kid, was totally unconcerned with all worldly activities.  
This led his parents to think that he was a lazy kid. The Restfulness of a  
Jnani was mistaken for laziness. And they took him to Sankara. Hastamalaka did  
a Sastanga Pranam to Sankara with deep emotions.   
Sankara perhaps knew about him. He lifted him and asked him "kastvam ", "who  
are you?", "whence do you come", "kuta agatosi", "what is your name" "kim  
nama the" etc.   
In reply to his guru's questions, Hastamalaka sang out the famous Hastamalaka  
Stotram.   
The stotram is simple yet beautiful. we shall study it here.

Quote  
nimmitam manush cakshuradi pravrutau   
nirast akhilopadir akashi kalpa   
ravir lokha chestam nimittam yatha yah   
sa nithyopalabdhi svarupoham atma   
Present in eyes and other outgoing senses, just as the space is present  
amongst all these worldly objects.   
just as various activities happen in the presence of Sun (Sun itself Remaining  
totally untouched by any activity)   
Thus I am that Eternal Presence by Nature which is Self.   
The very first verse is like a bomb shell. The description is so beautiful.  
Hastamalaka says as Space is present amongst these various "Upadhis". Upadi  
means adjunct -- various constructions. Just like that, I am in this body mind  
equipment.   
Like the space.   
What is space to the various forms and activities of the world: I am to this  
whole body mind equipment.   
The senses go out. .. that is pravrithi. going out. The eyes and other sense  
organs function in My presence.   
I am like that space.   
In the presence of Sun, various activities happen. The sun however is not  
responsible for any activity.   
in the presence of sun various objects function as per their nature. A plant  
functions in one way, another animal functions in yet another way. water  
evaoprates and forms clouds. But sun itself is totally untouched.   
That kind of ever presence. Still Presence. .. the background of everything.   
That is what i am -- The Self.

yamagnihoshnavan nitya bodhah svarupam   
manah chakshuradih bodhatmakani   
pravartanti ashritya nishkampamekam   
san nityopalabdhim svarupoham atma   
just as heat is inherent nature of fire, Consciousness is my nature.   
For, Mind, eyes and other sense organs I am the Consciousness.   
That upon which all these lifeless entities rely for their functioning   
That Eternal Presence am I, I am the Self.   
For eyes to function, mind is required. Eyes cannot show an object, unless  
there is mind. IF mind is unavailable, the eyes may be wide open but the  
perception does not happen.   
For mind to function what is required?   
What is the base of the functioning of mind? That I am.   
objects are seen with the eyes. The eyes see the objects -- when objects  
change, the eyes remain changeless. The reflection of the objects is seen in  
mind by consciousness! if no consciousness is present, there is no perception  
possible.   
hence consciousness is the base upon which all experiences are possible.   
i am the consciousness. Hence, the experiences do not matter, I am present in  
all experiences as the back ground. The base.   
That is Self. Consciousness is Self.

Once Muruganar asked Bhagawan is Atma Vidya is so simple like seeing Amalaka  
fruit in the hand.   
Bhagawan said it is much simpler than that.   
To see Amalaka fruit one must have that,he has to keep it in his hand,he must  
have eyes to see it,mind must function so that   
eyes can see it,mind requires the assistence of consciousness to perceive the  
Amalaka fruit.Though looks simple so many things   
are involved in the act of seeing Amalaka fruit in the hand.   
But Atma Vidya is simple.Just "Be as you are".It does not require any adjuncts  
to be.   
 Your awareness is your being. And if your awareness is directed nowhere, you  
are everywhere." This is what Ramana Maharshi means when he says "Be as you  
are".

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
Hastamalakam is one of the beautiful poems of Sri Sankara.   
Bhagavan Ramana has rendered in Tamil verse. The famous   
Who am I? - question of Bhagavan Ramana, was asked here   
by Sankara to Hastamalaka!   
The retarded child was not looking at one with steady eyes. On   
top of it, he was dumb. When Sankara and Padmapada came,   
for the first time, he looked at Sankara with steady eyes. The   
child's father himself was surprised about this 'behavior'.   
Bhagavan Ramana adds only one idea of His own in Tamil verse   
translation, Verse 15: [which is not there in Osborne's translation: "Like the amla fruit on the palm, he showed the Atma; hence this sloka is  
called Hastamalakam. This boy because of his immense knowledge was also  
called as Hastamalaka by everyone in this   
world."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju and Subramanian,   
 Thank you for the information.   
I am really impressed with Hastamalaka Stotram. I do not have a proper  
translation for it, so am trying to do it myself with the help of various  
available sources.   
I managed to get hold of an MP3 of Hastamalaka Stotram sung by one Swami  
Atmananda [a disciple of Dayananda Saraswathi i guess].   
Its very well sung.   
Love!   
Silence

Hastamalaka says "Like the Space outside". This is such a simple yet profound  
statement.   
Various objects are as if suspended in this space here.   
What is the space within?   
Let us study this.   
The space outside is : if all objects are removed what remains. Space itself  
cannot be removed.   
The space inside is: when all objects are removed, what remains?   
Infact, once its understood... for me to see the space outside, no object in  
the outside world needs to be eliminated.   
same within. for me to be the space within, no object in the inside world  
needs to be removed. No thought needs to be altered.   
i need to recognize the space within as Consciousness.   
In the lap of consciousness all the thoughts are suspended. No thought can  
touch me, just as a stone hurled in space cannot hit space. it can hit a form  
-- suppose someone is standing on the way, it might hit him. but the stone  
cannot hit space itself.   
Same within. IF there is a mental formation... a form is created of myself.  
that can get hit. if i remain as consciousness... no thought can hit me. This  
is also called "Formless" mind in Advaita Bodha Deepika. Formless mind means,  
being like the space... being Consciousness.   
What a simple yet profound example is given by Hastamalaka.   
Its Like Silence. Silence is, if all noise is stopped... what remains. At the  
same time, once the recognition is there, it can be observed amonst noise as  
well. noise no more disturbs the silence. .. rather noise is that which  
depends on the background silence. silence always remains as the unchanging  
background of all sounds.   
We see this when we listen to chirping of birds. Chirping of birds need not be  
removed for us to enjoy silence. The early morning melodious sounds made by  
various birds or the rustles of leaves make the silence even more profound.  
they do not disturb the silence.   
This is the whole point. once the Stillness within is recognized, the thoughts  
and ideas simply decorate it. .. every thought, every idea reveals the beauty  
of the Stillness within... just as the chirping of birds makes the silence  
more predominant. The thoughts are no more a disturbance!   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai,   
Dr. Stephen Hawking says: Space is ever expanding. It is the pure   
emptiness which is ever expanding. The stars, planets and galaxies   
occupy only an in infinitesimal portion of the Space. They are like like   
a few crumbs of bread on a large table. The Time and Space are   
interwined. The time is ever moving as a quotient of Space and vice   
versa, in a relativistic concept. In the final analysis, everything is a  
product of mind. The Real Time is only the Time. The Space within your brain*  
is the Real Space.   
Dr. Hawking uses the word brain and perhaps does not know the concept of Heart  
by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Muruganar says in Padamalai: Verse 1968: That which exists is only the present. Past and future   
are encountered when the present is disregarded. They are opposed   
to the present.   
Verse 1684: That which is perceived as time and space is nothing   
more than reality, the Self that is pure consciousness.   
Verse 845: Destruction is only for time and space. There is absolutely no  
movement for the Self, the Surpreme Reality.   
Verse 1582: Those who do not realize the present firmly, in their   
Heart, which is the truth, will be lost in the other [times, future and   
past] through joy and misery.   
 **Bhagavan Ramana also says this in Verse 15 and 16 in ULLadu   
Narpadu.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Tamizh version: Hastamalaka says: He is Nitya Suddha. Nitya Vastu. Pure Space   
without any adjuncts whatsoever. A pure crystal. Asangan. Nish-   
kalangan. Mindless.   
Arunachala Siva.
