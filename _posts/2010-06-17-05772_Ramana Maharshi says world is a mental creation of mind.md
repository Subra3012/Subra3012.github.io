D.: What is that Self-Realisation which removes the discontent? I am in the  
world and there are wars in it. Can Self-Realisation put an end to it?   
 **M.: Are you in the world? Or is the world in you?**   
D.: I do not understand. The world is certainly around me.   
 **M.: You speak of the world and happenings in it. They are mere ideas in  
you. The ideas are in the mind. The mind is within you. And so the world is  
within you.**   
D.: I do not follow you. Even if I do not think of the world, the world is  
still there.   
M.: Do you mean to say that the world is apart from the mind and it can exist  
in the absence of the mind?   
D.: Yes.   
M.: Does the world exist in your deep sleep?   
D.: It does.   
M.: Do you see it in your sleep?   
D.: No, I donât. But others, who are awake, see it.   
M.: Are you so aware in your sleep? Or do you become aware of the otherâs  
knowledge now?   
D.: In my waking state.   
 **M.: So you speak of waking knowledge and not of sleep-experience. The  
existence of the world in your waking and dream states is admitted because  
they are the products of the mind. The mind is withdrawn in sleep and the  
world is in the condition of a seed. It becomes manifest over again when you  
wake up. The ego springs forth,identifies itself with the body and sees the  
world. So the world is a mental creation.   
D.: How can it be?   
M.: Do you not create a world in your dream? The waking state also is a long  
drawn out dream. There must be a seer behind the waking and dream experiences.  
Who is that seer? Is it the body?**   
D.: It cannot be.   
M.: Is it the mind?   
D.: It must be so.   
M.: But you remain in the absence of the mind.   
D.: How?   
M.: In deep sleep.   
D.: l do not know if I am then.   
M.: If you were not how do you recollect yesterdayâs experiences? Is it  
possible that there was a break in the continuity of the âIâ during sleep?   
D.: It may be.   
M.: If so, a Johnson may wake up as a Benson. How will the identity of the  
individual be established?   
D.: I donât know.   
M.: If this argument is not clear, follow a different line. You admit âI  
slept wellâ, âI feel refreshed after a sound sleepâ. So sleep was your  
experience. The experiencer now identifies himself with the âIâ in the  
speaker. So this âIâ must have been in sleep also.   
D.: Yes.   
M.: So âIâ was in sleep, if the world was then there, did it say that it  
existed?   
D.: No. But the world tells me its existence now. Even if I deny its  
existence, I may knock myself against a stone and hurt my foot.The injury  
proves the existence of the stone and so of the world.   
M.: Quite so. The stone hurts the foot. Does the foot say that there is the  
stone?   
D.: No. - âIâ.   
 **M.: Who is this âIâ? It cannot be the body nor the mind as we have seen  
before. This âIâ is the one who experiences the waking, dream and sleep  
states. The three states are changes which do not affect the individual. The  
experiences are like pictures passing on a screen in the cinema. The  
appearance and disappearance of the pictures do not affect the screen. So  
also, the three states alternate with one another leaving the Self unaffected.  
The waking and the dream states are creations of the mind. So the Self covers  
all. To know that the Self remains happy in its perfection is Self-  
Realisation. Its use lies in the realisation of Perfection and thus of  
Happiness.**   
D.: Can it be complete happiness to remain Self-realised if one does not  
contribute to the happiness of the world? How can one be so happy when there  
is a war in Spain, a war in China? **Is it not selfishness to remain Self-  
realised without helping the world?   
M.: The Self was pointed out to you to cover the universe and also transcend  
it. The world cannot remain apart from the Self. If the realisation of such  
Self be called selfishness that selfishness must cover the world also. It is  
nothing contemptible.**   
D.: Does not the realised man continue to live just like a non-realised being?   
M.: Yes, with this difference that the realised being does not see the world  
as being apart from the Self, he possesses true knowledge and the internal  
happiness of being perfect, whereas the other person sees the world apart,  
feels imperfection and is miserable. Otherwise their physical actions are  
similar.   
 **D.: The realised being also knows that there are wars being waged in the  
world, just like the other man.   
M.: Yes.   
D.: How then can he be happy?   
M.: Is the cinema screen affected by a scene of fire burning or sea rising? So  
it is with the Self.**   
The idea that I am the body or the mind is so deep that one cannot get over it  
even if convinced otherwise. One experiences a dream and knows it to be unreal  
on waking. Waking experience is unreal in other states.So each state  
contradicts the others. They are therefore mere changes taking place in the  
seer, or phenomena appearing in the Self, which is unbroken and remains  
unaffected by them.   
Just as the waking, dream and sleep states are phenomena, so also birth,  
growth and death are phenomena in the Self. which continues to be unbroken and  
unaffected. Birth and death are only ideas. They pertain to the body or the  
mind. The Self exists before the birth of this body and will remain after the  
death of this body. So it is with the series of bodies taken up in succession.  
The Self is immortal. The phenomena are changeful and appear mortal.   
The fear of death is of the body. It is not true of the Self. Such fear is due  
to ignorance. Realisation means True Knowledge of the Perfection and  
Immortality of the Self. Mortality is only an idea and cause of misery.You get  
rid of it by realising the Immortal nature of the Self.

Dear prasanth,   
Excellent. This is the normal question and answer session that   
Bhagavan Ramana encounters, with many devotees and visitors.   
We are so mind mind-ful and ego-ful that we refuse to accept that   
the world is unreal. The sleep experience normally quoted by Bhagavan Ramana  
is understood by many devotees and they agreed   
with Him. However, a few visitors refused to accept this and simply   
continue their simple devotion to Him. The sleep experience is what   
Sri Sankara quotes in his works too.   
Everything is ego based. The frightening ego does not accept this   
drishti srishti vada so easily, because its survival depends on it.   
In one of the letters to Bhagavan Ramana, even Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni said  
that srishi drishti vada would still be correct.   
What to do?   
Bhagavan Ramana starts His ULLadu Narpadu [the first verse of the main text]  
only with this: Naamulam kandalaal nanavam sakti   
uLa......   
Arunachala Siva.
