In the previous note we observed that mind is consciousness in movement and it  
is essential for the   
consciousness to function in the phenomenal reality.Nobody has seen this world  
without the mind.   
Mind and world appear and disappear simultaneously.So both are interrelated  
and interdependent.   
When the mind does not perceive the world as in deep sleep,swoon,samadhi it  
becomes no-mind.   
So world must be a projection of the mind.Mind being consciousness in movement  
world must also   
be consciousness in movement.The sanskrit word Jagat(world) literally means  
that which always changes   
moves.So movement is common factor to both.If they don't move they cease to  
exist.   
So mind is the world.   
A child is born without any knowledge, any consciousness of his own self. And  
when a child is born the   
first thing he becomes aware of is not himself; the first thing he becomes  
aware of is the other. It is   
natural, because the eyes open outwards, the hands touch others, the ears  
listen to others, the tongue   
tastes food and the nose smells the outside. All these senses open outwards.   
That is what birth means. Birth means coming into this world, the world of the  
outside. So when a child is   
born, he is born into this world. He opens his eyes, sees others. 'Other'  
means the thou. He becomes   
aware of the mother first. Then, by and by, he becomes aware of his own body.  
That too is the other,   
that too belongs to the world. He is hungry and he feels the body; his need is  
satisfied, he forgets the   
body.So child observes the seen as a witnessing consciousness including his  
own body.He is yet   
to develop an ego so he sees the world without any separative feeling.   
Now starts the genesis of the ego.   
First he becomes aware of you, thou, other, and then by and by, in contrast to  
you, thou, he becomes   
aware of himself.   
This awareness is a reflected awareness. He is not aware of who he is. He is  
simply aware of the mother   
and what she thinks about him. If she smiles, if she appreciates the child, if  
she says, "You are   
beautiful," if she hugs and kisses him, the child feels good about himself.  
Now an ego is born.   
Through appreciation, love, care, he feels he is good, he feels he is  
valuable, he feels he has some   
significance.   
A center is born.   
But this center is a reflected center. It is not his real being. He does not  
know who he is; he simply knows   
what others think about him. And this is the ego: the reflection, what others  
think. If nobody thinks that   
he is of any use, nobody appreciates him, nobody smiles, then too an ego is  
born: an ill ego; sad,   
rejected, like a wound; feeling inferior, worthless. This too is the ego. This  
too is a reflection.   
First the mother - and mother means the world in the beginning. Then others  
will join the mother, and the   
world goes on growing. And the more the world grows, the more complex the ego  
becomes, because   
many others' opinions are reflected.   
The ego is an accumulated phenomenon, a by-product of living with others. If a  
child lives totally alone,   
he will never come to grow an ego. But that is not going to help. He will  
remain like an animal. That   
doesn't mean that he will come to know the real self, no.   
In this way the essential witnessing consciousness "I am" is mixed with  
adjuncts like the body,   
thinking faculty,intellect,memory resulting in a compound consciousness as "I'  
thought or   
I-am-the-body-idea" which imagines itself to be a body,so limited (kinchigna)  
so feels separated from rest   
of the existence,it is a distorted false form of "Real I"consciousness 'I  
am".So mind is imagining itself   
to be not only the body but also the underlying Self consciousness "I am".Mind  
cannot rise without   
imagining itself to be our real Self consciousness.The mind comes into  
existence by superimposing   
imaginary adjuncts on the basic form of consciousness "I am".   
Human requires basic needs like food,shelter,clothing,medical aid,job etc for  
his maintenance.   
For this he has to earn in right means.This is normal and physiological.   
Once ego is crystallized it starts comparing with others,becomes rabidly  
ambitious, competitive,   
starts possessing what he earns,because he has goal to reach through achieving  
lives a life of purpose   
and a man with purpose is angry,violent.In this way an achieving life relates  
with the existence in a   
pathological way and thinks that the other separate and contrary to his  
life.In this process of   
achieving and becoming desiring takes strong roots which makes us future  
oriented bypassing the   
present.A man of desire misses and sacrifices the present moment for a future  
which is yet to be.   
Some monks have non-achievement as their life goal and this is also an  
attitude of achieving in a   
different manner.We should go beyond achieving and non-achieving and live a  
natural way of life.   
Achieving attitude of mind is the seed of  
conflict,violence,disorder,strife,war in the society.   
Just imagine there are 750 crore achieving minds in the world whose interests  
are against each other.   
Total wealth of the world is in the hands of 2% rich people and so rest of the  
population are denied   
the basic needs of life.So see the danger of achieving attitude of mind and  
its consequences on the   
individual and so the society.Achieving attitude is only to fulfill  
psychological appetites for which   
there is no limit.Can real be achieved?Is it wise to run after to achieve that  
which is false.   
In life actually there no need to achieve anything for psychological purpose.   
If one starts for achieving Self that is also a self centered activity.Self is  
not achievable but it is there   
for you to become one with it through Self-Inquiry.
