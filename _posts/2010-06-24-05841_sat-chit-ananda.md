Dear Ramanaduli,   
SAT simply meas that which is eternally is. It is what is called   
ULLadu in Tamizh, as used by Bhagavan Ramana. Now this SAT   
even if it is eternal, it cannot remain without any associated Knowledge,  
which is CHIT. How can the Causeless Creator, the   
Primal Cause, remain without any Knowledge, CHIT. This CHIT   
is not like our worldly knowledge. It is not objective. It is Subjective,  
that is, the Knowledge associated with it without any   
difference or Suttarivu as called by Muruganar. We in this world   
"point out" he or she or it and then learn the knowledge. This knowledge is  
small, Chitrarivu, as it is called in Tamizh. But   
the knoweldge of the God or the Self or the Brahman is beyond   
description, eternal, it is CHIT. Now thirdly, such a Primordial   
Being - can it be just like that, without giving any special benefit   
to the seeker who become That? So it is Ananda, the Bliss. The   
Bliss again is not like our worldy ananda [which is in fact only   
santosham and not anandam], impermanent. Like after eating   
badam halwa, we are happy only for some time. Are we ever   
happy with that one piece of badam halwa or enjoying union   
with one's wife or husband or scoring first rank in the college?   
These are all flimsy, impermanent, non duarable and sometimes   
can produce misery also! A piece of badam halwa, though sweet   
and enjoyable, may increase the sugar level if the eater is a   
high-diabetic patient! So it is impermanent and not ever giving   
pleasures.   
The Brahman or the Self is thus Sat-Chit-Ananda. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say often, ULLa PoruL, aRivu, Anandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

People say AVAN CHITHAM. means it is God's will. so here God what He thinks it  
will be done.Does this chitham drive from CHIT?   
Moreover, when people become mad, they say CHITHAM KALANGIVITTADHU. Here also  
it means mind.   
The same chit can be used for mind and consiousness? Because mind is the  
reflection of consiousness. Like a bubble in the water where it rises and  
disolves, or waves and the ocean. When the mind or chit is associated  
outwardly it becomes chitrarivu whereas when it merges in consiousness it is  
called Perarivu?   
Chitrambalam means chit+ambalam. That is only consiousness. In the same way  
when we go to chithambaram temple it says you are consiousness. There is no  
difference in between man and God. Both are consiousness.   
Manikkavachkar sings... Seethapunaladi... chitrambalamadi.... Can you give  
meaning.

Chit is consciousness   
Chittam is the mind.   
Chittam derives from consciousness and is seen as the "Seat" or "Medium" for  
consciousness.   
That is how the words are derived. Chidambaram means the sky of  
consciousness... like an open space.   
pure consciousness.   
Chittam is imagination, mithya.   
chit is consciousness. Truth, SAT ANANDA

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Our chit is from mind. It is the knowledge out of our mind. So it   
is Chitrarivu. As you correctly said a mad man loses his knowledge   
in some respects and so his mind is said to be cranky. CHIT of   
Brahman is Perarivu, the all knowing Knowledge. He is called Sarvajna. It  
never falters. Never wavers. Ever present.   
Manikkavachagar says in that song: Seethapunal aadi... bathing in   
cold waters of a pond or tank. Chitrambalam paadi...Singing the   
glory of Chitrambalam. What is Chitrambalam? It is Consciousness   
within. It is also the Hall of Consciousness in Thillai i.e. Chidambaram.  
The same Sivam is there in that Kanaka Sabha as   
CHIT and the same is there within us as Heart also. Muruganar explains this  
in his works. Siva with three eyes is the anthromorphic god. Like Vishnu and  
others. Sivam is Consciousness. Pedithu nammai petredutha pey vaLai than....   
Pey VaLai means one who wears nice bangles. She is Sivakama   
Sundari or Unnamulai. She differentiates (petidhu, pedam - difference) us and  
gives birth as human beings and also makes us   
to pray to Siva. Aadi thiram padi... She is primordial concorporate   
with Siva, and she is having adi thiram, capacity which is again   
primordial and matchless. Andhamama padi. She is also andham,   
the Finality, Final Reality. She takes us to Sivam keeping aside all her  
sports of maya. Pada thiram padi... Let us pray to her feet.   
[Remember Muruganar's Padamalai - feet is Padam, Source.]   
Adelor embavai... Let us dance her glories.   
It is an early morning song for Maargazhi month sung by Saint   
Manikkavachagar at Tiruvannamalai. But he glorifies Chidambaram. After all,  
Sivakama Sundari and Unnamalai are one and the same. It is the 14th song of  
Tiruvembavai, in Tiruvachakam. How to pray to her? Kadhar kuzhi aada... the  
earstuds should dance due to our [girls'] stylish walk! Paimpoon   
kalan aada... All the jewels in the neck should dance... Kodahi kuzhal aada..  
Our locks of hair should dance.... Vandin kuzham aada... Seeing this the  
beetles should dance! Thus go the girls, for the early morning bath in  
Tiruvannamlai. Veda porul paadi...   
He is the purport of all Vedas. [See also Sri Arunachala Akshara   
Mana Maalai, Verse 99]. Apporulam maapadi... We are the purport of Vedas, the  
Self. Jothi thiram paadi... here comes Annamalai   
story. He is the Effulgence, which Brahma (buddhi) and Vishnu   
[ego] cannot fathom. Chuzh konrai thaar paadi.... Let us sing his konrai  
garland.   
Thus the saint prays to Siva and Sakti in the same song. After   
all they are concorporate. The Self and the Suddha Maya.   
One can write a book on Tiruvembavai's inner meanings. So many   
layers are there. What I have given is only a word to word meaning.   
Every line is Siva Advaitam.   
Elders say that one should chant Tiruvembavai every day not merely in Margazhi  
month. Particularly, Verse 10 is nitya anusandhanam.   
It should be read and contemplated upon, every day!   
Tiruvachakam speaks of a Nayaki (the Saint) merging with Nayakan   
(Siva). It is a long journey of Jiva to Godhead, through nayaki nayaka bhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

People say AVAN CHITHAM. means it is God's will. so here God what He thinks it  
will be done.Does this chitham drive from CHIT?   
Moreover, when people become mad, they say CHITHAM KALANGIVITTADHU. Here also  
it means mind.   
The same chit can be used for mind and consiousness? Because mind is the  
reflection of consiousness. Like a bubble in the water where it rises and  
disolves, or waves and the ocean. When the mind or chit is associated  
outwardly it becomes chitrarivu whereas when it merges in consiousness it is  
called Perarivu?   
Chitrambalam means chit+ambalam. That is only consiousness. In the same way  
when we go to chithambaram temple it says you are consiousness. There is no  
difference in between man and God. Both are consiousness.   
Manikkavachkar sings... Seethapunaladi... chitrambalamadi.... Can you give  
meaning.

Chit is consciousness   
Chittam is the mind.   
Chittam derives from consciousness and is seen as the "Seat" or "Medium" for

That is how the words are derived. Chidambaram means the sky of

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Our chit is from mind. It is the knowledge out of our mind. So it   
is Chitrarivu. As you correctly said a mad man loses his knowledge   
in some respects and so his mind is said to be cranky. CHIT of   
Brahman is Perarivu, the all knowing Knowledge. He is called Sarvajna. It  
never falters. Never wavers. Ever present.   
Manikkavachagar says in that song: Seethapunal aadi... bathing in   
cold waters of a pond or tank. Chitrambalam paadi...Singing the   
glory of Chitrambalam. What is Chitrambalam? It is Consciousness   
within. It is also the Hall of Consciousness in Thillai i.e. Chidambaram.  
The same Sivam is there in that Kanaka Sabha as   
CHIT and the same is there within us as Heart also. Muruganar explains this  
in his works. Siva with three eyes is the anthromorphic god. Like Vishnu and  
others. Sivam is Consciousness. Pedithu nammai petredutha pey vaLai than....   
Pey VaLai means one who wears nice bangles. She is Sivakama   
Sundari or Unnamulai. She differentiates (petidhu, pedam - difference) us and  
gives birth as human beings and also makes us   
to pray to Siva. Aadi thiram padi... She is primordial concorporate   
with Siva, and she is having adi thiram, capacity which is again   
primordial and matchless. Andhamama padi. She is also andham,   
the Finality, Final Reality. She takes us to Sivam keeping aside all her  
sports of maya. Pada thiram padi... Let us pray to her feet.   
[Remember Muruganar's Padamalai - feet is Padam, Source.]   
Adelor embavai... Let us dance her glories.   
It is an early morning song for Maargazhi month sung by Saint   
Manikkavachagar at Tiruvannamalai. But he glorifies Chidambaram. After all,  
Sivakama Sundari and Unnamalai are one and the same. It is the 14th song of  
Tiruvembavai, in Tiruvachakam. How to pray to her? Kadhar kuzhi aada... the  
earstuds should dance due to our [girls'] stylish walk! Paimpoon   
kalan aada... All the jewels in the neck should dance... Kodahi kuzhal aada..  
Our locks of hair should dance.... Vandin kuzham aada... Seeing this the  
beetles should dance! Thus go the girls, for the early morning bath in  
Tiruvannamlai. Veda porul paadi...   
He is the purport of all Vedas. [See also Sri Arunachala Akshara   
Mana Maalai, Verse 99]. Apporulam maapadi... We are the purport of Vedas, the  
Self. Jothi thiram paadi... here comes Annamalai   
story. He is the Effulgence, which Brahma (buddhi) and Vishnu   
[ego] cannot fathom. Chuzh konrai thaar paadi.... Let us sing his konrai  
garland.   
Thus the saint prays to Siva and Sakti in the same song. After   
all they are concorporate. The Self and the Suddha Maya.   
One can write a book on Tiruvembavai's inner meanings. So many   
layers are there. What I have given is only a word to word meaning.   
Every line is Siva Advaitam.   
Elders say that one should chant Tiruvembavai every day not merely in Margazhi  
month. Particularly, Verse 10 is nitya anusandhanam.   
It should be read and contemplated upon, every day!   
Tiruvachakam speaks of a Nayaki (the Saint) merging with Nayakan   
(Siva). It is a long journey of Jiva to Godhead, through nayaki nayaka bhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
SAT simply meas that which is eternally is. It is what is called   
ULLadu in Tamizh, as used by Bhagavan Ramana. Now this SAT   
even if it is eternal, it cannot remain without any associated Knowledge,  
which is CHIT. How can the Causeless Creator, the   
Primal Cause, remain without any Knowledge, CHIT. This CHIT   
is not like our worldly knowledge. It is not objective. It is Subjective,  
that is, the Knowledge associated with it without any   
difference or Suttarivu as called by Muruganar. We in this world   
"point out" he or she or it and then learn the knowledge. This knowledge is  
small, Chitrarivu, as it is called in Tamizh. But   
the knoweldge of the God or the Self or the Brahman is beyond   
description, eternal, it is CHIT. Now thirdly, such a Primordial   
Being - can it be just like that, without giving any special benefit   
to the seeker who become That? So it is Ananda, the Bliss. The   
Bliss again is not like our worldy ananda [which is in fact only   
santosham and not anandam], impermanent. Like after eating   
badam halwa, we are happy only for some time. Are we ever   
happy with that one piece of badam halwa or enjoying union   
with one's wife or husband or scoring first rank in the college?   
These are all flimsy, impermanent, non duarable and sometimes   
can produce misery also! A piece of badam halwa, though sweet   
and enjoyable, may increase the sugar level if the eater is a   
high-diabetic patient! So it is impermanent and not ever giving   
pleasures.   
The Brahman or the Self is thus Sat-Chit-Ananda. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say often, ULLa PoruL, aRivu, Anandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

ANANDA - UNBOUND, COMPLETE.   
I saw 100s of people in my dream. what are the objects made up of? They are  
made up of my mind stuff. Coz none of them exist outside. They are made up of  
Consciousness.   
SAT is what EXISTS. .. its CONSCIOUSNESS ALONE! Coz u r reading all this.  
where is it? Out there on the destop or laptop or in your mind? Its all in  
mind. The people, the mansions. ..everything is in mind!   
So SAT is CHIT. and that has no limits. Its Everywhere. It is Ananta...

gives birth as human beings and also makes us   
to pray to Siva. Aadi thiram padi... She is primordial concorporate   
with Siva, and she is having adi thiram, capacity which is again   
primordial and matchless. Andhamama padi. She is also andham,   
the Finality, Final Reality. She takes us to Sivam keeping aside all her  
sports of maya. Pada thiram padi... Let us pray to her feet.   
[Remember Muruganar's Padamalai - feet is Padam, Source.]   
Adelor embavai... Let us dance her glories.   
It is an early morning song for Maargazhi month sung by Saint   
Manikkavachagar at Tiruvannamalai. But he glorifies Chidambaram. After all,  
Sivakama Sundari and Unnamalai are one and the same. It is the 14th song of  
Tiruvembavai, in Tiruvachakam. How to pray to her? Kadhar kuzhi aada... the  
earstuds should dance due to our [girls'] stylish walk! Paimpoon   
kalan aada... All the jewels in the neck should dance... Kodahi kuzhal aada..  
Our locks of hair should dance.... Vandin kuzham aada... Seeing this the  
beetles should dance! Thus go the girls, for the early morning bath in  
Tiruvannamlai. Veda porul paadi...   
He is the purport of all Vedas. [See also Sri Arunachala Akshara   
Mana Maalai, Verse 99]. Apporulam maapadi... We are the purport of Vedas, the  
Self. Jothi thiram paadi... here comes Annamalai   
story. He is the Effulgence, which Brahma (buddhi) and Vishnu   
[ego] cannot fathom. Chuzh konrai thaar paadi.... Let us sing his konrai  
garland.   
Thus the saint prays to Siva and Sakti in the same song. After   
all they are concorporate. The Self and the Suddha Maya.   
One can write a book on Tiruvembavai's inner meanings. So many   
layers are there. What I have given is only a word to word meaning.   
Every line is Siva Advaitam.   
Elders say that one should chant Tiruvembavai every day not merely in Margazhi  
month. Particularly, Verse 10 is nitya anusandhanam.   
It should be read and contemplated upon, every day!   
Tiruvachakam speaks of a Nayaki (the Saint) merging with Nayakan   
(Siva). It is a long journey of Jiva to Godhead, through nayaki nayaka bhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the correct meaning for sat-chit-ananda. For ananda(bliss) we need  
chit?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
SAT simply meas that which is eternally is. It is what is called   
ULLadu in Tamizh, as used by Bhagavan Ramana. Now this SAT   
even if it is eternal, it cannot remain without any associated Knowledge,  
which is CHIT. How can the Causeless Creator, the   
Primal Cause, remain without any Knowledge, CHIT. This CHIT   
is not like our worldly knowledge. It is not objective. It is Subjective,  
that is, the Knowledge associated with it without any   
difference or Suttarivu as called by Muruganar. We in this world   
"point out" he or she or it and then learn the knowledge. This knowledge is  
small, Chitrarivu, as it is called in Tamizh. But   
the knoweldge of the God or the Self or the Brahman is beyond   
description, eternal, it is CHIT. Now thirdly, such a Primordial   
Being - can it be just like that, without giving any special benefit   
to the seeker who become That? So it is Ananda, the Bliss. The   
Bliss again is not like our worldy ananda [which is in fact only   
santosham and not anandam], impermanent. Like after eating   
badam halwa, we are happy only for some time. Are we ever   
happy with that one piece of badam halwa or enjoying union   
with one's wife or husband or scoring first rank in the college?   
These are all flimsy, impermanent, non duarable and sometimes   
can produce misery also! A piece of badam halwa, though sweet   
and enjoyable, may increase the sugar level if the eater is a   
high-diabetic patient! So it is impermanent and not ever giving   
pleasures.   
The Brahman or the Self is thus Sat-Chit-Ananda. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say often, ULLa PoruL, aRivu, Anandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

SAT - EXISTENCE   
CHIT - CONSCIOUSNESS   
ANANDA - UNBOUND, COMPLETE.   
I saw 100s of people in my dream. what are the objects made up of? They are  
made up of my mind stuff. Coz none of them exist outside. They are made up of  
Consciousness.   
SAT is what EXISTS. .. its CONSCIOUSNESS ALONE! Coz u r reading all this.  
where is it? Out there on the destop or laptop or in your mind? Its all in  
mind. The people, the mansions. ..everything is in mind!   
So SAT is CHIT. and that has no limits. Its Everywhere. It is Ananta...  
unbound. Totally Complete. And hence it is Ananda - Bliss.   
SAT CHIT ANANDA is you. ME, Everything,

People say AVAN CHITHAM. means it is God's will. so here God what He thinks it  
will be done.Does this chitham drive from CHIT?   
Moreover, when people become mad, they say CHITHAM KALANGIVITTADHU. Here also  
it means mind.   
The same chit can be used for mind and consiousness? Because mind is the  
reflection of consiousness. Like a bubble in the water where it rises and  
disolves, or waves and the ocean. When the mind or chit is associated  
outwardly it becomes chitrarivu whereas when it merges in consiousness it is  
called Perarivu?   
Chitrambalam means chit+ambalam. That is only consiousness. In the same way  
when we go to chithambaram temple it says you are consiousness. There is no  
difference in between man and God. Both are consiousness.   
Manikkavachkar sings... Seethapunaladi... chitrambalamadi.... Can you give  
meaning.

Chit is consciousness   
Chittam is the mind.   
Chittam derives from consciousness and is seen as the "Seat" or "Medium" for  
consciousness.   
That is how the words are derived. Chidambaram means the sky of  
consciousness... like an open space.   
pure consciousness.   
Chittam is imagination, mithya.   
chit is consciousness. Truth, SAT ANANDA

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Our chit is from mind. It is the knowledge out of our mind. So it   
is Chitrarivu. As you correctly said a mad man loses his knowledge   
in some respects and so his mind is said to be cranky. CHIT of   
Brahman is Perarivu, the all knowing Knowledge. He is called Sarvajna. It  
never falters. Never wavers. Ever present.   
Manikkavachagar says in that song: Seethapunal aadi... bathing in   
cold waters of a pond or tank. Chitrambalam paadi...Singing the   
glory of Chitrambalam. What is Chitrambalam? It is Consciousness   
within. It is also the Hall of Consciousness in Thillai i.e. Chidambaram.  
The same Sivam is there in that Kanaka Sabha as   
CHIT and the same is there within us as Heart also. Muruganar explains this  
in his works. Siva with three eyes is the anthromorphic god. Like Vishnu and  
others. Sivam is Consciousness. Pedithu nammai petredutha pey vaLai than....   
Pey VaLai means one who wears nice bangles. She is Sivakama   
Sundari or Unnamulai. She differentiates (petidhu, pedam - difference) us and  
gives birth as human beings and also makes us   
to pray to Siva. Aadi thiram padi... She is primordial concorporate   
with Siva, and she is having adi thiram, capacity which is again   
primordial and matchless. Andhamama padi. She is also andham,   
the Finality, Final Reality. She takes us to Sivam keeping aside all her  
sports of maya. Pada thiram padi... Let us pray to her feet.   
[Remember Muruganar's Padamalai - feet is Padam, Source.]   
Adelor embavai... Let us dance her glories.   
It is an early morning song for Maargazhi month sung by Saint   
Manikkavachagar at Tiruvannamalai. But he glorifies Chidambaram. After all,  
Sivakama Sundari and Unnamalai are one and the same. It is the 14th song of  
Tiruvembavai, in Tiruvachakam. How to pray to her? Kadhar kuzhi aada... the  
earstuds should dance due to our [girls'] stylish walk! Paimpoon   
kalan aada... All the jewels in the neck should dance... Kodahi kuzhal aada..  
Our locks of hair should dance.... Vandin kuzham aada... Seeing this the  
beetles should dance! Thus go the girls, for the early morning bath in  
Tiruvannamlai. Veda porul paadi...   
He is the purport of all Vedas. [See also Sri Arunachala Akshara   
Mana Maalai, Verse 99]. Apporulam maapadi... We are the purport of Vedas, the  
Self. Jothi thiram paadi... here comes Annamalai   
story. He is the Effulgence, which Brahma (buddhi) and Vishnu   
[ego] cannot fathom. Chuzh konrai thaar paadi.... Let us sing his konrai  
garland.   
Thus the saint prays to Siva and Sakti in the same song. After   
all they are concorporate. The Self and the Suddha Maya.   
One can write a book on Tiruvembavai's inner meanings. So many   
layers are there. What I have given is only a word to word meaning.

Tiruvachakam speaks of a Nayaki (the Saint) merging with Nayakan   
(Siva). It is a long journey of Jiva to Godhead, through nayaki nayaka bhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.
