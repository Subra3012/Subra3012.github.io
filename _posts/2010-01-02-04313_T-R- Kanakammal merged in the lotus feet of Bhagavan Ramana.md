T.R Kanakammal, a great devotee of Bhagavan and student of Muruganar Swamigal  
merged into Bhagavan on Ist January,2010, on the Jayanthi day of Bhagavan  
while she went around the shrine of Bhagavan at Sri Ramanashram,  
Tiruvannamalai. Her greatest contribution was her commentaries in Tamil on the  
complete poems of Bhagavan's Nool Thirattu. She has also written a book on  
reminescences of Bhagavan. Like Meera merging with Lord Krishna in Dwaraka  
Temple,yet another miracle of a woman devotee absorbed in Bhagavan Ramana in  
his shrine at Sri Ramanashram.   
Arunachala Siva Arunachala Siva Arunachala Siva........

Dear arcsekar,   
I am very happy and at the same time sad to see your post. I   
was present in the Samadhi Hall, at the material time. Most of   
the people present at the Samadhi Hall, expressed the same feelings   
mixed with happiness and sadness. Liberation on Bhagavan Ramana's Jayanti day  
on 1.1.2010 is a great gift of Bhagavan to   
that totally devoted lady. A gentleman who was sitting near me,   
in the Samadhi Hall said such miracles do happen in the Asramam,   
and only a few people know it and no one records it. Once, I am told that a  
worker, who had climbed up to set right the shamiana   
for a function like Jayanti, fell down from about 30 feet and straight on a  
rock on the ground. With his skull broken, he was rushed to   
Vellore and everyone thought that his life was over. But to the   
surprise of doctors in Vellore, he became alright in about 10 days   
and came back to work in the Asramam.   
Bhagavan Ramana's miracles do not ever stop. It happens even today. My case  
is itself a glorious example but I am not able to   
reveal the full details.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sl.Lakshmi,   
In good and happy times, hardly few think about God or Guru.   
When the life situation becomes utterly unmanageable, with penury,   
diseases, sorrows, one should think of God or Guru. But we do not   
do that. Because, our ego tries to fight these miseries, without   
seeking God or Guru or we become deluded by the events around   
us and do not have mental make up to think of God or Guru. That   
is why, one Azhwar said: Appothaikku, Ippothe solli vaithen Narayana. "I do  
not know whether I can chant your names Narayana, in times of unbearable  
distress, and that is why I am   
chanting your names now!" This is the situation. But we do not   
chant his names ippothe, now itself, as a reserve for appothe, at   
that time of distress. This is the human behaviour for most people.   
When the horses became jackals again at night, the Pandya King   
grew very angry at Saint Manikkavachagar and made him walk on   
the summer sands of Vaigai river, with hot bricks on his head.   
The Saint sang: "Namasivaya, Namasivaya, even if I faint I should   
think and chant your name in subconscious state!"   
How many of us can do this? It is very difficult. On the last day   
of His avatara period, that is on 14th April 1950, at about 8 PM,   
the inmates in the Asrmam suddenly started in chorus, singing: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva.... Bhagavan Ramana raised His   
back from the pillows and looked at them with abundant grace and   
thankfulness. Tears rolled down from His eyes. At 8.47 He left   
His body as a meteor! He is the complete Guru, with no mind/body  
consciousness for 54 years and no vasanas whatsoever.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi and others,   
In today's "The Hindu", there is an obit, informing the merger of   
T.R. Kanakammal at the golden feet of Bhagavan Ramana. This   
has been inserted by her friends and devotees. There is also a   
small photograph above the announcement.   
Arunachala Siva.

Smt. T.R. Kanakamma was a great soul and a true devotee of Bhagavan. Her  
importance also is glorified by her personal receipt of Grace from Bhagavan  
Ramana Maharshi and Kanchi Mahaswamigal.She was taught by Sri Muruganar  
Swamigal and she brought out two volumes of Bhagavan's Vedantic and devotional  
works with meanings as learnt from the great poet-devotee-saint Muruganar.Her  
merging with the Bhagavan in His own abode and while she was at prayer on His  
Jayanthi day are simply miraculous. May She in her exalted status continue to  
bless us all.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Thank you for the information about Smt. Sampooranammal.   
I did not know it so far. There was one Thinnai Swami (Thinnai   
means in Tamil, the raised frontal portion of the house. Once   
when he wanted to take leave of Bhagavan Ramana, Bhagavan   
Ramana said "Iru" Iru means in Tamil "Stay." Thinnai Swami   
took this as a great Upadesa and simply stayed in Tiruvannamalai.   
His wife was with him for some months and she also left T'malai   
to take care of her children in Chennai. This man simply stayed   
in Thinnai and so was called Thinnai Swami! He had no extra   
set of dhotis and shirt. He lived with that single dhoti and   
shirt occasionally taking bath. There was no smell due to these   
old dhoti and shirt! He will take only food that is given by others.   
He would never go to the Temple or the Asramam or for begging.   
He attained merger with Bhagavan many years later on a Maha   
Deepam Day! He was foretelling his departure stating that   
Arunachala and Unnamulai would take him on the Mahadeepam   
Day!   
Arunachala Siva.
