## Ramana's grace

Can we still know Ramana's grace as those people that visited with him at the  
ashram?   
There are so many story's detailing the effect Ramana had on the visitors,  
just by being close to him.   
It maybe a silly question but it has been on my mind.   
Ramana has an effect when I think of him or look at the picture I have, is  
this the same as grace?   
Mostly I just feel love for Ramana but I don't know him, and have only read  
books and seen pictures. Yet I have deep feeling for him, and see his  
greatness.

Dear kde,   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan Ramana says: Om Smaranth bandha naskakaaya Namah: Salutations to One who by contemplating removes the bondage.   
This is also told of Arunachala Hill in the famous poem on Arunachala.   
So Bhagavan Ramana is not different from Arunachala.   
Even today, devotees who visit Asramam get that grace, not   
only in removal of bondage but also in regard to so many little wishes. The  
Old Hall, where Bhagavan Ramana stayed for 22   
years and also the present Samadhi Hall are the most powerful   
places where His power of the Presence are felt, even though,   
the entire Asramam is brimming with that power of grace of   
Bhagavan Ramana. I have myself come out of anxiety neurosis   
after praying to Bhagavan Ramana and visiting Asramam.   
Many devotees by intensely praying to Ramana's photographs   
have also had these benefits. There is no doubt at it. I use   
to have a small bust photograph of Bhagavan Ramana throughout   
day and night and by looking at it, once in a while and I get peace. The  
photographs too emit the power. There is no doubt about it.   
One should have only faith in Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R, thank you for your answer. It makes me happy, and want to  
visit the ashram even more. I have faith in Ramana and if that is all that is  
needed it will be enough.   
"Bhagavan Ramana is not different from Arunachala".   
Do you mean Ramana is an incarnation of Arunachala?

Dear friend,   
Bhagavan Ramana is Arunachala - By this, I only meant both   
are the Self. Otherwise, Bhagavan Ramana is not incarnation   
of Arunachala. He calls Arunachala as His Father, as His lady-   
love, as His Mother etc., in His poems. Of course, Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Sastri his Sri Ramana Gita called Him as reincaranation   
of Skanda, the son of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

My thanks to you both.   
I understand it, grace leads us to Ramana, who is grace in a form and teaching  
that we can understand and benefit from.
