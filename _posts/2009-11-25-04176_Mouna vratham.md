## Sri Soundarya Lahari Saptaham  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 24, 2009, 12:36:54 PM

Sri Soundarya Lahari Saptaham or the Seven days Chanting of   
Sri Soundarya Lahari was started by the Pontiff of Sri Sarada   
Math, Sringeri, a few years back. It is popular in Karnatka   
and Tamil Nadu. From today, that is Kartika Poornima Saptami   
to Kartik Poornima (1st December) the select verse of Sri Soundarya Lahari, a  
Devi Stuti of Sri Sankara, is chanted 24 or 108 times,   
along with full chanting of 100 verses once. This takes about   
45 minutes. The songs are chanted or sung in Sindhu Bhairavi   
Raga. This year the first verse has been selected. Siva Saktya   
yukto....   
Kartik Sashti is Skanda's festival. From Saptami Devi worship   
starts. On Poornima Siva shines in all His glory on the Hill   
of Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Lighting Lamps on Kartika Poornima Evening  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 24, 2009, 12:54:19 PM

Kartik is a month of lighting lamps. In houses, women light   
earthern lamps around sunset and this is popular in South   
India. On the Poornima evening, the earthern and silver lamps   
are lighted after seeing Arunachala Deepam or around that time,   
this year it is around 5.45 PM (IST) on 1st December 2009.   
Once when Seshadri Swamigal was in his body, there was   
one Mudaliar (I forgot his first name), who used to spend   
money on tons of gingley oil, earthern lamps and wicks and   
light earthern lamps in hundreds in Tiruvannamalai. On a   
particular Kartik Poornima evening it was very windy. Seshadri   
Swamigal told Mudaliar with thunderbolt like laughter: "Oh,   
Mudaliar, are you going to light lamps today?"   
It so happened, Mudaliar could not light many lamps that   
evening. The earthern lamps lighted were put off due to   
winds. Seshadri came to Mudaliar and said: O fool! Do not   
try to light lamps aping Arunachala Deepam. Instead, feed   
the poor in hundreds by cutting ash-gourd and preparing Sambhar and good  
rice. Mudaliar prostrated before Swamigal and immediately arranged for  
feeding hundreds of people who came   
for Deepam and Giri Pradakshina. He continued this practice   
till his death.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Mouna vratham  
Author: ramanaduli          Date: November 25, 2009, 12:21:46 PM

What is real mouna vratham. In my experience I can see when I do not talk, the  
mind is speaking so many subjects without connections.   
Someone suggested to keep watching the mind. And be in Mona stage, means  
disolving the mind. I think it is disolving the mind in self is the   
real mouna viratham. That is vichara margam what Bhagavan says. Is it correct?

Abiding as the silent core is mouna vratham.   
But in today's world, not watching TV can also be considered as a vratham.   
The effect can be felt if one practises it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What is mounam is only silence of the mind, when the Heart   
will speak to us. It is not silence in words and actions. Vratham   
is something like a penance. As silentgreen correctly said, the   
Vratham like not watching TV, not going for movies, fasting without   
food for one day or one session -- are all some penances, and will   
confer Chidda suddhi. It is only an effort to arrive at the silence   
of the mind, the true silennce of the immortals.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, and not involved in futile discussion is also mouna.

Mounam or Silence, if truly observed, will definitely help us in staying   
in the Heart. Bhagavan Ramana says that the words are the most outward   
activity, its father is thoughts. Silence is the father of thoughts. So the   
Silence is the grandpa of words, and this is the most powerful sadhana.   
Keeping silent, with thoughts mushrooming around, is not true silence.   
Silence is thoughtless meditation.   
Arunachala Siva.
