## Mouna vratham

What is real mouna vratham. In my experience I can see when I do not talk, the  
mind is speaking so many subjects without connections.   
Someone suggested to keep watching the mind. And be in Mona stage, means  
disolving the mind. I think it is disolving the mind in self is the   
real mouna viratham. That is vichara margam what Bhagavan says. Is it correct?

Abiding as the silent core is mouna vratham.   
But in today's world, not watching TV can also be considered as a vratham.   
The effect can be felt if one practises it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What is mounam is only silence of the mind, when the Heart   
will speak to us. It is not silence in words and actions. Vratham   
is something like a penance. As silentgreen correctly said, the   
Vratham like not watching TV, not going for movies, fasting without   
food for one day or one session -- are all some penances, and will   
confer Chidda suddhi. It is only an effort to arrive at the silence   
of the mind, the true silennce of the immortals.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, and not involved in futile discussion is also mouna.

Mounam or Silence, if truly observed, will definitely help us in staying   
in the Heart. Bhagavan Ramana says that the words are the most outward   
activity, its father is thoughts. Silence is the father of thoughts. So the   
Silence is the grandpa of words, and this is the most powerful sadhana.   
Keeping silent, with thoughts mushrooming around, is not true silence.   
Silence is thoughtless meditation.   
Arunachala Siva.
