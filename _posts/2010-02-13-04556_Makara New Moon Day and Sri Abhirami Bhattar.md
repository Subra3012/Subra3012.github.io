The individual encompasses his own creation with his ego (as âIâ); so does  
the Lord play with the universe. Just as the dreamer is not to be confounded  
with the dream so is the Lord not to be confounded with the creation. Just as  
a man survives his dream, so does the Lord survive the dissolution of His  
creation. Just as you remain ever as pure consciousness apart from the body,  
etc., so is the Lord, unbounded consciousness apart from the universe, etc. Is  
it not after all only a picture drawn by Him on His Self? How can this unique  
creation be apart from Him? There can indeed be nothing but consciousness.  
Tell me of any place where there is no consciousness; there is no place beyond  
consciousness. Or can anyone prove in any manner anything outside  
consciousness? Consciousness is inescapable.   
Moreover, this consciousness is the only existence,covering the whole  
universe, and perfect all through.Just as there cannot be breakers apart from  
the ocean and light without the Sun, so also the universe cannot be conceived  
without consciousness. The Supreme God is thus the embodiment of pure  
Consciousness.   
The universe has thus originated only as an image on the surface of the mirror  
of the Absolute. This conclusion is in harmony with all facts.   
Creation is like a magicianâs trick, and is a city born of divine  
imagination. O Parasurama, you are aware of the mental creations of  
daydreamers which are full of people, life and work, similar to this. There  
are also doubts,tests, discussions and conclusions â all imaginary arising  
in the mind and subsiding there. Just as castles in the air are mental  
figments of men so also is this creation a mental figment of Siva. Siva is  
absolute Awareness, without any form. Sri Tripura is Sakti (energy) and  
Witness of the whole.That Being is perfect all round and remains undivided.   
The world cannot stand investigation because of its changing unreal nature.  
Just as the owl is dazzled and blinded by bright sunlight, so the world  
parades in glory before ignorance and disappears before right analysis.   
[Note: The man sees by sunlight and is helpless in its absence. The owl sees  
in darkness and is blinded in sunlight. Whose sight is the better of the two?  
This cannot be determined satisfactorily so that investigation becomes lame.]   
As long as the ignorance of the self lasts, so long will there be misery.   
The Sun helps all to see, but blinds the owls; water is the abode of fishes,  
but drowns man; fire burns a man, but is food to tittiri (a species of bird);  
fire is ordinarily put out by water, but it flourishes in the middle of the  
ocean at the time of dissolution. Similar discrepancies are evident elsewhere.   
Men and animals engage in activities with their limbs and senses, whereas  
spirits do so with the bodies of others. Instances like these are innumerable.   
Sight is of the eye and cannot be without it.A jaundiced eye sees everything  
yellow and diplopia produces a double image of a single object.   
Abnormal visions are thus the direct result of abnormal eyes. The Karandakas,  
in an Eastern island, are said to see everything red; so also the inhabitants  
of Ramanaka Isle see everything upside down.   
One hears many more strange stories of the kind, all of which are based on  
abnormalities of vision. They can all be remedied by proper treatment. The  
same applies to other senses,including the mind.   
The relation between space and objects and between time and events is  
according to your estimate of them; there is no intrinsic relationship between  
them.   
Just as the mirror remains unaffected by the passage of different images and  
yet continues to reflect as clearly as before, so also the one consciousness  
illumines the waking and dream states which can be verified by proper  
meditation.   
Therefore recognise the fact that the world is simply an image on the mirror  
of consciousness and cultivate the contemplation of âI amâ, abide as pure  
being and thus give up this delusion of the reality of the world.   
True experience of the Self is the unawareness of even âI amâ. Can the  
world persist after such unawareness? Second-hand knowledge is no better than  
the recollection   
of a dream.   
Just as the accession of treasure in a dream is useless, so also is second-  
hand knowledge.   
The whole world is manifested in it like a city in a mirror. Such is that  
transcendental state. On realising it, one becomes immortal; there is no place  
for doubts and uncertainties, as there is none at the sight of a reflection in  
a mirror; there is no more reason for ignorance as at the sight of innumerable  
reflected images; and there will be no more room for desire, because  
transcendence is then experienced.   
Just as a prince labours under a misapprehension that the string of pearls  
still clinging to his neck has been stolen away by another and is not  
persuaded to the contrary by mere words but only believes when he finds it  
around his neck by his own effort, so also, O youth, however clever a man may  
be, he will never know his own self by the mere teaching of others unless he  
realises it for himself. Otherwise he can never realise the Self if his mind  
is turned outward.   
Everybody fails in this investigation however learned and proficient he may  
be, because his mind is not bent inward but restlessly moves outward. As long  
as thoughts crop up, so long has the turning inward of the mind not been  
accomplished. As long as the mind is not inward, so long the Self cannot be  
realised. Turning inward means absence of desire. How can the mind be fixed  
within if desires are not given up?   
You are not the body, nor the senses, nor the mind, because they are all  
transient. The body is composed of food, so how can you be the body?   
Concentration on a particular item is necessary for the perception of external  
things. But since consciousness is the Self and not apart from the mind,  
concentration on it is not necessary for its realisation. It is enough that  
other perceptions (namely,thoughts) should be eliminated from the mind and  
then the Self will be realised.   
Therefore it was also said that the sole necessity for Self-realisation is  
purity of mind. The only impurity of the mind is thought. To make it thought-  
free is to keep it pure.   
The mind is truly abstracted in sleep. But then its light is screened by  
darkness, so how can it manifest its true nature? A mirror covered with tar  
does not reflect   
images, but can it reflect space also? Is it enough, in that case, that images  
are eliminated in order to reveal the space reflected in the mirror? In the  
same manner, the mind is veiled by the darkness of sleep and rendered unfit  
for illumining thoughts. Would such eclipse of the mind reveal the glimmer of  
consciousness?   
Moreover, pursue the analogy of a tarred mirror. The tar may prevent the  
images from being seen, but the quality of the mirror is not affected, for the  
outer coating of tar must be reflected in the interior of the mirror. So also  
the mind, though diverted from dreams and wakefulness, is still in the grip of  
dark sleep and not free from qualities.This is evident by the recollection of  
the dark ignorance of sleep when one wakes.   
Sri Sankara has said in Soundarya Lahari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He  
cannot even stir in Her absence.Siva should not therefore be considered to be  
a mere inexpressible entity depending for His movements upon Maya (like a man  
on his car). Sri Sankara continues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to His  
true being. Therefore a blessed few worship Thee as the endless series of  
waves of bliss, as the underlying basis of all that is, as the Supreme Force,  
maintaining the universe, and as the Consort of Transcendence. Thus the  
identity of Siva and Sakti with each other or with Transcendence is evident.   
When the pictures on a wall are erased, the original wall remains. No other  
work is necessary to restore its original condition.   
Similarly, the mind remains pure when thoughts are eliminated. Therefore the  
unqualified state is restored if the present disturbance is ended.   
Therefore rule out creation as a mere thought or series of thoughts and  
realise the non-dual, residual, pure intelligence as the Self.   
Second-hand knowledge of the Self gathered from books or Gurus can never  
emancipate a man until its truth is rightly investigated and applied to  
himself; direct Realisation alone will do that. Therefore, follow my advice  
and realise yourself, turning the mind inward.   
To imagine that the Self is shackled by mental projections is to imagine that  
the fire reflected in a mirror can burn it. There is absolutely no bondage  
beyond the foolish certainty that you are bound and the difference of entity  
created by mind. Until these two blemishes are washed away by the holy waters  
of investigation into the Self, neither I, nor Brahma the Creator, nor Vishnu,  
nor Siva, nor even Sri Tripura, the Goddess of Wisdom, can help that person to  
be emancipated.

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Final Part  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 08:12:18 PM

In deep sleep and samadhi the existence of âIâ cannot be denied. All admit  
its continued existence in those states also, because of the recollection of  
the experience (in those two states).   
Bhagavan Sri Sankara also says that the Self, namely Chit, is always shining  
as âIâ.   
In Viveka Chudamani it is found, âThat which constantly shines forth as  
âIâ throughout infancy etc., waking state, etc., which are superimposed on  
it....â   
Be not effortless in this direction Yoga Vasishta says: âEven with hands  
clenched and teeth ground,pressing the limbs and forcibly withdrawing the  
senses, the mind must first be brought under control.â So the utmost effort  
must be made.   
Also the breath must forcibly be controlled, if necessary, by means of  
pranayama (regulation of breath). One-pointedness must be gained at all costs.  
How long is effort necessary? Until direct experience is gained.   
Only the natural bliss of the Self prevails at the instant of relief of  
oneâs burden and in deep sleep. This means: As soon as one is relieved of oneâs heavy load, one surely feels refreshed;  
this cannot be denied; but here there are no objects to give pleasure, and how  
could it be felt unless it is from within, i.e., from the Self?   
In deep sleep there is no strain to be removed and yet there is the bliss of  
sleep. This cannot be denied because there is the recollection of the bliss of  
sleep after waking from it. This bliss cannot but be of the Self.

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Part3  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 07:52:40 PM

The difference between dreams and the wakeful state lies in the fact that in  
the waking state the dream is determined to be false, whereas in the dream the  
waking state is not so determined. Therefore the waking state is universally  
taken to be real. But this is wrong. For do you not experience the same extent  
of permanency and purposefulness in dreams as in the wakeful state?   
Wakeful consciousness does not intervene in dreams nor does dream-  
consciousness intervene in the wakeful state, while the two factors â  
enduring nature and purposefulness â are common to both.   
Examine your past dreams and past waking experiences in the light of these  
facts and see for yourself.   
Again, note the appearance of reality in magical phenomena and the seemingly  
purposeful actions of magical creations. Does reality rest on the slender  
basis of such appearances?   
The confusion is due to want of discrimination between the real and the unreal  
among ignorant folk. Ignorantly indeed do they say that the wakeful universe  
is real.   
The existence of Reality is self-evident and does not require other aids to  
reveal it. Unreality is the contrary.   
If you say, however, that a thing is real until and unless its existence is  
contradicted, consider the example of a coil of rope being mistaken for a  
snake. The fancied snake would according to you be real in the interval  
antecedent to correct knowledge, but that is absurd.   
The most important of the qualifications is the desire for emancipation.  
Nothing can be achieved without it. Study of philosophy and discussion on the  
subject with others are thoroughly useless, being no better than the study of  
arts. For the matter of that, one might as well hope for salvation by a study  
of sculpture and the practice of that art. The study of philosophy in the  
absence of a longing for salvation, is like dressing up a corpse.   
The fruit of Self-realisation is the end of all misery here and hereafter and  
absolute fearlessness. That is called Emancipation.   
[Note: There is an end of misery in sleep; but the potentiality of misery is  
not ended. Realisation destroys the cause of misery and sets the man free  
forever.]   
What is perceived in the world as being apart from the Self is also clearly  
seen to be perishable. What is perishable must certainly involve fear of loss.   
What is the use of hundreds of efforts in the absence of a real and unswerving  
desire for emancipation? That is the sole requisite and nothing else.   
The intellect is ordinarily befouled by evil propensities and so nothing good  
flourishes there. Consequently,people are boiled in the seething cauldron of  
births and deaths. Of these evil propensities, the first is want of faith in  
the revelations made by the Guru and in the sastras; the second is addiction  
to desires; and the third is dullness (i.e., inability to understand the  
revealed truth). This is a brief statement of them.   
Of these, want of faith is betrayed by oneâs doubts regarding the truth of  
the statements and by failure to understand them. The doubt arises whether  
there is moksha; and later misunderstanding leads to its denial. These two are  
sure obstacles to any sincere efforts being made for realisation.   
The second propensity, namely desire,prevents the intellect from following the  
right pursuit.For the mind engrossed in desire cannot engage in a spiritual  
pursuit. The abstraction of a lover is well known to all; he can hear or see  
nothing in front of him. Anything said in his hearing is as good as not said.  
Desire must therefore be first overcome before aspiring for spiritual  
attainment. That can be done only by dispassion. This propensity is manifold,  
being in the forms of love, anger,greed, pride, jealousy, etc. The worst of  
them is pursuit of pleasure which, if destroyed, destroys all else. Pleasure  
may be subtle or gross. Neither of these must be indulged in, even in thought.  
As soon as the thought of pleasure arises, it must be dismissed by the  
willpower developed by dispassion.   
There is no accomplishment equal to Self-realisation,which is alone capable of  
ending all misery, because it is the state of eternal Bliss.   
He who is, from his own experience, capable of appreciating the states of  
other Jnanis, including the best among them, is certainly a perfect Sage. He  
who is not influenced by happiness or misery, by pleasure or pain,by desires,  
doubts or fear, is a perfect Sage. He who realises pleasure, pain and every  
other phenomenon to be in and of the Self, is a perfect Sage. He who feels  
himself pervading all â be they ignorant or emancipated â is a perfect  
Sage. He who, knowing the trammels of bondage, does not seek release from them  
and remains in peace, is a perfect Sage.   
An intense devotee, though endowed with only a little discipline of other  
kinds (e.g., dispassion), can readily understand the truth though only  
theoretically, and expound it to others. Such exposition helps him to imbue  
those ideas and so he absorbs the truth. This ultimately leads him to identify  
all individuals with Siva and he is no longer affected by pleasure or pain.  
All-round identification with Siva makes him the best of Jnanis and a  
Jivanmukta (emancipated here and now). Therefore bhakti yoga (the way of  
devotion) is the best of all and excels all else.   
Investigation cuts at the root of ignorance.Dispassion develops investigation.  
Disgust for the pleasures of life generates dispassion towards them.   
Investigation is analysis conducted within oneself, discriminating the non-  
self from the Self, stimulated by a stern, strong and sincere desire to  
realise the Self. Dispassion is non-attachment to surroundings. This results  
if the misery consequent on attachment is kept in mind.   
Fear holds a man possessed of enormous wealth; misery, of a large family; and  
poverty, of insatiable desires.   
The man with no attachments is free from fear; the one with controlled mind is  
free from misery;the Self-realised man is never needy.   
Just as an actor is not really affected by the passions which he displays on  
the stage, so also this Jnani, always aware of his perfection, is not affected  
by the seeming pleasures and pains which he regards as a mere illusion, like  
the horns of a hare.   
The highest Jnani makes no difference between samadhi and worldly  
transactions. He never finds anything apart from the Self and so there is no  
lapse for him.   
The state of the Jnani is said to be identical with that of Siva. There is not  
the least difference between them. Therefore karma cannot besmear a Jnani.

## Final Part - Ellam Ondre - 'All is One' Recommened by Ramana Maharshi  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: April 20, 2010, 12:41:27 PM

Chapter III - GOD   
1\. **Who is God?** God is He who has transcended all that is seen by us. If  
transcending this world, is there no relation between Him and this world? Not  
a particle here is unrelated to Him. Then what is meant by transcending the  
world? The world comprises us and the objects seen by us. In other words, the  
animate and inanimate together form the world. What shall we say of Him who  
created the beings and things? Of these two, we say the conscious beings to be  
superior. **All that we can apprehend is that He belongs to the highest order  
of beings known to us. Our intellect cannot proceed further. Thus, our Creator  
is superior to us; He cannot be apprehended by our intellect;** therefore His  
Name, Transcended Being, "Kadawul," means that He surpasses our intellect.  
Hence His Name is "Kadawul" \- Transcended Being.   
2\. Can God then not be made known to us? Not quite so. In a way, He is known  
to us. This much of His Grace is enough for us. We have no need for all His  
Greatness. He has made known so much of His Greatness as will suffice to  
eradicate our misery. There is no reason for Him to reveal a jot more of His  
Power than is necessary to remedy our defects in the present state. Thus He is  
known according to our needs. Nay, He is in our grasp. However limitless, He  
is within reach of our knowledge to some extent.   
3\. What is it which brings Him within reach of our knowledge? That He is  
known as Being-Consciousness-Bliss.   
Being denotes that which is imperishable, that which exists forever. Should He  
become nonexistent at any time, who is His Destroyer? Who created Him? Since  
the perishable nature of all leads to the inference that they are lorded over  
by One who is imperishable, this immortal Overlord is God. His imperishable  
nature is Being (Sat).   
 **Now, what is Consciousness (Chit)? By Consciousness we mean knowledge.**  
This is absolute Knowledge, and not like our erring intellectual knowledge.  
Irregularity or mistake cannot stain its actions. It is Knowledge, pure and  
simple. Frequently He teaches us saying, "Your knowledge is irregular and  
erring." How orderly are even the insentient objects of His creation! It is  
known to many how an atheist was taught a good lesson when he derided the  
scheme of things saying, "Why did He make the seed so small for the banyan  
tree which is so big?" That an insentient thing is found in good order and  
later becomes useful, implies a conscious agency at work. Can a simple,  
insentient thing do something which is possible for unfailing knowledge only?  
Or, can't it be done by our inadequate knowledge? No, it can never be.  
Therefore God is said to be Consciousness (Chit) also.   
 **Now, what is Bliss? It is the state of being free from desire for anything.  
It is Peace which is ever full.** Were He to desire anything, how could He be  
better than ourselves? How could we gain Bliss from Him? He Himself would  
require another being to fulfil His desires. But who would think Him to be so?  
The state of self-contentment is that of Bliss also. Therefore He is called  
Bliss (Ananda).   
The three-Being, Consciousness and Bliss-are inseparable; otherwise, they  
would become naught individually. Hence, He is known as Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss (Satchitananda). Thus God remains not only transcendent but also falls  
within the reach of our knowledge as Being-Consciousness-Bliss.   
4\. He who has gained the fourth state and sees all as one, only he knows God  
truly as Being-Consciousness-Bliss. Words cannot express nor the ears hear how  
such a one is united with God; it is a matter of realization. But there are  
ways and means for such realization. They can be spoken of, learned and acted  
upon.   
5\. He who can be realized thus, is God. He has no name; we give Him a name.  
He has no form; we give Him a form. Where is the harm in doing so? What name  
is not His, or what form is not His? Where is the sound or form in which He is  
not? Therefore, in the absence of true knowledge of Him you can name Him as  
you please or imagine Him as of any form so to remember Him. Your hope for His  
Grace without any effort on your part is utterly fruitless. Should it be  
possible to have His Grace without any effort on your side, all would be  
alike; there would be no reason for any difference. He has shown us the ways  
and means. Make effort, reach the goal, be happy. Your idleness and  
selfishness make you expect His Grace without your effort. The rule for all is  
for you too. Do not relax your efforts. God can be realized by your effort  
only.   
6\. There is an effort which excels all others. This may, however, appear to  
be less effective than devotion to God with name and form. Nevertheless, this  
is the more efficient. It is simply the love which you extend to all beings,  
whether good or bad. In the absence of such love to all, your devotion to God  
amounts to a mere parody. Of what use are you to God? That you seek fulfilment  
of your desires from God without doing your duty towards the needy in the  
world must be attributed to your selfishness. In God's presence, there is no  
use for such. The workings that take place in His presence are all unselfish.  
Therefore, think that all the Centers are His and He is in all the Centers and  
thus be devoted to Him. God is truly bound by such high devotion.   
7\. As you go on ascribing names and forms to God and showing love to all  
because you have understood all names and forms to be His, your mind will  
gradually mature. Just as the taste improves with the ripening of a fruit, so  
also you will recognize the waxing of good and the waning of evil in you. As  
your mind matures, there will come a time when you should meet your Master.  
This is not to say that you go in search of him or he comes in search of you.  
At the right time the meeting will happen. All are moving in their own ways.  
Your fitness brings you together, makes you trust him, makes him teach you the  
right way, also makes you follow the his instructions. That is the straight  
way to reach God, which is to gain the fourth state. You will follow the way  
and reach your goal which is Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is God.   
8\. The way shown by the Master is final, straight and making for unity. It is  
well-tried, natural, and free from pain. When you are following the way shown  
by the master, doubts will not arise; there will be no fear. Are not fear and  
doubt the characteristics of the ways of darkness? How can they meet you in  
the way of Truth shown by the Master? In this manner, the way will itself  
speak to you and say that it is the right one. In that way, there will be  
nothing more for you to do but to meet your Master and learn from him. That  
way will be familiar to you, as the Master and God have made it so. Before  
you, he had treaded the way. He has shown you the way and you are following  
him. To how many will you show the same way? And how many more will follow the  
same way later? Obviously fear and doubt have no place in the way of truth.  
When once you have taken a step forward you will step back. The master's help  
is only for the first step forward. You need not do anything for your master  
in order to have the way shown to you. Know him to be the messenger of God  
sent down to disclose the way to the fit who have become ripe by their own  
efforts in either or both the directions mentioned earlier. It is God who  
sends this godly messenger just when you are ripe.   
9\. Practice with faith in the period of ignorance is called Bhakti; the same,  
with knowledge, is called Jnana. Of the two divisions of Bhakti, the one is  
devotion to God with name and form, and the other is karma which is love for  
all. Of the two divisions of Jnana, the practice of the true way shown by the  
Master is called yoga and the resulting state is called Jnana. It is natural  
for all to believe in something which is not seen and then to find it. Those  
who do not believe can never find. Therefore, the believers will gain  
something sometime or other and the unbelievers never gain anything. You can  
believe even for the simple reason that faith in God is not harmful. Thereby  
you can share the good effects. **This world is meant only for creating faith  
in you. This is the purpose of creation. Have faith and you can reach God.**   
10\. Though you may not believe all that is said of God, believe at least  
"There is God." This seed is very potent in its growth. It is so mighty as to  
negate all else and fill all by itself. It is so almighty that you will not  
see anything besides God, not even yourself. Truly, God is all.   
 **Chapter IV - Peace**   
1\. **What is peace? Although the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,  
does he have any cares concerning it? His mind is tranquil and refreshed.**  
Should his mind be in the same degree calm and refreshed even when he is face  
to face with the world and is active therein, then there is peace.   
2\. Can the mind remain so even when the world confronts us? It depends upon  
our estimate of the world. The mind is more excited when one's own property is  
plundered than when another's property is similarly plundered. Of one's own  
things, the loss of one thing causes greater concern than those of another.  
Why? Because our estimate of the things is the cause of the degree of the  
delight or anxiety concerning them. Therefore, should one learn to regard all  
equally, the mind will be extremely peaceful. Or should all things be  
considered as our own and highly prized, then too there is no cause for pain.  
Why? What will a man regret? **The mind which knows that universal concern is  
beyond its capacity, must needs become tranquil. Also when one feels that one  
has no claim on anything or that everything is perishable, the mind will  
remain cool.** Thus there will be lasting peace if one looks on all as of the  
same value. Peace is dependent upon one's intellectual appraisals.   
 _3\. I shall now illustrate this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is  
happy or troubled according to his opinion of the things seen in the dream.  
But on waking, his mind remains unaffected by all the happenings in the dream;  
it remains the same. Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to value all  
the matters of the dream equally. He is not sorry for the cessation of the  
dream. Why? He is convinced that the dream is not everlasting and must end on  
waking. In the same manner, should a man be convinced that he cannot but wake  
up sometime from the long dream of the world, his mind will be unchanging. It  
is the state of freshness. This is the state of Peace._   
4\. This is not to say that his relation with the world will cease. Now only  
peace and freshness of the mind are his. His actions cannot but vary according  
to circumstances. **The only change in him after the mind has become peaceful  
is this: his mind has known the truth and become unattached; therefore, it  
rests in peace. His actions though changeful will always be impartial.** But  
the actions of others are changing and cannot be impartial. Thus, the coolness  
of the mind produces enormous good not only to himself but also to the world  
at large. Peace shows the way to right conduct.   
5\. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his hand. Can there be any hostility  
between the light and the ups and downs on the way? There cannot be. But light  
and darkness cannot be together. The light chases away darkness, it discloses  
the ups and downs on the way and makes the man walk carefully, whether he  
moves up, down, or sideways. It removes the cause of vain complaints, such as,  
"That snag hurt my foot" or "This hollow made me slip." Similarly, after peace  
is gained, the state of peace makes the man neither hate nor antagonize the  
world. Rather it dispels the darkness which conceals from our view the true  
nature of the world and its snags. In the absence of the light of Peace which  
enables people to adjust themselves to varying circumstances, they condemn the  
world as full of misery, as they would complain of the snags on the road.  
**Therefore a man who has gained the utmost peace after knowing the whole  
world as a complicated dream, should not be considered either unrelated to the  
world or unconcerned with its activities; he alone stands in effective concord  
with it; only he is competent to be a man of action. Thus Peace is that which  
regulates one 's duties.**   
6\. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world lies in  
rectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of  
reformation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to  
possess it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To  
guide the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one's eyesight  
must itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has  
already discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the world  
and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can anyone be  
so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls? So also for  
the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world and help the  
people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the mind and body the  
sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the world, just as the  
life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass over the corpse it  
has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from work or trouble. Only  
truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolness.   
7\. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But in effect, it  
beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After all, success  
depends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple over, the  
incident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or it will  
leave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spiritual  
matters. **True happiness in the world is his, and that happiness comes out of  
release from bondage. Peace means doing good to any one in any manner.**   
8\. The obstacles to peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When  
they confront us we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of the  
mind distant from even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushed, it  
will lose its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be useful to  
you, nor can it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that your  
mind is more delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful mind, all  
your duties to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Let it  
release the same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are  
contained in Peace.   
9\. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the flower of your mind.  
Let the children of the mental modes watch this worship. Gradually they will  
learn to cast away their childish pranks and desire to delight like yourself.  
As they watch your Peace, they will themselves recoil from their vagaries.  
Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away by the vagaries of the mind.  
On the contrary, they should become peaceful by your peace. All must get  
peace.   
10\. I shall finish in one word: **The essence of all the Vedas is "Peace."**

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Final Part  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 08:12:18 PM  
---  
In deep sleep and samadhi the existence of âIâ cannot be denied. All admit  
its continued existence in those states also, because of the recollection of  
the experience (in those two states).   
Bhagavan Sri Sankara also says that the Self, namely Chit, is always shining  
as âIâ.   
In Viveka Chudamani it is found, âThat which constantly shines forth as  
âIâ throughout infancy etc., waking state, etc., which are superimposed on  
it....â   
Be not effortless in this direction Yoga Vasishta says: âEven with hands  
clenched and teeth ground,pressing the limbs and forcibly withdrawing the  
senses, the mind must first be brought under control.â So the utmost effort  
must be made.   
Also the breath must forcibly be controlled, if necessary, by means of  
pranayama (regulation of breath). One-pointedness must be gained at all costs.  
How long is effort necessary? Until direct experience is gained.   
Only the natural bliss of the Self prevails at the instant of relief of  
oneâs burden and in deep sleep. This means: As soon as one is relieved of oneâs heavy load, one surely feels refreshed;  
this cannot be denied; but here there are no objects to give pleasure, and how  
could it be felt unless it is from within, i.e., from the Self?   
In deep sleep there is no strain to be removed and yet there is the bliss of  
sleep. This cannot be denied because there is the recollection of the bliss of  
sleep after waking from it. This bliss cannot but be of the Self.   
 **Source** : TRIPURA RAHASYA OR THE MYSTERY BEYOND THE TRINITY Translated by  
SWAMI SRI RAMANANANDA SARASWATHI (Munagala S. Venkataramaiah)   
Tripura Rahasya is an ancient prime text on Advaita in Sanskrit and was highly  
commended by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi for study by seekers. There was no  
English translation of this scripture until the present one was made by  
Munagala Venkataramiah (Swami Ramanananda Saraswathi) in 1938.

## Makara New Moon Day and Sri Abhirami Bhattar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 13, 2010, 12:27:19 PM  
---  
On one Makara New Moon Day, the Goddess Abhirami in Tirukadaiyur,   
near Mayiladuthurai, in Thanjavur District, caused a miracle for the   
sake of her devotee/temple-priest. The priest's real name is not   
known but he is called Sri Abhirami Bhattar only. This day is celebrated  
every year on the Makara New Moon Day in the temple.   
This year, since Makara New Moon Day had a solar eclipse, the   
festival has been postponed to today, the Kumbha New Moon Day.   
During Sri Bhattar's time when he was the temple priest in Goddess Abhirami  
Temple, Serfoji Maharaja was ruling that place from   
Thanjavur as his capital. Serfoji Maharaja's date is said to be   
1720 AD and 1750 AD. He was the descendent of Maharashtrian   
King, Sivaji.   
Sri Bhattar was practising Siva-raja-yoga and was meditating on   
Goddess Abhirami in his Sahasrara. He soon developed fits of   
ecstasy and bliss and this became almost permanent with him.   
Due to this, the temple pujas and abulations and adornments got   
dislocated or were not properly done. Knowing his high state   
of bliss, some priests assisted him in the work, with due respect   
to Sri Bhattar. But some others were jealous of him and they   
wanted to go and inform King Serfoji. Accordingly, Serfoji was   
informed of this priests 'misdeeds'. They added colour to the scandal telling  
that Sri Bhattar has been in the habit of taking   
liquor and prattling something always and he is not really a   
man of great respect. King Serfoji said: I am coming to Poompuhar ( a sea  
coast near Mayiladuthruai) for this Makara New Moon Day for sea-bath and  
praying to the goddess. At that time, I shall verify the disputes.   
On the morning of New Moon Day, the King went to the sea, had his   
bath and came to the temple with his close associates. Sri   
Bhattar was sitting near a pillar, in a state of ecstasy visioning   
the form of Abhirami, in all her glory. While the priests told the   
king that he was so and so, the King came near him. Sri Bhattar did not even  
stand up and do namaskarams. The king grew angry   
and asked Sri Bhattar: What day is today? Sri Bhattar simply   
said as per his vision of Light of Goddess: Today is Full Moon Day!   
The king said: Alright, you have to show me the full moon this evening. I  
shall see it myself. He ordered the army men to make a tall pillar with 100  
pots tied in a row in a rope and on top of it,   
Sri Bhattar was made to stand. The King said: There is still   
4 Nazhigai time (96 minutes) for the full moon to appear, if it is so. We  
shall arrange to cut one pot every minute. If the moon does not appear, the  
last pot will also be snapped and you have to fall on the huge fire pit and  
die with burns.   
Accordingly, it was arranged. Sri Bhattar knew that his only support is  
Goddess and no one else. He was not afraid. He started singing the famous  
Sri Abhirami Andati (100 songs) in all devotion with tearful eyes. He first  
prayed to KaLLa VaraNa PiLLaiyar, the Ganesa who came as an elephant.  
(Details of this story later....). He was singing melodious heart-melting  
songs on the Mother. The pots were snapped one by one. As he came to the  
song no. 72, the full moon appeared in all its glory. How? The Mother  
appeared on the horizon first and she threw her ear stud (thadangam) on the  
sky and it became a bright full moon.   
I am praying to you to vanquish my deficiency.   
If I take birth again, it is your deficiency and not mine.   
In the large sky, like the thin lightning glowing is your slender   
 waist.   
To make good the deficiency, I pray to you, the bright lotus,   
 on the head of my Lord Siva. (Song No. 72).   
The king and others became dumbfounded and speechless, as they saw the bright  
full moon, on that new moon evening.   
Sri Bhattar was immediately released and the king prostrated to him and  
ordered for huge sums to be given to him (for his livelihood) and relieved of  
the routine temple duties, to pursue his raja yoga sadhana.   
*   
This Sri Abhirami Andati (it is mukta pada sadakam, with the last   
word of the previous work is used as a starting word of the next   
verse. Like Sri Arunachala Padigam of Bhagavan Ramana.   
He also composed two other poems titled Sri Abhirami Ammai Padigam and Sri  
Tirukadaiyur Padigam, each with 10 verses.   
All these are chanted on Fridays in the houses in Tamil Nadu.   
*   
Incidentally, Tirukadaiyur is the place, where Siva kicked Yama to go away to  
enable Sage Markandeya, live for ever, without ageing   
beyond 16 years.   
Even today, elderly couples on their 60th birthday, go to this   
temple, to offer special prayers and pujas for healthy life.   
The temple town has grown in recent times, with boarding and   
lodging facilities. The temple can be reached by car or state-run bus   
from Mayiladuthurai. The distance is about 20 KMs.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Bhagavan is also shiva who kicked yama with the atma jnanam and showed us how  
to live ageless. Shiva did this thruvilaiyadal in thrukkadavur whereas   
Bhagavan did in Thruvannamalai. KALANAI JANATHAL UDHAITHAVAR.

## Re:[2] Makara New Moon Day and Sri Abhirami Bhattar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 03, 2010, 05:11:22 AM

Dear ramanaduli,   
I am happy you have written about this. This made me to see   
whether Bhagavan Ramana has written anything about Markandeya   
who conquered death in Tiru Kadaiyur. Yes. He has written! In   
Sri Ramana Puranam, (which was written by Muruganar but the last   
three hundred or so lines were completed by Bhagavan Himself),   
Bhagavan says in Line 493-500:-   
By meditating upon the twin feet   
of "the Lord who knows what is written"**,   
he who destroys and reduces to nothing   
the burdent of fate, written upon the heads   
of the most excellent of his devotees,   
the brahmachari Markandeay overcame,   
through the intensity of his love   
for the one who ordained his destiny   
the fate that decreed   
that he should die   
as it had been ordained   
You are the exultation of those fierce warriors (of Jnana)   
who, through a love like that of Markandeya,   
exert themselves unrelentingly,   
through the supreme strength of grace,   
free of forgetfulness in the heart   
so that they triumph over fate   
and are no longer tormented by it.   
(** "The Lord who knows what is written" refers to Siva.   
It is He who writes the destiny on our heads and also knows   
fully about it. In Tamil, one of Siva's names is Ezhuttharium   
Peruman, who knows 'the letters', i.e letters of destiny written   
on our heads! In Tiruvottiyur, Siva is called Ezhuttharium Peruman.   
It is here, when Ganapati Muni was having unbearable pain on   
his skull, due to mantra-siddhi, Bhagavan Ramana went skyward   
to go that Ganapati temple, and pressed His palm on Muni's   
head to quell the burning pain.)   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[3] Makara New Moon Day and Sri Abhirami Bhattar

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the information of Thruvottiyur shiva. My friends and me went there  
after karthigai. From the next day onwards the Mulavar Adipureeswar will be  
kept without   
silver kavacham and being offered only punugu. That time I had darshan of  
Ezhuthariyum peruman but the archagar did not tell any thing about this  
importance.   
If we have a good luck we may come across a good informative pujari who would  
tell the importance of the murthi and sthalam. Most of the places they are  
keen on the dakshina. Anyway once again I thank you for this information. This  
is the reason we indians do namaskarams to God so that our destiny could be  
wipped out by   
lord. Brahma is writing our destiny according to our karmas but it can be  
wipped out by doing namaskarams to Shiva. Even Lord nataraja also shows His  
feet by pointing through His left hand means if we come to His feet His right  
hand will bless us. That is saranagathi.

## Makara New Moon Day and Sri Abhirami Bhattar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 13, 2010, 12:27:19 PM

On one Makara New Moon Day, the Goddess Abhirami in Tirukadaiyur,   
near Mayiladuthurai, in Thanjavur District, caused a miracle for the   
sake of her devotee/temple-priest. The priest's real name is not   
known but he is called Sri Abhirami Bhattar only. This day is celebrated  
every year on the Makara New Moon Day in the temple.   
This year, since Makara New Moon Day had a solar eclipse, the   
festival has been postponed to today, the Kumbha New Moon Day.   
During Sri Bhattar's time when he was the temple priest in Goddess Abhirami  
Temple, Serfoji Maharaja was ruling that place from   
Thanjavur as his capital. Serfoji Maharaja's date is said to be   
1720 AD and 1750 AD. He was the descendent of Maharashtrian   
King, Sivaji.   
Sri Bhattar was practising Siva-raja-yoga and was meditating on   
Goddess Abhirami in his Sahasrara. He soon developed fits of   
ecstasy and bliss and this became almost permanent with him.   
Due to this, the temple pujas and abulations and adornments got   
dislocated or were not properly done. Knowing his high state   
of bliss, some priests assisted him in the work, with due respect   
to Sri Bhattar. But some others were jealous of him and they   
wanted to go and inform King Serfoji. Accordingly, Serfoji was   
informed of this priests 'misdeeds'. They added colour to the scandal telling  
that Sri Bhattar has been in the habit of taking   
liquor and prattling something always and he is not really a   
man of great respect. King Serfoji said: I am coming to Poompuhar ( a sea  
coast near Mayiladuthruai) for this Makara New Moon Day for sea-bath and  
praying to the goddess. At that time, I shall verify the disputes.   
On the morning of New Moon Day, the King went to the sea, had his   
bath and came to the temple with his close associates. Sri   
Bhattar was sitting near a pillar, in a state of ecstasy visioning   
the form of Abhirami, in all her glory. While the priests told the   
king that he was so and so, the King came near him. Sri Bhattar did not even  
stand up and do namaskarams. The king grew angry   
and asked Sri Bhattar: What day is today? Sri Bhattar simply   
said as per his vision of Light of Goddess: Today is Full Moon Day!   
The king said: Alright, you have to show me the full moon this evening. I  
shall see it myself. He ordered the army men to make a tall pillar with 100  
pots tied in a row in a rope and on top of it,   
Sri Bhattar was made to stand. The King said: There is still   
4 Nazhigai time (96 minutes) for the full moon to appear, if it is so. We  
shall arrange to cut one pot every minute. If the moon does not appear, the  
last pot will also be snapped and you have to fall on the huge fire pit and  
die with burns.   
Accordingly, it was arranged. Sri Bhattar knew that his only support is  
Goddess and no one else. He was not afraid. He started singing the famous  
Sri Abhirami Andati (100 songs) in all devotion with tearful eyes. He first  
prayed to KaLLa VaraNa PiLLaiyar, the Ganesa who came as an elephant.  
(Details of this story later....). He was singing melodious heart-melting  
songs on the Mother. The pots were snapped one by one. As he came to the  
song no. 72, the full moon appeared in all its glory. How? The Mother  
appeared on the horizon first and she threw her ear stud (thadangam) on the  
sky and it became a bright full moon.   
I am praying to you to vanquish my deficiency.   
If I take birth again, it is your deficiency and not mine.   
In the large sky, like the thin lightning glowing is your slender   
 waist.   
To make good the deficiency, I pray to you, the bright lotus,   
 on the head of my Lord Siva. (Song No. 72).   
The king and others became dumbfounded and speechless, as they saw the bright  
full moon, on that new moon evening.   
Sri Bhattar was immediately released and the king prostrated to him and  
ordered for huge sums to be given to him (for his livelihood) and relieved of  
the routine temple duties, to pursue his raja yoga sadhana.   
*   
This Sri Abhirami Andati (it is mukta pada sadakam, with the last   
word of the previous work is used as a starting word of the next   
verse. Like Sri Arunachala Padigam of Bhagavan Ramana.   
He also composed two other poems titled Sri Abhirami Ammai Padigam and Sri  
Tirukadaiyur Padigam, each with 10 verses.   
All these are chanted on Fridays in the houses in Tamil Nadu.   
*   
Incidentally, Tirukadaiyur is the place, where Siva kicked Yama to go away to  
enable Sage Markandeya, live for ever, without ageing   
beyond 16 years.   
Even today, elderly couples on their 60th birthday, go to this   
temple, to offer special prayers and pujas for healthy life.   
The temple town has grown in recent times, with boarding and   
lodging facilities. The temple can be reached by car or state-run bus   
from Mayiladuthurai. The distance is about 20 KMs.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Bhagavan is also shiva who kicked yama with the atma jnanam and showed us how  
to live ageless. Shiva did this thruvilaiyadal in thrukkadavur whereas   
Bhagavan did in Thruvannamalai. KALANAI JANATHAL UDHAITHAVAR.

Dear ramanaduli,   
I am happy you have written about this. This made me to see   
whether Bhagavan Ramana has written anything about Markandeya   
who conquered death in Tiru Kadaiyur. Yes. He has written! In   
Sri Ramana Puranam, (which was written by Muruganar but the last   
three hundred or so lines were completed by Bhagavan Himself),   
Bhagavan says in Line 493-500:-   
By meditating upon the twin feet   
of "the Lord who knows what is written"**,   
he who destroys and reduces to nothing   
the burdent of fate, written upon the heads   
of the most excellent of his devotees,   
the brahmachari Markandeay overcame,   
through the intensity of his love   
for the one who ordained his destiny   
the fate that decreed   
that he should die   
as it had been ordained   
You are the exultation of those fierce warriors (of Jnana)   
who, through a love like that of Markandeya,   
exert themselves unrelentingly,   
through the supreme strength of grace,   
free of forgetfulness in the heart   
so that they triumph over fate   
and are no longer tormented by it.   
(** "The Lord who knows what is written" refers to Siva.   
It is He who writes the destiny on our heads and also knows   
fully about it. In Tamil, one of Siva's names is Ezhuttharium   
Peruman, who knows 'the letters', i.e letters of destiny written   
on our heads! In Tiruvottiyur, Siva is called Ezhuttharium Peruman.   
It is here, when Ganapati Muni was having unbearable pain on   
his skull, due to mantra-siddhi, Bhagavan Ramana went skyward   
to go that Ganapati temple, and pressed His palm on Muni's   
head to quell the burning pain.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the information of Thruvottiyur shiva. My friends and me went there  
after karthigai. From the next day onwards the Mulavar Adipureeswar will be  
kept without   
silver kavacham and being offered only punugu. That time I had darshan of  
Ezhuthariyum peruman but the archagar did not tell any thing about this  
importance.   
If we have a good luck we may come across a good informative pujari who would  
tell the importance of the murthi and sthalam. Most of the places they are  
keen on the dakshina. Anyway once again I thank you for this information. This  
is the reason we indians do namaskarams to God so that our destiny could be  
wipped out by   
lord. Brahma is writing our destiny according to our karmas but it can be  
wipped out by doing namaskarams to Shiva. Even Lord nataraja also shows His  
feet by pointing through His left hand means if we come to His feet His right  
hand will bless us. That is saranagathi.   
Ramanaduli
