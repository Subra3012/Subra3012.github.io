Dzogchen sky gazing meditation: basic steps   
\- Look outward at the sky  observe it and inquire about it.   
\- Recognize it is vast beyond concept.   
\- As mind observes the sky, look inward at mind  observe and inquire about  
it.   
\- Realize it is vast beyond concept.   
\- With the understanding that both mind and universe are inconceivably  
boundless entities,   
allow their space to begin to merge. Be one with the experience.   
\- Rest in this natural, pristine awareness.

Looking at the space or sky, helps one to understand the formless Being.  
Looking at   
the earth, helps one to understand the formful Being. But whatever the means,   
the bird in the sky has no rest excepting at the ground.   
Arunachala Siva.

The Upanishad speaks of two birds, one representing jivatman and the other  
Paramatman: Two birds were sitting on the branch of a tree. One of them was busy eating  
the fruits - bitter fruits of life. The other bird was calm, eating nothing.  
Both of them were friends and looked alike. Both of them clasped the branch of  
the tree. Yet their nature was different. One of them, the jivatman was busy  
tasting the bitter and sometimes the sweet fruits of life. The Paramatman, the  
other bird, sitting higher is calm in its resplendent glorious Self. Swamiji  
says, gradually the busy bird started hopping towards the calm, serene,  
majestic bird. And one day it had disappeared into the other. That is, the  
jivatman gradually became nearer and nearer the Paramatman. They become one.   
This is brahmajnana about which Vedanta tells us again and again through  
various imageries. We must not forget that the jivatman is essentially the  
same as paramatman.   
\- _Swami Vivekananda_
