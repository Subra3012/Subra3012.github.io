This is Hari posting on behalf of my father Mr Subramanian.   
He is doing well and still based in Bangalore.   
He has not been using his computer in recent months preferring to use his  
phone instead and does not type very often on it.   
He still actively reads, views and listens to Arunachala Ramana related  
content on his mobile but does not type.   
I have conveyed your thoughts and wishes to him and he is deeply grateful and  
thankful for your kind wishes.   
He is hoping to resume participating on this forum actively in a few weeks.

Thanks Hari for the update. Glad to note that your father Sri Subramaniam is  
fine and taking rest being away from the Computer. This was a big relief for  
us as we were all worried that suddenly why he stopped posting. Convey our  
Pranams to him. Hope to see him back soon. Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanayana
