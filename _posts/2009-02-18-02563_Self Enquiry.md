## Arunachala, the greatest trickster  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 18, 2009, 10:26:24 AM

There are thousands of stray verses in Tamil, which were sung   
extempore by various great poets during the past 18 centuries.   
There are a few compilations by Tamil scholars from 19th century   
giving as many of them as possible, with possible mentions about the   
poets. One Kalamegam is a great poet, who lived in Srirangam, in   
Tamil Nadu. He was a Saivite but had no disrespect for Vishnu and he treated  
them as one. He was eking his livelihood as a cook in   
Srirangam temple. One day, when he went to Arunachala, he sang a song in the  
shrine of Arunachaleswara, calling Him a great trickster.   
He asks in the poem: O Arunachala! A portion of cooked human flesh is in the pot.   
Another portion is on your leaf. A few bits are still there in the spadle.  
How come the boy, came in fully and alive, when you   
called him? What a great trickster are you!   
The allusion is to the story of Siruthondar, one of the 63 Siva Saints. Siva  
went to him as an old brahmin ascetic and asked for cooked human flesh. He  
styled himself as Kabaliga and wanted human meat. Siruthondar cut his son and  
his faithful wife cooked it and served Siva. When Siva called for his son, O  
Seerala! (it is his name), the boy came running from the backyard!   
There are hundreds of such verses. But only some of them are translatable,  
because in many verses, there are pun on the same word in Tamil. I shall try  
to post some.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Self Enquiry

Sometimes I feel I should sit and spend long time in Self-Enquiry and for me  
my mind is most quiet only at the night time. I have a desire to spend the  
entire night in Self Enquiry.   
I have some questions: Should I continue the enquiry in spite of restlessness,  
sleep? I know it is going to be a solid effort for beginners in deep and long  
meditation. One had I feel I should try and conquer all obstacles and continue  
and at the same time there is another thought to not strain oneself and  
continue.   
Has Bhagwan told some thing in such context?   
SatGuru Paahi Paahi

Dear Sambu,   
Bhagwans teaching will some how answer any question. Basically what I  
understand through Bhagwans answer is to go ahead with meditation and let what  
ever happen, happen, if I fall asleep, my mind would continue with Self  
Enquiry as soon as I wake up. It should also mean that as long as I am aware  
about my state, i.e. when I am sleepy, I need to put a check there and just  
turn my attention back to Self Enquiry.   
At the moment when we try to turn the attention back to Self Enquiry, we will  
certainly face a lot of hurdles, the body will be demanding to go flat and  
sleep. Probably I need to try once and see what happens.   
Food regulation and minimal work is something I need to work out.   
Prostrations to Bhagwan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Bhagavan Ramana has also said that for beginners, a specific allotted   
time for meditation/self enquiry, would be ideal. In due course, one   
can increase this time, depending upon his other duties. In due course, it  
will be continuing meditation, like the montone of thambur in Karnatic music.  
It will be there, amongst all the din and sound.   
As regards sleep, as Munagala mentioned, you can do meditation/   
self enquiry, till you actually fall asleep. And start again, when you wake  
up. Reducing the sleeping hours is also recommended, if you can go with  
lesser hours of sleep, subject to your age, health and daily work.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian,   
By the grace of Bhagwan, I will initially start meditating for fixed period of  
time and also work out on my food and sleep. I can only writ about it further  
after few days of actually doing meditation.

Tamas guna is dominant at night.   
Tamasic dullness is easily mistaken as Sattvic quietness.   
So we have to check our mental mood carefully,   
whether it is quietness or dullness.   
Generally speaking, it is good to meditate in the morning and the evening   
when Sattva is dominant, in my opinion.

Dear Ganesh b01,   
What happened to you? Why did you not write anything after February 2009?   
Arunachala Siva.
