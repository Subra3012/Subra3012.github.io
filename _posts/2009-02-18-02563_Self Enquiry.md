## Self Enquiry

Sometimes I feel I should sit and spend long time in Self-Enquiry and for me  
my mind is most quiet only at the night time. I have a desire to spend the  
entire night in Self Enquiry.   
I have some questions: Should I continue the enquiry in spite of restlessness,  
sleep? I know it is going to be a solid effort for beginners in deep and long  
meditation. One had I feel I should try and conquer all obstacles and continue  
and at the same time there is another thought to not strain oneself and  
continue.   
Has Bhagwan told some thing in such context?   
SatGuru Paahi Paahi

Dear Sambu,   
Bhagwans teaching will some how answer any question. Basically what I  
understand through Bhagwans answer is to go ahead with meditation and let what  
ever happen, happen, if I fall asleep, my mind would continue with Self  
Enquiry as soon as I wake up. It should also mean that as long as I am aware  
about my state, i.e. when I am sleepy, I need to put a check there and just  
turn my attention back to Self Enquiry.   
At the moment when we try to turn the attention back to Self Enquiry, we will  
certainly face a lot of hurdles, the body will be demanding to go flat and  
sleep. Probably I need to try once and see what happens.   
Food regulation and minimal work is something I need to work out.   
Prostrations to Bhagwan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Bhagavan Ramana has also said that for beginners, a specific allotted   
time for meditation/self enquiry, would be ideal. In due course, one   
can increase this time, depending upon his other duties. In due course, it  
will be continuing meditation, like the montone of thambur in Karnatic music.  
It will be there, amongst all the din and sound.   
As regards sleep, as Munagala mentioned, you can do meditation/   
self enquiry, till you actually fall asleep. And start again, when you wake  
up. Reducing the sleeping hours is also recommended, if you can go with  
lesser hours of sleep, subject to your age, health and daily work.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian,   
By the grace of Bhagwan, I will initially start meditating for fixed period of  
time and also work out on my food and sleep. I can only writ about it further  
after few days of actually doing meditation.

Tamas guna is dominant at night.   
Tamasic dullness is easily mistaken as Sattvic quietness.   
So we have to check our mental mood carefully,   
whether it is quietness or dullness.   
Generally speaking, it is good to meditate in the morning and the evening   
when Sattva is dominant, in my opinion.

Dear Ganesh b01,   
What happened to you? Why did you not write anything after February 2009?   
Arunachala Siva.
