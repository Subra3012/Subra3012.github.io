Bodhidharma sat facing the stone wall. The Second Patriarch of Chinese Câhan  
(Zen), Suika, stood long in the thick snow. Finally, he severed his own arm  
and presented it to Bodhidharma. He said, âYour student cannot pacify his  
mind. You, the First Patriarch, please, give me peace of mind!â The First  
Patriarch replied, _**âBring that mind, I will calm it down!â**_ The  
Second Patriarch said, âI search for it everywhere, but I cannot find it!â  
Bodhidharma replied, _**âI have already pacified it for you!â**_

One day Chuang Tzu and a friend were walking by a river.   
"Look at the fish swimming about," said Chuang Tzu, "They are really enjoying  
themselves."   
"You are not a fish," replied the friend, "So you can't truly know that they  
are enjoying themselves."   
 _ **" You are not me," **_said Chuang Tzu. _**" So how do you know that I do  
not know that the fish are enjoying themselves?"**_

The Zen Master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living pure life. A  
beautiful girl whose parents owned a food store   
lived near him. Suddenly without warning, her parents discovered that the  
beautiful girl was pregnant. This made them very angry.   
The girl would not confess who the father was, but, after much harassment, at  
last named Hakuin!   
The enraged parents went to the Master. 'Is that so?' was all he would say.   
After the child was born, it was brought to Hakuin. By the time, he had lost  
his reputation, which did not trouble him at all, but he took   
very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors, and  
everything else, the little one needed.   
A year later, the girl- mother could stand it no longer. She told her parents  
the truth -- that the real father of the child was a   
young man who worked in the fish market.   
The parents of the girl at once went to the Master, to ask his forgiveness,   
to apologize at length and to get the child back again.   
Hakuin was willing. In yielding he child, all he said, was, "Is that so?'   
Arunachala Siva.

Our HOPES should be like Hair & Nails. No matter how many times they get cut,  
they never stop growing.

_**" Donât think that only sitting with the eyes closed is practice. If you  
do think this way, then quickly change your thinking. Steady practice is  
keeping mindful in every posture, whether sitting, walking, standing or lying  
down. When coming out of sitting, donât think that youâre coming out of  
meditation, but that you are only changing postures. If you reflect in this  
way, you will have peace. Wherever you are, you will have this attitude of  
practice with you constantly. You will have a steady awareness within  
yourself."**_

_ **" It is extremely hard to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, even  
for a moment, let alone to self-liberate a single thought or emotion as it  
rises. We often assume that simply because we understand something  
intellectually, - or think we do - we have actually realised it. This is a  
great delusion. It requires the maturity that only years of listening,  
contemplation, reflection, meditation, and sustained practice can ripen."**_

A wise old Zen master, very near death, lay quietly on his mat with his eyes  
closed, all his disciples gathered around. Kneeling closest to him was his  
number one disciple, a longtime practitioner who would succeed the old man as  
head of the monastery. At one point the old master opened his eyes, and  
lovingly gazed at each and every one of his disciples assembled in the crowded  
room. Finally his glance rested on his successor, and he managed to speak his  
last words to the man: ?Ah, my son, you have a very thorough knowledge of the  
teachings and scriptures, and you have shown great discipline in keeping the  
precepts. Your behavior has, in fact, been flawless. Yet there is one more  
thing remaining to be cleared up: you still reek and stink of ?Zen?!?
