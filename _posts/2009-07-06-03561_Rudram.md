Dear I,   
Depending upon the area in which you stay in Bangalore,   
you may go to one of the following centres: 1. Sri Sringeri Sarada Temple, Shankarapuram. You have   
to approach one of the Purohits there and fix a programme   
of learning. There is a Vedapatasala, but you cannot join   
there, because they teach there all the Vedas, and only very young brahmin  
boys who have completed their sacred thread ceremony, can join there.  
Purohits also will not agree quite   
easily and they will ask for your background, including your   
caste and whether you are doing Gayatri sandhya etc., Be   
truthful and tell them the correct information.   
2. Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Math, 15th cross, Malleswaram. The   
same situation will prevail there. You have to be truthful   
to them.   
There are certain pre-requisites: 1\. You should know good Sanskrit, its letters, words and   
pronounciations. Even the best Sanskrit pandits falter   
and fumble in Sri Rudram. It is like walking on a razor's edge. Any wrong  
chanting will cause harm than benefits.   
2\. It needs at least a total period of about 200 hours. If one   
spends a period of say 1 hour per day, you may need 200 days. Memorizing the  
whole Sri Rudram, with all the waxing and waning singing [called Ganam and  
Patam] needs a lot of efforts. It is not a child's play. Normally, they will  
not give audio cassettes for practising.   
4\. Practising at home should be done with a lot of mental   
and body purity, say, bath, applying holy ashes, not wearing   
upper cloth and wearing only a dhoti. It is not like reading   
upanishads or Mountain Path.   
3\. Payment part of it, you can discuss with the teacher.   
Arunachala Siva.
