## deep sleep and waking state

All beings are one. But due to ego we feel we are separated and differet..  
During the deep sleep as there is no mind we become atmaswaroopam. The person  
who sleeps   
in the same way will be in the same condition. But we never feel about others  
during the (thoughtless state) in deep sleep. Each one gets up after the sleep  
tells their experience.   
During waking state, we laugh and can see other people"s laugh also. Why does  
not it happen in deep sleep?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Deep Sleep is where the mind is totally at rest. It does not do   
any activity. This is Anandamaya Kosam, where the mind is quiscent   
with the Self. This is the time when mind cannot wag its tail. But   
at the same time, it is not a state of liberation. Liberation is the   
permanent abidance in the Self. Sleep is temporary abidance in the   
Self. When one wakes up, the mind jumps out and the thought "I"   
comes first.   
In sleep, since there is no mind, or atleast its activities, where is the  
question of laughter? Who is to see whose laughing? In   
dream, where the mind works, we see people laughing and we also   
laugh.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Quote  
But we never feel about others during the (thoughtless state) in deep sleep.  
Because there're no otheres in the deep sleep state.   
Quote  
Each one gets up after the sleep tells their experience.  
I have no experience in the deep sleep state. There's no even "me" there. Do  
you have?   
Of course, after awakening I can say "I slept". But could I say this if others  
(my parents and teachers) had not told me before about what happened to a  
person when he closed his eyes, fell into nothingness, then oopened his eyes  
again remembering nothing? I am told this state called "sleeping" and I am  
learned to repeat it, but in fact I know _nothing_ about this deep sleep  
state. It is a state of complete ignorance. But at the same time it's a  
pointer, a pointer towards nothingness, which otherewise an ordinary person  
could not imagine.

Well. Is that same pointer who points nothingness during the deep sleep and  
emerges in the waking state? The whole world is sleeping. Most of us go into  
deep sleep and they have same pointer. The pointer who is ONE during the deep  
sleep but it is not the same ONE in waking state. Because we see the  
differences. The differences are due to the mind. So when the mind abide in  
the self (as Subramanian ji stated)the real pointer emerges who is the real  
"I". How to catch the real "I" in day time without sleeping.

Who is going to catch the real "I"? A separate entity, ego? It is imposible  
task for the shaddow to catch the object projecting this shaddow. It can only  
surrender if this is predestined.   
To see its own helplessness an ego can put for itself such tasks. For  
instance, try to remember that nothigness you experienced in deep sleep state.  
In fact it's imposible to 'remember' the complete absence of everything.   
Or investigate if someone really wakes up after deep sleep. Who wakes up? Is  
this entity real? What remains the same during waking and sleep state?

As the body becomes very tired we need rest. We sleep to get rest. In deep  
sleep there is no one. Before going to bed, there was me. (I) and after the  
sleep also   
"I" comes. As there is no thought in deep sleep, it is very clear that there  
is no mind. therefore in day time, the existing person is only mind. Now with  
this help of   
mind we cannot find out the pointer. Is it? It looks like asking the theif to  
find out the police. Now I understand is the mind itself is shadow. So the  
shadow cannot find the light because when the light comes the shadow will  
disappear. Is it?   
without a break I should remember this.

Now you speak from the point of view "I am the body". Is it really so?

Mind can find out the pointer, but it will be the pointer only, no more.   
Quote

From time to time theives surrender to the police

Completely agree with you.   
Quote

No need to remember bandles of concepts. It's more interesting to "remembver"  
what remains the same in deep sleep and waking state.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana says: The body needs only rest. Only the mind   
needs sleep. Because in sleep it is quiscent. People have observed   
that if the mind does not stop, no sleep comes, though body is at   
rest at the bed.   
In the deep sleep state, the I-I is there, as It is in dream and in   
waking state. It is the "I" that keeps you alive during sleep.   
When one wakes up, the I (the mind) jumps out and creates all   
sorts of mischief. Once someone asked Bhagavan: Then can we   
not always be at sleep and avoid mental mischief? Bhagavan   
Ramana said: No, you cannot. The mind will not allow you to sleep beyond the  
stipulated time. It wakes up.   
Arunachala Siva.

Perhaps, they (Plenum, Self, Existence, Transcendental Reality, Pure  
Consciousness, Awareness, Absolute ) also want to know whether you and i are  
the same with them?   
You yourself have just created several objects. Why don't one to provide them  
with any qualities? Or deprive them of qualities. What is the use of it?
