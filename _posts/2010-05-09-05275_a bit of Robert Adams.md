**O Rama, he sees the truth who sees the body as a product of deluded  
understanding and as the fountain-source of misfortune, and who knows that the  
body is not the Self.   
He sees the truth who sees that this body pleasure and pain are experienced on  
account of the passage of time and the circumstances in which one is placed;  
and that they do not pertain to him.   
He sees the truth who sees that he is the omnipresent infinite consciousness  
which encompasses within itself all that takes place everywhere at all  
times.**   
He sees the truth who knows that the Self, which is as subtle as the millionth  
part of the tip of a hair divided a million times, pervades everything.   
He sees the truth who sees that there is no division at all between the self  
and the other, and that the one infinite light of consciousness exists as the  
sole reality.   
He sees the truth who sees that the non-dual consciousness which indwells all  
beings is omnipotent and omnipresent.   
 **He sees the truth who is not deluded into thinking that he is the body  
which is subject to illness, fear, agitation, old age and death.**   
 **He sees the truth** who sees that all things are strung together in the  
Self as beads are strung on a thread, **and who knows "I am not the mind".**   
He sees the truth who sees all beings in the three worlds as his own family,  
deserving of his sympathy and protection.   
 **He sees the truth who knows that the Self alone exists and that there is no  
substance in objectivity.**   
He is unaffected who knows that pleasure, pain, birth, death, etc., are all  
the Self only.   
 **He is firmly established in the truth who feels: "What should I acquire,  
what should I renounce, when all this is the one Self?"**   
Salutations to that abode of auspiciousness, who is filled with the supreme  
realization that the entire universe is truly Brahman alone, which remains  
unchanged during all the apparent creation, existence and dissolution of the  
universe.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. We find the same person different and everyone sees the   
person in his own different way. This is because we have still   
not understood and realized that "I am". This "I am ness" if it   
could jettison out the "I" or the "I-thought", then everyone will   
see only the One. This I thought only gives rise to first person,   
second person and third person. Then it gives room for here and   
there, the space and yesterday, today and tomorrow, the time.   
This idea is taught by Bhagavan Ramana in Verses 14,15 and 16   
of Sad Darsnam.   
There is wooden doll of an elephant. One child sees it as elephant. Another  
child sees it as wood. Only a matured child sees it as   
elephant made in wood. (Tirumoolar)   
Arunachala Siva.
