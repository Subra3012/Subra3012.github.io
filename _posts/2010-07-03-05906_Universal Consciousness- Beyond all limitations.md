Dear devotees,   
 I came across an interesting article in the internet titled "The Rule Of Vigilance" by Dr. Sarada who is a staunch devotee of Bhagavan Ramana.The article appears in the web site <http://rmclb.tripod.com/jan99.htm#first>.It is a very practical article on Self Enquiry and it clears all the doubts which may arise to practitioner of self enquiry.Every sadhaka especially new sadhaka should go through this article.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
The 'I' which states I am agitated, is the mind or the ego. That is   
why Pure Consciousness is said to be beyond mind-consciousness.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 these are powers. they belong to the mind. coz they pertain to the mithya world.   
There is absolutely no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**   
\-- Quotations and Conversations Found in the Ramana Pictorial Souvenir, 1967

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.
