In America, the full moon will occur on July 18th at 4am......   
Anyone know when it occurs in India... and what night would be best to do  
pradiksha, the night of the 17th, or the night of the 18th?   
thanks!

Dear Blissboy, the Full Moon in India is observed from   
17th morning 12.57 PM to 18th afternoon 2.00 PM. You may   
accordingly readjust this to your local American time and observe.   
The full moon is seen bright at Tiruvannamalai on 17th night!   
Arunachala Siva.
