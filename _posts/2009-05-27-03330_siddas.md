Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Do you know the story of KARALA KATTAI SIDDAR. I think He got immersed in  
Vaidhyanathan temple in chennai poonamali. The sculpter has made His   
figure on one of the pillar. If you have his life story please let us know.   
Thanking you   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
I do not know anything about KARALA KATTAI SIDDHAR.   
He may be one of the lesser known Siddhas.   
Arunachala Siva.
