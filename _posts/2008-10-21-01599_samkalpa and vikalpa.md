Dear sirs,   
After many posts here I learnt that Mind should be there. But it should be  
pure mind. Raju ji said it is the reflect of pure being consiousness. He said  
we should not have sankalpa and vikalpa dosha. Then mind becomes pure. Ok.   
Here I cannot understand. When does the mind have sankalpa and vikalpa dosha.   
2ndly no body do any wrong thing with the mind with any bad intention. But  
sometime wrong things happens. Why does it happens. Why we have  
forgetfullness. This is also one kind of dohsa.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Once the reflection of pure consciousness by the mind is blocked due to the veiling of the mind by the action of Maya(moola avidya) it forgets   
it's source i.e self and starts thinking that it is a separate being because  
it forgot oneness with the ultimate reality."Who am i" enquiry   
helps us to recognise this unbroken oneness with the ultimate reality.Once the  
mind forgets it's source which is self whose nature is bliss   
mind starts searching for the bliss outside and in the process Sankalpa and  
Vikalpa are formed.Sankalpa is nothing but a search for happiness   
in the nonself and vikalpa is the doubt that it may not get it in the  
nonself.If this anomoly is destroyed mind finds oneness with the self again   
and melts in the bliss of self.   
When thought matter is too much we develop forgetfulness and commit more  
mistakes.All this is due to Pramada i.e self-forgetfulness.   
So uninterrupted self-awareness i.e sada apramada is important.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
As Dr. Raju said, Sankalpa is a fevered determination, to find things   
which are relative and not permanent. Vikalpa is the doubt arising,   
whether it would be good or bad, all in the non-self. Bhagavan   
Ramana uses two other dyads, love and hate. He says both should   
be eschewed. Hate, we understand. We should abhor hating.   
But, love, who to abhor it? Bhagavan says, even love for nonself   
is to be avoided. Being in the Self, is a state where both love and   
hate are not there.   
Arunachala Siva.
