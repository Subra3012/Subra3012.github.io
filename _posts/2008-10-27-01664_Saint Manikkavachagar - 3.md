Saint Manikkavachagar then went on pilgrimage to several Siva   
temples in Tamil Nadu. The entire Tiruvachakam is his description   
of Siva's glory in various temples. He wrote 51 songs under   
Tiruvachakam, covering 7 places of his visit. These places are: 1\. Tirup Perundurai - in Ramanathapuram distrcit.   
2\. Thillai - Chidambaram - in Cuddalore district.   
3\. Thirut Tonipuram or Sirkazhi - in Thanjavur district.   
4\. Tiru Aroor - in Nagapattinam district.   
5\. Tiruvannamalai - in Tiruvannamalai district.   
6\. Tiruk Kazhu Kundram - in Kanchipuram district.   
7\. Uttarakosa Mangai - in Ramanathapuram district.   
His songs are in Nayaki-Nayaka bhava, treating him as a woman   
pining with love of her paramour, Siva. While Jana Sambandhar   
spoke in pitru-bhava, like a son to father, Tiru Navukkarasar,   
spoke in putra-bhava, like a father to son and Sundramoorthy   
Swami, in sahodara-bhava, like a friend to a friend. The songs   
of Manikkavachagar are full of 'bhavas', and these would melt   
one's heart. His other poem of Tiru Chitrambala Kovaiyar, will   
put even Kama Sutra into shame! This poem of 400 verses,   
is full of love exploits between a girl and a man!   
Saint Manikkavachagar meets Siva as an old Brahmin Guru, in   
Tiruk Kazhu Kundram. This is the third appearance of Siva to him.   
He had seen him as Effulgence in Uttara Kosa Mangai, as a Siva   
linga in Tirup Perundurai and as a Brahmin guru in Tiruk Kazhu   
Kundram.   
Saint Manikkavachagar has sung two compositions in Tiruvannamalai.   
These are early morning songs as sung by maidens in the winter month   
of Margazhi, December-January, These maidens get up early and   
go for bath in the river and each one wakes up the other from sleep.   
They all go and take bath and pray to Siva, to get suitable Siva devotees   
as their husbands! Only Manikkavachagar wants Siva Himself as   
his husband. These two compositions are called: Tiruvembavai - Wake up song   
Tiruvammanai - Playing with small pebbles or seeds by throwing them   
 up and catching.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Many say Bhagawan is continuation of Jnana sambadar avatar who is full of Bhakti and devotion towards Arunachala Siva   
with pitru bhava and left the body at 16yrs of age.Bgagawan got realised at  
16yrs and he is full of Jnana with pitru bhava towards   
Arunachala Siva and he composed Akhsara mana malai in nayaki-nayaka style.So  
Bhagawan showed both Bhakti and Jnana in his life.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Krishna Bhikshu, in Sri Ramana Leela says that Bhagavan   
Ramana began where Jana Sambandha had left. He is an   
avatara of Jnana Sambandha as per Sri Ramana Gita of Kavyakanata   
Ganapati Sastri. Arunachala Akshara Manamalai is in Nayaki-   
Nayaka Bhava.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian   
Tiruperun Thurai( Avudaiyar Koil) is in Pudukottai District. I think it has  
been mentioned as Ramanathapuram District in the Blog   
Thanks   
Ram

Dear ram,   
Thank you for your information. I go by the old classifications of   
the districts in Tamil Nadu, which I left about 20 years back to   
join work in Bangalore. There are many further bifurcations and   
trifurcations, since then.   
Arunachala Siva.
