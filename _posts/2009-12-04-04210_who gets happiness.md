In satsang the speaker spoke on the charity. Mainly about the annadanam. He  
said, now a days people donate money to the charitable organisation and   
look after their business. It is not good. You must serve the food with your  
full heart means taking trouble whether in preparing or distrubuting is much   
superior than giving the money. You can feel their atma how it feels  
happyness. Now here I have a doubt. How does the atma feel happiness or  
sadness.   
I think all the sukha or dukha is only for the body and mind. On the other  
hand atma and the consiousness will just witness.   
coments please........

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Annadana or offering food to the needy is commended in scriptures,   
because the empty stomach will not permit philosophy into your   
mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

I endorse the views of the Speaker on charity.Long ago a traveller going to  
Tirupathi visited my house and asked for food.He cried that his stomach was  
in disorder and all he required was a little rice and buttermilk. He lamented  
people in the City disposed him by throwing a few coins.I was moved and served  
him food and the sense of fulfilment which the beneficiary and myself got was  
too good. Pure mind in synonymous with Atma/Self. Bhagavan who is Self in sum  
and substance did so many good deeds to mitigate the suffering of humans and  
all creatures. Why indulge in dry philosophy that self is just a witness, not  
affected by good or bad, non doer.

But, Atma, the Self can be realized only through mind. The mind   
can work only when the body is free from, at least hunger, if not   
diseases. Hence Annadanam becomes important. In Bhakta Vijayam stories of  
Maharashtra devotees, there is one story, where   
a beggar comes on an Ekadasi (fasting day), for food, since he was   
already with no food for five days. The devout brahmins who observe   
fasting, refused to give him food, since even giving food to one (and   
thus breaking the Ekadasi fast) is a sin. The beggar died. Panduranga then  
appeared and told the significance of fasting.   
Arunachala Siva.

Atma is beyond mundane perceptions/sensations. People sometime refer atma to  
body, mind, heart, intellect and consciousness but the real meaning is not be  
confused.   
Care has to be taken in everything (not only annadhanam) whether it reaches  
the right place/ person(s).   
It all depends why you wish to give charity..... If your mind is result  
oriented, you may attach yourself emotionally towards the act - you may  
sometime get the benefits shortly.   
Giving charity just because you know you have the means and are aware that  
there are deserving people to share - is the best.   
If there is an unconscious feeling that YOU have done the philantropic act,  
only then your derive pleasure or peace. Even expecting such, is wrong.   
Best is to be aware that the body, mind and ability (wealth) is not yours but  
is given to you by the universal authority for a short time with a free-will  
to use it or abuse it. Any rightful act of such awareness results in getting  
nearer to the universal authority.   
If you (or others) would like to know of a true story of a rich rogue (alive  
today) to whom a god got attracted by his selfless act and made him found a  
temple and serve as the priest, I will let you know.

Before telling the story I would like to tell you that there is a God name  
Muthappan in Kerala. His is none other than Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The  
beauty of Muthappan is that he is able to possess a human and interact with  
people with their queries. The main temple of Muthappan is at parassinikadavu  
in Kannur in Kerala. Not much is known about Muthappan but Muthappan likes  
annadhanam. Around 2000-3000 people feed daily in his Kannur temple. Food is  
offered both in the afternoon and evening.   
The question of God possessing human gives rise to many speculations regarding  
the fraudulent practices. While many such practices are humbug and fraud, I  
can vouch for parassini temple and the temple in my city.   
Now coming to the story...it all happened like this....   
Long before in 1950s a poor and ordinary man from South India (Kerala)  
migrated to nearby state and became very rich by his smart work and good  
fate. He ran a chain of hotels and had more than 40 workers. But, he was a  
hedonist and a rogue - used to beat his workers for their shortcomings in  
work.   
It was such time when people in kerala (a communist state) due to their  
extreme poverty, used to migrate to nearby states in search of work for  
survival. Most of them never got any work and with their bare resources  
exhausted, were left to sleep (or rather faint) with hunger in the railway  
station.   
One of the hotels of the rogue was opposite to the railway station. When he  
saw people virtually dying, he thought it better to feed them the separated  
rice-starch-water (which is nutritious but useless and would generally pour it  
in the ditch). With few additives he prepared the rice congee and fed the  
starving people inside the railway station. This happened for few months....  
Lord Muthappan got so attracted to him and probably felt he is the best person  
to be his priest. But he was a rogue; and to make him proper he had to be  
made a pauper. In the next 15 yrs or so he suffered extreme distress and had  
lost all his wealth.   
It was at that time Muthappan revealed the cause of his problem and his  
intention to have a temple and him to be the priest. There was no money to buy  
any land and so a house-temple was constructed as encroachment. The temple  
still stands today. The priest who is now very old from the time I knew (12+  
yrs) is fully transformed as a purist and a very kind person. He is happier  
than ever that he got the biggest of wealth - Lord Muthappan.   
I am one of the beneficiaries of grace of Muthappan without him, probably I  
would not be living for typing these words. Such were the problems!   
An action must be performed "JUST LIKE THAT". Well such is the intention one  
must perform any action be it annadhanam. There must be only one action and  
one intention and both must overlap!   
There are people giving tasty annadhanam to hundreds to people in temple  
(pilgrimages) but I have never known God getting attracted to them. They have  
some other hidden expectations in their agenda.

Premjit

As this rich rogue many bad people like valmiki, Kannapan nayanar turned to a  
Bhaktas. On the other hand good people with good intension, suffer a lot.   
Even we got free will, and use them for good cause, it is His will, He would  
draw some luky souls near to Him. In bhakti marga also we should not think   
any benifit, just we have to follow what jnanis say. Nobody knows God's play.

Dear Premjit,   
Yes. "Just like that" is the apt phrase, give it without the sense   
of doership, without any ego, whatsoever. That is ideal dhanam.   
Bhagavan Ramana says: Whatever one gives to others, one gives   
it for himself! I thought over this for a long time. It comes in   
Who am I? How can I give to others, through which I give to myself? Yes.  
The dhanam gives happiness as much as it is for   
the taker, as it to the giver. Both get happiness. For the taker,   
happiness comes from outside. For the giver, happiness comes from within.  
This is the transaction.   
Some Tamil poet says, (I do not know the name, may be one of the Siddhars): Dhanam is like the rightful sexual union between a male and a consenting  
female. Both are givers, both are takers, both get happiness.   
Arunachala Siva.

happiness comes from outside. For the giver, happiness comes from within.  
This is the transaction.   
Some Tamil poet says, (I do not know the name, may be one of the Siddhars): Dhanam is like the rightful sexual union between a male and a consenting  
female. Both are givers, both are takers, both get happiness.   
Arunachala Siva.
