D: When one enquires into the root of self-conceit which is of the form I,  
all sorts of different thoughts without number seem to rise; and not any  
separate I thought.   
 **M: It is the rise of egoity that is the cause and source of the rise of all  
other thoughts;** therefore, if the self-conceit of the form of egoity which  
is the root of the illusory tree of samsara (bondage consisting of  
transmigration) is destroyed, all other thoughts will perish completely like  
an uprooted tree.   
 **Whatever thoughts arise as obstacles to ones sadhana (spiritual  
discipline), the mind should not be allowed to go in their direction, but  
should be made to rest in ones Self which is the Atman; one should remain as  
witness to whatever happens, adopting the attitude Let whatever strange  
things happen, happen; let us see! This should be ones practice.** In other  
words, one should not identify oneself with appearances; one should never  
relinquish ones Self. This is the proper means for destruction of the mind  
(manonasa) which is of the nature of seeing the body as Self, and which is the  
cause of all the aforesaid obstacles. This method which easily destroys egoity  
deserves to be called devotion (bhakti),meditation (dhyana), concentration  
(yoga), and knowledge (jnana). Because God remains of the nature of the  
Self,shining as I in the Heart, **because the scriptures declare that  
thought itself is bondage, the best discipline is to stay quiescent without  
ever forgetting Him (God, the Self)**, after resolving in Him the mind which  
is of the form of the Ithought, no matter by what means. This is the  
conclusive teaching of the scriptures.

Dear prasanth,   
The thought is the bondage: ___________________________   
I shall quote one of the narrations of Annamalai Swami to a questioner: When I first came to Bhagavan, I used to ask questions about   
liberation. What is bondage? What is freedom? And so on.   
Muruganar, who was sitting next to me on one of these occasions,   
laughed and said: "This boy doesn't even know what liberation is and what  
bondage is."   
I think he was amused by the innocence of my enquiries. After   
I began serving Bhagavan, I listened very attentively to all philosophical  
explanations that He gave. I also talked to Chadwick and other devotees about  
various aspects of Vedanta. I gradually   
absorbed the teachings until a point came where I could say that I had a good  
working knowledge of Bhagavan's teachings and the various other systems that  
were being discussed in His Presence.   
In one of his later songs, Muruganar wrote about Bhagavan, "You   
make wise people of those who come to you in an ignorant state.   
This is the grace of Bhagavan Ramana. I always felt that this   
was a reference to me.   
It wasn't easy in the beginning. When I first came to the Asramam, I was so  
forgetful I rarely remembered anything that   
Bhagavan said. Because I was so forgetful, I used to keep a paper and pencil  
and write down whatever Bhagavan was saying.   
I felt that my forgetfulness was a hindrance to absorbing Bhagavan's  
teachings, so one day, I approached Him and said: "Bhagavan, my memory is very bad. Could you please bless me   
with a good one."   
Bhagavan looked into my eyes for a few minutes without saying anything. From  
that day on, my memory became very clear and sharp, so much so, I gave up  
carrying my pencil and paper.
