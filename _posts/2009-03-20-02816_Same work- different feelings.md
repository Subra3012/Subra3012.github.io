## Sanctification of Birth and Death  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 19, 2009, 08:14:13 AM

Life on earth is like an infinite ocean in which birth appears like a bubble  
and death marks the bursting   
of that bubble after which it exists no more. Atmosphere of a household is  
said to be defiled when a   
birth or death occurs in it. There are different sanctifying customs to be  
carried out on both these   
occasions. After the birth of a son, the father should offer oblations to  
please the gods and his   
ancestors after taking a bath.   
When a death occurs in a household, close relatives should take bath and carry  
the cadaver adorned with flowers   
and garlands outside the village or well-demarcated cremation ground for  
cremation. As per the religious tradition   
of the deceased, the body should either be consigned to the flames or buried.  
Then the relatives should again   
take bath in the pond or river facing south and offer watery oblations to the  
dead person. Since that day,   
Pindadaan (offering sweet balls made of barley flour, sesame seeds, jaggery  
and honey) should be done for ten   
days. On the fourth day of the cremation, ashes should be collected for  
immersion in holy places of pilgrimage.   
The person who had carried out the cremation must abstain from intimacy for  
thirteen days. Outsiders   
are also barred from eating cereals from such a household where a death has  
occurred. For the   
different classes of Hindu society, this sanctifying period varies. For  
Brahmins, it is ten days, for   
Kshatriyas, it is twelve days, for Vaishyas, it is fifteen days and for  
Shudras, this period has been fixed   
for one month. On the same day in every subsequent month, oblations should be  
offered to the dead   
for one year.

## Tale of Yayati  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 19, 2009, 08:16:09 AM

Nahush had six sons- Yati, Yayati, Sanyati, Aayati, Viyati and Kriti. Yayati  
had two wives, Devyani, the   
daughter of Shukracharya and Sharmishtha, the daughter of Vrishparva. Devyani  
gave birth to Yadu   
and Turvasu whereas Sharmishtha gave birth to Druhayu, Anu and Puru. Because  
of a curse of   
Shukracharya old age had descended on Yayati prematurely.   
Yayati then requested his eldest son Yadu to exchange his youth with his old  
age but Yadu refused.   
Then Yayati requested each of his sons one by one but all of them refused  
plainly for the fear of getting   
old prematurely.   
At last YayatiÂ’s youngest son Puru gladly accepted his request and gave him  
his youth. Regaining the youth,   
Yayati once again indulged in carnal pleasures with both his queens. But  
everyday his desire for pleasures   
increased like a fire flared up by ghee. After one thousand years Yayati  
realised his mistake and decided to   
expiate for his sin. Thus, Yayati returned Puru his youth and acquired his old  
age once again. Then crowning Puru   
as the king, he took an exile to the forest.

## Same work, different feelings

The same work can produce different feelings when approached from different  
directions.   
Consider for example ritualistic worship.   
A person who is fed up with the "objectifications" of the world and wants to  
collect his mind for meditative enquiry,   
ritualistic worship may be a botheration to him.   
On the other hand a person who is already in a stream of meditative awareness  
and wishes to express his joy outwards,   
ritualistic worship becomes a joyous devotional activity.   
Om Shanti. .

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes this is the case with everything. Bhagavan Ramana says for the   
true seeker, the world will look like a dream. Upon realization for the   
same seeker who has now become a Jnani, the world will look   
as Brahma Swarupa.   
Arunachala Siva.
