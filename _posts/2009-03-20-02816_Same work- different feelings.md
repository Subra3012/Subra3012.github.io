## Same work, different feelings

The same work can produce different feelings when approached from different  
directions.   
Consider for example ritualistic worship.   
A person who is fed up with the "objectifications" of the world and wants to  
collect his mind for meditative enquiry,   
ritualistic worship may be a botheration to him.   
On the other hand a person who is already in a stream of meditative awareness  
and wishes to express his joy outwards,   
ritualistic worship becomes a joyous devotional activity.   
Om Shanti. .

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes this is the case with everything. Bhagavan Ramana says for the   
true seeker, the world will look like a dream. Upon realization for the   
same seeker who has now become a Jnani, the world will look   
as Brahma Swarupa.   
Arunachala Siva.
