The Yoga tradition also classifies the mind in a different manner. It defines  
mind in the broadest sense,   
what is called Chitta in Sanskrit, as all aspects of conditioned  
consciousness. Under the concept of Chitta   
is included reason, emotion, sensation, memory, the instinctual part of the  
mind, and the ego; all that   
we ordinarily consider to possess some degree of consciousness within us. Yet  
under the concept of   
Chitta is also a higher creativity and intuition beyond the ordinary mind and  
physical consciousness,   
which a few people may develop in a significant manner. Chitta moreover  
extends beyond the personal   
mind, to collective and cosmic aspects of mind. Chitta is mind as a cosmic  
principle, not simply the human mind.   
Mind and Consciousness - Two Different Powers: Even more significantly, Yoga radically distinguishes between mind and  
consciousness, which it regards   
as two separate but related powers. Yoga regards consciousness, called Chit as  
something other than   
the mind or Chitta. This is very different from modern science but also from  
most of the world's   
philosophies, which generally identify mind and consciousness.   
The mind is an instrument of thinking and sensing on various levels. Mind is  
called the 'inner instrument'   
or 'anatahkarana' in Sanskrit, related to the body which is our outer  
instrument. The mind is looked upon   
as the sixth sense after the five bodily senses and is regarded as an organ,  
not our true being or the   
basis of our sense of self.
