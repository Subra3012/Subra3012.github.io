Dear I,   
Here is one question for you all - 'I':  _Why do you want Knowledge?   
_   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Bhagavan Ramana says that the only desire that one should have   
is desire for the Self. This desire for the Self is also called Self-   
Knowledge - Atma Bodham, to use Sri Sankara's words. All other   
knowledge is useles tinsel. Bhagavan says in Upadesa Saram,   
Verse 27: The Knowledge which is without knowledge and ignorance   
is the true Knowledge. There is nothing else to learn.   
Now, why do we need the Self Knowledge? It is natural for for   
all living beings. It is like a new born child, looking for mother's   
breast, as soon as it is taken on the lap. It is natural for any   
living being to know the Self, the Source, like the river flowing in   
all sorts of lands, finally reaching the ocean back, its Source.   
Arunachala Siva.

which knowledge you want to know? To live in this world we need some  
knowledge. This is worldly knowledge.   
After geting bored, it is quite natural for jivas to know about him, i.e.  
spiritual knowledge. In the begining for both knowledge we need some path,  
quide and of course dedication. That is all. Rest will come from grace. The  
self will be known by itself.

I think,here,in this world we cant have absolute knowlege about Him.Coz,then  
it wont be pure,and it will be simple,wordly.That would mean God is limited in  
some sense.We can have only fragances.For now...

Dear Jewell and Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Both of you are correct. Bhagavan Ramana says in Upadesa Saram, Verse  
27:-   
That is true knowledge which trasncends   
Both knowledge and ignorance,   
For in Pure Knowledge   
Is not object to be known.   
Arunachala Siva.
