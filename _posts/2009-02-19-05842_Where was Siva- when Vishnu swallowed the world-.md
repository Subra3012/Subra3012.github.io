## Where was Siva, when Vishnu swallowed the world?

Once some Vaishnavites asked Poet Kalamegam, sarcastically: Where was Siva, when Vishnu swallowed the world? Since Siva   
is in the world, He must have also gone into the stomach of Vishnu.   
Kalamegam replied forthwith with a song: No doubt Vishnu swallowed the world.   
It is like an elephant swallowing a big rice ball.   
But where is Siva? You also ask!   
Siva is the mahoot on the back of the elephant, seeing the   
Elephant swallowing the rice ball fully, without wasting   
 even a grain!

Funny, but somehow i don't find interesting all these Lord Vishnu Vs Lord  
Shiva fightings.   
Earlier when i read Srila Prahupada books they showcase Lord Krishna as  
ultimate god and lord shiva is junior or demi god.   
Now when i read few stories regarding origin of arunachala hill or the story  
mentioned below by Subramanian garu they say Lord Shiva is highest and  
ultimate and lord vishnu is a demi god.

if i start reading bible ( actually i am not interested at all) they will try  
to showcase jesus as ultimate   
If i start reading quran ( actually i am not interested at all) they will try  
to showcase allah as ultimate   
Story is endless so are names/forms..   
I EVEN REMEMBER ONCE GURU RAMANA HIMSELF ACCEPTED THAT IT IS JUST TO INSPIRE  
AND MAKE OUR FAITH AND CONCENTRATION SINGLEPOINTED THAT THEY CREATE STORIES  
RELATING TO MULTIPLE GODS IN PURANAS AND OTHER BOOKS.

Dear prasanth,   
Read the Bible and the Quran also, nothing wrong. Ultimately   
SIVA = VISHNU = MURUGA = GANAPATI = JESUS = ALLAH.   
There can be an Ishta Deivam, the god-form that one likes most.   
There can be a Kula Deivam, the god of the family. All are one   
only. Only creating one god as more supreme than the other is   
not good.   
When I pray to Siva, I am praying to Vishnu also and to other gods.   
The problem with ISKCON is that they say that Krishna is the most   
supreme being and other gods are inferior. This is duality. And so the  
Christians and Moslems about their gods. This will not take   
one to non dual consciousness, which is our aim as Ramana devotees. The  
nondual consciousness is "I-I", the Self, Brahman. All are Brahman. All are  
Arunachala Swarupams.   
Bhagavan Ramana says the same thing in Verse 4 of Arunachala Ashtakam. He  
told Christians that there is no need to convert   
themselves into Hindus. A good Christian can also realize the Self if he  
understands the unity, the Self. Dr. Syed, a pious Moslem who was with  
Bhagavan Ramana understood this and lived his life accordingly.   
Arunachala Siva.
