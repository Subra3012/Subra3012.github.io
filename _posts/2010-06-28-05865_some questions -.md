## Self-inquiry helps the fish out of the sea to go back to its source.

We cannot loose awareness but we can forget it.The literal meaning of   
sin is forgetfulness of one's own nature which is awareness.It is not   
permanently lost by conditioning but it is clouded and hidden underneath   
the conditioning which is commonly called the ego.Others help you to   
decondition yourself from the conditioning.Conditioning is a necessary   
phase in spiritual growth.   
Personality is a necessary part of growth. It is like if you catch hold of a  
fish in the sea and you throw it on the shore; the fish jumps back into the  
sea. Now for the first time it will know that it has always lived in the sea;  
for the first time it will know that, "The sea is my life." Up to now, before  
it was caught and thrown on the shore, it may not ever have thought of the sea  
at all; it may have been utterly oblivious of the sea. To know something,  
first you have to lose it.   
To be aware of paradise, first you have to lose it. Unless it is lost and  
regained you will not understand the beauty of it.   
Adam and eve story in Bible is significant,it is not a historical story but   
a story with psychological insight.They talk about snake bite there   
which means accumulating relative knowledge and because of that   
heaviness of relative knowledge one forgets his own natiure.This is not only  
original sin but also the only sin that is existing.Snake bite is   
provided by the society,school,university,teachers,parents,priests,   
politicians,fb friends.In this way there is apparent distancing of ourselves  
from our source of being.Then unable to bear that   
predicament involved in conditioning and personality one starts   
pondering what is my real nature,am i the personality,is it my essential   
being and in that way Self-inquiry starts which shows us the way   
to our source of being which is Self.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
I am in agreement with you. During the examination time, I have   
always experienced that about 15 to 20 minutes before the start   
of the examination are most cruel. I suddenly feel I have forgotten   
many formulae (I am a Chemistry student) and many experiments.   
At that time, there is no point also in seeing once again the whole thing. I  
become nervous. As the bell rings for entering the hall,   
I enter the hall with sweat and blue, which lasts till the question   
paper is quickly seen once. Once you read the question paper and   
start answering the answers come of their own accord, no forgetting,   
no lapse. This is exactly true in the case of realizing the I amness also.  
We forget or we think we have forgotten, but it is always there. Only our  
delusion [this is due to the world, as you have correctly said - the wrong  
conditioning by the objective world]   
is the sin and our forgetfulness of the Self is the sin. Once we   
come out of it and enter the great hall of self enquiry, we remember  
everything. Nothing is lost, nothing is forgotten, only a temporary lapse,  
thanks to this world of objective reality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right  
direction,and dont bother when it will finish. Shure,life is hard,and all that  
is easy to say.But like Vivekananda many times said Be brave!Be bold!Be  
strong!Be brave!Be a hero! You will find yourself!Anyway,its our destiny.

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.   
"Inquiry is not working" \-- what way is it expected to work?   
Yadi Deham Prtak Krithya, Chitti Vishramya tistasi [If you detach yourself  
from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march  
2009. I see "That" which has not changed all through passage of time so long  
which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was  
mine. but the 'I' which had those ignorance is limited.   
'I' am simply aware of i's limitedness   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

That is what I was wondering! Does Nagaraj really have this question?   
and then I thought, anyone can have some testing times and moments in  
practice.   
therefore wrote what i thought is appropriate.
