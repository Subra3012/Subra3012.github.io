## Self-inquiry is the process of claiming back the intelligence of awareness.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 28, 2010, 03:48:19 AM

I am a pediatrician and i observed that all children are intelligent and  
spontaneous   
irrespective of their social background.So as a child we are born with  
intelligence.   
We are the manifestation of the existence which is intrinsically intelligent  
in abundance.   
I also treat the adults but they are not so intelligent and spontaneous as  
children but   
they are cunning,conditioned by the society and fall in line with the way of  
society   
which is highly corrupt,brutal,violent,possessive, suppressive,self  
centered,ambitious,   
competitive.So during the transition from the childhood to adult this  
conditioning of the   
individual by the society is happening gradually.Society never wants you to be  
naturally   
intelligent.If the human being is conditioned it is easy for the society to  
manipulate him   
through the politician, priest,parents,educational system which kills our  
natural intelligence   
and makes us stupid.The whole educational system is created not to draw your  
innate   
intelligence inherent to awareness but to serve its vested interests.Saints  
like   
Sri Ramakrishna,Ramana Maharshi,Shirdi Sai Baba,Meher Baba are not conditioned   
insuch an educational system and they reached unimaginable heights in  
consciousness.   
Even JK is not a good performer in traditional education and he is just a  
matriculate.   
There is nothing wrong in getting trained in technological skills through  
education but   
the conditioning it imposes on us kills our natural intelligence is inimical  
to our growth   
and we must be aware of it.Scientists in the world developed weapons of mass  
destruction   
which can destroy the earth 500 times in the name of defending their countries  
and   
handed over them to the politicians and one such stupid may press the button  
of an   
atomic bomb and the earth with all its beauty may disappear in few moments.   
All these are the effects of conditioning and we have come out that at any  
cost,   
otherwise it is dangerous to the existence of humanity.They say to have peace  
on earth   
we must be prepared for war all the time with latest weaponry to destroy the  
human.   
Can violence bring peace? See the insanity of human conditioning which assumes  
itself   
as a master of our life and directing us what to do.Being limited the action  
born out of   
conditioning results in constant conflict,strife,misery.Life is a flux and we  
can respond   
to it moment to moment only if we are free and intelligent,we cannot be free  
if we are   
conditioned.We cannot face life with ready made answers from our conditioning.   
Parents impose obedience on you which destroys the intelligence as a great  
value   
because parents do not want you to be intelligent.   
This intelligence can be rediscovered through Self-inquiry which destroys all  
the barriers   
that society has created to prevent you from being intelligent.Ego is nothing  
but the   
conditioning imposed on you by the society.When we are doing Self-inquiry we  
question   
the existence of ego which is a group of ideas and thoughts imposed on you by  
the society   
with which we are identified with and feeling these group of ideas as the  
"me".Obviously   
this is not our nature and ego is just an utilitarian instrument in our hand  
to function in the   
hierarchic society.   
The function of Self-inquiry is negation,it removes the blocks and rocks that  
are imposed   
on us and which prevent the awareness from flowing freely.Self-inquiry brings  
back that spring of   
awareness alive.Everybody is carrying a great potential of awareness but  
society is preventing it   
from actualizing it by putting great blocks of conditioning  
politically,racially,economically,   
religiously thus imprisoning and limiting our consciousness in a way which  
serves their interests.   
To come out of that all such imprisonments of conditioning the intelligence  
involved in   
Self-inquiry just observes without fighting with the conditioning and that  
very observation   
puts aside the conditioning and thus we become free of all conditionings.Once  
you are out   
of the conditioning watching it,being aware of it,just being a witness you are  
intelligent.   
Then your intelligence which is innate in your awareness is discovered,with  
that intelligence   
we can undo what the society has done to us.We can destroy the mischief done  
by the society   
through our intelligence.We can destroy the conspiracy of  
priests,politicians,parents,teachers.   
When we come out of it for the first time we are an authentic free human  
being.That intelligence   
brings freedom and spontaneity.Stupid persons behave mechanically and  
intelligent person   
behaves consciously.Self-inquiry is a rebellion to destroy all this repressed  
structure which we   
call ego which represses our intelligence and brings stupidity to us.That is  
why Alzheimer's disease   
is becoming increasingly common best example being Ronald Reagon.Self-inquiry  
is real inner   
revolution which is psychological.It brings us to our original nature of pure  
awareness.   
All that is needed is to discover it,because it has been hidden for many  
centuries under the   
weight of the mind.The earth is waiting for free authentic human being who is  
free of   
conditioning and so joyfully celebrates his life.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Excellent. Every human being is born with natural intelligence.   
It is the social customs, practices and the educational systam   
and other such things mar this intelligence and make him or she   
'a being of society' not 'a being of God'. It is unfortunate that   
the independent India is adding to this poison by various measures.   
The purpose of Self Enquiry, I think, is to de-emot us from this   
social emotions which are diabolic and be in our natural emotion   
of one-ness with the God or the Self.   
What are the roots that clutch   
What branches grow out of this stony rubbish?   
Son of Man, you know only a heap of broken images,   
Where the sun beats, dead trees give no shelter and cricket   
 no relief.   
 -T.S. Eliot.   
Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 348: Having become free from concepts, which are afflicting   
thoughts, and with the 'I am the body' idea completely extinguished, one ends  
up as the mere eye of Grace, the non dual   
expanse of consciusness. This is the supremely fulfilling vision   
of God.   
Verse 349: Having restrained the deceitful senses, and having   
abandoned mental concepts, you should stand aloof in your real   
nature. In that state of Self-abidance in which you remain firmly established  
in the consciousness of the Heart, Sivam will reveal itself.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right  
direction,and dont bother when it will finish. Shure,life is hard,and all that  
is easy to say.But like Vivekananda many times said Be brave!Be bold!Be  
strong!Be brave!Be a hero! You will find yourself!Anyway,its our destiny.

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.   
"Inquiry is not working" \-- what way is it expected to work?   
Yadi Deham Prtak Krithya, Chitti Vishramya tistasi [If you detach yourself  
from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.   
Love!

Dear I,   
You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march  
2009. I see "That" which has not changed all through passage of time so long  
which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was  
mine. but the 'I' which had those ignorance is limited.   
'I' am simply aware of i's limitedness

That is what I was wondering! Does Nagaraj really have this question?   
and then I thought, anyone can have some testing times and moments in  
practice.   
therefore wrote what i thought is appropriate.
