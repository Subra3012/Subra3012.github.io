## Arunachala as a mantra

Found an amazing page on Arunachala as a mantra  
[url]http://davidgodman.org/asaints/powerofa1.shtml#ftnref4[/url   
At one point on the page it tells a story of Ramana Maharshi reading a verse  
in Tamil which says on Arunachala is equal to 1,000,000 NamaShivaya's!

This is a dialog between a disciple (d) and a software-side guru (sguru) on  
the subject of spirituality. The questions and answers are very brief. So a  
commentary is given below to understand the in-between thinking that is taking  
place. The questions and answers are taking place with a lot of silent  
contemplation in between.   
The discussion starts as given below.   
d: I have already read 1000 megabytes of scriptures. But still I am not  
getting the fulfillment I expect.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. The import is that the disciple has not approached sguru without any  
preparation. The disciple has already read 1000 megabytes of scriptures.  
Within that 1000 megabytes the disciple has already covered what he thinks are  
the key scriptures.   
2\. At this point the disciple has not gone for reading another 1000 megabytes  
because the disciple felt that reading further scriptures is repetition of the  
same concepts with different symbology. Therefore he decided to consult sguru.   
3\. It is not that the disciple has not found any fulfillment after reading  
the scriptures, but that he has not found the level of fulfillment he is  
seeking in life.   
4\. The Silence means that sguru has not responded. Silence is a potent thing,  
so in silence many things can get clarified by itself. But in this case even  
after a long silence the disciple could not get the clarity. Any more silence  
is not helping him. He expected a response from sguru. Therefore he says: So?   
To be contn. ...

sguru: Have you installed a firewall?   
d: Yes, that was the first thing I did.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru is ensuring that there was no unwanted intrusions in the  
system. The scriptures have been read in a distraction-free environment. They  
were read not only for the sake of completion of page counts, but there has  
been contemplation behind the reading.   
2\. The disciple says that he has installed the firewall first thing. So he  
was already aware of this. This also shows the sincerity of the disciple. He  
is sincere as well as prepared, in the sense that he has built his foundation  
on the contemplation of some key scriptures.   
3\. The Silence here again means sguru has not responded for a long time. The  
disciple also contemplated in that silence but required some further ground to  
break. Therefore he says: So?   
To be contn. ..

sguru: What did you do after reading the scriptures?   
d: I have installed the software packages in the desktop of my being.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru ensures that after reading the scriptures the disciple was not  
sitting idle. What is written in the scriptures need to be practised.  
Therefore he asks - What did you do after reading the scriptures?   
2\. The disciple replied that he has installed the software packages. So the  
disciple himself is not idle and contended with mere reading of the  
scriptures. He has installed the software packages. Where has he installed the  
software packages? In the desktop of his being. When a software actually runs  
in the desktop of the being, it is expected to bring some transformation in  
the being. For example, it is a common practice to run a Japa module to bring  
transformation in the desktop of the being.   
3\. Next sguru again went silent. The software is installed. So what still is  
lacking? The disciple also contemplated on this. Then wanted sguru to tell  
something else. Therefore he said: So?

sguru: What software packages?   
d: Bhakti, Enquiry and Service packages.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Next sguru wants to know what software packages the disciple installed.  
Scriptures can mean a broad thing. Even black magic will fall under  
scriptures. So exactly what scriptures did the disciple read, and based on  
that what software packages did the disciple install. Were the scriptures and  
software packages relevant to spiritual development?   
2\. Here also the disciple showed maturity. He selected the software packages  
which he thought were directly relevant to his spiritual development and at  
the same time easy for him to run.   
3\. The Bhakti package aims to connect to God through devotion. The God Who is  
transcendent (as well as immanent) is worshipped in a form with particular  
attributes by offering the heart's devotion. In this way the human-divine  
channel gets awakened.   
4\. The Enquiry package enquires directly into the human-divine channel by  
enquiring into the I-sense.   
5\. The Service package serves humans by contemplating on their essential  
divine nature.   
6\. sguru again went silent. The correct software seems to have been  
installed. There is a good balance of karma, bhakti and jnana. So what still  
is lacking to bring greater satisfaction? The disciple also thought on this.  
Then wanted sguru to tell still something further. Therefore he said: So?

sguru: Are the software running ok?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru wants to know whether the software packages were lying idle  
after installation, or were they actually being run. Also was there any issue  
during installation which prevented the software from running properly.   
2\. When a software package is merely installed and kept, there is only  
Shravana (Listening). It stops there. Shravana by itself cannot bring  
transformation in the desktop of the being. It needs to be followed by Manana  
(Reflection) and Nididhyasana (Meditation). For that the software packages  
need to be run regularly atleast upto a predefined time duration. If the  
software is not producing any satisfactory result after that, it can then be  
uninstalled.   
3\. The disciple said "Yes". The software packages are running ok.   
4\. There was again a long silence. So what happened? The software is running  
but not producing result? That was the question lurking behind. sguru did not  
respond for a long time. So the disciple said: So?

sguru: Were the worldly attachments virus-scanned?   
d: Yes.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
1\. Next sguru ensures that a virus scan was run to scan for worldly  
attachments. Here the scanning function is different from cleaning function.  
First one should scan for the virus.   
2\. Worldly attachments are like viruses for spiritual development. God  
consciousness expands. But attachment viruses create their mini-worlds and  
drown the mind there.   
3\. There may arise doubts that in practical life involving relationships with  
parents, spouse, children and relatives, how can life proceed without some  
sort of attachment? May be there are good attachments like attachments to wife  
and children and bad attachments like attachments to drinking. Some  
attachments need to be there to maintain practical relationships. These doubts  
are natural and should not be solved in a hurry. One can take one's own time.  
Therefore virus cleaning is a separate process than virus scanning.   
4\. But how does a virus scanner mark something as virus? Maybe it is a simple  
relationship which it has marked as virus. Possibility of defects are there  
everywhere in software. Maybe the virus scanner itself is buggy.   
5\. However the virus scanner is not defective. It operates based on only one  
simple rule: Everything has come from God, so there is a natural relationship  
between everything. When God is kept as the bonding entity in a relationship,  
it is not a virus; else it is a virus. With this rule it may be thought that  
majority of relationships in the world are viruses. It may be so, but for  
spiritual aspirant relationships need to be connected with God.   
6\. The disciple said that he has scanned for viruses, so he has taken the  
bold step.   
Now what still is lacking? That was the question lurking in silence. sguru did  
not speak for a long time and the disciple wanted more ground to break.  
Therefore he said: So?   
To be contn. ..

sguru: Was any virus cleaned?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Next sguru wants to know whether any virus was actually cleaned. Virus  
scanning requires introspection and is a bold step. Virus cleaning is a bolder  
step.   
2\. With viruses of attachments present in the system, the actual programs may  
not run as intended. All the viruses cannot be eliminated. But the key ones  
which are directly affecting the "take off" need to be mitigated. The key  
software packages have inbuilt virus cleaners which will gradually purge the  
system. But those major ones that are not allowing the key packages to run  
need to be eliminated.   
3\. The disciple has actually cleaned some virus shows that the disciple is  
serious. Being serious the disciple seems to be dejected when his expectations  
are not met. Probably his expectations are more.   
4\. By default the virus scanner marks all relations which are not connected  
with God as virus. So initially parents, wife, children may all be marked as  
virus. However the mitigation of the virus is not difficult. It can be as  
simple as praying to the family deity that all family is under your  
protection. Now since the family gets connected to God, the virus gets  
mitigated. The virus scanner always challenges to examine each relation and  
other associations which can be potential attachments.   
5\. There was a silence as usual. Everything seems to have been done. Can  
anything further be done? The disciple still seems to have some more  
expectations from this dialog. Therefore he says: So?   
To be contn. ..

sguru: Are there any servers in the network?   
d: Yes, Temple Servers and some other Servers.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. A server is a system which serves others. It has mighty power compared to  
normal systems. In spirituality, Server is a realised saint who emanates his /  
her spiritual power serving others by that mighty presence.   
2\. Incarnations of God are Servers of very high capacity. The representations  
of them like scriptures are also Servers. A temple represents a Deity who is a  
Server. In that sense a temple is also a Server.   
3\. Without a Server, a person cannot progress spiritually. There must be some  
influence of a Server, if not explicitly, in a hidden way. Servers provide the  
holy company to grow spiritually. The desktops log in the Servers and enrich  
themselves, enrich their functionalities.   
4\. sguru asks whether there is any Server in the network; because without  
Servers one can get drowned by mere philosophizing. Only virus cleaning will  
not do. Because while cleaning the virus, one is only introspecting within  
oneself, basically the ego. But to get a feel of the beyond, Servers are  
required.   
5\. The disciple says that there is Temple Servers in the network. So the  
disciple is not spiritually isolated within himself. He visits temples,  
immerses in that environment and there may be more involvement.   
6\. The disciple also mentions "other Servers". This indicates that the  
disciple has some personal guru, but he does not want to give further details.  
sguru also did not press for the details.   
7\. The disciple is therefore not the disciple of sguru. The disciple is  
associated with a separate guru. That is why he already knows many things. He  
is by no means immature. The disciple is holding dialog with sguru for the  
first time. So sguru is only like an upa-guru.   
8\. There was a silence because sguru did not speak. When holy company and  
advice is already flowing, what more can be said? Temporary despair is natural  
in spiritual life. The holy company and "other Servers" will help in getting  
over it. But the disciple is not yet ready to quit. Probably he wants one more  
Server to get added in the network. Therefore he says "So"?

silentgreen,   
one may do without bashya (commentary) for brahma sutra. ..but in this  
sambhashan(dialogue) between sguru and disciple, the bashya is a must...ha ha.   
I enjoy reading this...looking forward to the 'poornima' day when the disciple  
would exclaim 'Vedahametam purusham mahantam,aditya varnam  
tamasaparastat'...ha ha

Dear Sri Ravi; Yes, this is a peculiar dialog which does not make much sense  
without a commentary. (Not that with commentary everything will make sense).  
It is enacted like the hidden protocols of software.

sguru: Is the guru package installed?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Guru is the power which takes one from darkness to light in the spiritual  
sense. Among all the powers we normally encounter in life, guru-power is the  
rarest one. All other powers work in the realm of the ego. Guru-power is the  
only power which works from beyond the ego.   
2\. If maya is translated as delusion (the Tantras in general differ from this  
due to their different outlook of Shakti), the first place where delusion  
strikes is the guru-power. If delusion cannot conceal guru-power it is no  
delusion at all. Once guru-power is concealed, the inclinations of life itself  
changes.   
3\. If we consider that the power flow in an individual is more or less fixed,  
then if guru-power gets hidden, power will manifest externally as power of  
cars, properties, gadgets etc. Once guru-power is felt, the role of other  
powers in life reduces, as if all the powers get subsumed in the guru-power.   
4\. Guru-package is installed only if guru-power is felt and the same power is  
used to uplift oneself spiritually. Taking initiation from a guru and praying  
to the guru for financial difficulties, son's or daughter's marriage etc. is  
not installation of guru package. Personal guru may have a role to play in  
these matters also but these are secondary. Guru package is installed if from  
the personal guru one can derive the guru-power and uplift oneself  
spiritually.   
5\. Guru-power does not specifically point to any human guru. It is a power  
which shows the light from within. A human being will be widely accepted as a  
guru only if he / she can kindle the guru-power within. Guru-power can also be  
sensed from non-human sources like vastness of Nature, dark cave etc.   
6\. Installation of guru-package is quite rare because it involves three  
aspects which themselves are rare. First is, one should be a mumukshu  
(desirous of moksha or at least a higher spiritual state than one is at  
present). Second is, one should have felt the guru-power. Third is, the aspect  
of guru-power felt is as per one's inclination; so one can uplift oneself  
spiritually with that guru-power. There is a long journey even after that, but  
one has now found a spiritual direction to uplift oneself.   
7\. Mumukshus are rare. They are a different breed. They have a different  
sense. An ordinary spiritual teacher can collect disciples by hundreds, but  
they cannot collect mumukshus so easily.   
8\. Feeling the guru-power is also rare. As mentioned before, among all the  
powers we normally encounter in life, guru-power is the rarest of all. The  
doubts which many people have whether God really exist is not adequately  
dispelled by appearance of God. It is dispelled only by feeling the guru-  
power. Because even if God appears in some form or other, the basic  
dissatisfaction of life can continue after God disappears. Guru-power makes a  
hole of light in life itself which continues to show the path.   
9\. Finding the guru-power matching one's inclination is also rare, because  
everyone has a unique bent of mind. On top of this, there are several  
influences in life which keeps the inner being of one in a dynamic state. So a  
guru-power to match that shade of uniqueness among million shades, sounds like  
that the power is tailor-made for one.   
10\. sguru asks about the Guru package as a follow up of the previous "Server"  
question. Having multiple Servers in the network does not mean that Guru  
package is installed, even if the "Other Servers" are personal gurus. Having  
Servers in the network may only indicate that appreciation of God has dawned  
in life. But are you committed in uplifting your own life spiritually? Have  
you found a guru-power within the Servers of the network? Does the form of the  
guru-power match your inclination so that you can use it? If yes, only then  
Guru-package is installed.   
11\. The disciple saying "Yes" to this question has brought a subtle turn to  
the whole dialog. This is because the disciple has now revealed that he is  
under an active guru-power. Hearing this sguru abstained from talking any  
further. sguru thought that when one is under an active guru-power, that power  
itself will guide him and the continuation of the dialog will be an  
interferance to that power.   
12\. The disciple understood this and also started contemplating. Was it  
proper for him to consult someone else when he is following a guru-power  
internally? Is it a disrespect for the guru-power revealed to him? Then the  
disciple thought about the initial intention of his starting the dialog and  
the way the dialog has proceeded so far.   
13\. There are two "Silences" shown in the above dialog to point to the above  
two separate contemplations. One from the side of sguru, the other from the  
side of the disciple. A change in the environment has also come in the dialog.  
Now sguru is seeing a guru-power behind the disciple. And the disciple after  
contemplating concluded that it is by the will of his guru-power that the  
dialog has proceeded so far, else it should have long concluded. So the  
disciple is also seeing the guru-power behind sguru. Thus both the Silences  
converged towards the guru-power.   
14\. Getting inner approval, the disciple prodded on and said: So?, although  
he was not sure whether sguru will reply.

This is a dialog between a disciple (d) and a software-side guru (sguru) on  
the subject of spirituality. The questions and answers are very brief. So a  
commentary is given below to understand the in-between thinking that is taking  
place. The questions and answers are taking place with a lot of silent  
contemplation in between.   
The discussion starts as given below.   
d: I have already read 1000 megabytes of scriptures. But still I am not  
getting the fulfillment I expect.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. The import is that the disciple has not approached sguru without any  
preparation. The disciple has already read 1000 megabytes of scriptures.  
Within that 1000 megabytes the disciple has already covered what he thinks are  
the key scriptures.   
2\. At this point the disciple has not gone for reading another 1000 megabytes  
because the disciple felt that reading further scriptures is repetition of the  
same concepts with different symbology. Therefore he decided to consult sguru.   
3\. It is not that the disciple has not found any fulfillment after reading  
the scriptures, but that he has not found the level of fulfillment he is  
seeking in life.   
4\. The Silence means that sguru has not responded. Silence is a potent thing,  
so in silence many things can get clarified by itself. But in this case even  
after a long silence the disciple could not get the clarity. Any more silence  
is not helping him. He expected a response from sguru. Therefore he says: So?

sguru: Have you installed a firewall?   
d: Yes, that was the first thing I did.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru is ensuring that there was no unwanted intrusions in the  
system. The scriptures have been read in a distraction-free environment. They  
were read not only for the sake of completion of page counts, but there has  
been contemplation behind the reading.   
2\. The disciple says that he has installed the firewall first thing. So he  
was already aware of this. This also shows the sincerity of the disciple. He  
is sincere as well as prepared, in the sense that he has built his foundation  
on the contemplation of some key scriptures.   
3\. The Silence here again means sguru has not responded for a long time. The  
disciple also contemplated in that silence but required some further ground to  
break. Therefore he says: So?

sguru: What did you do after reading the scriptures?   
d: I have installed the software packages in the desktop of my being.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru ensures that after reading the scriptures the disciple was not  
sitting idle. What is written in the scriptures need to be practised.  
Therefore he asks - What did you do after reading the scriptures?   
2\. The disciple replied that he has installed the software packages. So the  
disciple himself is not idle and contended with mere reading of the  
scriptures. He has installed the software packages. Where has he installed the  
software packages? In the desktop of his being. When a software actually runs  
in the desktop of the being, it is expected to bring some transformation in  
the being. For example, it is a common practice to run a Japa module to bring  
transformation in the desktop of the being.   
3\. Next sguru again went silent. The software is installed. So what still is  
lacking? The disciple also contemplated on this. Then wanted sguru to tell  
something else. Therefore he said: So?

sguru: What software packages?   
d: Bhakti, Enquiry and Service packages.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Next sguru wants to know what software packages the disciple installed.  
Scriptures can mean a broad thing. Even black magic will fall under  
scriptures. So exactly what scriptures did the disciple read, and based on  
that what software packages did the disciple install. Were the scriptures and  
software packages relevant to spiritual development?   
2\. Here also the disciple showed maturity. He selected the software packages  
which he thought were directly relevant to his spiritual development and at  
the same time easy for him to run.   
3\. The Bhakti package aims to connect to God through devotion. The God Who is  
transcendent (as well as immanent) is worshipped in a form with particular  
attributes by offering the heart's devotion. In this way the human-divine  
channel gets awakened.   
4\. The Enquiry package enquires directly into the human-divine channel by  
enquiring into the I-sense.   
5\. The Service package serves humans by contemplating on their essential  
divine nature.   
6\. sguru again went silent. The correct software seems to have been  
installed. There is a good balance of karma, bhakti and jnana. So what still  
is lacking to bring greater satisfaction? The disciple also thought on this.  
Then wanted sguru to tell still something further. Therefore he said: So?

sguru: Are the software running ok?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Here sguru wants to know whether the software packages were lying idle  
after installation, or were they actually being run. Also was there any issue  
during installation which prevented the software from running properly.   
2\. When a software package is merely installed and kept, there is only  
Shravana (Listening). It stops there. Shravana by itself cannot bring  
transformation in the desktop of the being. It needs to be followed by Manana  
(Reflection) and Nididhyasana (Meditation). For that the software packages  
need to be run regularly atleast upto a predefined time duration. If the  
software is not producing any satisfactory result after that, it can then be  
uninstalled.   
3\. The disciple said "Yes". The software packages are running ok.   
4\. There was again a long silence. So what happened? The software is running  
but not producing result? That was the question lurking behind. sguru did not  
respond for a long time. So the disciple said: So?

sguru: Were the worldly attachments virus-scanned?   
d: Yes.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
1\. Next sguru ensures that a virus scan was run to scan for worldly  
attachments. Here the scanning function is different from cleaning function.  
First one should scan for the virus.   
2\. Worldly attachments are like viruses for spiritual development. God  
consciousness expands. But attachment viruses create their mini-worlds and  
drown the mind there.   
3\. There may arise doubts that in practical life involving relationships with  
parents, spouse, children and relatives, how can life proceed without some  
sort of attachment? May be there are good attachments like attachments to wife  
and children and bad attachments like attachments to drinking. Some  
attachments need to be there to maintain practical relationships. These doubts  
are natural and should not be solved in a hurry. One can take one's own time.  
Therefore virus cleaning is a separate process than virus scanning.   
4\. But how does a virus scanner mark something as virus? Maybe it is a simple  
relationship which it has marked as virus. Possibility of defects are there  
everywhere in software. Maybe the virus scanner itself is buggy.   
5\. However the virus scanner is not defective. It operates based on only one  
simple rule: Everything has come from God, so there is a natural relationship  
between everything. When God is kept as the bonding entity in a relationship,  
it is not a virus; else it is a virus. With this rule it may be thought that  
majority of relationships in the world are viruses. It may be so, but for  
spiritual aspirant relationships need to be connected with God.   
6\. The disciple said that he has scanned for viruses, so he has taken the  
bold step.   
Now what still is lacking? That was the question lurking in silence. sguru did  
not speak for a long time and the disciple wanted more ground to break.  
Therefore he said: So?

sguru: Was any virus cleaned?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Next sguru wants to know whether any virus was actually cleaned. Virus  
scanning requires introspection and is a bold step. Virus cleaning is a bolder  
step.   
2\. With viruses of attachments present in the system, the actual programs may  
not run as intended. All the viruses cannot be eliminated. But the key ones  
which are directly affecting the "take off" need to be mitigated. The key  
software packages have inbuilt virus cleaners which will gradually purge the  
system. But those major ones that are not allowing the key packages to run  
need to be eliminated.   
3\. The disciple has actually cleaned some virus shows that the disciple is  
serious. Being serious the disciple seems to be dejected when his expectations  
are not met. Probably his expectations are more.   
4\. By default the virus scanner marks all relations which are not connected  
with God as virus. So initially parents, wife, children may all be marked as  
virus. However the mitigation of the virus is not difficult. It can be as  
simple as praying to the family deity that all family is under your  
protection. Now since the family gets connected to God, the virus gets  
mitigated. The virus scanner always challenges to examine each relation and  
other associations which can be potential attachments.   
5\. There was a silence as usual. Everything seems to have been done. Can  
anything further be done? The disciple still seems to have some more  
expectations from this dialog. Therefore he says: So?

sguru: Are there any servers in the network?   
d: Yes, Temple Servers and some other Servers.   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. A server is a system which serves others. It has mighty power compared to  
normal systems. In spirituality, Server is a realised saint who emanates his /  
her spiritual power serving others by that mighty presence.   
2\. Incarnations of God are Servers of very high capacity. The representations  
of them like scriptures are also Servers. A temple represents a Deity who is a  
Server. In that sense a temple is also a Server.   
3\. Without a Server, a person cannot progress spiritually. There must be some  
influence of a Server, if not explicitly, in a hidden way. Servers provide the  
holy company to grow spiritually. The desktops log in the Servers and enrich  
themselves, enrich their functionalities.   
4\. sguru asks whether there is any Server in the network; because without  
Servers one can get drowned by mere philosophizing. Only virus cleaning will  
not do. Because while cleaning the virus, one is only introspecting within  
oneself, basically the ego. But to get a feel of the beyond, Servers are  
required.   
5\. The disciple says that there is Temple Servers in the network. So the  
disciple is not spiritually isolated within himself. He visits temples,  
immerses in that environment and there may be more involvement.   
6\. The disciple also mentions "other Servers". This indicates that the  
disciple has some personal guru, but he does not want to give further details.  
sguru also did not press for the details.   
7\. The disciple is therefore not the disciple of sguru. The disciple is  
associated with a separate guru. That is why he already knows many things. He  
is by no means immature. The disciple is holding dialog with sguru for the  
first time. So sguru is only like an upa-guru.   
8\. There was a silence because sguru did not speak. When holy company and  
advice is already flowing, what more can be said? Temporary despair is natural  
in spiritual life. The holy company and "other Servers" will help in getting  
over it. But the disciple is not yet ready to quit. Probably he wants one more  
Server to get added in the network. Therefore he says "So"?

silentgreen,   
one may do without bashya (commentary) for brahma sutra. ..but in this  
sambhashan(dialogue) between sguru and disciple, the bashya is a must...ha ha.   
I enjoy reading this...looking forward to the 'poornima' day when the disciple  
would exclaim 'Vedahametam purusham mahantam,aditya varnam  
tamasaparastat'...ha ha

Dear Sri Ravi; Yes, this is a peculiar dialog which does not make much sense  
without a commentary. (Not that with commentary everything will make sense).  
It is enacted like the hidden protocols of software.

sguru: Is the guru package installed?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Guru is the power which takes one from darkness to light in the spiritual  
sense. Among all the powers we normally encounter in life, guru-power is the  
rarest one. All other powers work in the realm of the ego. Guru-power is the  
only power which works from beyond the ego.   
2\. If maya is translated as delusion (the Tantras in general differ from this  
due to their different outlook of Shakti), the first place where delusion  
strikes is the guru-power. If delusion cannot conceal guru-power it is no  
delusion at all. Once guru-power is concealed, the inclinations of life itself  
changes.   
3\. If we consider that the power flow in an individual is more or less fixed,  
then if guru-power gets hidden, power will manifest externally as power of  
cars, properties, gadgets etc. Once guru-power is felt, the role of other  
powers in life reduces, as if all the powers get subsumed in the guru-power.   
4\. Guru-package is installed only if guru-power is felt and the same power is  
used to uplift oneself spiritually. Taking initiation from a guru and praying  
to the guru for financial difficulties, son's or daughter's marriage etc. is  
not installation of guru package. Personal guru may have a role to play in  
these matters also but these are secondary. Guru package is installed if from  
the personal guru one can derive the guru-power and uplift oneself  
spiritually.   
5\. Guru-power does not specifically point to any human guru. It is a power  
which shows the light from within. A human being will be widely accepted as a  
guru only if he / she can kindle the guru-power within. Guru-power can also be  
sensed from non-human sources like vastness of Nature, dark cave etc.   
6\. Installation of guru-package is quite rare because it involves three  
aspects which themselves are rare. First is, one should be a mumukshu  
(desirous of moksha or at least a higher spiritual state than one is at  
present). Second is, one should have felt the guru-power. Third is, the aspect  
of guru-power felt is as per one's inclination; so one can uplift oneself  
spiritually with that guru-power. There is a long journey even after that, but  
one has now found a spiritual direction to uplift oneself.   
7\. Mumukshus are rare. They are a different breed. They have a different  
sense. An ordinary spiritual teacher can collect disciples by hundreds, but  
they cannot collect mumukshus so easily.   
8\. Feeling the guru-power is also rare. As mentioned before, among all the  
powers we normally encounter in life, guru-power is the rarest of all. The  
doubts which many people have whether God really exist is not adequately  
dispelled by appearance of God. It is dispelled only by feeling the guru-  
power. Because even if God appears in some form or other, the basic  
dissatisfaction of life can continue after God disappears. Guru-power makes a  
hole of light in life itself which continues to show the path.   
9\. Finding the guru-power matching one's inclination is also rare, because  
everyone has a unique bent of mind. On top of this, there are several  
influences in life which keeps the inner being of one in a dynamic state. So a  
guru-power to match that shade of uniqueness among million shades, sounds like  
that the power is tailor-made for one.   
10\. sguru asks about the Guru package as a follow up of the previous "Server"  
question. Having multiple Servers in the network does not mean that Guru  
package is installed, even if the "Other Servers" are personal gurus. Having  
Servers in the network may only indicate that appreciation of God has dawned  
in life. But are you committed in uplifting your own life spiritually? Have  
you found a guru-power within the Servers of the network? Does the form of the  
guru-power match your inclination so that you can use it? If yes, only then  
Guru-package is installed.   
11\. The disciple saying "Yes" to this question has brought a subtle turn to  
the whole dialog. This is because the disciple has now revealed that he is  
under an active guru-power. Hearing this sguru abstained from talking any  
further. sguru thought that when one is under an active guru-power, that power  
itself will guide him and the continuation of the dialog will be an  
interferance to that power.   
12\. The disciple understood this and also started contemplating. Was it  
proper for him to consult someone else when he is following a guru-power  
internally? Is it a disrespect for the guru-power revealed to him? Then the  
disciple thought about the initial intention of his starting the dialog and  
the way the dialog has proceeded so far.   
13\. There are two "Silences" shown in the above dialog to point to the above  
two separate contemplations. One from the side of sguru, the other from the  
side of the disciple. A change in the environment has also come in the dialog.  
Now sguru is seeing a guru-power behind the disciple. And the disciple after  
contemplating concluded that it is by the will of his guru-power that the  
dialog has proceeded so far, else it should have long concluded. So the  
disciple is also seeing the guru-power behind sguru. Thus both the Silences  
converged towards the guru-power.   
14\. Getting inner approval, the disciple prodded on and said: So?, although  
he was not sure whether sguru will reply.

sguru: Is a version management system installed?   
d: Yes   
\ Silence   
d: So?   
Commentary: 1\. Guru package puts one on the track of spiritual progress. But what is the  
proof that one is on this track and not continuing with life as it is. The  
answer is the version management system.   
2\. The version management system needs to be installed to monitor one's  
progress.   
3\. The version management system is tied to a set of activities one  
undertakes for spiritual progress. If the question is how can activities lead  
to spiritual progress, the answer is that these activities are specifically  
performed with the intention of expanding oneself in the core of the being.   
4\. Though the version management system is tied to a set of activities, the  
version upgrade happens on the being and not the set of activities.   
5\. The disciple replies that he has already installed the version management  
system. The disciple seems to know everything. So what can sguru do? sguru was  
silent. But the disciple does not want to end the matter even now. So he says: So?
