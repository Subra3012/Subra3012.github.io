## The Young age etc., and the Waking state etc.,  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 10, 2009, 03:44:10 PM

There are two types of changes for a human life. The first   
is with reference to body, which constantly changing from   
birth, young age, middle age, disease, senilty, old age to death.   
This is deha-maya. The other is with reference to the mind,   
which is in wakeful state, dream state and deep sleep state.   
This is mano-maya.   
Vyavruthasu... in these changing states, anuvarthamana...   
that which is constantly shining, aham-sphurna, is aham- aham...   
the I-I. What one seeker should do is to ignore the changing   
body and mind states, prakateekarothi bhajatham... constantly   
meditate on this I-I. Nan... Nan as Bhagavan Ramana said   
in Who am I? Then this I-I will become one's nature.   
For this what one seeker should do? He should pray to the   
Guru, Sri Dakshinamurthy, who is showing a hand-pose,   
Chin-mudra and this is Permanent, bhadraya.   
Verse 7 of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram states: Balyadhishvapi jagradhadhisha tata sarvasvayas thasvapi   
Vyavruthas-anuvarthamanam, aham-ahamityanta sphurantham   
sadha,   
Svatmanam prakatikarothi bhajatam, yo mudhraya bhadhraya   
Thasmai Sri Gurumurtaye, Sri Dakshinamurthaye!   
Now this Chinmudra or the handpose, is only a physical show?   
Sri Dakshinamurty shows his right hand, where three fingers are   
a little away from the index finger and this index finger touches   
the bottom of the thumb. This is physical chinmudra and for this   
the meaning is that the individual soul should keep away from   
the three impurities of karma, maya and ego and hold the   
feet of Guru or God. The feet of Guru is the sublime way of   
surrendering to ensure atma-jnana. Muruganar has written   
about 3000 Verses under Pada-malai, Garland to the Guru's   
feet. This is on Bhagavan Ramana's feet.   
But this Chinmudra refers estoerically another thing also.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Young age etc., The waking state etc., - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 10, 2009, 04:00:19 PM

Chinmudra also indicates atma vichara, which is like guessing   
the Self through Vichara, like one guesses the Fire when there   
is smoke. This aham-sphurti, the understanding of I-I, this   
" I am ness" leads to Aham, the "is-ness". This is called   
in Tamil as "Irunthathanai irunthapadi irunthu katti", from a Tamil   
verse. This "Is-ness" is indicated through "I am ness" by   
Guru or Sri Dakshinamurty, the Primordial Guru. This is   
about "mudhraya" in Sri D.S. Verse 7.   
Then, what is "Bhadraya". This Sanskrit word means Permanent,   
Welfare or Than in Tamil. This bhadram is the permanence of   
the Self, Atma, in all states of body and mind. It is Nitya,   
Suddha, mukta, bhuddha subject, the one without a second.   
Once one understands this Chinmudra and mediate on the I-I   
within, then he is not bothered about his states of body like   
old age, senility etc., and also about the states of mind, like   
waking, dream and deep sleep states, Jagrat, Swapna and   
Sushupti.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said that Atma Vichara is quite   
simple, because it does not a good body as one does in puja,   
karma etc., and a constant waking state, as is necessary for meditation and  
pranyama. It can be done provided you think   
with conviction that you are not the body or the mind. The only   
thing needed is Sraddha, attention. You can have this attention   
sitting on your bed without needing externalities. If you go   
to sleep, please sleep, in the morning it will automatically come   
for your attention as you wake up.   
Bhagavan Ramana sings ecstatically in Sri Arunachala Akshramanamalai, Malai  
Marunthida nee malaithitavo   
arun malai marunthai oLir arunachala...(Verse 76)   
O Arunachala! You having applied the remedy for my delusion,   
how can I still remain deluded? You shine, do you not, as   
the mountain-medicine made up of grace?   
 \- Trans. K. Swaminathan.   
This Mountain Medicine is cure all, Sanjeevini. This is both   
aham-sphurti, mudraya, as Sri Sankara calls it and "is ness"   
bhadraya, permanent as he further says in the same verse   
of Sri D.S. (Verse 7)   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Young age etc., and the Waking state efc.,  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 10, 2009, 04:27:02 PM

Regardless of one's conditions of the body and the stages   
of the mind, if one could constantly contemplate on this   
Mountain Medicine, it will help you to overcome all delusions   
and confusions. Only attention, Sraddha alone is required.   
For this there is no need for penance, tapas, no need for pujas,   
ritualistic worships, it needs only attention, Sraddha with   
convicition.   
Swayambu Manu gave only this Upadesa to Druva, the young   
prince. First Druva did tapas, got Narayana outside who helped   
him to get back his lost love and affections from his father   
and also the kingdom. But he could not get Atma Jnana.   
Swayambu Manu had to be deputed by Narayana during Druva's   
old age. By that time, he had lost all bodt vigour and his mind   
could not be steadied. What tapas can I do now, asks Druva.   
Swayambu Manu says: Do not worry. What is needed for   
Atma Jnana is only Sraddha -- attention, with conviction.   
(Srimad Bagavatam).   
Afer realization of the Self, what karmas are there for a Jnani   
to do? What anushtanam, rituals to be done? He should simply   
remain in Atma Nishta state, Jnana Nishta state. Their only   
Dharma is to be in the Self, Svanubhava. It is inseparable   
from Jnani like flower and its fragrance and sugar and its   
sweetness. Atma alone is Swabhavam, Svanubhavam.   
This is what Pingala the harlot said in Srimad Bhagavatam: Sameepe Ramaneeyam, Sameepe Ramaneeyam. This bliss   
of Ramana is ever the closest to me, it is permanent and it   
is eternal, it is all-welfare, mangalam...   
Svatmaanam prakatikarothi bhajatam yo mudraya, bhadraya....   
Sri D.S. Verse 7.   
Those who do not know Sanskrit, but who know Tamil can   
see the beautiful Tamil versification, which is in Complete   
Works or can see even Arthur Osborne or K. Swaminathan's   
translations in English.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The woman and the child in Atma Vichara.  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 11, 2009, 11:58:51 AM  
---  
Under Verse 5 of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Sri Sankara says: "Various pseudo-philosophers regard the body, the life-breath,   
senses of perception and organs of action, fleeting cognitions   
and the total non-existence as "I" (Atman). Their power of   
comprehension is comparable to that of women, children and   
the blind and the dull witted...."   
One may wonder as to how can Sri Sankara brackets the women   
and the children together for incomprehension of the Self?   
Children - Okay, they have not yet learnt much in spirituality.   
But why women? Is it all male chauvenism?   
Right from Vedic and Upanishadic periods, there were in fact   
women, who were self realized souls or ardent self enquirers.   
We have Gargi, Maitreyi, Mandodari (Ravana's wife) and   
Sabari (the old huntress in Ramayana) and Gandhari (Duryodana's   
mother in Mahabharatam. But in all times in Hindu India, perhaps   
right upto British colonization, the women did not even go to   
school. The home was everything for a woman. Making garlands   
for gods, preparing sandal paste and nice mouth watering food   
offerings, were the only religious or spiritual work for them!   
Invariably the husband was her guru and if that guy is a rascal,   
she is doomed. Sometimes, son, yes. Son can also help her   
to attend to self enquiry, when she becomes old. As otherwise   
women had practically no exposure for spiriutal pursuits. Sri   
Sankara has to reflect the culture of his times. For that matter,   
no Jnani or a saint does say that which is not in tune with the   
culture of his times   
As self realized true Jnani-son, both Sri Sankara and Bhagavan   
Ramana had helped their mothers to attain liberation at the   
appropriate times.

## The World, Causation and the Guru  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 11, 2009, 12:20:57 PM  
---  
We all see the world. Jnanis also do see the world. We see   
all sorts of causation and duality in the world. There is Guru.   
there is a disciple, there is father and there is son. There is   
dream and wakefulness. All these are there. But Jnanis do   
see these cause and effect differently. He sees everything   
as impermanent knowing fully well that all these are not at all   
his. He just plays his role.   
There is a baby sitter at home. She comes everyday to the   
owner's house. She takes the baby with all fondness, bathes   
the baby, adorns it and feeds it with all love and seriousness.   
She tells everyone: "He is my Hari, he is my Hari, my darling child.   
He is only for me. Who can love him more than me?"   
This baby-sitting lady knows that Hari is not hers. All her   
fancy and love and kind words are only a game, which she   
does very sincerely. Today evening her job may be terminated,   
or tomorrow she may have to go away. But uptil that time,   
she treats the child as her own, but not having ownership at   
any point of time.   
Now, who will help a seeker to go past his feelings of dualism   
and causation? It is only the Guru. Such a Guru, Sri   
Dakshinamurty confers the dispassion and non dual comprension, with his Grace,  
if one seeker goes to him with all sincerity   
and Sraddha.   
After vanquishing the dualism, what will happen? How will   
a realized Jnani see the world. For him too, there are gurus   
and disciples, wakefulness and dream states, day and night.   
But how does he see these pairs?   
Viswam pasyati karya karanataya svasvami sambandhatha;   
Sishyacharyataya thathaiva pitru putradyatmana bhedhata;   
Svapne jagrati va ya esha purusho maaya paribramita: Thasmai Sri Gurumurtaye nama idham sri dakshinamurtaye:  \- Verse 8 of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Woman, and the Child and Atma Vichara - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 11, 2009, 04:24:41 PM  
---  
By the time, Bhagavan Ramana came to the world as an   
avatara of Skanda, the times had changed. It was the first   
50 years of 20th century. The women had some light. They   
were going to school, reading English etc., This is the reason   
Bhagavan Ramana never mentioned women as deluded and   
confused like an insentient object. For that matter, He never   
distinguished betwen male and female and even neuter. In   
Manikkavachagar's Tiruvachakam, he mentions the male and female and the neuter  
several times. But Bhagavan Ramana mentions this gender difference only once  
in Sri Arunachala Nava Manimalai, Verse 4.   
O Lord who is the Light who is beyond male, female and neuter!   
Come and dwell within my Heart as Pure Awareness!   
Bhagavan Ramana saw everyone as Light only, not as male   
female and neuter.   
Again if you see Vivekachoodamani, Sri Sankara says that in   
order to attain liberation, one should be born as a human being,   
and that too as a Brahmin, should be well learned and then   
do Atma Vichara. But Bhagavan Ramana says that it is enough   
if one is born as a human being. He carefully omits brahmin   
and all that crap. Both the views are as per culture of their times.   
Bhagavan Ramana goes one step further and says that even formal learning is  
not necessary to attain Atma Jnana.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The recognition of the self identity - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2009, 10:15:53 AM  
---  
Sureswara in his Vartikam gives a nice illustration for this.   
By a recollection of the experience in a former birth, the new-   
born animal proceeds, of itself, to suck the mother's milk.   
Thus, just as Atman remains the same through all the varying   
states of jagrat, swapna and sushupti, unchanging though the   
body changes in infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, and old   
age -- so too, It continues the same while passing through the   
bodes of gods, animals, men and so on, when the bodies die.   
Pratyabhijna - recognition of the self-identity, is thus a source   
of right knowledge and it may be brought under pratyaksha,   
perception. Only the process is somewhat different.   
Present both before and after, both at the time of experience   
and at the time of recollection, Atman recollects the thing which   
has persisted in Itself in the form of a samskara, or latent   
tendencies   
Screened by the curtain of Maya, the Brahman emitted but little   
light. The curtain fully removed, like the sun It shines. Maya   
or Mother Unnamulai is called Tirodana-kariswari, (Sri Lalita   
Sahasranamam) one who   
places the screen, she veils. She is called avarana sakti. Veiling   
Power. The same Mother Unnamulai is also called Sadasiva-   
anugrahata, (Sri Lalita Sahasranamam) she confers Sadasiva, the Brahman, by  
removing the screen.   
Not from the operation of causes nor of the organs of perception,   
does this recognition come. To cause recognition is only to remove   
ignorance.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The recognition of self-identity  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2009, 09:59:17 AM  
---  
We have seen in the seventh verse of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram,   
that the hand-pose or Chinmudra is not merely physical but also   
refers to the Atman within. This recognition of the Self within   
the sensation of I-I, is indicated by Guru. This indication is   
is known as fire when we see smoke. The individual self rid   
of ego is the Self, Svatmanam, ever experienced within.   
In Sanskrit literature of Vedanta, it is called Pratyabhijna or   
recognition of the self-identity, that Atman is a persistent   
entity.   
Questions may arise as to what is this Pratyabhijna   
and what is its purpose?   
This is answered by Suresvara in his Vartikam of Sri Dakshinamurty   
Stotram. Pratyabhijna is not enumerated among the right sources   
of knowledge, along with pratyaksha, perceiving or seeing etc.,   
How can it be a pramana, a source of knowledge? The is en-   
lightened by the seventh verse of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram.   
Pratyabhijnana - consists in recognizing a thing -- in the form   
of 'this is the same as that ' \-- which, having once before presented   
itself to consciousness, again becomes an object of consciousness,   
at present.   
Just as in the case of external objects, an identical thing which   
is continuusly present, is rfeferred to in the words 'this is that'   
\-- all the accidental things of place, time and form being left   
out of account.   
I think, a long time back, I have given some example of this   
in one of the posts. Suppose I had earier a few years   
back,I had seen nonduel in France. Now, today, I see him in Tiruvannamalai.  
I shall tell my wife immediately, "this is that"   
(non duel).   
I shall not say that "this non duel who I am seeing now in   
Tiruvannamalai, today, is that non duel whom I had seen   
in France a few years back!"   
"this is that" \- that is all.   
This That   
non duel (I see now) non duel (I had seen earier)   
 \- recognition \- recognition   
Tiruvannamalai (space) France (space)   
now (time) a few years back (time)   
the individual self (jiva) the Self   
This Pratyabhijnana of Atman consists in His becoming conscious that He is  
omniscient, etc., after casting aside the notion that He is of limited  
knowledge, and so on,engendered by His association with Maya.   
How this recognition comes about?   
Arunachala Siva.

## The recognition of the self identity - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2009, 10:15:53 AM  
---  
Sureswara in his Vartikam gives a nice illustration for this.   
By a recollection of the experience in a former birth, the new-   
born animal proceeds, of itself, to suck the mother's milk.   
Thus, just as Atman remains the same through all the varying   
states of jagrat, swapna and sushupti, unchanging though the   
body changes in infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, and old   
age -- so too, It continues the same while passing through the   
bodes of gods, animals, men and so on, when the bodies die.   
Pratyabhijna - recognition of the self-identity, is thus a source   
of right knowledge and it may be brought under pratyaksha,   
perception. Only the process is somewhat different.   
Present both before and after, both at the time of experience   
and at the time of recollection, Atman recollects the thing which   
has persisted in Itself in the form of a samskara, or latent   
tendencies   
Screened by the curtain of Maya, the Brahman emitted but little   
light. The curtain fully removed, like the sun It shines. Maya   
or Mother Unnamulai is called Tirodana-kariswari, (Sri Lalita   
Sahasranamam) one who   
places the screen, she veils. She is called avarana sakti. Veiling   
Power. The same Mother Unnamulai is also called Sadasiva-   
anugrahata, (Sri Lalita Sahasranamam) she confers Sadasiva, the Brahman, by  
removing the screen.   
Not from the operation of causes nor of the organs of perception,   
does this recognition come. To cause recognition is only to remove   
ignorance.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The World as manifestation of Brahman  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 13, 2009, 08:59:13 AM  
---  
Tiruvannamalai represents Fire, among the 5 elements of nature.   
The Hill is very old, about 3 billion years, older than Himalayas   
and other mountains. This Hill came up, as soon as the world   
was formed. The Hill, Bhagavan Ramana says in the axis of the   
whole world. There is a counter-axis somewhere in Peru in   
South America. This was told by Bhagavan Ramana. Recently,   
this counter-axis hill called Mount Paachu has been discovered.   
There the aborigines pray to a Goddess called, Pachama, reminding   
us of Pachiamman Kovil of Tiruvannamalai!   
There are five elements and there are five Siva temples representing each  
element. Chidambaram, is Space. Kalahasti,   
is Air, Kanchipuram is Earth, Tirvanaika, near Tiruchirapalli is   
Water, apart from T'malai which represents Fire. Then the   
Sun and the Moon are represented by Konark Sun Temple and   
Somnath Temple, in Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. Like this Jiva   
is also a Sivam. Thus the count is eight, ashta murtam, as mentioned in Verse  
9 of Sri D.S.   
All these represent as Siva swarupam. Poet Kalidas says in   
Kumara Sambhavam: "Siva did agni-sacrfice before marrying   
Parvati. He prayed to Agni. Siva is only praying to Him!"   
The same concept is also said when we say: Sarvam Vishnu   
Mayam Jagat. All are Vishnu in this world.   
Actually Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram is only an Ashtakam, eight   
versed poem. This Verse 9 and Verse 10 are called Palasruti,   
the benedictions for the seekers of the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The World from Jnani's and Ajnani's point of view  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 13, 2009, 08:49:20 AM  
---  
As soon as we get up, the I-thought arises, and with this, the   
world and Isvara, the personal god. The world is seen by most   
of us as in dyads, good and evil, happiness and misery, fortunes   
and misfortunes, promotion and pink-slip, etc., But on self   
realization, the Jnani sees the world as the Self, Atma Swarupa.   
There is only unity, no dyads and triads.   
Jnani sees the world as unity with Brahman. There could be   
wars and peace treaties, there could be famine and prosperity,   
there could be social workers and politicians and cinema actors.   
There could be murders and child births, there could be thieves   
and policemen. But for Jnani all are one. One without a second.   
With God's or Guru's grace, the Jnani realizes the Self and all   
manifestations disappear. Nothing exists except the Surpeme   
Brahman. The Guru, Sri Dakshinamurty, is embodied in all   
things, animate and inanimate. The Brahman or the Sivam   
has got 8 manfiest forms. Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space,   
Sun, Moon and the Jivas. The Jnani sees them all as Sivam.   
There were many devotees to Bhagavan Ramana. There was   
Echamma and Mudaliar Patti, who gave Him food without single   
day of interruption for almost 40 years. But there were also   
people who harmed Him. Perumal Swami was there. There was   
an urchin, who urinated on His back, when Bhagavan was sitting   
with closed eyes. There was a bogus sadhu, who applied chilly paste on His  
body. For Bhagavan Ramana, all were one. When there were swarm of mosquitoes  
on the Hill, devotees said that they could all leave for a better place  
outside Tiruvannamalai.   
Bhagavan said: "Mosquitoes, what mosquitoes? If you want,   
you can all go away. I shall be here only." Here was a Brahma Jnani who  
never even harmed mosquitoes and bed-bugs. He saw them all as manifestations  
of Siva. Every Jiva is Siva.   
Burambhamsyanilo-analambara maharnatho himamsumpuman;   
Ithyabathi characharatmaka midham yasyaiva murtyashtakam,   
Nanyathkinchana vidhyathe vimrushatam yasmat parasmathvibos   
Thasmyyai sri gurumurtaye sri dakshinamurtaye.   
 \- Verse 9 of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Inauspicious omens and auspicious omens  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2009, 12:30:46 PM  
---  
Every religion has got its own inauspicious and auspicious   
omens. But in Hinduism, it is quite high. Now days have   
changed, but upto 1900-50, it was considered very important   
in life. People used to shun, if a widow comes on your stepping   
out of the house. The widows were, those days, had a tonsured   
head, and wore a white sari and with no kumkum on the forehead. Like this,  
there were many, many. People used to shun the barber   
(he is needed for your haircut on a particular day!). Great saints   
have abhorred this practices, since they consider every living being   
is Atma within.   
Basvesvara, the famous Veera Saiva Saint told a story. In a   
kingdom, the citizens abhorred a barber and complained to the   
king. The king took him to his palace and kept him. On the   
Day 2, when he was taking his lunch with the barber, a lizard   
fell on his food plate. He could not thereafter peacefully eat from   
a second food plate that was offered by the royal cooks. He   
looked at the barber and said: "Now I believe that you are an   
inauspicious creature. I shall hang you." The barber was   
taken to the gallows. He was asked by the servants what was   
his last wish. The barber said: I would like to talk to the king   
for two minutes. I have no other wish. The king came.   
The barber said: "Sir, since you were seeing me while eating,   
you said that the lizard fell on your food plate. But what happened to my  
case, see. I saw you before eating, and now   
I am in gallows. Who is more inauspicious, you kindly tell me!"   
The king became ashamed and he released the barber and told   
the citizens: "There are no inauspicous or auspicious things for   
any one in life. Only our perceptions are inauspicious and auspicious."   
Basvesvara sings: See every body as Siva and see their feet   
as Siva's feet. Do not kill any animal or bird for your pleasure,   
you are eating Siva. Do not harm anyone unless you are harmed,   
since you are harming Siva. See everything as my Lord, Oh,   
Kudala Sangama Deva, the Lord of meeting rivers!*   
*This place is called Kudlagi and is on the corner of two rivers   
(probably tributaries of Tungabhadra, in Northern Karnataka)   
and the Siva temple is quite famous and here is where Basavesvara started his  
Veera Saiva movement, a revolt against   
orthodox brahminism.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nimittam is part of Indian astrology, where the significance of good and bad  
omens are well defined. Bad omen portends bad event and good omens indicate  
good things.In Ramayana, when Sita was about to commit suicide on account of  
haressment of Ravana, good omens brought up cheer and she was saved.Soon,  
Hanuman appeared on the scence and things turned out well.   
Time makes lot of difference. Accidents occur in a flash.If a black cat  
crosses the way on your start, just pray for a minute and proceed.Like that  
foolish king, let us not catch that cat and kill. Instead, take the cue, check  
your things, pray and proceed.Let us not underrate the omens.Everything in  
this world is interconnected.Chirping of some birds warn the arrival of  
predetors for animals. This type of signals eventually become an omen.What is  
omen for believers is superstion for others.

yes of course there are omens....but let me try to explain..   
you go over the street, the black cat comes your way...you stop and pray..and  
you go on and in that minute a bus is driving very fast over the street (maybe  
out of controll) but you where still on the safe site, because you prayed..   
now what is that? grace of god? you could say that you read the omen well, and  
that god saved you...   
but you know what, the self does not know about such things at all..all of  
this happened in simple thoughles presence...the movementof the mind  
arose...telling you to pray, then it was the bus out of control etc...   
all of this is allready the self...so you can call it omen, superstition or  
whatever you like, it makes no difference for who you allready are...and I  
think subramanian was referring to this.....   
but i may be wrong and talk nonsense   
much love   
matthias

Mr.Maththias,   
Glad you accepted there are omens. Omens serve the purpose of symptoms and  
signals in worldly life.Ultimately. as Bhagavan vouchsafes, destiny triumphs.   
No doubt everything is contained in Self.Living in the state of Self  
transcends all worldly things. I believe that most of the forum members  
,including myself, are in the lower realms. When you come down to Mother Earth   
just like other things, take omens in its strides.

Dear arcsekar and matthias,   
The omens or Saguna Sastra is an age old science inter-twined   
with Hindu religion. But the story that I had mentioned is to   
highlight, the people over a period of time, add a lot of nimittams,   
which are not religion-based. Secondly, when destiny can never   
be conquered, these nimittams or omens is just to give a last   
minute caution and even if one observes it, still destiny will have   
its say. The best thing is to pray to God or Guru and then start   
off a thing or work. Jnanis help us out in crisis and Jnanis themselves do  
not bother about the omens and other such things.   
When Thanjavur Big Temple was constructed, finally when that   
large Lingam was to be installed on the avadai, or pit, the Lingam did not  
remain steady and was wobbling. Normally, they place   
a lot of herbals with honey-comb paste to serve as adhesive for   
the Lingam to stand erect. But in this case, despite all this,   
the Lingam was not standing stable. The Chozha King sent   
word for astrologers who came and told him that there might   
have been bad omens which were not observed earlier when the   
temple work had begun. Then they sent for Karuvur Thevar.   
He was a Siddha in Thanjavur. He came and saw the Lingam.   
He spat his betel leaves-arecanut juice from his mouth to the   
pit and told to the Lingam: "Siva, you now stand comfortably!"   
The Lingam stood without wobbling! Karuvur Siddhar poems are   
available in Tamil.   
Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Old Hall. It was a lunar   
eclipse day and the eclipse was to start from 6 and to go up   
to 8 pm. Hence the night dinner was postponed to 8.15 pm,   
as against the usual 7.30 pm. At the stroke of 7.30, Bhagavan   
Ramana looked at the clock and was wondering why the dinner   
bell had not rung. Someone said about the eclipse. Bhagavan   
Ramana then said: O, this is all you have learnt from the famous   
Tiru Jnana Sambandhar's KoLaru Padigam, where he pooh poohs   
the astrology and says that for a Siva devotee, nothing will   
affect him. He then proceeded into the Dining Hall. Others followed and took  
the dinner as usual at 7.30 pm.   
Arunachala Siva.
