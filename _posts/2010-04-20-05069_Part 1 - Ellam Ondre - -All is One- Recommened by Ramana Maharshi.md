## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says wealth, their fame and social position are transitory

**Some people are proud of their wealth, their fame and social position, but  
these things are transitory.** None can take them away after death. It is not  
good to be proud of wealth. You may say, "I am wealthy," but then there are  
millionaires, multimillionaires, and so on. _In the evening fireflies think  
that they are lighting the world; but when the stars begin to shine, their  
pride is subdued._   
_The stars in turn think that they are lighting the world, but when the moon  
shines, the stars are put to shame. The moon, too, believes that her light  
illumines everything; but lo! the dawn appears and the rising sun effaces the  
light of the moon. If wealthy people thought of these things, they would no  
longer be proud of their wealth._   
A householder! Revered Sir, we are householders; please give us some further  
instructions. Sri Ramakrishna: **First know God, then perform the duties of a  
householder.[p. 75 & 76]**

On another occasion, when I [Annamalai Swami] asked Bhagavan to select some  
reading material for me, he gave me a short-list of six books: Kaivalya  
Navanitam, Ribhu Gita, Ashtavakra Gita, Ellam Ondre, Swarupa Saram and Yoga  
Vasishta.   
He laid particular stress on Ellam Ondre, telling me, 'If you want moksha  
write, read and practice the instructions in Ellam Ondre'.   
 **Source** : from Living by The Words of Bhagavan   
 **PREFACE**   
MEN court happiness and shun misery. It is the same with other beings also.  
This holds good for the common run of mankind. But the higher order is bent  
upon right conduct, enduring patiently the good or evil that it may bring.  
Fellowship with these will be lasting, whereas fellowship with ordinary people  
will not be. Good will result to the world through fellowship with the higher  
order only.   
The question then arises: " **What is right? '' The point is important, but  
the answer has not been found. Why? Because what is right is determined by  
circumstances. However comprehensive a work may be written on the subject,  
there will always be circumstances not envisaged by the author. Therefore it  
becomes necessary to realize that state which will enable us to assess the  
various conditions and determine what is right.**   
That state is one only. There are no states like it. Although it is single, it  
is extraordinary that the worldly wise consider it exceedingly rare. Nothing  
can be more extraordinary than this. That unique state is very clearly taught  
in the Upanishads. In this book I have put down the same truth according to my  
understanding. I have considered it my duty. I do not claim originality. The  
six chapters of this book are so closely interrelated that some point which  
may be expected in one chapter may be found in another. Again a few points  
which may not be clear on a superficial reading will become clear upon closer  
study. More may be gathered from major works or Sages. Universal Mother,  
Master true, save us!   
\- The   
 **The Text**   
 **Chapter I - UNITY**   
 **1\. All including the world seen by you and yourself, the seer of the  
world, is one only.**   
2\. All that you consider as I, you, he, she and it, is one only.   
3\. What you consider to be sentient beings and what you consider to be  
insentient, such as earth, air, fire and water is all one.   
4\. The good which is derived by your considering all as one cannot be had by  
considering each as separate from the other. Therefore all is one.   
5\. The knowledge of the unity of all, is good for you and good for others as  
well. Therefore all is one.   
6\. He who sees "I am separate," "you are separate," "he is separate" and so  
on, acts one way to himself and another way to others. He cannot help doing  
so. The thought "I am separate, others are separate" is the seed from which  
grows the tree of differing actions in relation to different persons. How can  
there be any lapse from righteousness for a person who knows the unity of  
himself with others? As long as the germ of differentiation is there, the tree  
of differing actions will flourish, even unawares. Therefore give up  
differentiation. All is one only.   
 **7\. Ask: "If in the world all things appear different, how can I consider  
all as one? Is there any way of gaining this knowledge?" The reply is: "In the  
same tree we see leaves, flowers, berries and branches, different from one  
another, yet they are all one because they are all included in the word  
'tree'. Their root is the same; their sap is the same. Similarly, all things,  
all bodies, all organisms are from the same source and activated by a single  
life principle." Therefore all is one.**   
8\. 0h good man! Is the statement that "All is one," good or evil? Think for  
yourself. Just as the person will always be righteous who regards himself like  
others and others like himself, how can any evil attach itself to him who  
knows himself to be others and the others to be himself? Tell me if there is  
any better way for obtaining good than the knowledge of unity? Certainly other  
methods cannot be as good as this one. How can anyone love others more than  
when knowing them to be himself, to know them in unity-love as unity, for they  
are truly one.   
9\. Who can share the mental peace and freshness of the knower of unity? He  
has no cares. The Good of all is his own good. **A mother considers her  
children 's well-being to be her own well-being. Still, her love is not  
perfect because she thinks she is separate and her children are separate. The  
love of a Sage, who has realized the unity of all, far excels even the love of  
a mother.** **There is no other means of gaining such love than the knowledge  
of unity. Therefore all is one.**   
10\. Know that the world as a whole is your undecaying body and that you are  
the everlasting life of the whole world. Tell me if there is any harm in doing  
so? Who fears to go the harmless way? Be courageous. The Vedas teach this very  
truth. There is nothing but yourself. All good will be yours. Yea, you become  
the good itself. All that others gain from you will be good only. Who will  
work evil to his own body and soul? A remedy is applied if there is an abscess  
in the body. Even if the remedy is painful, it is meant to do good only. Such  
will be some of your actions; they will also be for the good of the world. For  
that reason, you will not be involved in differentiation. I put it briefly: The knower of unity will act as one should. In fact, the knowledge of unity  
makes him act. He cannot err. In the world, he is God made visible. All is  
one.   
 _Here is Chapter II from Ellam Ondre:_   
You   
 **1\. Who are you? Are you this body? If so, why are you not aware of a  
serpent crawling on it when you are in deep sleep? So then can you be this  
body? No, certainly not. You must be other than this body.   
2\. Sometimes in sleep you dream. There you identify yourself with someone.  
Can you be that one? You cannot be. Otherwise, what becomes of that individual  
on your waking? You are not he. Furthermore, you are ashamed of having  
identified yourself with him. Clearly, you are not that particular person. You  
are the one that stands apart from him.**   
3\. Recall the state of dreamless slumber. What is your state then? Can that  
be your true nature? Surely you will not subscribe to this belief. Why?  
Because you are not so foolish as to identify yourself with the massive  
darkness which obstructs you from knowing the state you are in. Discerned by  
the intellect from the things around, how can you admit yourself to be the  
same as ignorance or blank? Or, how can it truly be your real nature? It  
cannot be. You are the knower who knows that this state remains one of dense  
darkness veiling your true nature. How can you be that which you have  
experienced and condemned? Therefore you are not the dark ignorance of deep  
sleep. You stand apart from this too.   
4\. When it is said that even this gross body is not you, can you be any other  
thing which is yet farther away from you? In the same way that you are not  
this gross body, you are not anything farther from the body, nor the dream  
person, nor the ignorance of deep sleep. You are distinct from these three  
states and this world.   
5\. These three states can be reduced to two conditions only-namely, the one  
of the subject and object, and the other is the unawareness of the subject  
itself. The former includes the waking and dream states, whereas the latter  
represents deep slumber. All your experiences are comprised in these two  
conditions only. Both of them are foreign to you. Your true nature remains  
distinct from them.   
6\. If you ask what that is, it is called turiya, which means the fourth  
state. Why is this name used? This name is proper because it seems to say the  
three states of your experience-waking, dream and deep sleep-are foreign to  
you and your true state is the fourth, which is different from these three.  
**Should the three states, waking, dream and deep sleep, be taken to form one  
long dream, the fourth state represents the waking from this dream. Thus it is  
more withdrawn than deep sleep, also more wakeful than the waking state.  
Therefore your true state is that fourth one which is distinguished from the  
waking, dream and deep sleep states. You are that only.** What is this fourth  
state? It is knowledge which does not particularize anything. It is not  
unaware of itself. That is to say, the fourth state is Pure Knowledge which is  
not conscious of any object, but not unconscious itself. Only he who has  
realized it even for a trice, has realized the Truth. You are that only.   
 **8\. What is there more for him who has gained the fourth state?  
Practically, it is not possible for anyone to remain forever in that state,  
that is, the state of no particular knowledge. He who has realized the fourth  
state later wakes up in this world, but for him this world is not as before.  
He sees that what he realized as the fourth state, shines forth as all this.  
He will not imagine this world as distinct from that Pure Knowledge. Thus what  
he saw within, he now sees without in a different form. In the place of the  
differentiation of old, he is now established in the state of non-  
differentiation everywhere. Now, he is all. There is nothing distinct from  
himself. His eyes closed or open, howsoever the things may change, his state  
remains unchanged. This is the state of Brahman. This is the natural eternal  
state. You are that ever-true state.**   
9\. There is nothing beyond this state. The words, 'inward' and 'outward' have  
no meaning for him. All is one. His body, speech and mind cannot function  
selfishly. Their workings will be grace for the good of all. The fragmentary  
"I" is lost forever. His ego can never revive. Therefore he is said to be  
liberated here and now. He does not live because his body lives, nor does he  
die because his body dies. He is eternal. There is nothing other than he. You  
are He.   
10\. Who is God? He is grace. What is Grace? Awareness without the fragmentary  
ego. How can one know that there is such a state? Only if one realizes it. The  
Vedas laud such a one as having realized God and become one with Him.  
**Therefore the greatest good that one can derive from the world and the  
greatest good which one can render unto it, is to realize this state.** In  
fact, there are no states besides this. They appear in the state of ignorance.  
For him who knows, there is one state only. You are that.

Dear prasanth,   
What a coincidence again! I have already got Ellam Onre - Tamil   
version. This time in Asramam, I bought the English Version -   
All is One! The English version, has been slightly revised.   
Incidentally, I have read somewhere, that Bhagavan Ramana asked   
Annamalai Swami to write the Ellam Onre in a small notebook.   
There were not many printed copies those days. Annamalai   
Swami did not have time, since he had to supervise the construction   
of various buildings in the Asramam. So Bhagavan Ramana wrote   
it Himself and then gave the note book. The writing was as neat   
and crisp like printed version!   
Arunachala Siva.

Does the Ashramam sell the copy of the book which Bhagavan wrote Himself. I  
have not seen His hand writings.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Ellam Onre - Tamil version in Bhagavan Ramana's handwriting is   
not available in the Asramam, for purchase. This copy may be   
in Sri Ramanasramam Archives or there was one Annamalai Swami   
Ashram in Palakottu, where this could be available.   
Incidentally, one book containing Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam   
and Upadesa Undiyar and ULLadu Narpadu and a few other works,   
written in Bhagavan Ramana's own handwriting, is available in Sri  
Ramanasramam, a fascimille edition, in Tamil. In this there is also   
the drawing of the Hill as drawn by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

\- The   
 **The Text**   
 **Chapter I - UNITY**   
 **1\. All including the world seen by you and yourself, the seer of the  
world, is one only.**   
2\. All that you consider as I, you, he, she and it, is one only.   
3\. What you consider to be sentient beings and what you consider to be  
insentient, such as earth, air, fire and water is all one.   
4\. The good which is derived by your considering all as one cannot be had by  
considering each as separate from the other. Therefore all is one.   
5\. The knowledge of the unity of all, is good for you and good for others as  
well. Therefore all is one.   
6\. He who sees "I am separate," "you are separate," "he is separate" and so  
on, acts one way to himself and another way to others. He cannot help doing  
so. The thought "I am separate, others are separate" is the seed from which  
grows the tree of differing actions in relation to different persons. How can  
there be any lapse from righteousness for a person who knows the unity of  
himself with others? As long as the germ of differentiation is there, the tree  
of differing actions will flourish, even unawares. Therefore give up  
differentiation. All is one only.   
 **7\. Ask: "If in the world all things appear different, how can I consider  
all as one? Is there any way of gaining this knowledge?" The reply is: "In the  
same tree we see leaves, flowers, berries and branches, different from one  
another, yet they are all one because they are all included in the word  
'tree'. Their root is the same; their sap is the same. Similarly, all things,  
all bodies, all organisms are from the same source and activated by a single  
life principle." Therefore all is one.**   
8\. 0h good man! Is the statement that "All is one," good or evil? Think for  
yourself. Just as the person will always be righteous who regards himself like  
others and others like himself, how can any evil attach itself to him who  
knows himself to be others and the others to be himself? Tell me if there is  
any better way for obtaining good than the knowledge of unity? Certainly other  
methods cannot be as good as this one. How can anyone love others more than  
when knowing them to be himself, to know them in unity-love as unity, for they  
are truly one.   
9\. Who can share the mental peace and freshness of the knower of unity? He  
has no cares. The Good of all is his own good. **A mother considers her  
children 's well-being to be her own well-being. Still, her love is not  
perfect because she thinks she is separate and her children are separate. The  
love of a Sage, who has realized the unity of all, far excels even the love of  
a mother.** **There is no other means of gaining such love than the knowledge  
of unity. Therefore all is one.**   
10\. Know that the world as a whole is your undecaying body and that you are  
the everlasting life of the whole world. Tell me if there is any harm in doing  
so? Who fears to go the harmless way? Be courageous. The Vedas teach this very  
truth. There is nothing but yourself. All good will be yours. Yea, you become  
the good itself. All that others gain from you will be good only. Who will  
work evil to his own body and soul? A remedy is applied if there is an abscess  
in the body. Even if the remedy is painful, it is meant to do good only. Such  
will be some of your actions; they will also be for the good of the world. For  
that reason, you will not be involved in differentiation. I put it briefly: The knower of unity will act as one should. In fact, the knowledge of unity  
makes him act. He cannot err. In the world, he is God made visible. All is  
one.   
 _Here is Chapter II from Ellam Ondre:_   
You   
 **1\. Who are you? Are you this body? If so, why are you not aware of a  
serpent crawling on it when you are in deep sleep? So then can you be this  
body? No, certainly not. You must be other than this body.   
2\. Sometimes in sleep you dream. There you identify yourself with someone.  
Can you be that one? You cannot be. Otherwise, what becomes of that individual  
on your waking? You are not he. Furthermore, you are ashamed of having  
identified yourself with him. Clearly, you are not that particular person. You  
are the one that stands apart from him.**   
3\. Recall the state of dreamless slumber. What is your state then? Can that  
be your true nature? Surely you will not subscribe to this belief. Why?  
Because you are not so foolish as to identify yourself with the massive  
darkness which obstructs you from knowing the state you are in. Discerned by  
the intellect from the things around, how can you admit yourself to be the  
same as ignorance or blank? Or, how can it truly be your real nature? It  
cannot be. You are the knower who knows that this state remains one of dense  
darkness veiling your true nature. How can you be that which you have  
experienced and condemned? Therefore you are not the dark ignorance of deep  
sleep. You stand apart from this too.   
4\. When it is said that even this gross body is not you, can you be any other  
thing which is yet farther away from you? In the same way that you are not  
this gross body, you are not anything farther from the body, nor the dream  
person, nor the ignorance of deep sleep. You are distinct from these three  
states and this world.   
5\. These three states can be reduced to two conditions only-namely, the one  
of the subject and object, and the other is the unawareness of the subject  
itself. The former includes the waking and dream states, whereas the latter  
represents deep slumber. All your experiences are comprised in these two  
conditions only. Both of them are foreign to you. Your true nature remains  
distinct from them.   
6\. If you ask what that is, it is called turiya, which means the fourth  
state. Why is this name used? This name is proper because it seems to say the  
three states of your experience-waking, dream and deep sleep-are foreign to  
you and your true state is the fourth, which is different from these three.  
**Should the three states, waking, dream and deep sleep, be taken to form one  
long dream, the fourth state represents the waking from this dream. Thus it is  
more withdrawn than deep sleep, also more wakeful than the waking state.  
Therefore your true state is that fourth one which is distinguished from the  
waking, dream and deep sleep states. You are that only.** What is this fourth  
state? It is knowledge which does not particularize anything. It is not  
unaware of itself. That is to say, the fourth state is Pure Knowledge which is  
not conscious of any object, but not unconscious itself. Only he who has  
realized it even for a trice, has realized the Truth. You are that only.   
 **8\. What is there more for him who has gained the fourth state?  
Practically, it is not possible for anyone to remain forever in that state,  
that is, the state of no particular knowledge. He who has realized the fourth  
state later wakes up in this world, but for him this world is not as before.  
He sees that what he realized as the fourth state, shines forth as all this.  
He will not imagine this world as distinct from that Pure Knowledge. Thus what  
he saw within, he now sees without in a different form. In the place of the  
differentiation of old, he is now established in the state of non-  
differentiation everywhere. Now, he is all. There is nothing distinct from  
himself. His eyes closed or open, howsoever the things may change, his state  
remains unchanged. This is the state of Brahman. This is the natural eternal  
state. You are that ever-true state.**   
9\. There is nothing beyond this state. The words, 'inward' and 'outward' have  
no meaning for him. All is one. His body, speech and mind cannot function  
selfishly. Their workings will be grace for the good of all. The fragmentary  
"I" is lost forever. His ego can never revive. Therefore he is said to be  
liberated here and now. He does not live because his body lives, nor does he  
die because his body dies. He is eternal. There is nothing other than he. You  
are He.   
10\. Who is God? He is grace. What is Grace? Awareness without the fragmentary  
ego. How can one know that there is such a state? Only if one realizes it. The  
Vedas laud such a one as having realized God and become one with Him.  
**Therefore the greatest good that one can derive from the world and the  
greatest good which one can render unto it, is to realize this state.** In  
fact, there are no states besides this. They appear in the state of ignorance.

Dear prasanth,   
What a coincidence again! I have already got Ellam Onre - Tamil   
version. This time in Asramam, I bought the English Version -   
All is One! The English version, has been slightly revised.   
Incidentally, I have read somewhere, that Bhagavan Ramana asked   
Annamalai Swami to write the Ellam Onre in a small notebook.   
There were not many printed copies those days. Annamalai   
Swami did not have time, since he had to supervise the construction   
of various buildings in the Asramam. So Bhagavan Ramana wrote   
it Himself and then gave the note book. The writing was as neat   
and crisp like printed version!   
Arunachala Siva.

Does the Ashramam sell the copy of the book which Bhagavan wrote Himself. I  
have not seen His hand writings.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Ellam Onre - Tamil version in Bhagavan Ramana's handwriting is   
not available in the Asramam, for purchase. This copy may be   
in Sri Ramanasramam Archives or there was one Annamalai Swami   
Ashram in Palakottu, where this could be available.   
Incidentally, one book containing Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam   
and Upadesa Undiyar and ULLadu Narpadu and a few other works,   
written in Bhagavan Ramana's own handwriting, is available in Sri  
Ramanasramam, a fascimille edition, in Tamil. In this there is also   
the drawing of the Hill as drawn by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ellam Onre or All is One is written by one Vaiyai R. Subramanian. Bhagavan  
Ramana liked this book very much. The hand written   
copy was first given to Annamalai Swami.   
This Vyai R. Subramanian [V.R. Subramania Iyer] had also written   
the excellent Tamizh translation of Sri Tripura Rahasyam, from   
Sanskrit. This was published in 1930. Sri N.R. Krishnamurty Iyer   
had also prepared a hand written copy and was perused by Bhagavan   
Ramana and corrected.

After a long gap only last week I got hold of this book "Ellam Ondre" in Tamil

decided to read it as part of my daily sadhana.

Dear atmavichar100,   
This was personally recommended by Sri Bhagavan to Sri Annamalai Swami. He  
wanted him to write it in his note book and   
read daily. Since Annamalai Swami had no time, (because he was busy with  
construction work), Sri Bhagavan Himself wrote it   
for him on a notebook. What a gift by Sri Bhagavan!   
This was composed by one Vaiyai Subramaniam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanyam Sir   
Thanks for the inputs. I have read about it and it is good to refresh it again  
.   
Do you have any information about the "Vaiyai R. Subramanian" i.e did  
he compose it himself or is it a collection of his Guru's sayings etc ? What  
lineage does he belong to - saivam, advaitam or was he a devotee of Saint  
Ramalinga Swamigal as in the end he concluded with "Arutperum Jyothu Thani  
Perum Karunai Thunai" and this is used only by Saint Ramalinga Swamy and his  
devotees.   
Would be very happy if you have more info about this author and work.

Dear atmavichar100,   
The author must definitely be one of lesser known devotees of Sri Bhagavan and  
the work is only a collection of thoughts. \ He must have   
been with Sri Bhagavan in His very early years on the Hill, I am not sure.   
He has also rendered in Tamizh prose, Sri Triupura Rahasyam directly from  
Sanskrit. The second edition of this book came in   
1930 and that means it must have been written even earlier to 1930. There his  
name appears as Vaiyai R. Subramanya Iyer.   
The interesting thing is that this Tamizh translation of Iyer has got a guru  
stuti and a Tamizh poem titled Sri Tripurasundari   
Padigam. This clearly shows he was a Sakti worshipper. He was also a Tamizh  
Pandit in Thanjavur.   
(This is earlier to English translation of Munagala Venkataramiah of the same  
book.)   
Sri Tripura Sundari mentioned by Iyer is in the temple of TiruvaiyaRu about 8  
kms. from Thanjavur. So he belongs to that   
village near Thanjavur and should be a Sakti worshipper and also an Advaiti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear atmavichar10,   
I am not sure. Sri Iyer did not seem to have any special interest in VaLLalAr  
Ramalinga Swamigal. Perhaps Iyer   
refers to Arutperunjothi as to mean Arunachala, the Light that appeared before  
Brahma and Vishnu.

The VS Iyer that Paul Brunton visited is different from the Iyer who wrote  
Ellam Onre.
