## Thoughts on Easter - 04.04.2010  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 04, 2010, 07:17:00 AM

Gospel according to St. Luke: 24.1-12:-   
1\. Very early on Sunday morning, the women went to the tomb,   
carrying the spice that they had prepared. 2. When they found   
the stone rolled away from the entrance, 3. they went in. But they   
did not find the body of Lord Jesus, 4. and they did not know what   
to think. Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside   
them. 5. The women were afraid and bowed to the ground. But   
the men said: "Why are you looking in the place of the dead for   
someone who is alive? 6. Jesus is not here! He has been raised   
from death. Remember that while he weas still in Galilee, he told   
you, 7. "The son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will   
nail him to a cross. But three days later he will rise to life."   
8. Then they remembered what Jesus had said. 9-10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women were the ones who had gone to the tomb. When they   
returned, they told the eleven disciples and the others what had   
happened. 11. The apostles thought it was all nonsense, and they would not  
believe. 12. But Peter ran to the tomb. And when he   
stooped down and looked in, he saw only the burial clothes. Then he returned,  
wondering what had happened.   
(Later the disciples met Jesus in the village of Emmaus near Jerusalem! Jesus  
asked: "What do you mean, you were telling that I do not know what was  
happening there in Jerusalem during the last few days." The two disciples  
answered: From what they told us in Jerusalem, we know that Jesus was a  
powerful prophet, who   
pleased God and all the people... Jesus then led his disciples out to Bethany  
where he raised his hands and blessed them. As he was doing this, he left and  
was taken up to the heaven.)   
On this day of resurrection of Jesus, the son of Man, let us pray to the son  
of Siva, Bhagavan Ramana to do what would please Him and love all the people.   
Happy Easter, with hot cross buns!   
Arunachala Siva.

## what it means to care for another  
Author: grhluna             Date: April 04, 2010, 01:29:47 PM  
---  
today an important cardinal of the catholic church admitted openly in a church   
ceremony, the catholic church for years has been guilty of remaining silent   
to save its own image.. regarding abuse of children   
this is exactly what i want to see happening in the world   
people starting to care, people starting to act, against selfish interest   
what it means to care for another is not so hard to understand and to  
implement   
in your life, this IS God   
\- say all Him, say all You, not me!   
\- perform action for charity   
\- go to a temple dont sit and pray from ur mind, but offer to clean the  
temple, this is service   
 a temple is a house of God   
\- dont claim God to be only yours... how could this be?? in all of truth, how  
could such be??   
\- dont cling torwards wealth, the material, things you like to own.. you will  
always want more.. this all leads to ego.. more desires.. selfish action..  
self delusion..   
 in stead give other people what they need, what you have, and dont need, give  
it to them, who are needy   
\- why love God, aspire for Him to love you!!! you see a rich person and love  
him to get some more wealth, but you see a beggar and ignore him because you  
do not want to give this poor filty person a clothe or a coin or some food or  
shelter? serve the beggar, the rich person doesnt need your help   
\- you want to meditate, meditate with these same values in the heart, the  
values of compassion, dont meditate to attain heaven.. or a personal  
liberation.. meditate with the intent to help all of life! the lesson is about  
ego here.. to loose it.. not to keep it!   
\- they say serve somebody else, you serve your own self, how can this not be  
true?   
 you serve somebody you serve your own, if you do not take credit...........   
 this is exactly what for instance Christ teached all His life, and even  
gave His life for!   
\- when you have guidance, stick with it! dont you think everything will be  
provided to you, if you have such correct attitude of compassion? it will! you  
have to have the right goals, the correct attitude, the attitude of  
compassion.. your natural logic.. not some sort of, i am the saint here  
attitude okay   
the only required of you, is that you serve everyone with compassion, you  
serve yourself   
this is how you make progress.. this is the meditation required.. meditate AND  
serve   
dont just meditate alone   
\- care not for the violent, dont you think the One who guides you will also  
protect you?   
 how can this not be so? ignore the violent, this is not your problem, this  
is also ego   
\- and last but not least the man with a thousand books in his home will think  
God is with him   
but, the man with even the tiniest fragment of love for God in the heart, will  
KNOW   
God is with him   
this all, makes the difference you need, in order to make progress   
anything else is rubbish

## Guilt  
Author: Joey_               Date: April 04, 2010, 07:51:24 PM  
---  
Hey, what did Sri Ramana say about guilt? In my life guilt has been a great  
obstacle and one of the main causes of suffering. For some reason, in my  
family's and relatives' lives guilt has had an enormous (negative) role and my  
brother even commited suicide because of the suffering caused by the guilt he  
carried.   
One spiritual teacher said that guilt is never justifiable. I would like to  
believe that but I just find it very difficult. Even if I think ill willed or  
cruel thoughts, I feel horrible and when I try to just drop it, the feeling of  
guilt grabs me even harder. So I would just like to hear your comments about  
this.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 05, 2010, 03:25:37 AM

Dear Joey,   
Guilt essentially stems from a feeling or thought in your mind,   
that keeps on telling you that you have done something wrong,   
something criminal to others. Like death, in the case of guilt   
also, the 'feeling' or 'thought' is the prime cause that gives us   
pain. In case of death, the thought occurs before the actual death.   
In case of guilt, it occurs after the actual guilt. In both the cases,   
it is all thought-products, which keep on nagging you, like a toothache.   
What is the way out? In case, you are capable of self enquiry,   
one can ask for whom this guilt-thought occurs. It is not for me.   
It is for my mind. Am I the mind? No. I am the Self.... Like this   
one can try to overcome the thought of guilt. The other way is   
to surrender to God or Guru and seek his pardon and also seek   
his grace, to prevent you from doing that act of guilt.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "However much one is   
a sinner, without crying that I am a sinner, I am a sinner... one   
should meditate on Atma, Swarupa Dhyanam. Then there is redemption for him.  
God is the embodiment of Grace. Once a   
guilt is sincerely regretted and God's feet are contemplated, one   
can come out of it.   
The important thing to ensure God's grace is NOT TO REPEAT THAT   
ACT THAT WOULD GIVE YOU THE GUILT FEELING.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Do you know what I think of myself? I feel like a tiny ant not collecting  
sugar but trying to reach Arunachala which is the Hill   
of Fire. I know fully well that as I go nearer and nearer, I shall   
burn myself and lose my individuality. What else does this ant   
want? I should lose my personality and merge in the fire, the   
Hill of Fire, Arunachala (= Bhagavan Ramana). If I do not take   
even one step everyday, towards that Frozen Fire, I honestly   
feel that I had wasted that day.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Joey,   
Every saint had a past and every sinner has a future. Confession in church or  
temple before the deity and seeking pardon is one way to be free from guilt.  
Atonement and compensating the wrong act by performing a good deed is another  
way.   
Our acts are based on environment, circumstances and our mental level. Mental  
development/maturity is an evolution.It is not proper to judge the past deeds  
with your current/correct level of understanding. A man confessed about an  
illicit affair to Bhagavan and he was instructed not to feel guilty over that.  
Mahatma Gandhi in his autobiography confessed and regretted that while his  
dad was in death bed, he indulged in sex with his wife in his private chamber.  
Osho strongly criticised the remorse of Gandhi. After attaining the state of  
Mahatma,applying his benchmark of moral to the juvenile behaviour is  
frivolous.   
All time truth is, you are not the Doer and hence be rid of guilt.

Thank you all for your responses =) It seems that guilt mostly occurs when I'm  
tense and not feeling well so relaxing the mind seems very good antidote. Also  
self-enquiry what Subramanian.R recommended is helpful cuz I can't find "I"  
that is feeling guilty even though I complain about feeling guilty!   
Quote  
you have to understand that, you must learn to accept both good AND bad   
when you accept what happens, or happened to you, it flows back to you and you  
get healed   
there is a whole mecanism in the mind, the ego trying to avoid to fall back on  
its unreality   
it fills the empty gap with anything it can, it has fear   
negative image idealized image, attracting and rejecting and so on   
this is only ego and a gigantic unreality you must understand this first   
\--   
identification with body, mind etc etc   
so if you have problems with feeling guilty, come to an understanding life is  
both good and bad and not only good   
or not only bad......   
from life you have to pick the good, but you have to understand life is both  
good and bad...   
This sounds very true. One teacher often said we can be blissfully happy even  
when depression, nervousness and guilt appears. But this is just if we can be  
fully aware of those negative feelings.   
Nisargadatta also said that _Pain and pleasure are the crests and valleys in  
the ocean of bliss (ananda). Deep down there is utter fulness._

Quote  
what did Sri Ramana say about guilt?   
He said: "In the vast ocean of cause and effect, actions happen and impermanent results  
follow. If one takes them as ÂmyÂ actions the idea of having a free will gets  
stronger. **This sense of personal doership gives rise to a feeling of guilt  
or pride and effectively blocks the spiritual understanding that everything  
happens according to the will of God. "**   
Sri Bhagavan also said: The thinking mind can be temporarily suspended through the control of breath.  
**It can be annihilated only when there is total understanding that God 's  
will prevails all the time and the different forms are only puppets having no  
free will of their own. With this understanding three beautiful things happen: there is no ÂoneÂ to feel guilty or proud, to get frustrated or to have a  
sense of enmity. Life becomes simple.**   
and: Ramana Maharshi : You are always pure. It is your senses and body which tempt  
you and which you confuse with your real Self. So first know who is tempted  
and who is there to tempt. But even if you do commit adultery, do not think  
about it afterwards, because **you are yourself always pure. You are not the  
sinner.**   
and:  **When the enquiry, ÂWhat is the thinking mind?Â occurs, the thinking mind  
understands intuitively that it has no free will and stops thinking itself to  
be the doer and gives way to the feeling of ÂI AM.Â This is the Direct path.**   
We have to understand that the feeling of guilt is the means how ego gives  
meaning to its (apparent) existence. Also one zen teacher said that we don't  
want to give up the idea of free will, because the last thing we want to  
happen, is to lose the rewards! Of course, this is much more easier to say  
than do, but a lot of people have been able to do it. And as Sri Bhagavan  
said: What I have done is surely possible for all!

Dear snow,   
Very nice compilation. Both the act of unrighteousness and the   
'feeling' thereof are the products of mind-body complex. The   
'feeling" helps a person to somewhat prevent him not to repeat   
that wrongful act. The feeling and then the confessions which   
are mental and wordy is not a license to repeat the said act.   
If one could conquer the mind, he becomes pure, as you have   
rightly said whereafter, there shall not be repetition of such   
acts or any wrongful acts in life.   
Once again, nice compilation!   
Arunachala Siva.

joey   
you believe you are guilty, but this is not the problem. your suffering  
comes from your attempt to AVOID the guilt. simply turn and face the FEAR of  
being guilty. BE GUILTY, be guilty all the way 100 %. experience being  
guilty with no chance of ever not being guilty. what a relief to not have to  
fight it anymore.   
and in this relief, stillness, you will see the truth of it.

Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Nava Mani Maalai, Verse   
Seven:-   
"O Annamalai, you have taken hold of my Jiva and body, even on   
that day, what defciency is there for me. You are my deficiency   
and completeness. I shall not think about them. Let it be your   
Will hereafter. O my Eye, give me only abundant love towards   
your anklet-wearing feet!"   
Where is the guilt? Where is my goodness? You are both.   
Why should I worry about these? I should only have abundant love   
towards your golden feet. Guru's feet are the gates of liberation!

I found another wonderful quote from Sri Bhagavan about guilt and free will.   
"When the mind is absorbed, in work or otherwise, and the thinking mind is not  
active it may be said that the mind is in control temporarily, only to become  
active again. When, through the deep understanding that ÂGod is the doer and  
no ÂoneÂ has any control over thoughts and actionsÂ the thinking mind is  
totally annihilated, then it can be said that the thinking mind in that body-  
mind organism is dead and only the working mind remains."

Dear Joey,   
You are correct. When the mind is absolutely controlled or annihilated there  
is no thinking mind at all at anymore. But the work will go on for the seeker.  
The seeker does all his work through the Self, within. If still, someone  
wants to have the idea of mind, asking how can the work be done, without the  
mind, then Bhagavan Ramana had answered: (This is as per Saiva Siddhantam)  
that Suddha Manas or Pure Mind does all the work. This Pure Mind has no  
unwanted thoughts but only thoughts about the work on hand. This is not in  
Advaita. But Muruganar mentions about this concept of Suddha Manas, in his  
works.

Quote  
what did Sri Ramana say about guilt?   
He said: "In the vast ocean of cause and effect, actions happen and impermanent results  
follow. If one takes them as ÂmyÂ actions the idea of having a free will gets  
stronger. **This sense of personal doership gives rise to a feeling of guilt  
or pride and effectively blocks the spiritual understanding that everything  
happens according to the will of God. "**   
Sri Bhagavan also said: The thinking mind can be temporarily suspended through the control of breath.  
**It can be annihilated only when there is total understanding that God 's  
will prevails all the time and the different forms are only puppets having no  
free will of their own. With this understanding three beautiful things happen: there is no ÂoneÂ to feel guilty or proud, to get frustrated or to have a  
sense of enmity. Life becomes simple.**   
and:  **When the enquiry, ÂWhat is the thinking mind?Â occurs, the thinking mind  
understands intuitively that it has no free will and stops thinking itself to  
be the doer and gives way to the feeling of ÂI AM.Â This is the Direct path.**   
This is all I needed to hear! Now I will atleast intellectually always know  
that guilt is just part of egos surviving methods.   
I'm very sorry, but I found out that these were from commentary of 'Upadesa  
Saram', not from the original text itself. But still this quote is from Sri  
Bhagavan himself and it should be enough   
"But still the You are always pure. It is your senses and body which tempt you  
and which you confuse with your real Self. So first know who is tempted and  
who is there to tempt. But even if you do commit adultery, do not think about  
it afterwards, because you are yourself always pure. You are not the sinner."   
And here is a couple more: " **The only freedom** man has is to strive for and acquire the jnana which  
will enable him not to identify himself with the body. The body will go  
through the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha and a man is free either  
to identify himself with the body and be attached to the fruits of its  
actions, or to be detached from it and be a mere witness of its activities."   
"Whatever this body is to do and whatever experiences it is to pass through  
was already decided when it   
came into existence."   
"How is the mind known to us? Owing to its activities, namely,   
thoughts. **Whenever thoughts arise remember they are all modes   
of God and they cannot be otherwise**, this is enough; this is   
the surrender of the mind. Can anything exist independent of God? All is God  
alone.   
He acts through all. Why worry ourselves?"

Dear Joey, I think all realised souls said that guilt is not good.It makes you  
weak and depressed.Sri Ramakrishna was always saying that every sinner can be  
a saint,and every saint can be a sinner.You will reap the fruit of your every  
action.Thats punishment.Whay then need to feel guilty?Just try to learn from  
that experience,and then close that door forewer.Only then you can go forward.

If you had been guilty due to any acts in the past, forget about   
them. Do not do any act of guilt, from now on. Nurturing thoughts   
about guilt are the greater pain or sin, than the act per se.   
Doing guilt again and again and then seeking forgiveness from   
God/Guru is the most despicable act. It is not like week-end   
washing of your soiled clothes, through a washing machine.   
This is what Bhagavan Ramana cautioned against.   
Arunachala Siva.
