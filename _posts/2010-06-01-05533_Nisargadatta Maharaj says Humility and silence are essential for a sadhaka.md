Chapter 26: Personality, an Obstacle   
Q: Why do you keep on dismissing the person (vyakti) as of no importance?  
Personality is the primary fact of our existence. It occupies the entire  
stage.   
M: As long as you do not see that it is mere habit, built on memory, prompted  
by desire, you will think yourself to be a person -- living, feeling,  
thinking, active, passive, pleased or pained. Question yourself, ask yourself.  
'Is it so?' 'Who am l'? 'What is behind and beyond all this?' And soon you  
will see your mistake. And it is in the very nature of a mistake to cease to  
be, when seen.   
Q: Sharada Devi, wife of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, used to scold his  
disciples for too much effort. She compared them to mangoes on the tree which  
are being plucked before they are ripe. 'Why hurry?' she used to say. 'Wait  
till you are fully ripe, mellow and sweet.'   
M: How right she was! There are so many who take the dawn for the noon, a  
momentary experience for full realisation and destroy even the little they  
gain by excess of pride. **Humility and silence are essential for a sadhaka,  
however advanced.** Only a fully ripened jnani can allow himself complete  
spontaneity.   
Q: It seems there are schools of Yoga where the student, after illumination,  
is obliged to keep silent for 7 or 12 or 15 or even 25 years. Even Bhagavan  
Sri Ramana Maharshi imposed on himself 20 years of silence before he began to  
teach.   
M: Yes, the inner fruit must ripen. Until then the discipline, the living in  
awareness, must go on. Gradually the practice becomes more and more subtle,  
until it becomes altogether formless.   
Q: Krishnamurti too speaks of living in awareness.   
M: He always aims directly at the 'ultimate'. Yes, ultimately all Yogas end in  
your adhi yoga, the marriage of consciousness (the bride) to life (the  
bridegroom). Consciousness and being (sad-chit) meet in bliss (ananda). For  
bliss to arise there must be meeting, contact, the assertion of unity in  
duality.   
Q: Buddha too has said that for the attainment of nirvana one must go to  
living beings. Consciousness needs life to grow.   
M: The world itself is contact -- the totality of all contacts actualised in  
consciousness. The spirit touches matter and consciousness results. Such  
consciousness. when tainted with memory and expectation, becomes bondage.  
**Pure experience does not bind; experience caught between desire and fear is  
impure and creates karma.**

Dear prasanth,   
Bhagavan Ramana also spoke of Silence, as the un-inturrpted   
talk. Silence and perseverance are also His recommendations.   
Arunachala Siva.
