We both went dead silent. The silence hung thick in the air for a few  
minutes. Then, I said to my sister,   
'Do you feel that?' She replied, 'Yes.' I asked, 'What does it feel like to  
you?' She said, 'There is a   
force field all around me. The silence is overpowering.' I said, 'There is a  
force field all around me.   
The silence is overpowering.' I said, 'I feel something like liquid plastic  
permeating the air and there is   
energy pulsing through it. It is like a liquid, tangible Consciousness.' I  
really cannot come up with a   
physical example that accurately depicts this force field.   
We drove to the Sri Ramanasramam. The force field was still palpably felt.  
It was so strong and so tangible   
that it was easily felt wherever we went. It was as though we had entered  
into the aura of Arunachala   
and the experience continued. The incredible thunderous silence continued.   
We went into Sri Ramana's shrine and it was there. It was there in the  
Mother's temple. It was there   
in the accommodation office. Then we walked up the Caves where Sri Ramana had  
spent twenty three   
years. We entered the Virupaksha Cave and it was there. We entered  
Skandasramam and it was there.   
The force field and silence ever present, a physical Presence.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
