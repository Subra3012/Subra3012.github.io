**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 171-172**   
Hearing the narrative of the Brahmana about birth of Draupadi, and also  
listening of the Draupadi's swayamvara, Pandavas with their mother set out  
towards Panchala kingdom. While they were living in Ekachakra town, Vyasa  
visited them once more to tell them about their future wife.   
There lived a certain maiden in a rishis hermitage. Due to her past karma, she  
couldn't get married in that life. So she did great penance pleasing Lord  
Shankara. Shiva being Bhaktavatsala appeared before her and told her to ask  
any boon she wants. She asked him for a husband with various qualities,  
repeatedly. **Lord Shankara then granted that boon and said, she will have  
five husbands from Bharata clan. She said, "Lord, I want only one husband", to  
this the Lord said, "You asked for a husband, five times, hence you will have  
five husbands in your next life".**   
Having narrated the above story, Vyasa then said to Pandavas "Sons, that  
damsel is reborn as Draupadi to Panchala king, Drupada. She is set aside as  
the Queen for all five of you. Go to Panchala and obtain her as your wife".   
 **Reflections From the Story:**   
 **When people pray, they have to make a sankalpa (statement of intention)  
properly and their objective should be clear in their mind.** One has to be  
careful what one utters, and also what one thinks apart from being careful  
about actions. **So we need to be careful even in your thoughts, not only in  
your actions.Budhdha also said, One has to be clear about the objective of  
their prayers.**

Most of the times we do not know what to ask, how to ask and when to ask. We  
are child in front of God (of course we are the children of Him) So it is  
better to ask such way, to grant NIRMALA BHAKTHI and achanchala Bhakthi. If we  
have bhakthi it will lead to accept the life which way it comes.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Once Akhilandamma asked Bhagavan Ramana for some Upadesam.   
What Bhagavan Ramana could give? He told Akhilandamma: "Unnaiye unakku kodu". You give your Self to you! Akhilandamma   
did not understand this at all. However, she pursued with a   
prayer to Arunachala: Ennaiye enakku kodu. Give me my Self to me!   
She led her entire life serving Bhagavan and Mother Azhagamma without any  
sankalpa for her and merely seeking the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
