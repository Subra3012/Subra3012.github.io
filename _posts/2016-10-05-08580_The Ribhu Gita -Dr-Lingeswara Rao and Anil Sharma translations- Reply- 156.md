17. I alone am the universal Self. Indeed, I alone am. I alone am the supreme Brahman. I alone   
am beyond the beyond.   
18. I alone am the joy of awareness. I alone am happiness and unhappiness. I alone am the ideal of the   
Guru too. I alone am the infallible ever.   
19. I alone am the end of the Vedas. I alone am brooding. I am the body, verily the pure consciousness.   
I am bereft of doubt.   
20. I alone am the supreme light. I alone am the supreme state. I alone am the indestructible Self.   
I alone am the ancient.   
21\. I am Brahman - there is no doubt of this. I alone am the part-less. I  
am the fourth - there is no   
doubt. I am the Self, there is no doubt.   
22\. I lack even 'I'. I am purged of the 'I' concept. I alone am the end of  
notions. I alone am elegance.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
