The individual encompasses his own creation with his ego (as âIâ); so does  
the Lord play with the universe. Just as the dreamer is not to be confounded  
with the dream so is the Lord not to be confounded with the creation. Just as  
a man survives his dream, so does the Lord survive the dissolution of His  
creation. Just as you remain ever as pure consciousness apart from the body,  
etc., so is the Lord, unbounded consciousness apart from the universe, etc. Is  
it not after all only a picture drawn by Him on His Self? How can this unique  
creation be apart from Him? There can indeed be nothing but consciousness.  
Tell me of any place where there is no consciousness; there is no place beyond  
consciousness. Or can anyone prove in any manner anything outside  
consciousness? Consciousness is inescapable.   
Moreover, this consciousness is the only existence,covering the whole  
universe, and perfect all through.Just as there cannot be breakers apart from  
the ocean and light without the Sun, so also the universe cannot be conceived  
without consciousness. The Supreme God is thus the embodiment of pure  
Consciousness.   
The universe has thus originated only as an image on the surface of the mirror  
of the Absolute. This conclusion is in harmony with all facts.   
Creation is like a magicianâs trick, and is a city born of divine  
imagination. O Parasurama, you are aware of the mental creations of  
daydreamers which are full of people, life and work, similar to this. There  
are also doubts,tests, discussions and conclusions â all imaginary arising  
in the mind and subsiding there. Just as castles in the air are mental  
figments of men so also is this creation a mental figment of Siva. Siva is  
absolute Awareness, without any form. Sri Tripura is Sakti (energy) and  
Witness of the whole.That Being is perfect all round and remains undivided.   
The world cannot stand investigation because of its changing unreal nature.  
Just as the owl is dazzled and blinded by bright sunlight, so the world  
parades in glory before ignorance and disappears before right analysis.   
[Note: The man sees by sunlight and is helpless in its absence. The owl sees  
in darkness and is blinded in sunlight. Whose sight is the better of the two?  
This cannot be determined satisfactorily so that investigation becomes lame.]   
As long as the ignorance of the self lasts, so long will there be misery.   
The Sun helps all to see, but blinds the owls; water is the abode of fishes,  
but drowns man; fire burns a man, but is food to tittiri (a species of bird);  
fire is ordinarily put out by water, but it flourishes in the middle of the  
ocean at the time of dissolution. Similar discrepancies are evident elsewhere.   
Men and animals engage in activities with their limbs and senses, whereas  
spirits do so with the bodies of others. Instances like these are innumerable.   
Sight is of the eye and cannot be without it.A jaundiced eye sees everything  
yellow and diplopia produces a double image of a single object.   
Abnormal visions are thus the direct result of abnormal eyes. The Karandakas,  
in an Eastern island, are said to see everything red; so also the inhabitants  
of Ramanaka Isle see everything upside down.   
One hears many more strange stories of the kind, all of which are based on  
abnormalities of vision. They can all be remedied by proper treatment. The  
same applies to other senses,including the mind.   
The relation between space and objects and between time and events is  
according to your estimate of them; there is no intrinsic relationship between  
them.   
Just as the mirror remains unaffected by the passage of different images and  
yet continues to reflect as clearly as before, so also the one consciousness  
illumines the waking and dream states which can be verified by proper  
meditation.   
Therefore recognise the fact that the world is simply an image on the mirror  
of consciousness and cultivate the contemplation of âI amâ, abide as pure  
being and thus give up this delusion of the reality of the world.   
True experience of the Self is the unawareness of even âI amâ. Can the  
world persist after such unawareness? Second-hand knowledge is no better than  
the recollection   
of a dream.   
Just as the accession of treasure in a dream is useless, so also is second-  
hand knowledge.   
The whole world is manifested in it like a city in a mirror. Such is that  
transcendental state. On realising it, one becomes immortal; there is no place  
for doubts and uncertainties, as there is none at the sight of a reflection in  
a mirror; there is no more reason for ignorance as at the sight of innumerable  
reflected images; and there will be no more room for desire, because  
transcendence is then experienced.   
Just as a prince labours under a misapprehension that the string of pearls  
still clinging to his neck has been stolen away by another and is not  
persuaded to the contrary by mere words but only believes when he finds it  
around his neck by his own effort, so also, O youth, however clever a man may  
be, he will never know his own self by the mere teaching of others unless he  
realises it for himself. Otherwise he can never realise the Self if his mind  
is turned outward.   
Everybody fails in this investigation however learned and proficient he may  
be, because his mind is not bent inward but restlessly moves outward. As long  
as thoughts crop up, so long has the turning inward of the mind not been  
accomplished. As long as the mind is not inward, so long the Self cannot be  
realised. Turning inward means absence of desire. How can the mind be fixed  
within if desires are not given up?   
You are not the body, nor the senses, nor the mind, because they are all  
transient. The body is composed of food, so how can you be the body?   
Concentration on a particular item is necessary for the perception of external  
things. But since consciousness is the Self and not apart from the mind,  
concentration on it is not necessary for its realisation. It is enough that  
other perceptions (namely,thoughts) should be eliminated from the mind and  
then the Self will be realised.   
Therefore it was also said that the sole necessity for Self-realisation is  
purity of mind. The only impurity of the mind is thought. To make it thought-  
free is to keep it pure.   
The mind is truly abstracted in sleep. But then its light is screened by  
darkness, so how can it manifest its true nature? A mirror covered with tar  
does not reflect   
images, but can it reflect space also? Is it enough, in that case, that images  
are eliminated in order to reveal the space reflected in the mirror? In the  
same manner, the mind is veiled by the darkness of sleep and rendered unfit  
for illumining thoughts. Would such eclipse of the mind reveal the glimmer of  
consciousness?   
Moreover, pursue the analogy of a tarred mirror. The tar may prevent the  
images from being seen, but the quality of the mirror is not affected, for the  
outer coating of tar must be reflected in the interior of the mirror. So also  
the mind, though diverted from dreams and wakefulness, is still in the grip of  
dark sleep and not free from qualities.This is evident by the recollection of  
the dark ignorance of sleep when one wakes.   
Sri Sankara has said in Soundarya Lahari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He  
cannot even stir in Her absence.Siva should not therefore be considered to be  
a mere inexpressible entity depending for His movements upon Maya (like a man  
on his car). Sri Sankara continues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to His  
true being. Therefore a blessed few worship Thee as the endless series of  
waves of bliss, as the underlying basis of all that is, as the Supreme Force,  
maintaining the universe, and as the Consort of Transcendence. Thus the  
identity of Siva and Sakti with each other or with Transcendence is evident.   
When the pictures on a wall are erased, the original wall remains. No other  
work is necessary to restore its original condition.   
Similarly, the mind remains pure when thoughts are eliminated. Therefore the  
unqualified state is restored if the present disturbance is ended.   
Therefore rule out creation as a mere thought or series of thoughts and  
realise the non-dual, residual, pure intelligence as the Self.   
Second-hand knowledge of the Self gathered from books or Gurus can never  
emancipate a man until its truth is rightly investigated and applied to  
himself; direct Realisation alone will do that. Therefore, follow my advice  
and realise yourself, turning the mind inward.   
To imagine that the Self is shackled by mental projections is to imagine that  
the fire reflected in a mirror can burn it. There is absolutely no bondage  
beyond the foolish certainty that you are bound and the difference of entity  
created by mind. Until these two blemishes are washed away by the holy waters  
of investigation into the Self, neither I, nor Brahma the Creator, nor Vishnu,  
nor Siva, nor even Sri Tripura, the Goddess of Wisdom, can help that person to  
be emancipated.

Tripura Rahasya is an ancient prime text on Advaita in Sanskrit and was highly  
commended by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi for study by seekers. There was no  
English translation of this scripture until the present one was made by  
Munagala Venkataramiah (Swami Ramanananda Saraswathi) in 1938.

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Part1

The feeling of a need to work in order to gain happiness (being the index of  
misery) is the misery of miseries. How can there be pleasure or removal of  
pain so long as it continues?   
Only those who need not engage in action, are happy; they are perfectly  
content, and self-contained, and they experience a happiness which extends to  
all the pores of the body.   
Wrongly do they ever engage in work, being deluded; such is the plight of  
humanity stupefied by the poison of the sense of obligation.   
Confounding dispassion (vairagya) with misery,and the pleasures of the world  
with happiness (sukha), a man suffers in the cycle of births and deaths, while  
powerful ignorance prevails.   
Association with the Sages is alone said to lead to the highest good. Your  
contact with Samvarta has led you to this stage of enlightenment, which is the  
forerunner of emancipation. On being approached, the Sages teach the greatest  
good.   
Misery is of two kinds, external and internal.The former pertains to the body  
and is caused by the nerves, etc.; the latter pertains to the mind and is  
caused by desire.   
Mental distraction is worse than physical pain and the whole world has fallen  
a victim to it. Desire is the seed of the tree of misery and never fails in  
its fruits.   
Respite gained by the fulfilment of one desire before another takes its place,  
is not happiness, because the seeds of pain are still latent. Such respite is  
enjoyed by the insects also (which certainly do not typify perfect  
happiness).Yet is their enjoyment distinctly better than that of men because  
their desires are less complex?   
Fatigue is certainly produced for everybody after the flurry (or passion) of  
copulation, just as there is fatigue for an animal carrying a load   
Beauty is only a mental concept, as is evident from the similar feeling in  
similar enjoyments of lovers in dreams.   
The idea of beauty lies in oneâs own desire innate in the mind.   
Even the most accomplished among men have fallen into the habit of seeking  
pleasure from woman, for all consider her the best hunting ground for  
delight.Similarly also a manâs body is thought by women to be the highest  
source of enjoyment.Shaped of fat and flesh, filled with blood,topped by the  
head, covered by skin, ribbed by bones,covered with hair, containing bile and  
phlegm, a pitcher of faeces and urine, generated from semen and ovum, and born  
from the opening from where urine is ejected â such is the body. Just think  
of it! Finding delight in such a thing, how are men any better than worms  
growing in offal?   
What is known as the mind is, after all, always like a restless monkey. So the  
ordinary man is always afflicted with troubles. Everybody knows that a  
restless mind is the channel of endless troubles; whereas one is happy in  
sleep in the absence of such restlessness.Hearing with a distracted mind is as  
good as not hearing, for the words serve no useful purpose, resembling the  
fruit-laden tree seen in a painting.   
Men earn their food, gods their nectar, pious ascetics the highest beatitude  
and others their desires, by individual exertion alone.   
Whatever has the impress of misery on it cannot be good. Such are wealth,  
children, wife, kingdom, treasury, army, fame, learning, intellect, body,  
beauty and prosperity. For they are all transient and already in the jaws of  
death, otherwise called time.   
Therefore worship the Primal Cause of the universe as the starting point; be  
devoted to Him; He will soon enable you to succeed in your attempts to destroy  
the illusion.   
Among the methods of approach to God, there are (1) worship to overcome  
troubles, (2) worship to gain wealth, etc., and (3) loving dedication of  
oneself. The last one is the best and surest in its results.   
A human master may take long to recognise unselfish work;but God, the Lord of  
the Universe, the Dweller in our hearts, knows everything and soon bestows  
appropriate fruits. In the case of other kinds of devotees, God has to await  
the course of destiny â that being His own ordainment; whereas for the  
selfless devotee, God, the   
Lord and the sole refuge, is all in all and takes care of him without  
reference to the devoteeâs predestiny or His own ordained laws. He  
compensates the devotee quickly, and that is because He is supreme and self-  
contained without depending on anything else.   
Predestiny or divine will is powerless before Him. Everyone knows how He set  
aside predestiny and divine laws in the case of His famous devotee,  
Markandeya.   
[Note: A Rishi, Mrikandu by name, who was childless,pleased Siva by his  
penance. When Siva appeared to him,he prayed that a son might be born to him.  
Siva asked him if he wished to have a dull boy long-lived, or a bright boy  
short-lived. Mrikandu preferred the latter. So Siva said âYou will have a  
very brilliant son; but he will only live for sixteen yearsâ. Accordingly a  
son was born who was very good and dutiful, and most intelligent and  
pious,charming all who saw him. The parents were delighted with him but grew  
sad as he grew up. He asked them the reason for their sadness and they told  
him of Sivaâs boon.He said, âNever mind. I will seeâ, and took to  
penance.Siva was pleased with his intense devotion and ordained that he should  
remain sixteen years of age for all eternity.]   
The current notion that one cannot escape oneâs destiny is applicable only  
to weak-minded and senseless wastrels.   
The Primal Being is Siva with five faces and three eyes, the Creator would in  
that case be like an ordinary potter making pots, endowed with a body and  
brain. True, there is no art found in the world, without a body and some  
intellect. In fact, the creative faculty in men belongs to something between  
the body and pure intelligence.   
[Note: Body being insentient cannot act of its own accord; nor can intellect  
do so without a tool.]   
Therefore the mind operates apart from the gross body,in dreams; being  
intelligent it creates an environment suitable to its latent desires. This  
clearly indicates that the body is only a tool for a purpose and the agent is  
intelligence.Instruments are necessary for human agents because their  
capacities are limited and they are not self-contained.Whereas the Creator of  
the universe is perfect in Himself and creates the whole universe without any  
external aid.This leads to the important conclusion that God has no body.  
Otherwise, He would be reduced to a glorified human being, requiring  
innumerable accessories for work and influenced by seasons and environments,  
in no way different from a creature, and not the Lord. Moreover, preexistence  
of accessories would quash His unique mastery and imply limits to His powers  
of creation. This is absurd, as being contrary to the original premises.  
Therefore, He has no body nor the other aids, yet He still creates the world,  
O Lord of my life! Fools are taken in by the notion of giving a body to the  
transcendental Being. Still, if devotees worship and contemplate Him with a  
body according to their own inclinations, He shows them grace, assuming such a  
body. For He is unique and fulfils the desires of His devotees.   
Nevertheless, the conclusion must be reached that He is pure intelligence and  
His consciousness is absolute and transcendental. Such is the consciousness-  
intelligence in purity,Absolute Being, the One Queen, Parameswari  
(Transcendental Goddess), overwhelming the three states and hence called  
Tripura. Though She is the undivided whole, the universe manifests in all its  
variety in Her, being reflected as it were,in a self-luminous mirror. The  
reflection cannot be apart from the mirror and is therefore one with it. Such  
being the case, there cannot be difference in degrees (e.g., Siva, or Vishnu  
being superior to each other). Bodies are mere conceptions in the lower order  
of beings and they are not to the point in the case of God. Therefore, be  
wise,and worship the one pure, unblemished Transcendence.   
As long as you are contaminated with notions of me or mine (e.g., my home, my  
body, my mind, my intellect),the Self will not be found, for it lies beyond  
cognition and cannot be realised as âmy Self â.   
Retire into solitude, analyse and see what those things are which are cognised  
as mine; discard them all and transcending them, look for the Real Self.   
Is there any moment when the Self is not the Self? Neither is control of mind  
used to gain it. I shall give you some examples: Just as things unseen in darkness are found on its removal by means of a lamp,  
and are therefore said to be recovered from oblivion.   
Just as a confused man forgets his purse, but remembers and locates it on  
keeping his mind unruffled and steady, yet still says that he has gained the  
lost purse,though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.   
So also the control of your mind is not the cause of your Self-realisation;  
though the Self is always there, it is not recognised by you even with a  
controlled mind because you are not conversant with it.   
Just as an infant tries to take hold of his own reflection being unaware of  
the mirror, so also common people are taken in by their mental reflections in  
the mirror of the pure, luminous Self and are not aware of the mirror, because  
they have no acquaintance with the Self.   
The mind should be brought to the condition of a newborn baby. Then he feels  
as if he were separate from all gross materials and only the feeling âI  
amâ persists.

Just as a confused man forgets his purse, but remembers and locates it on  
keeping his mind unruffled and steady, yet still says that he has gained the  
lost purse,though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.   
So also the control of your mind is not the cause of your Self-realisation;  
though the Self is always there, it is not recognised by you even with a  
controlled mind because you are not conversant with it.   
Just as an infant tries to take hold of his own reflection being unaware of  
the mirror, so also common people are taken in by their mental reflections in  
the mirror of the pure, luminous Self and are not aware of the mirror, because  
they have no acquaintance with the Self.   
The mind should be brought to the condition of a newborn baby. Then he feels  
as if he were separate from all gross materials and only the feeling âI  
amâ persists.

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Part3  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 07:52:40 PM

The difference between dreams and the wakeful state lies in the fact that in  
the waking state the dream is determined to be false, whereas in the dream the  
waking state is not so determined. Therefore the waking state is universally  
taken to be real. But this is wrong. For do you not experience the same extent  
of permanency and purposefulness in dreams as in the wakeful state?   
Wakeful consciousness does not intervene in dreams nor does dream-  
consciousness intervene in the wakeful state, while the two factors â  
enduring nature and purposefulness â are common to both.   
Examine your past dreams and past waking experiences in the light of these  
facts and see for yourself.   
Again, note the appearance of reality in magical phenomena and the seemingly  
purposeful actions of magical creations. Does reality rest on the slender  
basis of such appearances?   
The confusion is due to want of discrimination between the real and the unreal  
among ignorant folk. Ignorantly indeed do they say that the wakeful universe  
is real.   
The existence of Reality is self-evident and does not require other aids to  
reveal it. Unreality is the contrary.   
If you say, however, that a thing is real until and unless its existence is  
contradicted, consider the example of a coil of rope being mistaken for a  
snake. The fancied snake would according to you be real in the interval  
antecedent to correct knowledge, but that is absurd.   
The most important of the qualifications is the desire for emancipation.  
Nothing can be achieved without it. Study of philosophy and discussion on the  
subject with others are thoroughly useless, being no better than the study of  
arts. For the matter of that, one might as well hope for salvation by a study  
of sculpture and the practice of that art. The study of philosophy in the  
absence of a longing for salvation, is like dressing up a corpse.   
The fruit of Self-realisation is the end of all misery here and hereafter and  
absolute fearlessness. That is called Emancipation.   
[Note: There is an end of misery in sleep; but the potentiality of misery is  
not ended. Realisation destroys the cause of misery and sets the man free  
forever.]   
What is perceived in the world as being apart from the Self is also clearly  
seen to be perishable. What is perishable must certainly involve fear of loss.   
What is the use of hundreds of efforts in the absence of a real and unswerving  
desire for emancipation? That is the sole requisite and nothing else.   
The intellect is ordinarily befouled by evil propensities and so nothing good  
flourishes there. Consequently,people are boiled in the seething cauldron of  
births and deaths. Of these evil propensities, the first is want of faith in  
the revelations made by the Guru and in the sastras; the second is addiction  
to desires; and the third is dullness (i.e., inability to understand the  
revealed truth). This is a brief statement of them.   
Of these, want of faith is betrayed by oneâs doubts regarding the truth of  
the statements and by failure to understand them. The doubt arises whether  
there is moksha; and later misunderstanding leads to its denial. These two are  
sure obstacles to any sincere efforts being made for realisation.   
The second propensity, namely desire,prevents the intellect from following the  
right pursuit.For the mind engrossed in desire cannot engage in a spiritual  
pursuit. The abstraction of a lover is well known to all; he can hear or see  
nothing in front of him. Anything said in his hearing is as good as not said.  
Desire must therefore be first overcome before aspiring for spiritual  
attainment. That can be done only by dispassion. This propensity is manifold,  
being in the forms of love, anger,greed, pride, jealousy, etc. The worst of  
them is pursuit of pleasure which, if destroyed, destroys all else. Pleasure  
may be subtle or gross. Neither of these must be indulged in, even in thought.  
As soon as the thought of pleasure arises, it must be dismissed by the  
willpower developed by dispassion.   
There is no accomplishment equal to Self-realisation,which is alone capable of  
ending all misery, because it is the state of eternal Bliss.   
He who is, from his own experience, capable of appreciating the states of  
other Jnanis, including the best among them, is certainly a perfect Sage. He  
who is not influenced by happiness or misery, by pleasure or pain,by desires,  
doubts or fear, is a perfect Sage. He who realises pleasure, pain and every  
other phenomenon to be in and of the Self, is a perfect Sage. He who feels  
himself pervading all â be they ignorant or emancipated â is a perfect  
Sage. He who, knowing the trammels of bondage, does not seek release from them  
and remains in peace, is a perfect Sage.   
An intense devotee, though endowed with only a little discipline of other  
kinds (e.g., dispassion), can readily understand the truth though only  
theoretically, and expound it to others. Such exposition helps him to imbue  
those ideas and so he absorbs the truth. This ultimately leads him to identify  
all individuals with Siva and he is no longer affected by pleasure or pain.  
All-round identification with Siva makes him the best of Jnanis and a  
Jivanmukta (emancipated here and now). Therefore bhakti yoga (the way of  
devotion) is the best of all and excels all else.   
Investigation cuts at the root of ignorance.Dispassion develops investigation.  
Disgust for the pleasures of life generates dispassion towards them.   
Investigation is analysis conducted within oneself, discriminating the non-  
self from the Self, stimulated by a stern, strong and sincere desire to  
realise the Self. Dispassion is non-attachment to surroundings. This results  
if the misery consequent on attachment is kept in mind.   
Fear holds a man possessed of enormous wealth; misery, of a large family; and  
poverty, of insatiable desires.   
The man with no attachments is free from fear; the one with controlled mind is  
free from misery;the Self-realised man is never needy.   
Just as an actor is not really affected by the passions which he displays on  
the stage, so also this Jnani, always aware of his perfection, is not affected  
by the seeming pleasures and pains which he regards as a mere illusion, like  
the horns of a hare.   
The highest Jnani makes no difference between samadhi and worldly  
transactions. He never finds anything apart from the Self and so there is no  
lapse for him.   
The state of the Jnani is said to be identical with that of Siva. There is not  
the least difference between them. Therefore karma cannot besmear a Jnani.

## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Part2  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 07:33:39 PM

The individual encompasses his own creation with his ego (as âIâ); so does  
the Lord play with the universe. Just as the dreamer is not to be confounded  
with the dream so is the Lord not to be confounded with the creation. Just as  
a man survives his dream, so does the Lord survive the dissolution of His  
creation. Just as you remain ever as pure consciousness apart from the body,  
etc., so is the Lord, unbounded consciousness apart from the universe, etc. Is  
it not after all only a picture drawn by Him on His Self? How can this unique  
creation be apart from Him? There can indeed be nothing but consciousness.  
Tell me of any place where there is no consciousness; there is no place beyond  
consciousness. Or can anyone prove in any manner anything outside  
consciousness? Consciousness is inescapable.   
Moreover, this consciousness is the only existence,covering the whole  
universe, and perfect all through.Just as there cannot be breakers apart from  
the ocean and light without the Sun, so also the universe cannot be conceived  
without consciousness. The Supreme God is thus the embodiment of pure  
Consciousness.   
The universe has thus originated only as an image on the surface of the mirror  
of the Absolute. This conclusion is in harmony with all facts.   
Creation is like a magicianâs trick, and is a city born of divine  
imagination. O Parasurama, you are aware of the mental creations of  
daydreamers which are full of people, life and work, similar to this. There  
are also doubts,tests, discussions and conclusions â all imaginary arising  
in the mind and subsiding there. Just as castles in the air are mental  
figments of men so also is this creation a mental figment of Siva. Siva is  
absolute Awareness, without any form. Sri Tripura is Sakti (energy) and  
Witness of the whole.That Being is perfect all round and remains undivided.   
The world cannot stand investigation because of its changing unreal nature.  
Just as the owl is dazzled and blinded by bright sunlight, so the world  
parades in glory before ignorance and disappears before right analysis.   
[Note: The man sees by sunlight and is helpless in its absence. The owl sees  
in darkness and is blinded in sunlight. Whose sight is the better of the two?  
This cannot be determined satisfactorily so that investigation becomes lame.]   
As long as the ignorance of the self lasts, so long will there be misery.   
The Sun helps all to see, but blinds the owls; water is the abode of fishes,  
but drowns man; fire burns a man, but is food to tittiri (a species of bird);  
fire is ordinarily put out by water, but it flourishes in the middle of the  
ocean at the time of dissolution. Similar discrepancies are evident elsewhere.   
Men and animals engage in activities with their limbs and senses, whereas  
spirits do so with the bodies of others. Instances like these are innumerable.   
Sight is of the eye and cannot be without it.A jaundiced eye sees everything  
yellow and diplopia produces a double image of a single object.   
Abnormal visions are thus the direct result of abnormal eyes. The Karandakas,  
in an Eastern island, are said to see everything red; so also the inhabitants  
of Ramanaka Isle see everything upside down.   
One hears many more strange stories of the kind, all of which are based on  
abnormalities of vision. They can all be remedied by proper treatment. The  
same applies to other senses,including the mind.   
The relation between space and objects and between time and events is  
according to your estimate of them; there is no intrinsic relationship between  
them.   
Just as the mirror remains unaffected by the passage of different images and  
yet continues to reflect as clearly as before, so also the one consciousness  
illumines the waking and dream states which can be verified by proper  
meditation.   
Therefore recognise the fact that the world is simply an image on the mirror  
of consciousness and cultivate the contemplation of âI amâ, abide as pure  
being and thus give up this delusion of the reality of the world.   
True experience of the Self is the unawareness of even âI amâ. Can the  
world persist after such unawareness? Second-hand knowledge is no better than  
the recollection   
of a dream.   
Just as the accession of treasure in a dream is useless, so also is second-  
hand knowledge.   
The whole world is manifested in it like a city in a mirror. Such is that  
transcendental state. On realising it, one becomes immortal; there is no place  
for doubts and uncertainties, as there is none at the sight of a reflection in  
a mirror; there is no more reason for ignorance as at the sight of innumerable  
reflected images; and there will be no more room for desire, because  
transcendence is then experienced.   
Just as a prince labours under a misapprehension that the string of pearls  
still clinging to his neck has been stolen away by another and is not  
persuaded to the contrary by mere words but only believes when he finds it  
around his neck by his own effort, so also, O youth, however clever a man may  
be, he will never know his own self by the mere teaching of others unless he  
realises it for himself. Otherwise he can never realise the Self if his mind  
is turned outward.   
Everybody fails in this investigation however learned and proficient he may  
be, because his mind is not bent inward but restlessly moves outward. As long  
as thoughts crop up, so long has the turning inward of the mind not been  
accomplished. As long as the mind is not inward, so long the Self cannot be  
realised. Turning inward means absence of desire. How can the mind be fixed  
within if desires are not given up?   
You are not the body, nor the senses, nor the mind, because they are all  
transient. The body is composed of food, so how can you be the body?   
Concentration on a particular item is necessary for the perception of external  
things. But since consciousness is the Self and not apart from the mind,  
concentration on it is not necessary for its realisation. It is enough that  
other perceptions (namely,thoughts) should be eliminated from the mind and  
then the Self will be realised.   
Therefore it was also said that the sole necessity for Self-realisation is  
purity of mind. The only impurity of the mind is thought. To make it thought-  
free is to keep it pure.   
The mind is truly abstracted in sleep. But then its light is screened by  
darkness, so how can it manifest its true nature? A mirror covered with tar  
does not reflect   
images, but can it reflect space also? Is it enough, in that case, that images  
are eliminated in order to reveal the space reflected in the mirror? In the  
same manner, the mind is veiled by the darkness of sleep and rendered unfit  
for illumining thoughts. Would such eclipse of the mind reveal the glimmer of  
consciousness?   
Moreover, pursue the analogy of a tarred mirror. The tar may prevent the  
images from being seen, but the quality of the mirror is not affected, for the  
outer coating of tar must be reflected in the interior of the mirror. So also  
the mind, though diverted from dreams and wakefulness, is still in the grip of  
dark sleep and not free from qualities.This is evident by the recollection of  
the dark ignorance of sleep when one wakes.   
Sri Sankara has said in Soundarya Lahari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He  
cannot even stir in Her absence.Siva should not therefore be considered to be  
a mere inexpressible entity depending for His movements upon Maya (like a man  
on his car). Sri Sankara continues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to His  
true being. Therefore a blessed few worship Thee as the endless series of  
waves of bliss, as the underlying basis of all that is, as the Supreme Force,  
maintaining the universe, and as the Consort of Transcendence. Thus the  
identity of Siva and Sakti with each other or with Transcendence is evident.   
When the pictures on a wall are erased, the original wall remains. No other  
work is necessary to restore its original condition.   
Similarly, the mind remains pure when thoughts are eliminated. Therefore the  
unqualified state is restored if the present disturbance is ended.   
Therefore rule out creation as a mere thought or series of thoughts and  
realise the non-dual, residual, pure intelligence as the Self.   
Second-hand knowledge of the Self gathered from books or Gurus can never  
emancipate a man until its truth is rightly investigated and applied to  
himself; direct Realisation alone will do that. Therefore, follow my advice  
and realise yourself, turning the mind inward.   
To imagine that the Self is shackled by mental projections is to imagine that  
the fire reflected in a mirror can burn it. There is absolutely no bondage  
beyond the foolish certainty that you are bound and the difference of entity  
created by mind. Until these two blemishes are washed away by the holy waters  
of investigation into the Self, neither I, nor Brahma the Creator, nor Vishnu,  
nor Siva, nor even Sri Tripura, the Goddess of Wisdom, can help that person to  
be emancipated.
