Dear Nagaraj,   
I am reading a book titled The Unbearable Lightness Of Being by Milan Kundera.  
The book   
first came in 1988. This is a beautiful book against the backdrop of Czech  
Revolution, crushed   
by Russians. The book, throughout runs under stream of philosophy. One catchy  
observation   
by the author is, abanboned child or found out child, in a garden or riverbed,  
makes history.   
If the Pharaoh,s daughter had not snatched the basket carrying little Moses,  
there would not   
have been Old Testament, no civilization of West Asia etc., If Polybus had not  
been taken in the young   
Oedipus, Sophocles would not have been written. .his most beautiful tragedy!   
I was thinking, the same can be said of Sita and Andal!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramana,   
Nice   
I truly believe, there is one truth, which is nameless, which is theory-less,  
with is attributeless, which is state-less. One who realises that truth can  
never see anything as right or wrong, true or false, this or that!   
Even whom we call a dvaitin or anybody, even after he realises, he would  
continue to pray with great fervor! Nothing changes for him.   
One who realises, will himself not know it, he would simply continue and just  
the quest in him would have ended. He is, without any thirst.   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear anandchitra,   
The Ramanasramam Book Depot is within the premises of Sri Ramanasramam,  
Turuvannamalai,   
606 603, India. I do not think you can buy CDs and books, online. You have to  
send a demand   
draft after ascertaining the total price andt courier charges. The online  
purchases are available   
only for books for residents in India.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear ramana,   
Kindly tell me what is the use of watching so many youtube videos on various  
topics, about various religions and faiths,   
and about various teachers? Is it not better to stick to one faith and have  
one Guru, without brandishing other faiths   
and other teachers and their sayings? Sri Ramakrishna used to tell one story.  
One farmer went to dig a well. He dug up to   
10 feet. No water came. He left that pit and went to dig another well. Again  
10 feet. No water. He lost all interest and remained   
thirsty and without water for his agricultural fields, after doing such 10  
feet digging at 4 or 5 places. Had he dug at one place,   
with perseverance and sustained efforts at one place, in 40 feet, he would  
have found water. Hence let us stick to one faith,   
atma vichara which is the sum and substance of all faiths.   
We are not going to write a comparative study of various theologies and  
teachers. Our job is to see that we spiritually   
progress by adopting a faith that is most suitable to us, and improve  
steadily. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear ramana,   
You say you are listening to some songs of other faiths, when you are tired  
and when you want to remove that weariness.   
On the other side, you say you want to follow the practices of Sanatana Dharma  
and your spiitual progress. There are good   
kirtanas praising the gods of Sanatana Dharma also. They are not in English  
but in Indian languages, like Dohas in Marathi,   
Tyagaraja Kirtanas in Telugu, Tamizh songs by Arunagiri Nathar, Sri Bhagavan,  
and Nayanmars and Azhwars. A few of them   
are available in youtube and most of them are in CDs. By listening to them,  
your pastime for removing the tiredness and also   
your spiritual progress will be in unison. Of course Vedic hymns should not be  
listened through CDs. They must be listened from   
live recitation. Other hymns are okay.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear ramana,   
Sanatana Dharma is all embracing. However since Jesus and Mohammad gave a  
separate name for their faiths, it is excluded from   
Sanatana Dharma. When the son has disowned his father, how can father call  
him his son? Or when a wife has divorced her   
husband, how can the husband call her his wife?

Jesus did not give a name to "his" faith. His followers did that. Read the  
symbols of the Gospels and the beautiful mystical sayings of Jesus with an  
open heart and forget what his "followers" codified into dogma.   
Jesus was not some errant redheaded step-child when it comes to Santana  
Dharma.   
He lived it, he taught it, and did so in such a powerful and uplifting way  
that 2,000 yrs. later He is still showing people the way to God and performing  
miracles. Many when they come close to death see God or Self as Jesus and/or  
identify the Light of the Self as Jesus or Christ - at least in the culture  
where I come from where He is predominant.   
My grandmother was healed by Him when she was dying during the American flu  
epidemic of 1917-1919 and remained a lifelong devotee. She was holier and more  
devoted than I am.   
That said, the best commentaries on Jesus I have ever seen have come from  
Hindu teachers. The Sermon on the Mount commentary by Swami Probhavananda is  
fantasitc.   
The single best is the exhaustive commentary on the Gospels by Paramahansa  
Yogananda.

Dear Astralman,   
I have no quarrel against Jesus Christ. As you correctly said, it is his  
followers who made into a different faith and said that unless   
you follow Christianity, you will not get salvation. If Jesus had been alive,  
when British started ruling countries like India, he would   
not have permitted "conversion" from Hinduism to Christianity, luring the  
people with money and free education. Whereas much against   
Jesus' Will, missionaries started converting Hindus into Christians. This  
made the split felt more and more between Hinduism and Christianity. All  
great Saints have said the same teachings to humankind for their upliftment  
and salvation. So there is no surprise in   
the Sermon of the Mount being similar to Hindu thought. What Jesus said from  
Mount of Sinai is the same as what Sri Bhagavan said   
from Arunachala or what Rishis of India said from the Himalayas.   
Hinduism never converted people of other faith into Hinduism. That is why it  
is called Sanatana Dharma, an all embracing faith, ancient   
and primordial. In fact Buddha is considered as an avatara of Narayana in  
Srimad Bhagavatam.   
All fissures between religions are by lower rung people, whose ego is not  
subsided.   
Arunachala Siva.

precisely, that is the real problem. These are the problems created by  
"followers" That is the same issue with all religions including ours!   
Sir, even in the name of Sanathana Dharma, there are many new modern day Gurus  
who lure people to them. I feel, this is not any different from Christians  
converting Hindus!   
I felt it most appropriate to say that Sanathana Dharma never converted people  
of other faith over saying Hinduism never converted people of other faith. As  
the term Hindusim is relatively new, just coined by Britishers over last 2  
centuries perhaps! And What we call Hindusim is quite different from the true  
spirit of Sanathana Dharma.   
 **Especially, today, there is no relevance in calling Hinduism as Sanathana  
Dharma. It is mostly referred as Hinduism, which is no different from  
Christianity, Islam! We can 't refer Hindu's as Sanathana Dharma anymore!   
In the name of Allah, Jesus and Krishna, Ramana Maharshi, Adi Shankara,  
Ramakrishna, Chinmayananda and many of other religions are coming up their own  
TV channels, all these are dangerous precedents! A huge business is building  
over! and Allah, Jesus and Krishna and others are surely not responsible for  
that!   
The evil effects of Kali Yuga is already predicted in Srimad Bhagavatam  
http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=11939   
The truth is one and the same irrespective of the ways. In fact, those who are  
able to see this, are in a way, a rebellion to their own religions! a deeply  
spiritual persons is dangerous to the society, which is full of ideas!

Dear Nagaraj,   
I see your point. The fight in today's context, is one where Gurus attract to  
join them as their disciples. There are many bogus gurus\   
also. But all gurus bogus or genuine are only in Hinduism and there is no  
conversion. There may be some small amount of conversion   
in villages and far off areas like Nagaland where Christians still work for  
conversion.   
In this context, I wish to point out only peculiar conversion which was there  
in and around Sri Rangam area in Tamizh Nadu.   
There some Sri Vaishanva Saints were asking Smarthas (Sankara's followers) to  
join Sri Vaishnavism. In Tiruchirapalli, where I studied   
and which is near Sri Rangam, I know some persons who were Smarthas earlier in  
the earlier generation but have become Sri   
Vaishnavas now! We used to call them as Iyer by Iyengars. I think even this  
must have stopped now.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sir,   
I kindly disagree on vedic chanting cds. For people like me, live recitation  
is vary rare. But I really find solace in playing the vedic cds especially in  
the mornigns, when my house becomes a temporary Ramansramam and the faces of  
Bhagavan and Saradamma's photos seem to shine with greater splendour and  
bliss.   
Sometimes I get some mild laughters and seems something within me resonates  
and say 'yes', 'yes' to the chantings. So now I am sort of addicted to the  
morning 'moods' that I create in weekends after copying it from our  
Maharishee's abode.   
I had spoken to veda prasara samithi and they told it is ok with playing but  
only exception was they asked to light a lamp, be bathed and do some  
meditation or sit & listen as they are played.   
Sabhda is eternal. In Kali yuga, it repeats in the recorded CDs. It is the  
humble mind that matters.

Dear ramana,   
There is one video prepared by Dennis Hartel and David Godman, in 1983,  
containing an interview of Annamalai Swami   
by one westerner, with Sundaram Swami, as an interpreter. This runs for about  
an hour fifteen minutes. David Godman   
announced it and sold it through his blog. It was at a concessional price of  
Rs 125.00. I am not sure whether this DVD   
is now available. I do not know whether the youtube interview is the same as  
that of Dennis Hartel.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is a much longer panel discussion involving Rajiv Malhotra and Subramanya  
Swamy. If you have time and interest you can go through it. Certainly it is  
worth listening between 20th minute and 65th minute if you want to be

Friends,   
Please find links to the wonderful movie **Vireswar Vivekananda**.This was  
taken in 1963 as part of the Birth centenary celebrations. The movie is in  
black and white and is in Bengali-The actors have done a wonderful job knowing  
that it is not easy to bring to the screen the utter innocence and childlike  
charm of Sri Ramakrishna and the Fiery,multisided Narendra(Swamiji).Here are  
the links: part 1 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYjhmBoSQlA   
part 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGawTJLI5Ks   
It requires familiarity with the lives and atleast some knowledge of hindi.For  
those who do not know language or the story,I will describe briefly the Part 2  
Sequence: 1.Sri Ramakrishna smoking his hookah,enquires his nephew Ramlal-Why Naren has  
not come?It is quite since he came.I want to see him,I am finding it very  
difficult having not seen him.I badly want to see him.   
Ramlal says that Naren has been informed but he has not come.   
Sri Ramakrishna decides to visit Naren' s House.   
In Naren's home,narendra is studying.His friends visit him.Naren tells them :I  
have two vision before me-One is that I will become a successful man with  
Plenty of Money, Weath,Honour, Fame,etc.   
The Other vision is that I will become a 'Renunciant' renouncing everything  
and become a mendicant.   
As they are discussing thus,Sri Ramakrishna arrives with Ramlal in tow and  
with sweets for naren.He comes calling-LOREN,LOREN(This is the colloquial name  
with which he used to call Naren).He feeds Naren with a sweet and says-"How  
long you have not come to dakshineswar!How long since I have heard your  
singing.Please sing one song...one song".   
Naren sings this song:-Jago mA kula Kunalini'-Means: Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep   
In the lotus of the Muladhara!   
Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother: Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head,   
Where mighty Siva has His dwelling;   
Swiftly pierce the six lotuses   
And take away my grief, O Essence of Consciousness!   
Sri Ramakrishna is in samadhi.Coming back to the plane of the senses,he  
expresses appreciation for Narendra and Pleads with Narendra-:Please come to  
Dakshineswar,Won't you!Please come to Dakshineswar,Please"!   
Naren is moved and says 'Yes'.   
Narendra then goes and tells his mother:'Master has called me to  
Dakshineswar.I am going'.   
Naren's mother tells him-'Dakshineswar,Dakshineswar.That madcap thakur!We are  
in penury.Thakur(Master)knows God.Why do you not ask him to talk to God and  
bring some relief to us'.   
Naren goes to Sri Ramakrishna. The Master is very happy -He calls one of the  
devotees and tells him-'Go and tell your Mother(Holy Mother)that Naren has  
come!Ask her to make good Rotis!(Bread).He calls another person and tells  
him-'Naren's family is in difficulty.Why don't you talk to someone to get help  
him'   
Naren hears the conversation and scolds Sri ramakrishna:'Why are you doing  
this by speaking about my difficulty!We have our honour".   
He tells Sri Ramakrishna to speak to kali about his difficulty.Ramakrishna  
tells him-'Why do you not ask her'.He sends Naren to the kali Temple.   
Naren goes to the temple and a firm faith seizes him.He behelds the Divine  
Mother,Living and ready to Grant any boon!.He forget what he went for and asks  
for Viveka,Vairagya,Jnana and Bhakti and then comes back to sri Ramakrishna.   
sri Ramakrishna asks him-'What did you ask the boon from Divine Mother'?   
Naren says:I forgot to ask!   
Sri Ramakrishna sends him again.naren Goes and again asks only Viveka,vairagya  
,Bhakti and Jnana.He returns to Sri Ramakrishna and when the Master asks him  
whether he asked mother for relief from suffering,Naren Tells him:'No,I felt  
ashamed at ask. I asked only for Viveka,vairagya, Bhakti and Jnana'.   
The Master is highly pleased and blesses him saying -Your people will not have  
want of food and simple living.   
Narendra then asks master to sing a song-'Ma you are tAra'.   
on it goes...Sri Ramakrishna is diagnosed as suffering from cancer....Narendra  
becomes Swami vivekananda....   
Wonderful movie!Unfortunately, no subtitles!   
Namaskar.

Nagaraj,   
I bought that DVD.I found it totally insipid!These things have to be produced  
by people with genuine devotion.'Technology' and 'Information' can only  
produce caricatures!Sorry,it is a strong criticism but this is what it is.I  
put in my comments to R K Mutt as well.   
If you had bought something that is not useful,one can atleast give it to  
someone who may find it eseful.In this case,I decided to keep it with me so  
that I do not unwittingly dispirit someone and bring down swamiji in their  
estimation.   
Namaskar.

Dear i   
only after posting the link here, i saw that you had already left a comment in  
the link itself. I have been having an eye on this video, wanting to buy.  
Thank you for your feedback. Yes, sometimes, such videos leave one with a  
sense of dissatisfaction, if it fails to capture the intensity of the  
character, being tried to show in the movie.   
i am sure, the previous links b/w movie carries a stronger spirit and the  
beauty which can seldom be found in current day movies.   
i do like watching movies as well. I, especially like to watch kamal haasans  
movies (He doesn't make movies just for the heck of it)   
Movie making is an art. GV Iyer, AP Nagarajan were stalwarts at that.

Nagaraj,   
Sure,the Black and white film 'bireswar Vivekananda' is inspirational.The  
actors have done a Great job.The Music is wonderful-The songs are absolutely  
top class and from the Original kathamrita.No one can hold a candle to these  
Bengalis when it comes to sheer intensity in singing-They are truly gifted and  
put their heart and soul.   
This movie captures the utter simplicity and charm of sri Ramakrishna;Swamiji  
also gets a good presentation.   
Namaskar.

jewell,   
The Ganesha 'Bhajan' is quite a symphonic composition.I have been thinking of  
sharing this 'Chants of India' set to music by the Great sitar Maestro pundit  
Ravishankar and produced by George Harrison(Beatles Group).It has the basic  
chants rendered in Traditional style with the music only embellishing it.You  
may like listen to it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg8uoepX4OI   
Namaskar

Balaji/Jewell,   
You may find some of the chants in that Album with their meaning here: http://www.onbeing.org/program/approaching-prayer/feature/chants-india/617   
The translation of the Gayatri mantra is not accurate,yet it does give some  
sense.   
Namaskar
