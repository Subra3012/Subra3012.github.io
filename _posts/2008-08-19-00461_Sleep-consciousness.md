Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai,   
Yes. srkudai is correct. We are always Consciousness. In sleep,   
mind is temporarily absent, curling itself up into the Self. In   
the morning, after a trice of Self awareness, the first thought   
"I" springs forth and then the play starts!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, in sleep, the mind is temporarily withdrawn, but is   
not killed. That is all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sankar,   
 It is in everybody's experience that one is happy in deep sleep.So who is this "I"who knows that i slept happily.   
 In sleep we disidentify with the body and mind.So who is this "I"in sleep which does not do anything because   
 it is adjunctless yet perceives the nothingness and happiness of sleep?That which knows the state of sleep is   
 definitely not our mind but only our self conscious being which is conscious of itself and the contentless sleep.   
 That is why self in sleep state is called "Prajnanaghana".

Dear DRPVSSN RAJU, Yes. In PRAJNANA GANA, the mind is   
powerless, but is not annihilated. Sometimes, in dream state,   
it acts and you become a king and marry a beautiful girl.   
Arunachala Siva.
