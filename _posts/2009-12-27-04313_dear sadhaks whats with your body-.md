## Madhura Bhakti - Gopikas Selling Milk, Curds..  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: December 30, 2009, 11:03:08 AM

It is really so delightful to see thee Gopikas on the streets to sell milk and  
curds in their pails that were kept one upon the other on their heads. A  
Gopika was determined to sell buttermilk, contemplated on the Divine Feet of  
Bala Murali, entirely forgetting herself, uttered in bliss Govinda! Oh  
Damodara! Oh Madhava... they usually call out loudly, "milk!", "curds!"  
beckoning people to come. But strangely they have forgotton themselves and are  
moving around calling - "Govinda!", "Damodara", "Madhava", "Muralidhara"...  
They have forgotten the very purpose of their visit. One would wonder if they  
would have rebirth? Will they ever be born again? What a gifted souls they  
were! They are really blessed!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## Tiruppavai - 18  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 02, 2010, 09:48:50 AM

Today is the 18th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month and it is the   
practice in many Tamil houses and with Tamil knowing Sri Vaishnavas of  
Karnataka, to sing the 18th song of Tiruppavai   
of AndaL.   
This particular song reveals some hitherto unknown information.   
Krishna or Kannan is already married to one lady by name Nappinnai. Krishna  
is said to have 108 wives, (Vallabhacharya   
says the number is 16108!) and one among them is the Tamil   
girl Nappinnai. Nappinnai means a girl with lustrous jet black hairs!  
Beginners in Sri Vaishnava philosophy think that AndaL is one of   
Krishna's wives. Yes. But that is only in Sri Rangam - Srivilliputtur  
stories. There is no reference to AndaL in Srimad Bhagavatam   
or Sri Narayaneeyam. Some authors say that AndaL is   
Goda Devi. But there is no name of Godadevi either in these   
two books. But there is reference to Nappinnai. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says that Krishna married one Dravidian (!) (Blackie!)   
girl by name Nappinnai. So, Nappinnai, the brunette, is Goda Devi   
or AndaL, we should conlcude.   
He is of the strength of an elephant, and valorous shoulders   
that shall never retreat against his enemies. He is Nandagopa,   
the foster-father of Krishna. O Nappinnai, one with long jet black   
fragrant hairs, the DAUGHTER IN LAW OF Nandagopa, please open   
the door. All of Krishna's girl friends have come for bathing. The   
cuckoos perching on the Madhavi creepers are cuckooing, again and   
again. We are repeatedly singing the holy names of Krishna, your   
hubby. Please open the door with your bangle-tingling lotus like   
hands!   
The cuckoos are cooing. So this is already morning, after dawn.   
In the dawn, as per Manikkavachagar's Tiruvembavai, the cocks   
make sounds first. Then the red legged snarks give forth sounds.   
Then the conch shells from priests make sounds. Then only   
the late rising cuckoos make cooing. Here AndaL refers to cooing   
of cuckoos. Hence it is no more dawn but early morning.   
Nappinnai, the brunette, has only long jet black hairs. But her   
limbs are pinkish red like those of a doll. This is evident from the last  
sentence of the poem. Hence she is a Dravidian but fair complexioned!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 17  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 27, 2009, 07:49:36 AM

The 17th song is sung on the 17th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month,   
this year it is falling on 1st January 2010.   
Here the girls first tell Yasoda and Nandagopa to wake up and then ask Krishna  
and Balarama to wake up.   
"O the Attire, the Water and the Food! Our Lord, the dharmic   
Nandagopa, please wake up. O the Leader of all gopas and the   
light and the lamp of the clan Yasoda our Lordess, please wake   
up. O our Lord who measured the Space and the Worlds (with   
your feet, as Trivikrama), the god of the gods, please wake up.   
O the anklet wearing brave Balarama, please wake up. O the   
brothers wake up without further sleep."   
Arunachala Siva.

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.
