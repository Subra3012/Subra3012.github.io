**Sri Ramakrishna said that once a doll, made of salt, wanted to measure the  
depth of the ocean; but no sooner did it touch the water than it melted in the  
ocean.**   
How could it tell about the depth?   
Similarly, neither the mind nor words can express the real nature of God when  
the aspirant has merged in Him.   
A text of the Vedas says: "The words come back with the mind vainly trying to  
express what Truth is."

In one of the Upanishads, it is said, that "Vedas try to reach   
Brahman and come back losing, crestfallen."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. All Jnanis have said the same Truth, as if they were   
school boys copying from each other's note books!   
Whatever you have mentioned about the songs of Uttara Gita,   
has also been told by Bhagavan Ramana, in Sad Darsanam, Supplement, Verses 3  
to 5.   
Verse 3:- When one has learned to love the company of Sages,   
wherefore all these rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool,   
southern breeze is blowing, what need is there for a hand fan?   
Verse4:- Body heat is overcome by the cool light of the moon,   
want by the good wish-yielding tree (Karpaga), and sin by the   
Holy Ganga. These three - body/mind heat, want and sin all flee   
at the august sight of the peerless Sage.   
Verse 5:- Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols which are   
only of stones and clay, are not as mighty as the Sages are. For   
while they make one pure in course of countless days, the Sage's   
eyes by a mere glance purify at once.

Arunachala Siva.

Swami Vivekananda sang this song before Sri Ramakrishna.   
 _Let us go back once more, O mind, to our proper home,   
Here in this foreign land of earth,   
Why should we wander aimlessly in stranger's guise?   
These living beings round about,   
And the five elements,   
Are strangers to you, all of them; none are your own.   
Why do you so forget yourself,   
In love with strangers, foolish mind?   
Why do you so forget your own?   
Mount the path of truth, O mind! unflaggingly climb,   
With love as the lamp, light your way.   
As your provision on the journey, take with you   
The virtues, hidden carefully;   
For, like two highwaymen,   
Greed and delusion wait to rob you of your wealth.   
And keep besides you constantly,   
As guards to shelter you from harm,   
Calmness of mind and self-control.   
Companionship with holy men will be for you   
A welcome rest-house by the road;   
There rest your weary limbs awhile, asking your way,   
If ever you should be in doubt,   
Of him who watches there.   
If anything along the path should cause you fear,   
Then loudly shout the name of God;   
For He is ruler of that road,   
And even Death must bow to him._
