## girivalam

Dear sir,   
Recently I came to know there is another path to do girivalam. I did the outer  
one where there are 8 lingams.   
Can you please advice me how to go to that path. All people start from the  
temple and walk the 14 k.m. of distance   
During night will the inside path be opened for devotees?   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are said to be three roads for Arunachala Giripradakshina.   
One is the inner most road, in jungles, skirting the Hills. Nobody   
tries this. The middle road is on the foothills, where only one can   
walk and others have to be follow him. Two or three cannot walk,   
hand in hand. The third one is the outermost road, which is asphalted   
for cars and other vehicles can go. Here only, most of the devotees   
walk. The road is broad. This is about 14 kms in cicrumference.   
Here is where, you can come across the eight lingams and small   
temples for them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
If you mean the Inner Path for Giri Pradakshina, you can read a good articl in  
Ramanasramam's newsletter: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_April_2008.pdf   
enjoy!

dear sambahmurthy ji,   
thankyou for your response.   
would love to do it at 4 a.m.   
is the path well marked...so that there is no chance of deviation if one is  
new to the place and doing it alone?   
of course, one may say where is the chance of deviation when there is only a  
single goal!   
best regards,   
vinita

Dear vinita,   
If you take the outermost road, which is asphalted and in which   
vehicles ply, there is no chance of any deviation. The inner roads   
in the jungles of the Hills, are difficult to negotiate.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear vinita,   
I am not based in Tiruvannamalai. You may however, seek the   
help of anyone inside the Asramam, where everybody is always   
eager to help the visitors. They may not be able to accompany   
you during Girivalam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thankyou! i will surely do that.   
No, i wasn't looking for company during girivalam..... such things, i believe,  
are best done alone.   
best wishes!

did manage to complete girivalam day before yesterday. my realisation at the  
end of this experience was how much i am tied to the body. this happened when  
during the last few miles of the journey each step was so hurtful that it felt  
that i was walking on nails or burning coals (just my imagination).   
but every step of the way was worth it.   
the temple of arunachala just took my breath away.

Dear vinita,   
I am happy. Could Asramam people help you? Were you interested in some books  
in the Asramam?   
There is one description in Arunachala Mahatmayam: When one takes one step for girivalam, Indra becomes his servant.   
When he takes two steps, Kubera becomes his servant. When he completes  
girivalam, Vishnu becomes his servant. Every droplet   
of blood that oozes from the sole of the devotee while doing girivalam, due to  
thorns and bushes, they are worn as red rubies   
by the gods on their headgears!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Arunachala Siva,   
i was helped by a person who has been doing girivalam at least twice every  
month since 2002.   
yes, i did visit the ashram several times and found it very peaceful. Bought 2  
books one being the glory of aruchala.   
Could have beautiful darshans of the lord and the devi in the temple.   
best regards,   
vinita
