## Himavan pleased with Siva  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 06, 2010, 10:36:20 AM  
---  
Himavan is the king of Himachala and his wife is Mena Devi.   
Their only darling daughter is Uma. Once Brahma and Vishnu   
came to Himavan and told him to give his daughter in wedding   
to Siva. Siva came to see Uma and was happy and indicated his   
liking to marry Uma. Himavan became thoughtful. This guy has   
not mother and father. And his caste is not even known to us. We do not know  
his gothra, lineage. How can we give our daughter? Mena Devi said: It does  
not matter. If he has no mother and father,   
it is in a way good, for Uma will not suffer at the hands of a mother   
in law or a sister in law!   
The wedding took place in a grand manner. Kubera came as   
the best-man for Siva. Brahma and Saraswati, and Vishnu and   
Lakshmi attended the wedding and gave the couple a lot of costly   
gifts.   
Finally Siva took leave and left with Uma. He said that they are   
going for honey-moon to Tiruvannamalai. "It is a very cool place   
here. Annamalai is quite hot. So, for a change, we propose to go   
to Tiruvannamalai for honey-moon.   
Himavan exclaimed: "Oh! To Annamalai?"   
Siva said: "Yes, to Annamalai. I own that Hill."   
Himavan became very happy. O, our son-in-law is also the   
owner of a Hill. Then, I should say that he belongs to our caste!   
He and Mena Devi happily saw the couple off to Tiruvannamalai!   
*   
One girl to another:-   
His temple is the cremation ground!   
He wears the tiger skin as a nice apparel.   
He has no mother, no father, He is all alone...   
(What is the glory of your Siva?)   
The other girl answers: What if, He has no mother or father.   
What if, He is all alone, a destitute.   
You don't know His valour, if He gets angry,   
All the worlds will burn to gravel and dust!

## Oh, street beggar with monkeys  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 07, 2010, 10:45:45 AM  
---  
Sivananda Lahari., Verse 20 describes Siva as a street beggar   
holding monkeys.   
sadha mohadavyam charati yuvadheena kuch-girouh   
natathyasa sakasvatati jatithi svairamabhita   
kapalin bhiksho me hrudaya-kapi-matyantha chapalam   
dhrutam bhaktya bhadhva siva bhavadheenam kuru vibho   
O Siva, the one who is all pervading! For ever, my mind is roaming   
in the forests of listless delusion. It dances on the mountain-like breasts  
of young women. It jumps around the branches of the trees of desires. It  
moves hither and thither on all four directions at will without any purpose.  
O the street beggar, with skull as the alms-   
bowl! You take my mind which is the monkey and hold it tight under your  
control with a rope called grace.   
The mind that is monkey can be given only to Siva, who is Pasupati,   
the Lord of all living beings, so that I may become peaceful without its  
interminable pranks and delusions!

Subramanya Iyer, Sri Ramakrishna Math,   
Chennai. Rough translation by me.)

## wishing for others

While doing self enquiry slowly man can understand saranagathi thathva. As  
Bhagavan says when everything is taken care of God we should not worry.   
Now can we wish best things for others. Sometimes things never do happen the  
way man wishes. Ordinary man gets agitated whereas the spiritual   
seeker understands it is our prarabda. Is it good to wish or just keep  
watching?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Wishing others in times of distress is always good, whether others   
are spiritual or not. I am not sure whether our wishes would change   
the course of their prarabdha, but I am sure that these wishes give   
them a lot of peace and this itself is a tonic for their distress.   
Arunachala Siva.

To give comfort we say do not worry, God is there, He will help you. But due  
to prarabda when things turn upside down, opposite people loose their faith.  
It is also their prarabda. They ask when every thing is fixed according to  
the prarabda why we have to pray to God. I do not have answer. Young people  
they expect lot   
in short time and pray to God. It is very difficult to explain them about the  
law of nature, law of karma and prarabda. Actually I will we should pray to  
God to give strength to face the situations whatever it may be rather people  
ask God to grand such such manner to them. To understand the karma theory, we  
should have   
God's grace. Otherwise people get frustrations in life.

Dear I,   
There is this one prayer, it is called as the Serenity Prayer, written by  
Reinhold Niebuhr, a theologian:  **God grant me the serenity   
to accept the things I cannot change;   
courage to change the things I can;   
and wisdom to know the difference.**   
Living one day at a time;   
Enjoying one moment at a time;   
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;   
Taking, as He did, this sinful world   
as it is, not as I would have it;   
Trusting that He will make all things right   
if I surrender to His Will;   
That I may be reasonably happy in this life   
and supremely happy with Him   
Forever in the next.   
Amen.   
This covers the entirety all all religions put together.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent quote and that is the truth. The question of destiny   
has been asked by many devotees and Bhagavan Ramana has   
replied: "Yes. Everything is pre-destined." Devaraja Mudaliar   
then asked Him: "Suppose, I pick up this hand-fan for waving for   
breeze and then keep it down after sometime. Is this also pre-   
destined?" Bhagavan smiled and said: "Yes. Everything is pre-   
destined."   
Then, Ramanaduli, what power on earth can change the course   
of destiny? It is only God/Guru's Grace. Nothing shall prevent.   
our destiny excepting Guru's Grace. To obain Guru's Grace, we should pray,  
meditate and eventually surrender. That is all.   
*   
Oh, You are like my mother, who gives her breasts for suckling!   
If you do not give, this lowly dog, I shall suffer like an uncared baby*   
I trust You, please give me your Grace!   
O Mother, I shall rest at your feet.   
But why are you not gracing me?   
You have taken hold of me, this lowly dog, as your slave,   
Am I saying No, due to some mistrust, I do not know!   
 \- Ananda Maalai, Garland of Bliss, Tiruvachakam, Verse 5   
 Manikkavachagar.
