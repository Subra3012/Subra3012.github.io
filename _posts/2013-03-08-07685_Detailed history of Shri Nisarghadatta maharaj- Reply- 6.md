Dear Vladimir,   
It is sooo interesting to read about Your pilgrimage,and about all the Sacred  
places You visited. How wonderful! I wish i could see all that,but in a way i  
feel i am,reading this post. I am somehow impressed with the native place of  
Bausaheb Maharaj. I dont know why,its sounds Holy and Beautiful,from Your  
words,and it feels that way. And the father superior from Nimbal seems to be  
very fascinating. I am also happy You visited Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj's birth  
place. It must be special experience... I pictured that tree Maharaj planted.  
Althrough the story of tigers and poor dogs is somehow sad.. Well,it is jungle  
like You said.   
I never visited places like those,and i love when i read about it. I am sure  
it is Beautiful and special,like you said. So happy to read about Your  
travel,about our Fathers.   
I must say i dont know much about Your Guru,Sri Ramakant Maharaj,only that He  
is disciple of Maharaj,and sure that time with Him is most precious of  
everything.   
Thank You sooo much for sharing all this! I am truly delighted to read it.  
Truly,truly delighted!   
With love and prayers,
