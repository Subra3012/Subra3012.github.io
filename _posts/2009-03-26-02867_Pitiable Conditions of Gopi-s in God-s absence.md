## Siva, why not you reduce the load on your head?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 26, 2009, 07:59:09 AM

There was one Chokkanatha, a poet in Sirkazhi. He was suffering   
from acute poverty and his daughter was also meditating on Siva   
for marrying her! Oneday he came to Siva temple of Sirkazhi and   
prayed to Siva, Brahmapuriswarar in Sirkazhi: O Siva! The loads on your head are too much. That is why, you   
are irritated and you do not look at our miseries. Why not you   
give the Arugu grass on your head to the deer on your hand?   
The deer shall eat the grass and both would leave you! Why not   
you give to the serpent on your head, your crescent moon? The   
serpent would also eat the moon and both would leave you. Thus   
the loads on your head would get reduced. With less irritation,   
you can come to me and give me riches and also marry my daughter,   
who has become lean as a bamboo, due to misery of love!

## Kanthimathi! Why not you speak to your husband?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 26, 2009, 08:08:43 AM  
---  
Kanthimathi or Vadivamba is the goddess in Siva Temple of Tirunelveli, where  
Siva is called Nellaiyappar. One day, the poet   
Chokkanatha went to that temple and as usual poverty burned him.   
He prayed to Kanthimathi, the goddess, as follows: O Kanthimathi! Why not you speak your husband? You both are   
lying in a bed of pearls with lotuses spread all over it. You are   
a woman of bamboo-like shoulders where pearls grow! You open   
your mouth which drops pearls of sweet-nothings to Siva before   
kissing! You plant your pearls-like teeth upon His mouth which   
is sour with the taste of poison! At that time, why not you speak   
to Him some pearls-like words to recommend my case for riches   
and gold?   
This poem consists imagery of pearls in many places!

## Why is Lotus is in the Navel?  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 26, 2009, 08:58:32 AM

The third virtue of Lord Vishnu is that he bears a lotus on his navel,hence he  
is also known as Padmanabham.   
From the lotus rises Lord Brahma. Brahma has only royal virtues (Rajoguna).  
Thus to remain in peaceful form   
Lord Vishnu has discarded all the royal virtues through his navel. Similarily  
he has made the snake, which has   
Tamoguna (virtue of darkness), his seat, Thus only Satoguna (Virtue of the  
truth) remains with him, and God   
became Shantakaram (acquired a peaceful form). Hence, if a worshipper wishes  
to be in peaceful form, he must   
first discard the virtues of royality and darkness.

## Badarikashram  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 26, 2009, 09:11:25 AM  
---  
Once, on being asked by the sages about the greatness of Badrikasharam, Sutji  
narrated the same tale, which   
Lord Shiva had once told sage Narad -   
Lord Mahadeva had told Narad that altogether there were one lakh and twenty-  
five thousand mountains and   
Badrikashram was supreme among them. Lord Mahadeva said - Badrikasharam is the  
abode of Lord Nara -   
Narayan. Narayan - the origin of all creations has four arms and his  
complexion is dark. Narayan manifests himself   
in both forms - Sakar as well as Nirakar. He is the eternal Purusha and is  
worshipped by people during the full   
period of Uttarayan. Since Badrikashram is covered with snow during the period  
of Dakshinayan, Narayan is not   
worshipper during these six months. All the deities dwell at Badrikasharam.  
The sages live in their hermitages at   
Badrikasharam. River Alaknanda flows at Badrikasharam. Anybody taking a dip in  
the holy water of Alaknanda

## The Battle of Gods and Demons  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 26, 2009, 09:24:02 AM  
---  
Rig, Sama and Yajurveda are like the clothes of Hindu society. Those who give  
them up are in fact   
naked. This statement is endorsed by the following tale: Once upon a time, a battle occurred between the demons and the gods. It lasted  
for one hundred years at the end   
of which period, the demons defeated the gods. The humiliated gods reached  
Ksheersagar and prayed Lord   
Vishnu. Pleased by their prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared before the gods. All  
the gods greeted Him and said- "O   
Lord! In sheer violation of BrahmaÂ’s dictate, formidable demons have kidnapped  
even our due shares offered in   
the oblations. Protect us from the onslaught of the demons. We cannot fill  
them because they abide by their   
religion. Kindly show us a way to kill the demons."   
Hearing the pleas of the gods, Lord Vishnu produced Mayamoha from His body and  
giving them to the   
gods, said- "Mayamoha will cause illusion in the minds of the demons. The  
illusion will influence the   
demons to violate the path shown by the Vedas. You can kill them after that".  
Saying this, the Lord   
disappeared. The gods took Mayamoha and reached the abode of the demons.

## Pitiable Conditions of Gopi's in God's absence  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 26, 2009, 09:27:41 AM

After the disappearance of God, Gopis were perplexed. Their hearts burned with  
desire. They had   
dedicated their entire selves in the feet of Lord. They were entirely merged  
in the love of Krishna. Thus   
driven by passion, Gopis began to search Lord Krishna. They asked trees,  
creepers and vegetation for   
the whereabouts of their beloved. They then spotted His footprints at one  
place. Footprints of Radha   
were also there. 'Indeed He would have carried her, that great fortunate one,  
on His shoulders.' They   
thought. Lord had indeed, after disappearing from amidst Gopis, taken Radha to  
an isolated place. She   
had then began to think herself superior to other Gopis. So at one place, she  
said: "O Lord, I can't walk   
now. My tender feet are tired. Kindly carry me on your shoulders to wherever  
you wish." At her request,   
Lord Krishna agreed to carry her on his shoulder. But as soon as she proceeded  
to ride, Lord   
disappeared from there also. Now, Radha began to cry and wail and fainted. At  
the same time, other   
Gopis also reached there and found Radha lying unconscious on the ground. All  
of them including   
Radha then returned to the bank of Yamuna and began to wait for Krishna's  
appearance.

Dear Nagaraj,   
One Sri Vaishnava gentleman said: Radha was seven years old   
and Krishna was four years old, in the beginning of Srimad   
Bhagavtam. I think these stories have inner layers of meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.
