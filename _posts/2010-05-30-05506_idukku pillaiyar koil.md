## ULLadu Narpadu - 144  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 31, 2010, 08:47:39 AM  
---  
T.R. Kanakammal writes the following comments under ULLadu   
Narpadu Verse 24:- (abridged)   
The perceived body does not have the nature of engaging itself   
in activities with the awareness of the "I". The Atman, the Perceiver, is  
ever still or immovable (achala) by nature, and there is no 'other' in Atman.  
Hence It cannot engage in any activities whatsoever.   
Something appears betwixt the body and Fullness, considering   
the body as its limit and acting with a sense of doership. This   
has many names like Chit-Jada granthi, subtle body, ego, samsara,   
bondage and mind. All these refer only to the mind, the subtle body. It is  
also called Jiva.   
The mind is that which immediately on rising as 'I' creates many   
appearances, ahandai (ego), says Bhagavan. The ahandai, lives   
relating the chit vastu to the body, and acquires the nature of 'I',   
called Jiva bodha. That which appears in a subtle form, within   
the gross body, with seeming existence, is the subtle body, or   
"nutpa mei" or sukshma sarira. The ego, imagining itself to be related to  
totally unrelated things, thereby getting attached to,   
and being whirled around in repeated cycles of births - is samsara. The  
"eternally free" Chit Vastu appearing to be bound by the body is bondage,  
bhandam.   
If "I" is neither the Atman nor the body, what then is "I"?   
Subsiding in sleep and rising as "I" on waking up, the Jiva bodha   
(the individual awareness), the dehatma bhava (I am the body   
notion) is that "I".   
Purely an imaginary being, this Jiva is born out of the superimposition of the  
consciousness of Atman onto the body   
and the blemishes of the body onto the Self. Thus, the ego   
partakes of the character of both the body and the Self. It is both extensive  
and limited. It is an intangible link between body and   
pure Consciousness. The Self is pure and not aware of any   
'other' to say "I".   
This knot chit-jada granthi, is unreal. The Jiva is unreal. Equally unreal  
are the creations of the Jiva or ego, like ignorance bondage etc., Other than  
this Jiva, there is no individual. Individuality is the bondage, which when  
removed, the non dual Atman alone remains. It is the subtle body that is  
distinctive of each individual, persisting till the gain of Jnana. Ego, or  
mind, is the main factor of the subtle body, which moves from one body to  
another, thus inextricably caught up in the wheel of transmigration, called  
samsara.   
Cutting off the knot is too difficult to be accomplished by one's own effort.  
Guru's grace alone can accomplish it. Wisdom lies in the   
sole reliance on the saving grace of the guru. Bhagavan Ramana   
completes the ULLadu Narpadu, with the words, ahandhai uru   
azhithale mukti... The destruction of the ego is liberation. All our efforts  
are only towards this, for which Guru's grace is essential.   
All our devotion, along with simultaneous self enquiry is only to   
obtain the guru's grace in large measure, by making us fitting   
receivers for the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

## idukku pillaiyar koil  
Author: ramanaduli          Date: May 30, 2010, 03:52:27 PM

Once when we went for girivalam we saw some people were standing near by a  
small temple on the way. We asked them   
what is this. They told us this is a idukku pillaiyar koil. If you enter and  
come through it, you would not have   
any more births. Immedietly my friend also tried and came out of other side.  
She also asked me. At first my mind started questioning lot. At end, having  
fear within me whether I could make it or not, I tried and came out.   
I took it as a fun. Because it is not a correct way to become mukthi. I  
wonder, Bhagavan showed us everything.   
But how these practices are being done by the people there.

Idukku Pillaiyar Kovil is a small structure, almost near the   
Eastern side of the giri valam route. There are cavtities on both   
sides and one has to enter on a lying posture and move and come out of the  
front cavity. There is no Pillaiyar or Ganesa inside. It is   
only a structure. People who are not very lien cannot enter and   
come out. My wife who is of a lean frame makes it everytime.   
Even my drivers have gone and come out. I have not ventured   
it since I am somewhat fat. It is only an exercise to try your   
efforts and perseverance. Mukti, I do not know. Bhagavan   
Ramana has not mentioned about it in His conversations. But   
people do it as a ritual in perseverance. It is of course nice, to   
watch my wife going and in coming out!   
Arunachala Siva.
