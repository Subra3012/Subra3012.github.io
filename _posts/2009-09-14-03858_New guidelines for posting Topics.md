## New guidelines for posting Topics

I have observed some frustration from Members in their submissions and replies  
to Topics, with particular reference to large numbers of separate Topics on  
one single theme - i.e. one Topic for each Verse of a long translation.   
This tends to make it difficult for visitors to navigate the site and find  
things of interest to them, especially for those with slower connections.   
Rather than restrict the number of Posts, I have decided to move all of the  
long Translations and Commentaries to a new Board entitled 'Translations and  
Commentaries by Forum Members'.   
Please use this board to post your translations, serialisations and  
commentaries on long works, leaving the other boards free for single Topics.   
The transfer of Topics had already begun and will continue over the next few  
days - I also have a limited connection here in India, so it takes time.   
My thanks   
Graham -

I think it is a good idea to restrict the number of topics each member can  
start in a day.
