## Iswara Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 27, 2009, 12:27:46 PM

Iswara Gita is an old poem available within Kurma Puranam.   
This poem was appreciated by Bhagavan Ramana. The poem   
is in the form of Siva-Uma conversation, as Guru Gita. This   
is full of advaita jnana. I once posted about this. There   
is a Ramanasramam publication of Iswara Gita, Tamil poems   
by Tattvaraya Swamigal, the author of Tamil Kaivalya Navaneetam. This book is  
now out of print.   
Verse 53: Atma is permanent and real, as Truth. Hence rishis call the   
Atma as Truth. This is Brahman. All individual jivas, which   
are nothing but bundles of egos and thoughts and which is the   
product of Maya, is Avidya, unreal and impermanent. This Maya   
again inseparable from Brahman. This is as old as Brahman,   
and acts according to the will of Brahman, of course, depending   
on individual jivas' karmas. Rishis like Sanaka transcended this   
Maya.   
Verse 54: As smoke, dirt, and dust pervade the Space, but Space is   
unaffected by these, the Atma within is unaffected by   
indriyas (sense organs) and antakharana (mind, ego, intellect,   
and mindstuff).   
Verse 56: Upon attainement of Atma Jnana, the individuals consider   
this universe as Brahman, and Jnana Swarupa. They do not   
see anything other than Brahman. Only when Atma Jnana   
is not attained, the individuals consider the universe as real   
and is different from God and are tossed by good and bad,   
pains and pleasures.   
Verse 60: Siva further said to Uma: When a person constantly contemplate the Light in  
his Heart, he never suffers from pains and pleasures,   
and his ego never rises its hood.* He is a Jivan Mukta and is   
ever lives in Light.   
* See Sad Darsanam, Verse 27.   
Verse 61: Realizing that all elements are within him, and all elements   
are both inside and outside the Brahman, he is ever in   
Brahma Swarupam. He never sees anything wrong or sinful   
and is ever without anything wrong or sinful.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Iswara Gita - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 27, 2009, 12:38:15 PM  
---  
A few more verses from Iswara Gita: Verse 66: Those who sulk that it is my destiny to suffer births and deaths,   
are not going to attain salvation. Those who, regardless of   
destiny, constantly practise Atma Vichara as the all-cure medicine,   
shall attain Brahman, with their determination coupled with   
conviction.   
Verse 67: As all rivers ultimately merge in the ocean, and become un-   
differentiated, the individuals practising atma vichara with   
determination, shall attain the subtle Brahma swarupam,   
with their calm disposition and correct knowledge.   
Verse 68: So, there is only Knowledge. Knowledge is in every substance.   
There is nothing other than That. When this Knowledge is   
contaminated with bondage and dyads, people see the universe   
of variety. This variety hides the Brahma Swarupam anbd they   
are deluded and disillusioned seeing the universe different   
from Brahman.   
Verse 69: This Atma Jnana is the True Knowledge. This is pure Bliss.   
All other knowledge are false knowledge. They are untrue   
and are only ignorance.*   
See also Upadesa Saram, Verse 27.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Iswara Gita - 4  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 27, 2009, 05:44:51 PM  
---  
Verse 77: I, Parameswara, is in all beings. No one can understand me   
fully. The good ones who have seen me as Truth, meditate   
on Me and stay in Sahaja state. But many say that I am   
Limitless, I am Purusha and I am this Universe. They also   
realize that I am also different from them.   
Verse 78: The rishis who have realized me in their inner eye call me   
Brahman. They call me as without any qualities, I am taintless,   
and I am the Real that is realized as "I AM". They also know   
that I am the Chitsakti behind this universe. The ignorant never   
knows Me.   
Verse 79: One who understands my real Jnana also knows that there is   
nothing like Maya which comes under one's delusion. This can   
be realized only through Jnana Vichara (enquiry) and not by   
any other means. Thus spake the god of gods, the god of rishis.   
Verse 80: The one who has understood my Reality says that I am beyond   
Maya. And there is no creation at all. They know nothing is   
other than Me. And the universe is run by My command.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Iswara Gita - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 27, 2009, 12:49:33 PM  
---  
A few more verses from Iswara Gita: Verse 74: I, Parameswara, is avyakta, hidden, in all the three states   
of a living being, like wakefulness, dream and deep sleep.   
I am also called the Jiva, individual soul in these states.   
I am also called Maya when I make and unmake the universe.   
I am called Iswra by the devotees. I am called the Prapancham,   
the Universe, by karmis, doers of sacrifices and rituals. I am   
called Brahman, who have overcome the bondage and they   
see my true Light. I am the Light.   
Verse 75: I am not impermanent and destruction. I am ever permanent   
and full of rasa (taste) and gandha (fragrance). All the bodies,   
hands and legs, which are countless, and all kharanas (minds)   
of individuals, which are impermanent, are in Me only. The   
permanent Atma Jnana of yogis and jnanis is also in Me.   
Verse 76: The god of the gods, Parameswara then told Sanaka and   
others: I am seeing everything without the eyes. I am   
walking everywhere without feet. I am listening to all the   
sounds that happen in the Space. I am without hands, but   
can hold everything. I am leaving them too at my will.*   
(* See the comparable verse in Srimad Bhagavad Gita).   
The prose rendering of Iswara Gita, Tamil of Tattvaraya   
Swamigal has been done by Sri J.Jayaraman, of the Asramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Butter Milk Ramayana  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 30, 2009, 06:45:03 AM  
---  
We have heard about Valmiki's Ramayana, Kamban's Ramayana   
in Tamil. Pothana's Ramayana in Telugu, Tulsi Das's Ramayana   
in Hindi and Ezhuttachan's Ramayana in Malayalam. There are   
innumerable Ramayana versions in English. But what is this   
Butter Milk Ramayana?   
There was one rich landlord in the village. He used to have   
many cows and oxen in his yard. His wife used to supply   
buttermilk (I remember the thick buttermilk that is served in   
Sri Ramanasramam, during lunch) to the poor and needy. She   
will measure her supplies to them. Once there was a brahmin   
lady who was poor in that village. She used to go the landlord's   
house and beg the wife for buttermilk. The wife of landlord said: I shall give you, no problem. But you have to tell me Ramayana   
everyday. I cannot read and write. But you are a brahmin's wife.   
The brahmin wife agreed. She used to say short, medium or   
long versions of Ramayana depending upon the measures of   
buttermilk that is given to her! If it is only one small measure,   
she would say: Rama married Sita, lost his wife in the jungle,   
got her back killing Ravana and came back to Ayodhya." That   
is all. If it is two measures, she would give more details. Like   
this, the butter milk Ramayana came into use.   
Bhagavan Ramana has been giving us large measures of not   
only buttermilk but also milk, curds and butter. So we should   
tell Him our Ramayana, our troubles and travails everyday in   
detail. Our doubts and questions should be posed to Him.   
This is our Ramayana. If you tell Him all this, He shall find   
a way out for you. Our Ramayana should be long everyday,   
since He is large measures of milk, buttermilk and butter.   
We should not be cringy.   
Saint Ramalingam says: "If a father beats, the child goes to   
the mother for support. If a mother beats, the child goes   
to the father for support. Here, you are the Father and Mother   
for me. Do not beat me. Where can I go for support? Please   
embrace me instead of beating me! I can bear no more."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Crutches for Life  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 30, 2009, 07:01:46 AM  
---  
This morning I was watching a brief discourse by Sri Sri   
Ravisankar, of Art of Living Couses. He said that the problem   
of modern man is that we are having too many crutches to   
support. A lame cannot walk with more than two crutches.   
Or at best one crutch. But if I give him ten crutches, how can   
he walk? We are today having many crutches, fame, name,   
money, family, doctors, medicines. But we forget the one real   
crutch that is Guru or God. Keep all the crutches away and   
keep only God or Guru as your crutch. That is sufficient for   
you to walk on the path.   
There were Kashmiri brahmins called Pandits in Kashmir.   
They were owning large apple gardens, wealth, palatial   
houses, a lot of Sanskrit knowledge and all that. At some   
point of time, they forgot the God that is the real crutch.   
They were mercilessly driven away from Kashmir. Today   
they are on the streets of Delhi, seeking alms and selling   
fruits!   
In Yuganda, there were a few super rich Indians who were   
runing huge factories and owning a lot of wealth like cars,   
dollar balances in US etc., Idi Amin suddenly gave them 8   
hours notice to leave the country. They were allowed to   
carry one one suitcase for each family. One such wealthy   
Indian had to come to England. His dollar balances had   
been blocked by Uganda. He had nothing. He started   
selling hotdogs in London streets to make a living!   
In both the cases, the persons forgot the one real crutch   
that is God or Guru. Kavyakanta Ganapati once said to   
Bhagavan: "Bhagavan! We can conveniently do our Sadhana, if we get Rs 3.00  
per month (it was 1920s). Bhagavan Ramana smiled and said: "Nayana, why even  
that? It is enough if one has got a human body!" For Bhagavan Ramana, even  
body was not a crutch!   
Arunachala Siva.

It is an unkind remark to state that the Kashmir Pandits and Ugandan Asians  
forgot the real crutch-God. It is an accusation as if all sufferers are non-  
believers of God. God is love and expect the devotees to stand on their own  
leg.

Dear arcsekar,   
I only said that "they forgot their real crutch" It is like saying   
that the Self is always within us, but we forget the Self and   
try to operate only with the mind. The Self is the real crutch,   
but the mind is the pseudo-crutch. This availability of real crutch   
is realized, only when the other crutches fail us.   
Arunachala Siva.
