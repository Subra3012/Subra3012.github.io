வேயுறு தோளிபங்கன் விடமுண்ட கண்டன்   
மிகநல்ல வீணை தடவி   
மாசறு திங்கள்கங்கை முடிமே லணிந்தென்   
உளமே புகுந்த அதனால்   
ஞாயிறு திங்கள்செவ்வாய் புதன்வியாழம் வெள்ளி   
சனிபாம்பி ரண்டு முடனே   
ஆசறு நல்லநல்ல அவைநல்ல நல்ல   
அடியா ரவர்க்கு மிகவே.   
This is from KOLaRu Pathigam of Saint Tiru Jnana Sambandhar: He is the consort of the lady who has got bamboo like (slender) shoulders. He  
has got neck with hala-hala poison held in it.   
He plays Veena lucidly. He has got crescent moon without the dark spot, on His  
matted locks.He has entered my Heart.   
The various planets and their movements - those of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury,  
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the two snakes   
node and anti node called Rahu and Ketu-- all these shall do only good, only  
great good for His devotees.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

This is from the first padigam (actually 11 verses) of Tiru Jnana Sambandhar,  
sung in Sirkazhi when he was three years   
old! He cried for milk in the temple tank and his father was bathing there.  
Not knowing that his father is in tank and without   
seeing his father, he cried due to fear and hunger. (All pageant!). The Lord  
and Goddess of Sirkazhi temple appeared on the sky   
and the Goddess gave her breast milk in a golden cup and gave it to the child-  
saint. Then they disappeared. His father,   
on completion of bath came out and found milk on the lips of the child. He  
asked angrily,'Who gave you milk?' Then   
the child saint showed the temple tower and sang this verse: தோடுடைய செவியன் விடையேறியோர் தூவெண்மதிசூடிக்   
காடுடையசுட லைப்பொடிபூசியென் னுள்ளங்கவர் கள்வன்   
ஏடுடையமல ரான்முனைநாட்பணிந் தேத்த அருள்செய்த   
பீடுடையபிர மாபுரமேவிய பெம்மா னிவனன்றே. (1/1/1)   
He is wearing an ear stud.(thodu) and He came on the Vidai (Rishaba) vehicle.  
He is crescent moon on His head.   
He is seen with vibhuti from the burning ghat. He stole my Heart. Brahma, on  
the lotus had prayed to Him in the   
past and he was graced by Him. He is residing in the great temple of Brahma  
puram, (Sirkazhi) and He is the one   
who came (along with His consort).   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

This Tevaaram song is from Canon 2 (of Tiru Jnana Sambandhar) and it is called  
KOLaRu Padigam,   
the decad that snaps the ill effects of stars and planets: என்பொடு கொம்பொடாமை யிவைமார் பிலங்க   
எருதேறி யேழை யுடனே   
பொன்பொதி மத்தமாலை புனல்சூடி வந்தென்   
உளமே புகுந்த அதனால்

உடனாய நாள்க ளவைதாம்   
அன்பொடு நல்லநல்ல அவைநல்ல நல்ல   
அடியா ரவர்க்கு மிகவே.   
He is wearing bones, pig's horns, tortoise on His chest.   
He comes on a Bull with His consort (Uma_   
He is wearing oomatham garlands and Ganga   
He has entered my Heart,   
So for the devotees of Him,   
the following days are also good,   
that is ninth, tenth,sixteenth,eighteenth, and sixth   
star days from the first star of Aswini.*   
*These star days are supposed to have ill-effects for travel   
and auspicious occasions. But they will do only good for   
the devotees of Siva.   
Aaslesha, jyeshta, Pooradam, Tiruvadhirai (Ardra),and Uttharaashada star days.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is a verse by Jnana Sambandhar from Tirup pugalur, which is on the  
southern bank of Kaveri.   
This is the place where Saint Tirunavukkarasar attained mukti. The temple was  
prayed to by Lord of   
Agni. It is also the birth place of Muruga Nayanar. For Sundaramurti  
Swamigal, Siva made the brick into   
golden bricks.

English Translation of the above verse from Tirup pugalur: He is wearing an ear stud and is the sacred thread. He is having His consort  
Uma on His left form of the body.   
He skinned the elephant (sent by Daruka forest rishis) and wore the skin as  
upper cloth. He is staying in   
the temple of Tirup pugalur where Devas come and worship Him. This is the  
place where there are gardens and   
orchards in which bees make sweet sound -reengram.

English Translation of the above verse: He is having eight weapons in His hands (these include pick axe, trident, fire  
and it also includes abhaya karam and   
vara karam). However He is seeking bhiksha and eats. He is staying in the  
temple of Tiruvalidhayam, (nowadays   
called Padi, on the outskirts of Chennai city). His temple is surrounded by  
orchards and flower gardens from which   
sweet fragrance of honey spreads outside. The devotees who seek Him in total  
surrender, will have no sufferings in   
life and the ill effects of prarabdha will not touch them.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is a Tevaram verse of Jnana Sambandhar in Saiva Canon 1,(4.2). This

Tiruveezhimizhalai is the place where Mahavishnu prayed to Siva and when out  
of 1000 lotuses, one was short., in order   
to complete the puja, he placed his eye, for the lotus. Siva was pleased and  
gave back his eye and also the disc. Siva   
is in the form of marriage attire with Uma. Jnana Sambandhar and  
Tirunavukkarasar received a gold coin each, with which   
they fed the famine stricken people of the town. Since Jnana Sambandha got  
the vision of Siva in Sirkazhi, he combined   
both the temples and composed this decad.   
Verse 2: English meaning: The young girls of this town play with kazhalchi kai (a nut) and ball and also  
play ammanai. They teach the parrots   
the great names of Siva which were learnt and repeated by the parrots.He  
adds:O Lord! You have shown the form   
of Siva in Sirkazhi. You are having a begging bowl which is Brahma's skull.  
What a form is this! The brahmins   
praise you and do pujas here.   
Arunachala Siva.

He is wearing the skin of tiger which was sent by Darkua forest rishis as His  
waist cloth. He is similarly having skin of an elephant which was   
again sent for abhichara by Daruka forest rishis, as His upper cloth. He is  
wearing white Vibhuti. He is having sacred thread which shines on   
His chest. He is the Lord of all celestial beings. His neck is dark for He  
had swallowed hala hala poison and retained it in His   
throat. He confers Atma Jnana Bodham for who prays to Him. (His curved leg  
confers Atma Jnana.) He is having on the left   
of His form Uma Devi, His consort.

This is a verse where Tiru marugal and Tiruch chenkaattankudi are both  
mentioned.   
In Tirumarugal, when a lady eloped with her lover, and stayed in a dark hall,  
the lover got stung by a serpent and he died.   
The lady was weeping saying that he had died even before she married her.  
Jnana Sambandhar came to the hall on his   
way to the temple and saw to it that the lover is resurrected.   
When Jnana Sambandhar was staying in Tirumarugal, Siruthonda Nayanar, another  
Saiva Saint, requested him to come   
to his place, that is Tiruch chenkattan kudi. Even though Sambandhar visited  
Tiruch chenkattankudi later, he showed   
the form of Siva appearing there in Tirumarugal itself.   
Meaning: The brahmins chant Vedas and Vedangas here and prayed to the feet of Siva.  
The moon is shining bright in the nights.   
There are water bodies where the kayal fish swim and jump. Siva is dancing  
with fire on His hand in this temple.   
The place is called Ganapathiswram.   
Arunachala Siva,.

Kaveri river. The temple is called   
Pasupatheeswaram. Siva in this temple is prayed to by Indra, seven rishis and  
cows. Hence this temple is also

such songs.

This is one of the verses in the decad on Tiruveezhi mizhalai which is on the  
Southern Bank of Kaveri. Siva   
is seen in the wedding form of His and Uma. When Mahavishnu was praying to  
Siva, with lotus flowers, one flower   
was short and he placed his eye in lieu of a lotus flower. Siva was pleased  
and gave him the disc as a weapon.   
Saint Tiru Jnana Sambandhar and Saint Tiru Navukkarasar got one gold coin  
each, when they found the town   
population suffering from hunger due to famine conditions arising out of lack  
of seasonal rains and the saints sold   
the gold coins and fed the population with meals.   
ஈறாய்முத லொன்றாயிரு பெண்ணாண்குண மூன்றாய்   
மாறாமறை நான்காய்வரு பூதம்மவை ஐந்தாய்   
ஆறார்சுவை ஏழோசையொ டெட்டுத்திசை தானாய்   
வேறாயுடன் ஆனானிடம் வீழிம்மிழ லையே.   
Arunachala Siva.

Context and Meaning: VENu puram is another name for Sirkazhi. VENu means bamboo. Siva appeared as  
bamboo pole here.   
Meaning: He is having Uma on His left of His form. Uma has got fragrant locks of hair,  
to which bees swarm thinking that she is   
wearing flowers. He is having crescent moon on His crown. Hence He is called  
Chandra choodan. In this temple,   
Mahalakshmi came and prayed. The town has got white sky-rising palaces and  
houses.   
Since Uma and Mahalakshmi are staying here, the temple if prayed to will  
confer learning and wealth to the devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.
