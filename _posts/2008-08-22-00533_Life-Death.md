## Life-Death

If we experience life(self)before physical death,the idea of death will  
disappear in that very experience.   
All thoughts are welcome.

Dear Raju, Yes, the Self can be realized while being alive. Such   
people are Jivan Muktas. eg. Bhagavan. Some others realize   
during the last moments of death and then there is the fall of the body.   
They are Videha Muktas. While Jivan muktas can give teaching   
to the unillumined, the Videha muktas can do nothing of that sort.   
That way, they are very 'selfish'.   
Arunachala Siva.

well, since when we encounter Self which is Awareness ; since Awareness is  
not born, it cannot die thus we, who ever were beyond death, realize that  
we were never born nor will we ever die.   
Sir, please do not call it difficult. The moment we call it so, it becomes a  
distant goal. How can reaching God be difficult, when we are already in him ?  
How can reaching the self be difficult when we are it ?   
These are ideas that need to be rejected.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear sankar,   
 Thinking that experiencing the awareness is difficult is a mind game which creates it for it's survival.If we experince awareness as it is,mind will be annihilated so mind will try it's best to divert your attention from the awareness.But if you do self-enquiry with firm conviction that you are the self mind games will not divert your attention towards awareness and experiencing awareness is not at all difficult because we are that.

Dear Raju, Kindly do not get into the deluge of words. We are all,   
as srkudai said, ever the Awareness. But, what is obstructing is   
the ego. Bhagavan says, "Leave the mind, the Awareness shines."   
See His words. He did not say, "Awareness will appear', but said   
'Awareness shines". The Awareness is ever present, as   
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, I am telling you too. Do not get into whirlpool   
of words. Sastra vasana will not take us anywhere. Be still   
and the Awareness shines.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel, Mind or ego, as you have correctly said, is   
necessary to know the Self. It is like, the stick that stirs   
the funeral pyre. Who am I? (1902) will not leave us. It is   
one book which contains all the answers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel,   
 "who am i "stick is always directed selfwards.That is the main difference between "who am i"thought and other thoughts which are always directed   
towards objects.

Dear Raju, Very much yes. The Who am I? is the stick is   
pointing to the Self within. This burns all the outgoing thoughts,   
and in the Self Realization, it burns itself.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sankar,   
 As you wisely said mode of transport is also important to reach the destination.Bhagawan made the best, fast and smooth mode of   
transport for all of us in the form of self-enquiry.As you rightly said we can  
reach the destination fast by doing self-enquiry sincerely by holding on to   
self tenaciously.

Dear Sankar, Turn the mind or the ego inside. The Guru outside   
will push it inwards. The Guru within, the Paramatman will pull   
it from inside.   
Arunachala Siva.
