After a devotee sent to Sri Bhagavan a Tamil translation of Shankaracharyas  
Atma Bodha, Bhagavan composed a new translation in Tamil. He did this  
translation very rapidly, working even at night, using a flashlight!   
Can Shankara, the enlightener of the Self, be different from ones own Self?  
Who but he, does this day, abiding as the inmost Self in me, speak this in the  
Tamil language?  Sri Bhagavan   
1\. This  Atma Bodha  is meant to fulfil the want of the seekers of  
liberation who, by their prolonged tapas, have already cleansed themselves of  
impurities and become mentally peaceful and free from desires.   
 **2\. Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one  as  
essential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gained.   
3\. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. On the other  
hand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.**   
4\. Owing to ignorance, the Self now appears to be covered up; on the removal  
of ignorance, the pure Self will shine forth of Itself, like the sun after the  
dispersal of clouds.   
5\. The jiva is mixed up with ignorance. By constant practice of knowledge the  
jiva becomes pure, because knowledge disappears (along with ignorance), as the  
cleansing nut with the impurities in the water.But here is the world, how can  
the Self alone be real and non-dual?   
6\. Samsara is full of likes and dislikes and other opposites. Like a dream,  
it seems real for the time being; but, on waking, it vanishes because it is  
unreal.   
Because the dream is negated on waking, I know it to be unreal; but the world  
persists and I find it only real.   
7\. So long as the substratum of all, the non-dual Brahman is not seen, the  
world seems real  like illusory silver in a piece of mother-of-pearl.But the  
world is so diverse; yet, you say there is One only.   
 **8\. Like bubbles rising on the surface of the waters of the ocean, all the  
worlds arise from, stay in and resolve into the Supreme Being (Paramesa) who  
is the root cause and prop of all.**   
9\. In the Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is all permeating, eternal Vishnu,  
all these diverse objects and individuals appear (as phenomena) like various  
ornaments made of gold.Yes, but what about the numberless individual souls?   
10\. Just as the all-pervading akasa (ether) appears fragmented in different  
objects (as in a pit, a jar, a house, a theatre hall, etc.) but remains  
undifferentiated on the limitations falling away, similarly with the single,  
non-dual ruler of the   
senses (seeming to function as gods, men, cattle, etc.). But the individuals  
have different traits and function according to different conditions.   
 **11\. The traits, etc., are also superimposed. Pure water (tasteless by  
itself) tastes sweet, bitter, salty etc., according to the admixture in it  
(upadhis). Similarly, race, name status, etc., are all superimposed on the  
non-dual Self of all. What are these upadhis which play such tricks on the  
Self? They are gross, subtle and very subtle as described here.**   
12\. The gross body made up of the five gross elements (earth, water, fire,  
air and ether) is meant to reap the fruits of past actions in the shape of  
pleasure and pain.   
13\. The subtle body consisting of the five airs, the mind,intellect, the ten  
senses and made up of subtle elements is also meant for enjoyment (as in  
dreams).   
14\. Inexpressible and beginningless ignorance is said to be the causal body  
(as in deep sleep). Know the Self to be other than these three upadhis.   
If so, why is the Self not evident to me? On the other hand, Sruti says, This  
Purusha is made up of annarasa (essence of food).   
 **15\. Just as a clear crystal (itself colourless) appears red,blue, yellow,  
etc., according to the background, so also the Self, pure and untainted, seems  
to be identical with the body,the senses, the mind, intellect or blissful  
ignorance (panchakosas) when in contact with them.**   
16\. Just as husking the paddy exposes the grain within (the rice), so also  
should one judiciously separate the pure Atman from the sheaths covering it.   
Atman is said to be everywhere. Why should it then be judiciously looked for  
within the five sheaths?   
17\. Though always and everywhere present, the Self does not shine forth in  
all places. Just as light is reflected only in a transparent medium, so also  
the Self is clearly seen in the intellect only.   
18\. The Self is realized in the intellect as the witness of the activities  
of, and yet separate from the body, the senses, the mind, intellect and gross  
nature (prakriti) as is a king in relation to his subjects.   
The Self seems to participate in their activities; so he cannot be different  
from them, nor be their witness.   
19\. Just as the moon seems to move when the clouds around her move, so also  
the Self seems to the indiscriminating to be active, when actually, the senses  
are active.   
To be active, the body etc., must also be intelligent; they are said to be  
inert. How can they act without the intelligent Self participating in their  
actions?   
 **20\. Just as men do their duties in the light of the sun (but the sun does  
not participate in them), so also the body, senses, etc., function in the  
light of the Self without its participating in them.**   
True, the Self alone is intelligence. I know myself to be born,growing,  
decaying, happy, or unhappy and so on. Am I right?   
21\. No. The characteristics (birth, death, etc.) of the body and the senses  
are superimposed on the Being- Consciousness-Bliss as is the blue in the sky  
by those who do not discriminate.   
22\. So also **the characteristics of the mind, such as agency, etc., are by  
ignorance superimposed on the Atman, as are the movements of water on the moon  
reflected in it.   
23\. Only when the intellect is manifested, likes and dislikes, pleasure and  
pain are felt. In deep sleep, the intellect remaining latent, they are not  
felt. Therefore, they are of the intellect and not of the Atman (the Self).  
Here is the real nature of the Atman.**   
24\. As light is the very sun, coldness the water, heat the fire, so also the  
eternal, pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss is the very Self.   
At some time or other, every individual experiences, I am happy, and thus  
Being-Consciousness-Bliss experience is plain. How can one make the experience  
permanent and unchanging?   
25\. Being-Consciousness is of the Self; the I mode or modification is of  
the intellect; these are distinctly two.However, owing to ignorance, the  
individual mixes them together and thinks I know and acts accordingly.   
26\. Never is there any change (or action) in Atman nor knowledge in the  
intellect. Only the jiva is deluded into thinking itself to be the knower,  
doer and seer.   
 **27\. Like the snake in the rope, mistaking the jiva for the Self, one is  
subject to fear. If, on the other hand, one knows oneself not as a jiva but as  
the supreme Self, one is altogether free from fear**.   
28\. Only the Self illumines the senses, intellect, etc., as a lamp does  
objects such as pots. The Self is not illumined by them as they are inert.   
If the Self cannot be made known by the intellect, there will be no knower to  
know the Self and the Self cannot be known.   
29\. To see a light, no other light is needed. So also, the Self being self-  
effulgent, needs no other means of knowledge. It shines of itself.   
If so, every one must be Self-realized, effortlessly, but it is not so.   
30\. On the strength of the Vedic teaching, Not this, not this, eliminate  
all the adjuncts (upadhis) and with the help of the mahavakyas, realize the  
identity of the jivatman (individual self) with the paramatman (the supreme  
Self).   
31\. The whole objective world such as the body, is born of ignorance and  
transient like a bubble on water. Know the Self to be distinct from it and  
identical with Brahman (the Supreme).   
32\. Being distinct from the gross body, birth, death, old age, debility,  
etc., do not pertain to me. Not being the senses, I have no connection with  
the objects of the senses such as sound, etc.   
 _33\. The srutis declare: I am not the vital air (prana), not the mind,  
(but) pure (Being). Not being the mind I am free from likes and dislikes,  
fear, etc.   
34\. I am free from qualities and actionless, eternal, undifferentiated,  
untainted, unchanging, formless, ever free and pure._   
35\. Like ether, I am always pervading all, in and out, unswerving, ever  
equal in all, pure, untainted, clear and unshaken.   
 **36\. That which remains eternal, pure, ever-free, all alone, unbroken  
bliss, non-dual, Being-Consciousness-Bliss, transcendent Brahman (the same) am  
I.**   
37\. Long, constant practice of I am Brahman only destroys all vasanas  
(latent tendencies), born of ignorance as an efficacious remedy (rasayana)  
eradicates a disease.   
 **38\. Be dispassionate, keep the senses under control and let the mind not  
wander; sit in a solitary place and meditate on the Self as infinite and one  
alone.**   
39\. Keep the mind pure; with keen intellect, resolve all that is objective  
into the Self and always meditate on the Self as clear and single like ether.   
40\. Having discarded all names and forms, you are now the knower of the  
Supreme Being and will remain as perfect Consciousness-Bliss.   
41\. Being the same as Consciousness-Bliss, there is no longer any  
differentiation such as the knower and the known; and the Self shines forth as  
Itself.   
 **42\. If in this manner by process of constant meditation,the two pieces of  
wood, namely the Self and the ego are rubbed together, the flames from the  
fire of knowledge burn away the whole range of ignorance.**   
43\. On knowledge destroying ignorance in this way, like the light of dawn  
scattering the darkness of night, the Self will rise like the sun in all its  
glory.   
 **44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing  
to ignorance. On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were  
gained, like the necklace on ones own neck.**   
45\. Just as in darkness a post is mistaken for a man, so is Brahman in  
ignorance mistaken for a jiva. If, however, the true nature of a jiva is seen,  
delusion vanishes.   
46\. Knowledge arising on the experience of reality immediately destroys the  
ignorant perception of I and mine, which resemble the delusion of  
direction in darkness.   
 **47\. A jnani who is a perfectly Self-realized yogi, sees by the eye of  
wisdom all objective phenomena to be in and of the Self and thus the Self to  
be the sole being.   
How does he then act in the world?**   
 **48\. Just as clay is the only material from which different utensils are  
formed (such as pots, jars, etc.), so he sees that the Self, too, is the whole  
universe and there is nothing but the Self.   
49\. In order to be liberated while yet alive, the sage should completely  
avoid the adjuncts (upadhis), and thus gain the real nature of Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into a wasp.   
Note: Upadhis are like thinking "i am body", "i am thin", "i am rich", "i am mind".   
maggot means(insect) and wasp means (butterfly).Butterfly normally picks one  
insect and then keeps it in hole and starts bites it.Finally maybe insect also  
gets butterfly qualities and starts flying.   
For more details see AtmaBodha Pravacham By Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami  
Volume15.   
50\. Having crossed the ocean of illusion and having killed the demons of  
likes and dislikes, the yogi, now united to shanti (peace), finds delight in  
the Self and so remains in his own glory.   
51\. The jivanmukta, freed from all desire for transient,external pleasures,  
delights in his own Self and remains clear and steady like lamp in a pot.   
52\. Like the akasa (ether) which remains untainted by the objects contained  
therein, the muni (sage) remains untainted by the adjuncts (upadhis) covering  
him. Being the   
all-knower he remains like one that knows not, and moves about like the air  
uncontaminated by the objects it touches.   
53\. On the dissolution of the adjuncts (the body, senses,etc.), the sage now  
freed from particularities merges in the all-permeating Being (Vishnu), like  
water in water, ether in ether or fire in fire.   
54\. There is no gain over and above this gain, no pleasure over and above  
this bliss, no knowledge over and above this knowledge, know this to be  
Brahman.   
55\. That on seeing which nothing remains to see, on becoming which there is  
no more return to samsara, on knowing which nothing remains to know, know that  
to be Brahman.   
56\. What fills everything, above, below and around, itself Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, non-dual, infinite, eternal, one only, know that to be  
Brahman.   
 **57\. What remains as immutable, unbroken Bliss, and as one only, that which  
even the scriptures indirectly denote by the process of elimination as not  
this, not this, know the same to be Brahman.   
58\. Dependent on a fraction of the inexhaustible Bliss of the Atman, all the  
gods such as Brahma enjoy bliss according to their grades.   
59\. Like the butter in milk, the objective universe is contained in it; all  
the activities are based on it alone. Therefore Brahman is all-pervading.**   
60\. What is neither subtle nor gross, short nor long,produced nor spent, what  
is devoid of form, attribute, caste and name, know it to be Brahman.   
 **61\. By whose light the sun and other luminaries shine forth, but which is  
not itself illumined by them and in whose light all this is seen, know it to  
be Brahman.**   
62\. Like fire in a piece of red-hot iron, Brahman permeates the whole world  
in and out and all through, makes it shine and itself also shines by itself.   
63.Brahman is distinct from the universe,yet there remains nothing apart from  
Brahman.Should any other than Brahman appear,it is only an illusion like water  
in a   
mirage.   
64\. Whatever is seen or heard, it cannot be different from Brahman. True  
knowledge finds Brahman to be Being-Consciousness-Bliss and one without a  
second.   
 **65\. Only the eye of wisdom can see the omnipresent Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss, but not the eye of ignorance for a blind eye cannot see the sun.   
66\. Like gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities  
burnt away by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by sravana,  
manana and nidhidhyasana (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he  
shines forth by himself.**   
67\. Because the sun of knowledge, the chaser of darkness has risen, the Atman  
shines in the expanse of the Heart as the omnipresent sustainer of all and  
illumines all.   
68\. He who bathes in the clear, warm, ever-refreshing waters of the Atman,  
which being available everywhere, here and now, need not be sought for in  
special centres and seasons; such a one remains actionless. He is the knower  
of all; he pervades all and is ever immortal.

## Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi Composition Of Atma Bodha (Knowledge of the Self )  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: May 01, 2010, 11:37:06 AM

After a devotee sent to Sri Bhagavan a Tamil translation of Shankaracharyaâs  
Atma Bodha, Bhagavan composed a new translation in Tamil. He did this  
translation very rapidly, working even at night, using a flashlight!   
âCan Shankara, the enlightener of the Self, be different from oneâs own  
Self? Who but he, does this day, abiding as the inmost Self in me, speak this  
in the Tamil language?â â Sri Bhagavan   
1\. This â Atma Bodha â is meant to fulfil the want of the seekers of  
liberation who, by their prolonged tapas, have already cleansed themselves of  
impurities and become mentally peaceful and free from desires.   
 **2\. Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one â as  
essential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gained.   
3\. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. On the other  
hand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.**   
4\. Owing to ignorance, the Self now appears to be covered up; on the removal  
of ignorance, the pure Self will shine forth of Itself, like the sun after the  
dispersal of clouds.   
5\. The jiva is mixed up with ignorance. By constant practice of knowledge the  
jiva becomes pure, because knowledge disappears (along with ignorance), as the  
cleansing nut with the impurities in the water.But here is the world, how can  
the Self alone be real and non-dual?   
6\. Samsara is full of likes and dislikes and other opposites. Like a dream,  
it seems real for the time being; but, on waking, it vanishes because it is  
unreal.   
Because the dream is negated on waking, I know it to be unreal; but the world  
persists and I find it only real.   
7\. So long as the substratum of all, the non-dual Brahman is not seen, the  
world seems real â like illusory silver in a piece of mother-of-pearl.But  
the world is so diverse; yet, you say there is One only.   
 **8\. Like bubbles rising on the surface of the waters of the ocean, all the  
worlds arise from, stay in and resolve into the Supreme Being (Paramesa) who  
is the root cause and prop of all.**   
9\. In the Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is all permeating, eternal Vishnu,  
all these diverse objects and individuals appear (as phenomena) like various  
ornaments made of gold.Yes, but what about the numberless individual souls?   
10\. Just as the all-pervading akasa (ether) appears fragmented in different  
objects (as in a pit, a jar, a house, a theatre hall, etc.) but remains  
undifferentiated on the limitations falling away, similarly with the single,  
non-dual ruler of the   
senses (seeming to function as gods, men, cattle, etc.). But the individuals  
have different traits and function according to different conditions.   
 **11\. The traits, etc., are also superimposed. Pure water (tasteless by  
itself) tastes sweet, bitter, salty etc., according to the admixture in it  
(upadhis). Similarly, race, name status, etc., are all superimposed on the  
non-dual Self of all. What are these upadhis which play such tricks on the  
Self? They are gross, subtle and very subtle as described here.**   
12\. The gross body made up of the five gross elements (earth, water, fire,  
air and ether) is meant to reap the fruits of past actions in the shape of  
pleasure and pain.   
13\. The subtle body consisting of the five airs, the mind,intellect, the ten  
senses and made up of subtle elements is also meant for enjoyment (as in  
dreams).   
14\. Inexpressible and beginningless ignorance is said to be the causal body  
(as in deep sleep). Know the Self to be other than these three upadhis.   
If so, why is the Self not evident to me? On the other hand, Sruti says,  
âThis Purusha is made up of annarasa (essence of food).â   
 **15\. Just as a clear crystal (itself colourless) appears red,blue, yellow,  
etc., according to the background, so also the Self, pure and untainted, seems  
to be identical with the body,the senses, the mind, intellect or blissful  
ignorance (panchakosas) when in contact with them.**   
16\. Just as husking the paddy exposes the grain within (the rice), so also  
should one judiciously separate the pure Atman from the sheaths covering it.   
Atman is said to be everywhere. Why should it then be judiciously looked for  
within the five sheaths?   
17\. Though always and everywhere present, the Self does not shine forth in  
all places. Just as light is reflected only in a transparent medium, so also  
the Self is clearly seen in the intellect only.   
18\. The Self is realized in the intellect as the witness of the activities  
of, and yet separate from the body, the senses, the mind, intellect and gross  
nature (prakriti) as is a king in relation to his subjects.   
The Self seems to participate in their activities; so he cannot be different  
from them, nor be their witness.   
19\. Just as the moon seems to move when the clouds around her move, so also  
the Self seems to the indiscriminating to be active, when actually, the senses  
are active.   
To be active, the body etc., must also be intelligent; they are said to be  
inert. How can they act without the intelligent Self participating in their  
actions?   
 **20\. Just as men do their duties in the light of the sun (but the sun does  
not participate in them), so also the body, senses, etc., function in the  
light of the Self without its participating in them.**   
True, the Self alone is intelligence. I know myself to be born,growing,  
decaying, happy, or unhappy and so on. Am I right?   
21\. No. The characteristics (birth, death, etc.) of the body and the senses  
are superimposed on the Being- Consciousness-Bliss as is the blue in the sky  
by those who do not discriminate.   
22\. So also **the characteristics of the mind, such as agency, etc., are by  
ignorance superimposed on the Atman, as are the movements of water on the moon  
reflected in it.   
23\. Only when the intellect is manifested, likes and dislikes, pleasure and  
pain are felt. In deep sleep, the intellect remaining latent, they are not  
felt. Therefore, they are of the intellect and not of the Atman (the Self).  
Here is the real nature of the Atman.**   
24\. As light is the very sun, coldness the water, heat the fire, so also the  
eternal, pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss is the very Self.   
At some time or other, every individual experiences, âI am happyâ, and  
thus Being-Consciousness-Bliss experience is plain. How can one make the  
experience permanent and unchanging?   
25\. Being-Consciousness is of the Self; the âIâ mode or modification is  
of the intellect; these are distinctly two.However, owing to ignorance, the  
individual mixes them together and thinks âI knowâ and acts accordingly.   
26\. Never is there any change (or action) in Atman nor knowledge in the  
intellect. Only the jiva is deluded into thinking itself to be the knower,  
doer and seer.   
 **27\. Like the snake in the rope, mistaking the jiva for the Self, one is  
subject to fear. If, on the other hand, one knows oneself not as a jiva but as  
the supreme Self, one is altogether free from fear**.   
28\. Only the Self illumines the senses, intellect, etc., as a lamp does  
objects such as pots. The Self is not illumined by them as they are inert.   
If the Self cannot be made known by the intellect, there will be no knower to  
know the Self and the Self cannot be known.   
29\. To see a light, no other light is needed. So also, the Self being self-  
effulgent, needs no other means of knowledge. It shines of itself.   
If so, every one must be Self-realized, effortlessly, but it is not so.   
30\. On the strength of the Vedic teaching, âNot this, not thisâ,  
eliminate all the adjuncts (upadhis) and with the help of the mahavakyas,  
realize the identity of the jivatman (individual self) with the paramatman  
(the supreme Self).   
31\. The whole objective world such as the body, is born of ignorance and  
transient like a bubble on water. Know the Self to be distinct from it and  
identical with Brahman (the Supreme).   
32\. Being distinct from the gross body, birth, death, old age, debility,  
etc., do not pertain to me. Not being the senses, I have no connection with  
the objects of the senses such as sound, etc.   
 _33\. The srutis declare: âI am not the vital air (prana), not the mind,  
(but) pure (Being).â Not being the mind I am free from likes and dislikes,  
fear, etc.   
34\. âI am free from qualities and actionless, eternal, undifferentiated,  
untainted, unchanging, formless, ever free and pure._   
35\. âLike ether, I am always pervading all, in and out, unswerving, ever  
equal in all, pure, untainted, clear and unshaken.   
 **36\. âThat which remains eternal, pure, ever-free, all alone, unbroken  
bliss, non-dual, Being-Consciousness-Bliss, transcendent Brahman (the same) am  
Iâ.**   
37\. Long, constant practice of âI am Brahman onlyâ destroys all vasanas  
(latent tendencies), born of ignorance as an efficacious remedy (rasayana)  
eradicates a disease.   
 **38\. Be dispassionate, keep the senses under control and let the mind not  
wander; sit in a solitary place and meditate on the Self as infinite and one  
alone.**   
39\. Keep the mind pure; with keen intellect, resolve all that is objective  
into the Self and always meditate on the Self as clear and single like ether.   
40\. Having discarded all names and forms, you are now the knower of the  
Supreme Being and will remain as perfect Consciousness-Bliss.   
41\. Being the same as Consciousness-Bliss, there is no longer any  
differentiation such as the knower and the known; and the Self shines forth as  
Itself.   
 **42\. If in this manner by process of constant meditation,the two pieces of  
wood, namely the Self and the ego are rubbed together, the flames from the  
fire of knowledge burn away the whole range of ignorance.**   
43\. On knowledge destroying ignorance in this way, like the light of dawn  
scattering the darkness of night, the Self will rise like the sun in all its  
glory.   
 **44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing  
to ignorance. On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were  
gained, like the necklace on oneâs own neck.**   
45\. Just as in darkness a post is mistaken for a man, so is Brahman in  
ignorance mistaken for a jiva. If, however, the true nature of a jiva is seen,  
delusion vanishes.   
46\. Knowledge arising on the experience of reality immediately destroys the  
ignorant perception of âIâ and âmineâ, which resemble the delusion of  
direction in darkness.   
 **47\. A jnani who is a perfectly Self-realized yogi, sees by the eye of  
wisdom all objective phenomena to be in and of the Self and thus the Self to  
be the sole being.   
How does he then act in the world?**   
 **48\. Just as clay is the only material from which different utensils are  
formed (such as pots, jars, etc.), so he sees that the Self, too, is the whole  
universe and there is nothing but the Self.   
49\. In order to be liberated while yet alive, the sage should completely  
avoid the adjuncts (upadhis), and thus gain the real nature of Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into a wasp.   
Note: Upadhis are like thinking "i am body", "i am thin", "i am rich", "i am mind".   
maggot means(insect) and wasp means (butterfly).Butterfly normally picks one  
insect and then keeps it in hole and starts bites it.Finally maybe insect also  
gets butterfly qualities and starts flying.   
For more details see AtmaBodha Pravacham By Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami  
Volume15.   
50\. Having crossed the ocean of illusion and having killed the demons of  
likes and dislikes, the yogi, now united to shanti (peace), finds delight in  
the Self and so remains in his own glory.   
51\. The jivanmukta, freed from all desire for transient,external pleasures,  
delights in his own Self and remains clear and steady like lamp in a pot.   
52\. Like the akasa (ether) which remains untainted by the objects contained  
therein, the muni (sage) remains untainted by the adjuncts (upadhis) covering  
him. Being the   
all-knower he remains like one that knows not, and moves about like the air  
uncontaminated by the objects it touches.   
53\. On the dissolution of the adjuncts (the body, senses,etc.), the sage now  
freed from particularities merges in the all-permeating Being (Vishnu), like  
water in water, ether in ether or fire in fire.   
54\. There is no gain over and above this gain, no pleasure over and above  
this bliss, no knowledge over and above this knowledge, know this to be  
Brahman.   
55\. That on seeing which nothing remains to see, on becoming which there is  
no more return to samsara, on knowing which nothing remains to know, know that  
to be Brahman.   
56\. What fills everything, above, below and around, itself Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, non-dual, infinite, eternal, one only, know that to be  
Brahman.   
 **57\. What remains as immutable, unbroken Bliss, and as one only, that which  
even the scriptures indirectly denote by the process of elimination as ânot  
this, not thisâ, know the same to be Brahman.   
58\. Dependent on a fraction of the inexhaustible Bliss of the Atman, all the  
gods such as Brahma enjoy bliss according to their grades.   
59\. Like the butter in milk, the objective universe is contained in it; all  
the activities are based on it alone. Therefore Brahman is all-pervading.**   
60\. What is neither subtle nor gross, short nor long,produced nor spent, what  
is devoid of form, attribute, caste and name, know it to be Brahman.   
 **61\. By whose light the sun and other luminaries shine forth, but which is  
not itself illumined by them and in whose light all this is seen, know it to  
be Brahman.**   
62\. Like fire in a piece of red-hot iron, Brahman permeates the whole world  
in and out and all through, makes it shine and itself also shines by itself.   
63.Brahman is distinct from the universe,yet there remains nothing apart from  
Brahman.Should any other than Brahman appear,it is only an illusion like water  
in a   
mirage.   
64\. Whatever is seen or heard, it cannot be different from Brahman. True  
knowledge finds Brahman to be Being-Consciousness-Bliss and one without a  
second.   
 **65\. Only the eye of wisdom can see the omnipresent Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss, but not the eye of ignorance for a blind eye cannot see the sun.   
66\. Like gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities  
burnt away by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by sravana,  
manana and nidhidhyasana (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he  
shines forth by himself.**   
67\. Because the sun of knowledge, the chaser of darkness has risen, the Atman  
shines in the expanse of the Heart as the omnipresent sustainer of all and  
illumines all.   
68\. He who bathes in the clear, warm, ever-refreshing waters of the Atman,  
which being available everywhere, here and now, need not be sought for in  
special centres and seasons; such a one remains actionless. He is the knower  
of all; he pervades all and is ever immortal.
