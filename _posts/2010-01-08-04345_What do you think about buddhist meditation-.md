## superset and subset

A student was asked to give an example of superset-subset relationship: He wrote: Superset A = {}   
Subset B = {mind, ego, thought}   
The teacher was angry. He asked: Why did you make the superset null?   
How will you get things from a null superset in a subset?   
The student scratched his head and replied: That is what I am learning.   
The teaching gave him 0, a rejection of null.   
A holy man saw it and gave him 0, a blessing of null.   
(A set is an unordered collection of elements)

Dear rideforever,   
I have said today in another post, desiring the Self is the only   
vasana that one can have. Bhagavan has said this. For desiring   
the Self, if one goes to a Guru or read His teachings, then it   
becomes auxillary to that desiring of the Self. These are all   
done by Suddha Manas, or Pure Mind, which do not cultivate   
prarabdha effect.   
Arunachala Siva.
