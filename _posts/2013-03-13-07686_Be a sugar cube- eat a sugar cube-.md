Dear Vladimir,   
Great! I would love to see these pictures and clips. Also to read and know  
more about the places of all the Gurus from our lineage. I actually know very  
little,only basic things. And its very interesting to know all and see from  
someone who actually is been there,and recently too. And i am very interested  
to see and hear Sri Ramakant Maharaj.   
Yes,i think i will understand. Our languages are very similar,and i generally  
i know little Russian,from shooll.   
Thank You so much for the chance to participate in Your wonderful pilgrimage!   
With love and prayers,

Deepa-Ji   
My only intent was the highlighted areas.   
People believe and argue vehemently - at least among my relatives \- that  
Bhagavatham is nothing but Bhakthi. But sadly, people dont realize what  
Bhagavatham itself tells about itself. It keeps saying all through and then  
ends with the term - "Satyam Param Dhi-mahi". This is a very controversial  
topic - not in this forum - but even among my relatives and friends. But  
repeatedly, BG (not just the highlighted verses) and Bhagavatham keeps  
highlighting the importance of jnana above everything else. Even if BG and  
Bhagavatham keeps saying clearly "without any qualifications and adjectives"  
about this - people keep adding "adjectives and qualifications and  
interpretations" to escape the truth. I quoted only a few verses - there are  
tons more, though not as water tight as what Udai mentioned from Atma Bodha.  
Among their interpretations and arguments (all these among my relatives) -  
people keep saying Sri Ramakrishna Bhagawan was pure bhakthi etc. But they  
dont realize two things - one, there is only one ramakrishna bhagawan in the  
entire universe history and two, in my opinion ramakrishna bhagawan is the  
utmost jnani and Ramana Bhagawan is the utmost bhaktha ( and also vice versa  
).   
Enough for confusion today,   
-Sanjay.

Deepa, Sanjaya and others,   
I dont quite agree with your sort of emphaiss on jnana etc.   
I feel Sanjaya is trying to prove something as if taking the side of jnana and  
commenting on a bhakthi work like Bhagavatam.   
I dont understand what some people think when they use term like jnana. It is  
not definitely fanciful quotes with tgerms like All is Self, I am Self, No  
effrots, No objects only Pure Conscousness.   
Jnana is in experience only. You cannot describe it. The moment you say  
'There is only Consciousness' that itself is duality.   
So there is no need to argue for jnana in place of bhakthi and trying to prove  
that a book is jnana book.   
This is not a correct trend -- to classify a jnanai like Thakur as this or  
that.   
Ramana Maharishee did not mean this when he spoke about Self.   
And whoever attained jnana, they attained because they put into practice  
whatever sadhana their Guru gave them.   
They never read any scripture endlessly and then take sides and support the  
cause of jnana yoga scriptures.   
Scriptures are pointers -- discussions are to clear the block and move ahead,  
noone replace efrorts. And efforts do not require taking sides or commenting  
on what other friends think about Bhagavatam.

Dear Krishna   
I knew this will be misunderstood in spite of me quoting Sri Ramakrishna and  
Ramana Bhagawan.   
Quote  
> I feel Sanjaya is trying to prove something as if taking the side of jnana  
> and commenting on a bhakthi work like Bhagavatam.  
I am saying exactly the opposite. A great bhakthi work like Bhagawatham talks  
of Jnana equally is my point. A great bhaktha like Sri Ramakrishna Bhagawan in  
my opinion is a great jnani equally. A great jnani like Ramana Bhagawan is a  
great Bhaktha according to me.   
Who am I to take sides, sir? I dont own / authored any of these - just that I  
dont like interpretations of scriptures to suit our mindset. I take only one  
side - the side of Supreme Truth. I have no sides to take on the path to reach  
there. Again, A true bhaktha like Sri Ramakrishna is also a great jnani and a  
great jnani like Bhagawan is a great bhaktha.   
Hope that clarifies, my friend.   
Best of luck   
Sanjay

Thanks everyone for the information, and the links. I have started to listen  
to Swami Chinmayananda. Many thanks again!   
God bless.

Deepa - Ji   
yes. They are in torrent format. You need to have a torrent downloader like  
they mention. It took me more than 5 months to listen to this whole thing - it  
was the first full BG satsang I listened - and it was an awesome start, I must  
say.

Deepa-Ji   
Quote  
> bhakthi at its most intense will become jnana (from bedha bhakthi to abedha  
> bhakthi). And jnana will also develop intense bhakthi.  
Very well written. Very true indeed. What is the use arguing about the path.  
If we can find a new path to Supreme Truth and claim that as best (other than  
yoga, bhakthi, jnana etc) - so be it. All we should be concerned about is how  
are we progressing towards the Supreme Truth that all Veda and Upanishads  
unequivocally proclaim as Supreme Truth.

Deepa Ji   
You dont need torrent - here is the complete MP3 version for download. You  
have to download individually and will take sometime though.

Dear Krishna-Ji   
It does not serve any purpose saying nothing exists, nothing needs to be done  
etc. Then why are we doing all these? Why are all jnani's imparting so much -  
to guide us? They could have just sat there saying - nothing needs to be  
understood, just wait for jnana at most unexpected place. This would amount to  
rubbishing everything written in Upanishads and Vedas and told by jnanis and  
Lord Krishna in 18 chapters elaborately. Upanishads could have just said  
nothing needs to be understood. The only purpose this will serve is keep our  
basal vasanas and lower planes of vasanas flourish - without purifying the  
ego.   
Purifying ego is a very important step in realization and all the jnana in  
scriptures help achieve that. All scriptures and jnanis help remove obstacles.  
Without that one can never ever get out of the clutches of basal low level  
vasanas.   
Saying none needs understanding, nothing to be done, no teaching - it will  
come in most unexpected place etc. is a sure recipe for failure and a total  
contradiction of what so many jnanis and scriptures struggled to convey.   
What you mention above as words cannot explain etc are the state of jnanis.  
Let us not fool ourselves thinking we are like them - and nothing needs to be  
understood, no action is needed, it will happen in unexpected place etc.   
I dont want to extend this as a debate - but I sincerely wish my point is  
taken in right sense. I again ernestly submit that it is better to read and  
re-read all our original scriptures with proper understanding before reading  
the many books written by foreigners and indians on what they understood as  
messages from jnanis like Ramana Bhagawan and Nisargadatta Maharaj. Why go  
anywhere else when you have the source right here and now saying crystal clear  
truth for infinite time (ever since Maya started her play)?   
Salutations to the Supreme with this concluding verse...   
As the blazing fire reduces wood into ashes, O Arjuna,   
 so does the fire of wisdom reduce all karmic bondage to ashes.

I have deleted this message, because seems it is liable to be misunderstood  
and fall into the category of neo advaitins.   
Enough we have many such stuff in net \-- Let me not add to it and confuse  
anybody else.   
That which cannot be conveyed in words should not be written.   
I quite agree with you.
