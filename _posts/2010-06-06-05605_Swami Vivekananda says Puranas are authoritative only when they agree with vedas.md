THE COMMON BASES OF HINDUISM   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora   
Let them talk of India's regeneration as they like. Let me tell you as one who  
has been working  at least trying to work  all his life, that there is no  
regeneration for India until you be spiritual. Not only so, but upon it  
depends the welfare of the whole world. **For I must tell you frankly that the  
very foundations of Western civilisation have been shaken to their base.**   
The mightiest buildings, if built upon the loose sand foundations of  
materialism, must come to grief one day, must totter to their destruction some  
day. The history of the world is our witness. Nation after nation has arisen  
and based its greatness upon materialism, declaring man was all matter. Ay, in  
Western language, a man gives up the ghost, but in our language a man gives up  
his body. **The Western man is a body first, and then he has a soul; with us a  
man is a soul and spirit, and he has a body. Therein lies a world of  
difference.**   
Do not be in a hurry, do not go out to imitate anybody else. This is another  
great lesson we have to remember; imitation is not civilisation. I may deck  
myself out in a Raja's dress, but will that make me a Raja? An ass in a lion's  
skin never makes a lion. Imitation, cowardly imitation, never makes for  
progress. It is verily the sign of awful degradation in a man. Ay, when a man  
has begun to hate himself, then the last blow has come.   
When a man has begun to be ashamed of his ancestors, the end has come. Here am  
I, one of the least of the Hindu race, yet proud of my race, proud of my  
ancestors. I am proud to call myself a Hindu, I am proud that I am one of your  
unworthy servants. I am proud that I am a countryman of yours, you the  
descendants of the sages, you the descendants of the most glorious Rishis the  
world ever saw. **Therefore have faith in yourselves, be proud of your  
ancestors, instead of being ashamed of them.** And do not imitate, do not  
imitate! Whenever you are under the thumb of others, you lose your own  
independence. If you are working, even in spiritual things, at the dictation  
of others, slowly you lose all faculty, even of thought. Bring out through  
your own exertions what you have, but do not imitate, yet take what is good  
from others.   
We have to learn from others. You put the seed in the ground, and give it  
plenty of earth, and air, and water to feed upon; when the seed grows into the  
plant and into a gigantic tree, does it become the earth, does it become the  
air, or does it become the water? It becomes the mighty plant, the mighty  
tree, after its own nature, having absorbed everything that was given to it.  
Let that be your position. **We have indeed many things to learn from others,  
yea, that man who refuses to learn is already dead.**   
Declares our Manu: -   
"Take the jewel of a woman for your wife, though she be of inferior descent.  
Learn supreme knowledge with service even from the man of low birth; and even  
from the Chandâla, learn by serving him the way to salvation." **Learn  
everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way  
absorb it; do not become others.Do not be dragged away out of this Indian  
life; do not for a moment think that it would be better for India if all the  
Indians dressed, ate, and behaved like another race.**   
Religion in India must be made as free and as easy of access as is God's air.

**THE RELIGION WE ARE BORN IN   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
Now let us consider what are the common grounds of agreement in the religion  
we are born in. At first sight we undeniably find various differences among  
our sects. Some are Advaitists, some are Vishishtâdvaitists, and others are  
Dvaitists. Some believe in Incarnations of God, some in image-worship, while  
others are upholders of the doctrine of the Formless. Then as to customs also,  
various differences are known to exist. The Jâts are not outcasted even if  
they marry among the Mohammedans and Christians.   
They can enter into any Hindu temple without hindrance. In many villages in  
the Punjab, one who does not eat swine will hardly be considered a Hindu. In  
Nepal, a Brâhmin can marry in the four Varnas; while in Bengal, a Brahmin  
cannot marry even among the subdivisions of his own caste. So on and so forth.  
**But in the midst of all these differences we note one point of unity among  
all Hindus, and it is this, that no Hindu eats beef.** In the same way, there  
is a great common ground of unity underlying the various forms and sects of  
our religion.   
Now as to the Vedas, the Hindus believe that they are not mere books composed  
by men in some remote age. They hold them to be an accumulated mass of endless  
divine wisdom, which is sometimes manifested and at other times remains  
unmanifested. Commentator Sâyanâchârya says somewhere in his works  "Who  
created the whole universe out of the knowledge of the Vedas". **No one has  
ever seen the composer of the Vedas, and it is impossible to imagine one.**  
The Rishis were only the discoverers of the Mantras or Eternal Laws; they  
merely came face to face with the Vedas, the infinite mine of knowledge, which  
has been there from time without beginning.   
I have no faith in the theories advanced by Western savants with regard to the  
Vedas. They are today fixing the antiquity of the Vedas at a certain period,  
and again tomorrow upsetting it and bringing it one thousand years forward,  
and so on. **However, about the Puranas, I have told you that they are  
authoritative only in so far as they agree with the Vedas, otherwise not.** In  
the Puranas we find many things which do not agree with the Vedas.   
As for instance, it is written in the Puranas that some one lived ten thousand  
years, another twenty thousand years, but in the Vedas we find:  "Man lives  
indeed a hundred years." Which are we to accept in this case? Certainly the  
Vedas. Notwithstanding statements like these, I do not depreciate the Puranas.  
They contain many beautiful and illuminating teachings and words of wisdom on  
Yoga, Bhakti, Jnâna, and Karma; those, of course, we should accept.   
Here I should ask you to remember that Hindus, from time immemorial, knew the  
Atman as separate from Manas, mind. But the Occidentals could never soar  
beyond the mind. **The West knows the universe to be full of happiness, and as  
such, it is to them a place where they can enjoy the most; but the East is  
born with the conviction that this Samsara, this ever-changing existence, is  
full of misery, and as such, it is nothing, nothing but unreal, not worth  
bartering the soul for its ephemeral joys and possessions.** For this very  
reason, the West is ever especially adroit in organised action, and so also  
the East is ever bold in search of the mysteries of the internal world.

Vedas are pramanas, the final authority for checking up the truth.   
They cannot be amended at all.   
The Puranas and other codes like that of Manu and others are   
like Indian constitution. They can be amended a thousand times.   
Arunachala Siva.
