**THE RELIGION WE ARE BORN IN   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
Now let us consider what are the common grounds of agreement in the religion  
we are born in. At first sight we undeniably find various differences among  
our sects. Some are Advaitists, some are Vishishtâdvaitists, and others are  
Dvaitists. Some believe in Incarnations of God, some in image-worship, while  
others are upholders of the doctrine of the Formless. Then as to customs also,  
various differences are known to exist. The Jâts are not outcasted even if  
they marry among the Mohammedans and Christians.   
They can enter into any Hindu temple without hindrance. In many villages in  
the Punjab, one who does not eat swine will hardly be considered a Hindu. In  
Nepal, a Brâhmin can marry in the four Varnas; while in Bengal, a Brahmin  
cannot marry even among the subdivisions of his own caste. So on and so forth.  
**But in the midst of all these differences we note one point of unity among  
all Hindus, and it is this, that no Hindu eats beef.** In the same way, there  
is a great common ground of unity underlying the various forms and sects of  
our religion.   
Now as to the Vedas, the Hindus believe that they are not mere books composed  
by men in some remote age. They hold them to be an accumulated mass of endless  
divine wisdom, which is sometimes manifested and at other times remains  
unmanifested. Commentator Sâyanâchârya says somewhere in his works  "Who  
created the whole universe out of the knowledge of the Vedas". **No one has  
ever seen the composer of the Vedas, and it is impossible to imagine one.**  
The Rishis were only the discoverers of the Mantras or Eternal Laws; they  
merely came face to face with the Vedas, the infinite mine of knowledge, which  
has been there from time without beginning.   
I have no faith in the theories advanced by Western savants with regard to the  
Vedas. They are today fixing the antiquity of the Vedas at a certain period,  
and again tomorrow upsetting it and bringing it one thousand years forward,  
and so on. **However, about the Puranas, I have told you that they are  
authoritative only in so far as they agree with the Vedas, otherwise not.** In  
the Puranas we find many things which do not agree with the Vedas.   
As for instance, it is written in the Puranas that some one lived ten thousand  
years, another twenty thousand years, but in the Vedas we find:  "Man lives  
indeed a hundred years." Which are we to accept in this case? Certainly the  
Vedas. Notwithstanding statements like these, I do not depreciate the Puranas.  
They contain many beautiful and illuminating teachings and words of wisdom on  
Yoga, Bhakti, Jnâna, and Karma; those, of course, we should accept.   
Here I should ask you to remember that Hindus, from time immemorial, knew the  
Atman as separate from Manas, mind. But the Occidentals could never soar  
beyond the mind. **The West knows the universe to be full of happiness, and as  
such, it is to them a place where they can enjoy the most; but the East is  
born with the conviction that this Samsara, this ever-changing existence, is  
full of misery, and as such, it is nothing, nothing but unreal, not worth  
bartering the soul for its ephemeral joys and possessions.** For this very  
reason, the West is ever especially adroit in organised action, and so also  
the East is ever bold in search of the mysteries of the internal world.

Vedas are pramanas, the final authority for checking up the truth.   
They cannot be amended at all.   
The Puranas and other codes like that of Manu and others are   
like Indian constitution. They can be amended a thousand times.   
Arunachala Siva.
