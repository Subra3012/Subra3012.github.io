## Kaupina Panchakam by Sankara  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 17, 2008, 01:36:32 PM  
---  
Kaupina Panchakam, Five Verses on Loin-cloth, is a small   
poem of Sankara, which aptly describes Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
A sample:-   
Witnessing the changes of the mind and body   
Naught but the Self within him beholding   
Heedless of outer, of inner, of middle,   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Chanting Brahman, the Word of redemption   
Meditating only on " I am Brahman"   
Living on alms and wandering freely   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Arunachala Siva.

In this Adi Shankara describes the state of advanced devotees who have  
surrendered to the ultimate reality and living with witnessing consciousness  
without the noise   
of the adjuncts.

The relation between self and the mind is like rope and the snake.   
While knowledge of rope is real,knowledge of snake imaginary.   
You cannot kill an imaginary snake because it never existed.   
If you focus light to look at the so called snake,   
 you will have the knowledge rope and knowledge of snake disappears.   
Similarly if you focus all the consciousness you have in your hand through   
self-enquiry all the imaginary objective knowledge of mind disappears   
and pure unadulterated adjunctless clear consciousness shines.

As I understand it, in a fully realized person the ego is killed but not the

its very enlightening to discuss lives of these saints and see the Scriptures

Dear Sankar and non duel, What I meant was that the life stories   
of saints can be read from books. After reading such books, the   
purport of the happenings in their lives can be discussed.   
Yesterday, srkuadi, wrote about Sri RK. Now, unless one   
knows about Sri RK and Saradhamani, Sri RK and Mathur Babu,   
or Sri RK and Bhairavi Brahamani, one cannot appreciate the   
the incidents and the purport of such incidents. Hence I   
suggested about reading the books containing the life histories   
of such books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs   
When I was going through this old mails, I came to know some meber want to  
write about saints life. Our India is punya boomi. It is the heart for the  
whole world to give jnana and spiritualism. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and  
from east to west we got plenty of saints who took avatar whenever it was  
needed.like samuvami uge uge. Among the saints, some spread bhakti margam like  
meera, some are pure advaitans, They roamed from village to village and they  
sang lots of folk songs, in their respectful languages. Some were sanskrit  
scholars their deciples recorded all in songs form.From south there are so  
many saints. as Subrahmaniyan ji told 63 nayanmar from saivam and 12 Alwars  
from vaishnavam. So we can discuss state by state. There are muslim babas, and  
sufis are also there. We are so fortunate to take birth in India.The tamil  
literature is called Deiva Thamizh. The literature itself contains lots of  
poems about the creator.There are so many siddas who wrote poems and did  
miracles lot still they live around Thruannamalai. Bhagavan also mentioned and  
saw them in His period. If you start this topic. This thread wil be  
everlasting flower in the spiritual garden. We get more chance to know many  
things

Dear Ramanaduli, Thanks for the post. The thread was started   
by Sankar asking for the life stories of saints. I told him that these   
stories can be read from suitable books. We can only discuss   
certain aspects of such stories. The srkudai, started about Sri   
Ramakrishna. I have no problem in narrating the strories. But   
these, as you have said, will be a long serial. Let us see what Bhagavan   
wills.

Dear srkudai, Non objective consciousness means only   
object-less consciousness. Bhagavan says, in Who am I?,   
'vichara' means where there is no object. Sri Sadhu Om,   
also says the same thing in the Path of Sri Ramana, a 4 volume   
book. However, for Jnani, who has realized the Self, the appearance   
disappearance of world and objects does not make any difference.   
It is he for whom, there is immateriality of the world and objects.   
When a photograph which was seen by Bhagavan and also the   
others in the Old Hall, was later misplaced and when everyone   
was searching for it, someone asked Bhagavan whether he has   
seen the photograph and has also seen its misplacement, Bhagavan   
said, that he does not know both!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, yes. Experience alone is there and there   
is no experiencer and experienced, the duality. Non objective   
experience is the experience of the Self and here the Experience   
is the Existence. To say, objects come and go is not correct, because,   
there is no object, "the drisyam" but only "the drik", the subject.

Dear Sankar and Raju, The selfrealized Jnanis can confer self   
realization to the advanced 'seekers' provided they are ready.   
The readiness implies,   
a. to understand that the world, the individual soul and personal   
god are imaginations.   
b. to abhor worldly pleasures and put up with worldly miseries.   
c. to totally trust in Guru's way and to lead a life as per Guru's words.   
d. to develop viveka and vairagya, discrimination and detachment.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 ultimately its "Just Be". Sri Ramana's essential teaching is Just Be. For someone who cannot do this, he suggested inquiry or sharanagathi both eventually lead to just be.   
As such, Bakthi leads to just be state as narada says by getting such  
love, one becomes stabdah, stilled! infact, one does not become stilled ; one  
recognizes that one is stillness itself. Coz if it is said that one is  
stilled, people will think that their mind has to be stilled. One has to just  
recognize that one is Stillness itself.

Also sir, i seldom use this idea that there should be no other coz if this

Dear Sankar,   
Quote  
we should not worry about what people will think about if we say this   
 When you are trying to convey a message, you should use the right words, and think twice before presenting. We need to make sure that the other person understands the message as it is. This is the reason why i am very careful to express. People have too many preconditioned ideas. The moment i use the word "God" \ people have already imagined Jesus,Rama or what ever. So to convey the vision i see, i have to use the right words, and use the right pointers. Anyone who sees the pointed object clearly sees the object and shares my vision.   
Yes sir, let us write abt some saints.

Dear Sankar, What srkudai wrote is correct. You are using   
many words without conveying direct meaning. You say   
that the self surrender in the dream will not last. I do not   
understand this. Then, you ask about stories on saints. Why   
don't you read books on Saints, yourself? There is Bhatka   
Vijayam, stories about devotees of Vittala. There is Periya   
Puranam, which speaks about 63 saints of Siva. You may   
read these books. Only books on advaita philosophy need   
explanation. Storeis can be read by anyone if he buys some   
of these books.

It is an experience of thought-free,nondual,adjunctless,nonobjective clear  
self-conscious being "I am"which annihilates our wrong knowledge prevailing   
from aeons and aeons that we are body bound mind with adjuncts.

Because you are witnessing the daily disturbance you are able to say that i am  
disturbed.   
You are different from the disturbance of the mind.   
The awareness,the witnessor is independent of your mental activity,hold on to  
it uninterruptedly.

Dear Sankar, all that you have listed out are only aids   
to realization and not realization itslef. In self-   
realization, there is no listing, no questioning no   
answering. Bhagavan answered questions of everyone   
because, He had abundant Grace towards all those

Dear Sankar, as Bhagavan has said: "Grace is always flowing."   
Grace only requires unflinching devotion to him, without let up.   
Devotion is the mother of jnana. But one caveat: To get Grace,   
in abundance, one should carry to Him a big vessel, like Ramanatha   
Brahmachari, Mastan, Echammal, Palaniswamy, Keerai Patti,   
Mudaliar Patti and Kunju Swami.   
Arunachala Siva.

Friends, i cannot say what it is   
but i can definitely say, its not an experience. An experience is merely  
something happening in the mind, its born and it dies   
no experience is special. any mental experience can be got by hypnotic  
suggestions.   
So Realization has to be something other than an experience. ... the  
Experiencer ! known with the mind, but once known all experiences turn out  
to be experiences of Truth !

To establish in a state of nonobjective self-consciouness is commonly called  
self-realisation.Because duality is not there question of mind does not   
arise.Only in object knowing consciousness mind appears to be there as an  
experiencer.

Experiencer is nothing but a collection of all past dead experiences in the  
form of memories.Experiencing is a living thing,when it is converted   
as an experience by the mind it is a dead thing which can be stored in the  
memory cells of the brain.When there is pure perception without   
the contamination of thought there is no experiencer.

No no sir! Discussing lives of Saints is not just reading from books   
its very enlightening to discuss lives of these saints and see the Scriptures  
revealed through them.   
I think we can discuss. They express scriptures through their lives. ill start  
a small discussion thread on Sri Ramakrishna paramahamsa shortly and if all of  
you are ready to participate, will show how such a discussion can be fruitful

Dear Sankar and non duel, What I meant was that the life stories   
of saints can be read from books. After reading such books, the   
purport of the happenings in their lives can be discussed.   
Yesterday, srkuadi, wrote about Sri RK. Now, unless one   
knows about Sri RK and Saradhamani, Sri RK and Mathur Babu,   
or Sri RK and Bhairavi Brahamani, one cannot appreciate the   
the incidents and the purport of such incidents. Hence I   
suggested about reading the books containing the life histories   
of such books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs   
When I was going through this old mails, I came to know some meber want to  
write about saints life. Our India is punya boomi. It is the heart for the  
whole world to give jnana and spiritualism. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and  
from east to west we got plenty of saints who took avatar whenever it was  
needed.like samuvami uge uge. Among the saints, some spread bhakti margam like  
meera, some are pure advaitans, They roamed from village to village and they  
sang lots of folk songs, in their respectful languages. Some were sanskrit  
scholars their deciples recorded all in songs form.From south there are so  
many saints. as Subrahmaniyan ji told 63 nayanmar from saivam and 12 Alwars  
from vaishnavam. So we can discuss state by state. There are muslim babas, and  
sufis are also there. We are so fortunate to take birth in India.The tamil  
literature is called Deiva Thamizh. The literature itself contains lots of  
poems about the creator.There are so many siddas who wrote poems and did  
miracles lot still they live around Thruannamalai. Bhagavan also mentioned and  
saw them in His period. If you start this topic. This thread wil be  
everlasting flower in the spiritual garden. We get more chance to know many  
things

Dear Ramanaduli, Thanks for the post. The thread was started   
by Sankar asking for the life stories of saints. I told him that these   
stories can be read from suitable books. We can only discuss   
certain aspects of such stories. The srkudai, started about Sri   
Ramakrishna. I have no problem in narrating the strories. But   
these, as you have said, will be a long serial. Let us see what Bhagavan   
wills.

Dear Sankar, yes genuine crying is one way to in our run-up to   
the Self realization. Bhagavan had chided mother Azhagamma, when   
she had asked Akhilandamma to procure greens from the Hill. Mother   
Azahagamma cried. Bhagavan said: Cry Cry, it is good for you.   
Likewise, when I read several incidents in Bhagavan's life, I have   
cried. He told Annamalai Swami, the kitchen worker, one early morning,   
to taste the chutney He has grinded. Annamalai Swami hesitated saying   
that he was not a brahmin (and non-brahmins should not take anything   
before brahmins had eaten!) and that he had not by then brushed his   
teeth. Bhagavan said: It does not matter, you may taste a little and   
tell he how it is. "Go for brushing the teeth afterwards. Do not tell   
anyone!" When Echammal brought her new born grandson, who had   
become destitute, since his parents had died, and shed tears, Bhagavan   
also cried irresistably! Bhagavan was like a mirror, refelecting the joys and  
sorrows of His devotees. If one could cry reading such incidents, it is   
a sure way to cleanse one's mind and ego.   
Arunachala Siva.

When Bhagavan's mother, Azhagamma cried, when Bhagavan   
chided her for asking greens from Akhilandamma, He did not   
cry. He made her to cry and understand the ignorance behind   
such pettty desires in life. Bhagavan cried when Echammal brought

It was not to indicate her ignorance. He reallly cried. Because   
a Brahma Jnani is like a mirror, and He will mirror the feelings   
of the person who is looking at a mirror! Saint Manikkavachagar   
said in Tiruvachakam, "Aanal, Azhudhal Unnaip Peralame!"

Thank you Sankar. We are thinking about the Hill from afar and it is   
the Power beyond words. Arunachala Mahatmiyam says that the   
Hill will confer liberation even to those, who think of It from afar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hello Subramanian.R, what a simple fact. Think of Arunachala from afar and the  
Hill will confer liberation.   
It goes hand in hand with the Arunachala webcam page for those of us afar.   
For a while I began to wonder what had happened to you when you stopped  
posting. Then I saw the message about the trouble with your P.C..   
I'm pleased you got it fixed.   
Your posts do bring life to the Forum.   
Regards.   
Paul.

My dear Paul, thank you for your observation that I bring life   
to the Forum. Only Bhagavan has give us this life for all of us,   
so that we are fortunate to meditate, write and exchange views   
on Him in the common Forum. I am also one of the persons who   
view the Arunahcala Hill through the webcam, at least twice a   
day. This is the way to contemplate on the Hill from afar and it   
is by His grace, we can merge in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

If we experience the self every day looks like a Guru Poornima.   
By installing web cam so that we can have a darshan of Arunachala at any time,  
arunachala-ramana.org is doing a great service to humanity.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Do you know the story of Abhirami Bhattar,   
who lived in Southern Tamil Nadu, in the temple of Abhirami,   
called Tirukkadaiyur? He was always in the bliss of the Mother   
and people thought he is a madcap. Sarfoji Mahraraja, who   
was the king of that area visited the temple, saw this madcap,   
and in order to tease him, asked, What day is today? The   
Bhattar answered: Today is the Full moon day. All including   
the King laughed, because that day was a New Moon day!   
The King said, "If you do not show me the moon this evening,   
I shall kill you." He arranged for a big trap made and placed   
the Bhattar on the trap. If the trap is severed, he would fall   
on the huge fire beneath. The Bhattar did not hesitate, sat on   
the trap and started singing 100 glorious songs on the Mother.   
When he came to the 81st song, the full moon appeared on   
the sky!   
Yest you are correct. It is a bliss of full moon for those   
who could dwell in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Thank you. The descendents of Sri   
Abhirami Bhattar are still living in Tiruchirappalli, a bigger   
town about 150 kms from Tirukkadaiyur. The Brahman is   
always praised as One brighter than 1000 Suns. And the   
Bliss is praised as One with brighter than 1000 Moons. This   
is seen in Tamil poetry of various saint-poets. Bhagavad Gita   
also says the same thing about Krishna, in Viswaroopa Darsana   
Yogam. When the first atom bomb was dropped on Nagasaki   
in Japan, Einstein said that light and heat was brighter than   
thousand suns. Incidentally, Einstein had a writing behind his   
table which said, " (After discovering the theory of relatiivity),   
I now know that God is there, but He is very subtle." He is   
also reported to have said once: " I only want to know God's   
thoughts, the rest in this universe are all mere details!"   
Arunachala Siva.
