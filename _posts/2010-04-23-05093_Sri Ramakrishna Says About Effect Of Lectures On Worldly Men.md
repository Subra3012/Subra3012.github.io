**Give thousands of lectures, you cannot do anything with worldly men. Can you  
drive a nail into a stone wall? The head will be broken without making any  
impression on the wall. Strike the back of an alligator with a sword, it will  
receive no impression.**   
 _A calf cannot stand on its legs all at once. It falls down, gets up, falls  
again, and then it learns to stand and run. You do not know who is a Bhakta  
(godly) and who is worldly; but that is not your fault. When a heavy storm  
blows, one cannot distinguish Tamarind from Mangotree. It is true, however,  
that no one can absolutely renounce all works without realizing God._   
The question is, how long should Sandhya (rituals) and other ceremonial works  
be practised? So long as the Holy Name of the Lord does not bring tears of  
love to the eyes and produce horripilation in the body.

Dear prasanth,   
Very nice.   
Saint Manikkavchagar says: I am falsity. My mind is falsity.   
But, can I not get you if I weep?   
 \- Tiruchadakam, Ananda Paravasam, in Tiruvachakam.   
Arunachala Siva.
