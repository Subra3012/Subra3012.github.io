## Entry of Bhagavan Ramana in one's life

A general survey of Bhagavan Ramana devotees reveals a common thing. To many  
devotees who did not know much about Ramana, He gained entry into their  
heart, when they were in deep trouble or undergoing bad patch of life. In  
fact, in my case also, when I had a long period of unemploymeme despite my  
qualifiactions and experience, in 1991-that was the time when HE seized me in  
his tiger's claw and Iam for ever under his grip.His saying that if you are  
not destined to work, you will not get work,however hard you may try; if you  
are destined to work, you can not escape from it -created a deep impression on  
me.   
Comments invited on this phenomenon of Ramanas's entry as an univited guest  
during darkdays and living with you for ever

Dear arcsekar,   
I fully agree with you. In good days, one does not think of God   
or Bhagavan Ramana. One comes to God or Guru, only when   
miseries and pains confound him. There are a few exceptions   
like Muruganar and Kavyakanta Ganapti Muni and David Godman,   
who seeks a Guru despite a comfortable living on hand. In my   
case, He became known to me in 1990s when I visited Tiruvannamalai first. It  
was a casual visit and then the local   
Ramana Maharshi Centre, in charge Sri Natarajan gave me some   
books during one of my visits to his house cum Ramana books   
sale centre in Bangalore. He really 'entered' my life in the year   
2000, when miseries and pains bogged over me. This time, it   
was intense. I came out of drug habit easily by putting faith in   
me. I started going to Tiruvannamalai again at least once in a   
year. The year 2007 marked the beginning of more than one visit   
to Asramam, every year. In the year 2008 I visited His Asramam   
three times and during the current year, three times so far.   
Many people come to know Him.   
A few people are called.   
Still fewer are chosen.   
I bow to Him, the Complete Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

My mother had placed an image of Bhagavan on her shrine. I found that any  
chance I had I would gaze at this photograph, I could not take my gaze from  
his as I just wanted - then I realised that I had found and recognised  
"living proof" beyond any of my doubts, of a self-realised person. Ten years  
of earnest practice and enquiry had led me to Bhagavan, or rather, when I was  
ready, Bhagavan let me know he was here (and everywhere ).   
Love to all   
PB
