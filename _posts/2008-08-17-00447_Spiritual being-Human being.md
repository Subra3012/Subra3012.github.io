Are we human beings trying to have a spiritual experience or spiritual beings  
undergoing a transient human experience?All thoughts are welcome.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and non duel, we are all living beings,   
trying to find an answer, for the question that never was!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel,   
 Your answer "neither"amounts to saying that we are nonbeings.Then who is writing these posts?   
 Kindly contemplate on the question again.

Dear subramanian,   
 The question is vital and there is an answer if we do self-enquiry sincerely.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju & non duel, Do not give out anger. The anger   
hits your Self. Bhagavan says in Who am I? "Whatever one gives   
to another, he is only giving to himself."   
1. To say that we are neither human beings nor spiritual beings   
is not correct, in my opinion. Underline, my opinion.   
2. Then to find out an answer, we may try this way:-   
 a)We are all human beings.   
 b)There is Spirit in us, the activtating force. Hence we are also   
 Spiritual.   
 c)Why then, we are not able to be Spiritual but only mind and   
 body beings?   
 d)Because we forget the Self, like a lady who forgets the necklace   
 around her neck and keep on searching. There is anger, worry   
 and fear in her. The restlessness starts and the 'search' begins.   
 e)Someone, like Bhagavan Ramana, a Guru, comes to us   
 and shows the necklace. Like the lady, who was all along   
 searching for the necklace "outside", we were searching   
 "outside" and then we come to know it is within us.   
 d)That is SELF REALIZATION.   
 c)Finally we find out that we are not mind-body beings but   
 only SPIRITUAL HUMAN BEINGS.   
Now I am starting one more round of discussions. Should we be   
only Human beings to become Spiritual Human Beings? Then,   
how about Cow Lakshmi, which got Mukti? How about Jadabharata?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 Probably my language shows that i am angry towards somebody.Today nonduel posted me an affectionate letter.There are no   
differences between me and other forum members.Anyway i will take care of my  
language.   
 Jada Bharata and cow lakshmi are advanced souls incarnated in an animal body.Many say cow lakshmi is aku kurala avva   
who took care of Bhagawan in his early days of stay at Arunachala  
hill.Bhagawan declared that cow Lakshmi attained liberation without   
his help because she is so pure without any tendencies in contrast to  
Bhagawan's mother who required help of Bhagawan for liberation.   
Many say the white peacock presented to Bhagawan by Baroda queen is none other  
than Madhava Swami who served Bhagawan   
for many years.I feel that all these beings deserve what they got because of  
purity of heart irrespective of which body they wear.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Excellent insights. Thank you. In Tamil   
books it is said that Cow Lakshmi was Echammal in its previous   
birth. The white peacock was Madhava Swami, as David Godman   
writes. There is one more incident mentioned in Arunachala Purana,   
that an advanced soul was born again as a bush of thorns, in the Hill,   
to clear the prarabdha, and it caught fire and disppeared, when   
some great Jnani trampled on it! There are also stories like this   
in Srimad Bhagavatam also. Like Gajendra, for example.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel, Cool answer. In the Self, which is the One   
without second, there is no spirit, no human, because to   
adjectify the Self, we are doing dis-service. The question   
was raised from Raju's point of view and the answer was   
given from non duel's point of view. But ultimately, there is   
neither Raju nor non duel. But you may appreciate the fact   
that all such questions are raised from the duality point of   
view and also all answers are given from the duality point of   
view. In the Self, where is the questioner and answerer?   
This is what Gaudapada Karika says, when it states: "There is no creation, no dissolution..." etc.,   
Anger was again inferred by me and you say that there was   
no anger. That is all.   
If there is no duality and all is the Self, then, as I said the Forum   
has to close the shutters, because all are the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel,   
 Are you a screen with pictures or are you a picture trying to find the screen.Do you deny existence of both?

Dear non duel and DRPVSSN Raju, For whom is this question?   
To me. Who am I?   
Who am I? is the Brahmastram of Bhagavan, the invincible   
weapon!!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju and non duel, the Spirit and the Human discussions   
of yesterday, made me to remember a French professor, about   
whom, my English professor quoted during my college days.   
This French professor did not know much English and he was   
conducting a class with English students. One day, a student   
was making fun in the class and he wanted to punish him.   
He suddenly forgot the phrase Get Out! and so he got out of   
the class, and from the corridor, he was shouting at the student: "Get in, Get in!". Simlarly a student who was asked to rephrase   
the follwing English sentence, with a negative, without changing   
the meaning: The Angels always like the Saints.   
The correct answer would be somewhat: The Angels did not ever   
dislike the Saints.   
Instead, the boy wrote: The Devils always hate the Saints!   
In retrospect, I feel that the entire discussions on Spiritual and   
Human beings are like this.   
Arunachala siva.

Dear Raju, Yesterday, in a post under this Topic, I referred   
to Cow Lakshmi as reincarnation of Echammal and this is   
not correct. Cow Lakshmi, as Bhagavan Himself has confirmed   
was a reincarnation of Keerai Patti (the Grandma of the greens).   
Again, as you have correctly said, Bhagavan was not with Cow   
Lakshmi, till her very end, becuase, unlike Mother Azhagamma,   
she did not have any gushing vasanas, towards the last few   
minutes or hours and so Bhagavan left her to merge in the Self,   
peacefully, without any last minute help.   
Arunachala Siva.
