rath-yatra.htm   
Thousands of pilgrims and faith leaders from all over the world participated  
in the London [ Images ] Rath-yatra, festival of chariots, on Sunday evening  
as the city was illuminated by wonderful colours and sounds of the annual Hare  
Krishna Festival.   
The devotees pulled three 40-foot high colourful chariots carrying the sacred  
deities of Lord Jagannatha, Lady Subhadra and Lord Balarama from Hyde Park to  
Trafalgar Square. The giant chariots were accompanied by a procession of  
singers, musicians and dancers. At Trafalgar Square, where the procession  
concluded, thousands of people had gathered to witness cultural and  
educational displays and exhibitions linked to the Rath-yatra.   
The festival of chariots is a celebration dating back to over 5000 years,  
annually observed in the ancient holy city of Jagannatha Puri in Orissa,  
making it the oldest street festival in the world.   
Devotees believe that if they get the honour of pulling the ropes of the giant  
chariot, carrying Lord Krishna, known as Jagannatha - Lord of the Universe,  
then, at the end of this life, they will be granted eternal service to the  
Lord in the spiritual world.   
"Each year, we aim to make the Festival of the Chariots a more vibrant and  
colourful festival for London. Now over forty years on, it's amazing to see  
yet another generation of Londoners enjoying the Ratha-Yatra celebration in  
our capital," said Titikshu Das, Coordinator of London Carnival of Chariots.   
This ancient festival was brought to western shores by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami,  
founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.   
The first Rath-yatra festival outside of India [ Images ] took place in San  
Francisco in 1967. This festival came to London in 1969, where it has been  
faithfully observed every year for over 40 years attracting more than 30,000  
people throughout the day.

Those who are serious about meditative enquiry may stop watching TV and see  
the effect on the mind after a couple of months.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear Silentgreen   
This is a great challenge to everyone in this forum. Has anyone practiced not  
watching the TV?   
When I learnt Yoga for some days, my teacher advised us not to watch TV for  
that period and watch the difference for ourselves. Though I watch TV very  
minimally for that period, I could still see its effects. It helped me be  
focussed with my sadhana. No obstacles could affect me.   
Let me try this out. Tomorrow I will try not to watch TV for the whole day.  
Just a small way to begin this Sadhana.   
Nagaraj

Like books, TV time has also been reduced by me drastically. I watch   
two half-an-hour programmes everyday in the evening. One programme is Periya  
Puranam, a discourse by Smt. Parimalam,   
in Sankara TV. Another is Where is Brahmin? in Jaya TV. No news,   
no dances, no serials, no cinemas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Cricket is a great menace that is afflicting Indian citizens. I am   
very happy about IPL shifting the Twenty-Twenty matches to   
South Africa. It would have been better if they had shifted it   
to Arctic Sea, where some penguins, pelicans and Eskimos might   
watch the matches.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes it is correct. There was one Sadhu in Arunachala, who was   
addicted to Ganja habit. It helped him in his meditation. Siva   
finally appeared before him. The Sadhu exclaimed: "O Annamalai!   
You have come! I am ready. Please wait a minute, I shall pick up   
my Ganja pocket and then proceed with You!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Then How harder it should be to give up our Ego?   
How much time it takes to break a habit formed in this birth?   
Then how much would it take to break habits of all our births put together.   
Always remember the 3Ps.   
Ah, beautiful point. It's almost demotivational sometimes to try and quit one  
thing when you realize that unless you quit the quitter you've quit nothing.  
And even then it's perhaps not something "you" do but rather something that  
happens to you when you see deeply enough the actual state of affairs.

Dear prasanth,   
Cricket got undue importance because of the money that is flowing   
in and out of the system. How many foot-ball matches are taking   
place right now. The World Cup is going on. But no one in India   
seems to talk about it at length. In fact 1/ 1/2 hrs of foot ball   
is much more a difficult task than a 1 day game of Cricket. Then,   
how about Hockey, which is our national sport? No one bothers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
As bhagavan ramana says people want to do things which get them more  
happiness.   
Maybe our indians get more happiness watching/playing cricket rather than any  
sport. :-)   
But as for me every sport is time waste to watch atleast it is better i feel  
to play for sometime so that we may get some sort of physical exercise.
