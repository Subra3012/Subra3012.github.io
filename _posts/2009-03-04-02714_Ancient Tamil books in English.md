## Birth, Death and Rebirth  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 04, 2009, 11:01:27 AM

What is Birth and Death? This question haunted me for a long time. Then one  
day I understood thus: What is called as Birth? We know what is birth by seeing a child being born,  
if a child is born, then we know it to be birth, we say a child is born.  
Similarly, we know what is death when we see some person die. We see a person  
lie flat as know im to be dead. We call this as death! Both the above points  
i.e. birth and death is known to us by seeing what is birth and by seeing what  
is dead. So we have only seen what is birth and what is death.   
Do 'I' or 'you' know what birth are death is? Do you remember your birth? How  
much so ever you try to recollect where from, when you were born, you cannot  
recollect your own birth! The truth is 'You' 'I' are birth less. You know your  
your birth day, time of your birth only by what others have told you, for  
example, your parents have recorded your birth date and so on, but do you  
really know your own birth? you have been believing that you were born on this  
date this time etc...   
The fact is, 'You' can never know your birth date at all by yourself, for you  
are actually birth less. Similarly, 'You' can never know your death at all  
because you can never know when you die? do you? So long what we know about  
death is only what we saw, but we have never experienced death or birth. The  
fact is you can never experience Death because you are Deathless.   
So now what is Rebirth?   
Is there a Rebirth? You are born every moment, and when every moment that  
passed by you died. to make it more simple, every new thought is   
your rebirth and every thought that just passed by is your past life. You are  
born and dead innumerable number of times - countless.   
This moment when you know this truth, now you can remember all your past  
life's. What you were and what you are now. What is called prarabdha is this.  
It because of your past actions you are now thus. You can recollect your past  
life. It is said Buddha recollected all his previous life's - It is this  
truth!   
The Vedas, Upanishads say, you have now been born as a human being after  
ountless births and you have this rare opportunity to be born as a human. What  
is its essence? Does it mean you were something else in your past life and  
all? Just think about this. Let me take an example of a Terrorist, Does he  
know he is a human being? He does not, He has all animal instinct in him, He  
kills, destroys and all etc.. later at some point in his life, he then  
realizes his folly, he realizes how he has been so long like an animal, now  
when he realizes this truth, that moment he is born as a Human Being. He was  
animal in his past life as a terrorist. Now when he realized his folly he  
became a human being. This is the Truth!   
I would like to illustrate this further with the srory of Jadabharatha.   
As the story goes just when all his austerities were going to give him their  
fruits i.e. when he was just about to attain liberation, One day while  
offering prayers to the Sun God on the river bank, he saw a lone and heavily  
pregnant doe coming to quench its thirst in the river. Hardly had it touched  
the water when the forest echoed with the roar of a lion. The doe became  
terror-stricken and it just leaped into the water without even quenching its  
thirst and tried to ford it in a bid to escape to the other side of the river.  
Shocked by fear and overcome by the effort to negotiate the current, the doe  
gave birth to a young deer midstream. Without even being aware of it, the doe  
reached the other bank where it died of exhaustion. The royal sage who saw it  
all, was moved by compassion at the sight of the motherless infant deer being  
carried away by the river. He picked the young deer, took it to his ashrama  
and fed it with tender grass and protected it from wild beasts. Soon he grew  
very fond of it. In course of time the sage became so attached to it that he  
could not part from it even for a short while. He feared all sorts of harms to  
his pet and prayed for their removal. He forgot that he was a sage and behaved  
like a foolish householder doting over his child. In the end he died with  
thoughts of the deer in his mind.   
The Vedic scriptures say that a man will be born in his next birth as that  
thing about which he was thinking most at the time of his death. So in this  
case, Jadabharatha thinking about the motherless deer, for the love for the  
deer, and hence he was born as a deer (He decided to be its caretaker, Mother  
deer), the essence is that he is not born again as a deer but in that love, he  
forgot himself and himself lost in the love of the deer became a (caretaker  
like a mother) deer to take care the motherless infant deer. He became a  
mother deer. Like How sometimes, young people are mesmarised on terror and  
become terrorist. Similarly, Jadabharatha became a deer. Then like the example  
being discussed how the terrorist realizes his folly and becomes human being,  
Jadabharatha realized - "regretted: "How foolish of me to have forgotten my  
tapas and become attached to an animal? And now I suffer for it, being born an  
animal. I shall not repeat the mistake." Saying this the deer left its mother  
and began living in the vicinity of a Rishi's ashrama spending all its time  
thinking of God. When death approached, the deer entered the water of a river  
and standing there, gave up its body. So the last thought at death was he  
realized his mistake and did not want to commit the same mistake (Note he dint  
die, his thought dies).   
In the next birth the deer was born as the son of a pious Brahmana. The past  
tapas and mistakes lingered in the child's mind and so he did not want to  
commit the same mistake. As a child Bharata in his third birth did not show  
any attachment to his family. He did not even speak. People therefore called  
him Jada or a dunce. Hence the name Jada Bharata.   
I have seen some people saying that they have wasted their life so far and  
they cannot do anything in this life and hope for the best in the next birth!  
The question is do they even have this birth like how they think? or is there  
another birth like they think? The truth is there is no "Next Birth" like how  
it sounds. Rebirth is now. Death is now. You dont die or take birth at all. So  
there is No Birth, no Rebirth, or Death at all as it is normally understood.  
The real essence of Birth, Rebirth and death is only your thoughts and not  
you.

In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Krishna said to Uddhava thus about death: The mind combined with 5 indriyas and tendencies derived from Karma which  
constitute the linga sharira (Subtle Body) transmigrates from one body to  
another. The Atman though different from the Linga Sharira, also seems to  
follow it because of the absolute superimposition between them.   
The mind of the dying man, swayed by his own actions and their impressions,  
thinks intensely on experiences he had in life, on what he had seen, heard and  
passed through. Consequently he feels that he has entered a new body that has  
manifested by its intense thought, and left the old one. With the coming of  
the consciousness of the new body, there is complete oblivion of the old body,  
its history in the world.   
On account of the intensity of attraction felt for the new body for whatever  
reason, the memory of the of one is completely effaced.   
Death means this complete forgetfulness of the old body and its affairs by the  
Jiva.   
The acceptance of the new body by the Jiva and his complete identification  
with it is called birth. How this happens is found in the examples of dreams  
and reveries. As in these states, the Jiva becomes completely oblivious of the  
old body and gets identified with the new one. The Identification is absolute  
that the Jiva forgets its pre-existence and comes to believe that he has come  
into being with a new body.   
When Jada Bharatha saw the infant deer without its mother, he became its  
caretaker by becoming its mother. then when he realized his mistake, he left  
the old body as a mother - caretaker and also the infant deer and was born  
again as a pios Brahmana and attained the lord.

Sri Bhashyam is a commentary of Brahma Sutras by Sri Ramanujacharya. Sutras or  
thread or Aphorism of Para Brahmam.   
The Vedas and Upanishads were neatly categorized by Badarayana or Vyasa or  
Krishnadvaipayana (He is known by these names) Before he categorized the Veda,  
upanishads etc... the great sages of the yore even before Vyasa, Vashishta,  
Vishwamitras. It was a time when there was no written record, teaching was  
only by listening to their Guru. these great sages transfered from generations  
to generations the sutras or Aphorisms of Brahma Gnana. They are very very  
abstract aphorisms and are the root of the entire Vedas themselves. Vedas  
themselves are birthless, Brahma Sutras are considered the roots of the Vedas.   
Greats like Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka and few others have written  
commentary on Brahma Sutras. It is so abstract that it is capable being  
interpreted in multiple ways. These commentaries were supported with evidences  
from Upanishads by Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva etc...   
The very fact that it is capable of being interpreted in multiple ways viz.  
Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, Dwaita proves that ultimate truth can be attained by  
any of the interpretations!   
Sri Ramanuja wrote a commentary on Sutras to as a proof(study) his system of  
doctrine Vishishtadvaita like Shankaras Advaita.   
proof or study here to find out what the Brahma Sutras say finally? do they  
really convey what the student has understood from the Vedanta!   
Shankara through his study of Vedas, understood Advaiata Bhava and through his  
study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras too conveyed the same  
doctrine of his Advaita   
Ramanuja through his study of Vedas, understood the Vishishtadvaita(Qualified  
Advaita) and through his study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras  
too conveyed the same doctrine of his Vishishtadvaita   
Similarly, Anandatheertha or Madhvacharya his doctrine Dvaita   
No study of Vedanta is complete without close examination of these Brahma  
Sutras. They are also called as Nyaya Prasthana or logical standing point of  
Vedanta.

Thanks Nagaraj for the post, but my question was   
Quote from: karthikeyan M on March 15, 2009, 03:12:36 PM  
SRK Math book on Sri Ramanuja, I read the book, but in some sections the book  
comes heavily against Siva. Have you read the book.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I have not yet read the book on Sri Ramakrishna published by RK Math. However  
I have read the story of Sri Ramanuja from different sources.   
Sri Ramanuja's reforms were rather too strong for his time. Admitting women  
and all castes in the maTams. He questioned the authority of Adi Sankara's  
maTams. There indeed was a lot of ideological opposition. Also he was not  
prepared to sign the declaration that "nothing is greater than Siva". The  
aazvaars accepted Siva, but accorded a higher status to Vishnu. Ramanuja  
considered naadhamuni, aaLavandhaar and the aazhvaars as his spiritual  
leaders.   
Even among the Vaishnavites, there are two groups, one follow Vedanta Desikan  
of 13th Century and others Sri Ramanuja.   
Since I have not read the book, to have a clear understanding, it would be  
great if you can share the exact text from the book on Sri Ramanuja so that we  
can investigate for our understanding   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M   
SRK Math as philosophy, approves only Advaita. But Sri Ramakrishna's  
religious tolerance is well known. He supported   
all religions and sects. Sri Ramakrishananda, who came to Madras   
and started the Madras Math, the second in the whole world, after   
Belur, wanted to know about Sri Ramanuja who is a Tamil scholar and  
visishtadvati. Hence, Sri Ramakrishananada, read Sri Ramanuja's books and  
wrote a biography on him. Sri Ramanuja's book naturally would consist ideas  
establishing Visishtadvata and also the Supremacy of Narayana. Sri  
Ramakrishnanada is faithful to Sri   
Ramanuja's philosophy while writing the biography. That is all.   
Srimad Bhagavatam, written by Sage Vyasa, speaks about the supremacy of  
Narayana. It says Narayana gave birth to Brahma and   
Brahma gave birth to ten sons, one of them is Siva. Sage Vyasa   
is neutral. That is why his Brahma Sutram, gives rise to interpretations by  
all the three great Saints. Sankara, Sri Ramanuja   
and Madhwa. Sri Ramanuja's Brahma Sutra Bhashyam, naturally interprets Brahma  
Sutram, as per qualified non dualism. Sage   
Vyasa's Skandam, extols the supremacy of Skanda. All devi slokas,   
and devi bhashyam extols the supremacy of Uma. This is not uncommon in Hindu  
philosophy. Abhirami Andati says She is one,   
and she became many. That sums up the whole thing. Sankara is   
par excellent, because he extolled Advaita, Non dual Brahman. But he also  
wrote numerous slokas on all the deities. You should read Sri   
Soundarya Lahari, of Sri Sankara. He says that Uma, Sri Lalita  
Tripurasundari, is the greatest, and all gods including Siva, remain as four  
legs of her sleeping cot and Siva her bed! Can you beat it?   
Arunachala Siva.

A little more to add from my previous post...   
Sri Vaishnavas understand the Vedas to teach that Sriman Narayana is the  
Supreme Brahman, and that meditation and surrender to him is the only means to  
moksha.   
The Tamil heritage of the Sri Vaishnavas also teaches them that Narayana alone  
is the supreme entity. With these as a background, the question of worshipping  
Siva as envisioned in temples and puraanas cannot even arise, since according  
to the Vaishnava tradition, Siva is not God as such.   
This is somewhat contrary to the smaarta view that both Vishnu and Siva are  
merely subjective and ultimately false conceptions of the formless,  
undifferentiated Absolute.   
According to me these differences arises form the doctrine stand point of  
view. Just like how Jesus is for Christians, Vishnu was to Vaishnavites, He is  
the only supreme God Vushnu is the only Brahman. Whereas from Shankaras stand  
point of view, Vishnu, Shiva are only representation or manifestation of the  
supreme reality or Bharman.

Thanks a lot,   
I have to admit, at the beginning I had little knowledge of siva and I was a  
devotee of Lord Vishnu. Until the age 22 or 23 for the first time I visited  
Arunachala, got introduce to Siva and importantly with Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi from there till now its no turning back (date: around 2004), honestly  
speaking it was Arunachala who made me to visit the Scared Chidambaram Temple.   
An interesting incident occur in my life i want to share with you people.   
We had our house shifted in 2007 August, while shifting there was a aluminum  
cast idol of Nataraja, while shifting I found this Idol and told my mother  
that let the idol be thrown or kept away in old house, my mother said it is  
siva and should be not thrown. Even at that moment I had no knowledge of  
''Dancer of the Cosmos, the Lord of the Universe', NATARAJA.   
Ok we moved to new house(rent), that same year December 2007 we visited Scared  
Chidambaram Temple, we went inside we were searching for main deity, we came  
across Lord Govinda, and asked for the main deity, an retired Professor made  
us to turn the otherside, suddenly all people lifted their hands up in  
salutation, and there was the Idol of Nataraja behind it was the Secret.   
But all i can say now is that I pray both Siva and Vishnu likewise giving more  
to Nataraja.   
\   
The quest for me was to understand our ancient Tamil works on Hinduism through  
books.   
But there seems to be many books.   
I'm a tamilian but being brought up in Bangalore, can speak tamil but cannot  
write or read it. Yes one day i will learn soon.   
Going by what Subramanian.R and Nagaraj post, it looks so complicated our  
Hinduism is. But for a common man hearing what Subramanian and Nagaraj words  
it is really difficult to understand and to accept which.   
More confusion has got into me.   
Siva Chidambaram

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I would say don't get too much into intellectual and complications in your  
efforts or sadhana. somehow I or we have landed here with so much study or  
readings. The reality is that there is no difference between you and me in  
spite of the complications and extra intellectual learning from my side.   
At the end of the day, if you are successful in tears dropping from your eyes  
out of devotion Bhakthi, nothing is equivalent to that. Just be as you are.  
Don't get caught in too much intellectualisation as well. Don't let yourself  
be confused. discard what is confusing as poison and keep going. Even mine or  
our posts. I would even go further saying don't even bother knowing further  
the doctrines of Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita and all. Just shower  
love.   
Swami Vivekananda has said: _It is a man-making religion that we want. It is man-making theories that  
we want. It is man-making education all round that we want. And here is the  
test of truth --anything that makes you weak physically, intellectually, and  
spiritually, reject as poison, there is no life in it, it cannot be true.  
Truth is strengthening. Truth is purity, truth is all knowledge; truth must  
be strengthening, must be enlightening, must be invigorating._**   
Keep it very simple, I have come to understand that love and loving others and  
above all **FORBEARANCE** is the ultimate realisation. thats what jnanis do.  
we should strive to relieve or help others of their pain, spread love. love is  
everything.   
Thirumular has said all that needs to be told in 2 simple beautiful words the  
sum of all knowledge of all Vedas and scriptures of all religions. Refer to a  
post on Auvaiyar's Aathichoodi simple teachings in this forum. they make best  
set of principles anyone needs to follow.   
 **Anbe Sivam** Love, indeed is the all pervading God!   
Truly there is nothing more to know at all even from Vedas or Upanisdhads or  
any other scriptures of the world.   
As the saying goes:  **PAROPARAKARYA PHALANTI VRIKSHAH - The trees bear fruits to serve  
others.   
PAROPAKARAYA VAHANTI NADYAH - The rivers flow to serve others   
PAROPAKARAYA DUHANTI GAVAH - Cows give milk to serve others.   
PAROPAKARTHAM IDAM SHAREERAM - This human body is meant to serve  
others.**   
We should never forget these in our life and even in our spiritual quests, we  
may tend to get lost in our search by forgetting our real purpose (above)   
Paropakaram is the beginning and the end of all knowledge and even Self  
Realisation.   
This body is not ours so it is only for Paropakaram

Thanks   
Going by the posts,   
Should I completely stop bothering about the books as Nagaraj quotes and go  
ahead with simply love to god.   
There arose a confusion in one of the posts, a post quoted Sankara stating  
Siva is one of the names of vishnu then the main thing what made the greats to  
divide gods, did it happen based on the rich and poor.   
But again if one comes across these great people it will certainly make them  
to know what they preached, why our Bhagavan Ramana himself has written many  
books, so if i come across Ashram book stall i will quite get one.   
My objective is to know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita in simple  
terms, please

To know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadvaita is to know your Self. So  
why not find out your Self first and then you will know what is Advaita,  
Dwaita or Visishtadvaita. Bhagawan Ramana says first find out who is it that  
wants to know what is Advaita, Dwaita or Visishtadvaita.   
Who is the enquirer?

**Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita, Advaita**   
In short,   
Dvaita --> Devotee feels God is separate and worships God as a master.   
Vishishtadvaita --> Devotee feels God is whole and he is part of God.   
Advaita --> Devotee merges in God completely and no separateness remains.   
Here is a puranic story which shows that all the three ways of connecting to  
God can exist in the same devotee: Once Ramachandra, God-incarnate, said to his great devotee Hanuman,   
 _My son, tell Me in what relation you regard Me, and how you meditate upon  
Me._   
Hanuman replied:  _O Rama, at times I worship Thee as Purna, the undivided one.   
Then I look upon myself as an Amsa, a part, a fragment as it were, of  
Divinity.   
At other times I meditate upon Thee, O Rama, as my Divine Master and think of  
myself only as Thy servant.   
When however, I am blessed, O Rama, with Tattva Jnana, or true Knowledge, I  
realise that I am Thou and Thou art I._   
Om Shanti. .

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
There is no need for confusion. Bhagavan Ramana has used one   
simile. There are toffees. Some are green, some are yellow, some   
are red. Each child likes one particular colour and shape even though  
sweetness is same in all. And that is the simile which you should keep in  
mind, while praying to your god, your ishta devata. All are one. The only  
other thing is: You should not dislike or hate the other toffees, because  
some other child likes it! Do not hate other gods.   
You pray to your chosen deity and then do meditation and self enquiry. All  
gods merge in the Self within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
The English prose rendering of Periya Puranam published by Sri   
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, is by one Rangachari. The original   
sources are Tiru Thondar Thohai by Sundaramoorthy, which lists all the 60 (the  
remaining three being Sundarmoorthy himself and his   
mother and father). This is part of his own composition which comes   
under Book VII of Saiva Canons. A slightly more elaborate Tamil composition  
is Tiruthondar Tiruvandati, by Nambi Andar Nambi, which comes in Book XI of  
Saiva Canons. A good prose version in Tamil is by   
Kripananda Variayar titled Sivan Arut Selvar. I go by original   
Tamil verses of Periya Puranam, by Sekkizhar, which is Book XII of   
Saiva Canons. This is a composition of about 4500 delightful verses.   
The English version of Rangachari and Tamil version of Kripananda   
Variyar would serve the purpose. The Tamil book is published by   
Vanadhi Padippagam, T Nagar, Chennai 600 017.   
Arunachala Siva.
