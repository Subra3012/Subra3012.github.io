Incredibly, Sri Ramana's experience was unmotivated. He recalled: 'I knew  
nothing of life and had no idea   
that it was full of sorrow; and I had no desire to avoid rebirth or seek  
release, to obtain detachment or   
liberation. (ibid. p.12) True, His awakening was set in motion by a 'sudden  
fear of death', but it should   
be noted that this fear appeared suddenly, spontaneously. The boy was not  
consciously seeking to avoid   
death or seek a solution to life's problems. From that moment on Sri Ramana  
remained perpetually,   
continuously absorbed in that force.   
Bhagavan Ramana's life and teachings were an incredible confirmation of both  
the Upanishadic teachings   
as well as the teachings of Advaita Vedanta. However, in an interesting twist  
in this instance, Sri Ramana's   
teachings are primary revelation of Advaita are a confirmation of His  
awakening because they are found to be   
in accord with His teachings! It is a wonderful phenomenon that the words of  
Lord Ramana, in numerous   
instances, are virtually the exact words in the Upanishads, in the teachings  
of the Sages, and a host of others.   
What is remarkable is that Lord Ramana had no knowledge of the ancient  
teachings before His Self Realization   
and only came to learn of them many years after.
