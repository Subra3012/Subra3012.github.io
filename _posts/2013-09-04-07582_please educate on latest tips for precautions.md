Dear Graham and all others,   
Please educate about latest set of precautions to be taken both by male and  
female devotees while going up the hills or going in inner path.   
Even for males, is there any danger from the so called beggars in the hill  
path? they seem to be in young age with pants and ask for alms, if they look  
around and no body else to be found, will they start threatening?   
What are the precautions to be taken to tackle stray dogs that suddenly bark  
and monkeys that scare?   
I have seen at one instance, a young guy saw a group of foreigners climbing  
virupaksha cave. I was behind them some feets away climbing. This guy  
thought I did not know tamil and told something not very parliamentary in  
tamil language. I looked at him casually and then resumed my steps. This  
happened on Dec 25th 2012 being a christmas day thank God foreigners and  
Indians were found in large numbers. Otherwise I dont think it is safer to  
roam around the hills alone even for males

 **Parable of the "elephant God"**   
"Let me tell you a story. In a forest there lived a holy man who had many  
disciples. One day he taught them to see God in all beings and, knowing this,  
to bow low before them all. A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for  
the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he heard an outcry: 'Get out of the way! A mad  
elephant is coming!' All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels.  
He reasoned that the elephant was also God in another form. Then why should he  
run away from it? He stood still, bowed before the animal, and began to sing  
its praises. The mahut of the elephant was shouting: 'Run away! Run away!' But  
the disciple didn't move. The animal seized him with its trunk, cast him to  
one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay unconscious  
on the ground. Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother  
disciples came to him and carried him to the hermitage. With the help of some  
medicine he soon regained consciousness. Someone asked him, 'You knew the  
elephant was coming - why didn't you leave the place?' 'But', he said, 'our  
teacher has told us that God Himself has taken all these forms, of animals as  
well as men. Therefore, thinking it was only the elephant God that was coming,  
I didn't run away.' At this the teacher said: 'Yes, my child, it is true that  
the elephant God was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to stay there.  
Since all are manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the mahut's words?  
You should have heeded the words of the mahut God.' (Laughter)   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna
