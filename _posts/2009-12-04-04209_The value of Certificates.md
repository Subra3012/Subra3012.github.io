## The value of Certificates  
Author: Graham              Date: December 04, 2009, 04:33:43 PM  
---  
A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Sir,   
People today want to read Bhagavan Ramana through u-tube   
videos and merge with e-Self! Even Self realization has been   
made electronic and computer savvy!   
Arunachala Siva.

That's right. Here are their Web-pages (in Russian) with the classification of  
gurus amd masters according to their system: http://congress.advayta.org/assotsiatsiya-masterov/klassifikatsiya.html   
and their a system of exams after wich one can receive a certificate  
confirming his (her) status and authirity: http://congress.advayta.org/assotsiatsiya-masterov/sistemyi-attestatsiy.html   
it would be funny if it had not been so fraud   
These are the same people (in fact a kind of totalitarian cult) who organized  
so called "International Advaita Congress" in Moskow

The iniciator and main organizer of all this circus so called Swami Vishnu Dev

Good PR, isn't it?

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

Sir,   
People today want to read Bhagavan Ramana through u-tube   
videos and merge with e-Self! Even Self realization has been   
made electronic and computer savvy!   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Sir,   
People today want to read Bhagavan Ramana through u-tube   
videos and merge with e-Self! Even Self realization has been

gurus amd masters according to their system: http://congress.advayta.org/assotsiatsiya-masterov/klassifikatsiya.html   
and their a system of exams after wich one can receive a certificate

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

Sir,   
People today want to read Bhagavan Ramana through u-tube   
videos and merge with e-Self! Even Self realization has been   
made electronic and computer savvy!

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

Dear I,   
That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs  
of devotees who have laid such respects and belief on a Guru who seems  
dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!   
But yes, Sanathana Dharma has passed toughest test of times over centuries  
after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on  
saints - just meant that such a venerated (position) (state) of highest  
Sanyasa order such as 'Paramahamsa' is played with.   
Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like  
Abdul Kalam is respect worthy. When such respect worthy seat is used for  
filthy games, it is, what to say, just feel not nice about it!   
Sad part is that masses, only know a fake after such incidents. Untill then,  
such a person is venerated as a "Jagad Guru"   
Off course, there is actually no mud splash on saints, it is not to be taken  
literally!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs  
of devotees who have laid such respects and belief on a Guru who seems  
dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!   
But yes, Sanathana Dharma has passed toughest test of times over centuries  
after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on  
saints - just meant that such a venerated (position) (state) of highest  
Sanyasa order such as 'Paramahamsa' is played with.   
Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like  
Abdul Kalam is respect worthy. When such respect worthy seat is used for  
filthy games, it is, what to say, just feel not nice about it!   
Sad part is that masses, only know a fake after such incidents. Untill then,  
such a person is venerated as a "Jagad Guru"   
Off course, there is actually no mud splash on saints, it is not to be taken  
literally!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Dear Soham3, you can advise that guy who made certificates to add this point

Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs

dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!   
But yes, Sanathana Dharma has passed toughest test of times over centuries  
after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on  
saints - just meant that such a venerated (position) (state) of highest  
Sanyasa order such as 'Paramahamsa' is played with.   
Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like  
Abdul Kalam is respect worthy. When such respect worthy seat is used for  
filthy games, it is, what to say, just feel not nice about it!   
Sad part is that masses, only know a fake after such incidents. Untill then,  
such a person is venerated as a "Jagad Guru"   
Off course, there is actually no mud splash on saints, it is not to be taken  
literally!

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false

after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on

Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Dear Soham3, you can advise that guy who made certificates to add this point

Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Dear Soham3, you can advise that guy who made certificates to add this point

Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

Dear I,   
That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs  
of devotees who have laid such respects and belief on a Guru who seems  
dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!

More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Quote  
It is said that Adi Sankara slept with ladies. Ramana was above sex.  
Dear Soham3, you can advise that guy who made certificates to add this point  
to his system.   
Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the  
question 'who compares?'

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

Don't know about its truth, but such news are hurting the sentiments of  
people. It is a mud splash on the glorious lives of saints.  
Don't know about this swami in particular and whether he spoke strongly  
against sex which has now come back to haunt him. This is the inevitable  
ending for those who emphasize the body in spiritual matters by saying 'do  
this and don't do that'.   
How can a fake person (if he is fake) or TV channels splash mud on saints?  
The real saints only stand out more in contrast to these events.

Dear I,   
That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs  
of devotees who have laid such respects and belief on a Guru who seems  
dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!   
But yes, Sanathana Dharma has passed toughest test of times over centuries  
after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on  
saints - just meant that such a venerated (position) (state) of highest  
Sanyasa order such as 'Paramahamsa' is played with.   
Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like  
Abdul Kalam is respect worthy. When such respect worthy seat is used for

Dear grhluna,   
False teachers are created by followers which is why there are so many of  
them. After an expose, they may wander around for a while but many will find a  
replacment guru who they think is not false. Even now many who are not  
followers of this particular swami may think how their own guru is genuine.  
The urge to follow something external is one of the most difficult urges to

N's case is shocking because he has amassed crores of rupees as wealth and had   
about 2 million followers! In case his fakeness is proved, how many misguided   
persons would be there, left in lurch. What is more intriguing, is : Why

he run away? He should have sought police protection for his life and then

have   
faced the suffering instead of running away. Sri Sankara says in  
Vivekachoodamani,   
wealth, wife or lover, and son are the three attachments, a true Jnani should  
abhor.   
He had the first two, the third one might have also been there? One

Dear friends,   
N's case is shocking because he has amassed crores of rupees as wealth and had   
about 2 million followers! In case his fakeness is proved, how many misguided   
persons would be there, left in lurch. What is more intriguing, is : Why  
should   
he run away? He should have sought police protection for his life and then   
explained the facts with computer and graphic experts at his side? He must  
have   
faced the suffering instead of running away. Sri Sankara says in  
Vivekachoodamani,   
wealth, wife or lover, and son are the three attachments, a true Jnani should  
abhor.   
He had the first two, the third one might have also been there? One  
Premananda   
caught about 10 years back, said that he had a dozen children, illegitimate!   
The Tamil channel has identified the woman too. Her name is one R... a cine   
actress!   
Arunachala Siva.

I've learned after 20 plus years of investigation that saints are very, very  
rare. I believe that Bhagavan was a true light in the last century and that  
among those living now I am only aware of Swamy Lakshami and Mathru Sri  
Sarada. I now of many people who have spiritual experiences but I am no longer  
really interested in them.   
In America our preachers usually go to college and get a degree in Divinity at  
either the master's or graduate level. They learn the history of the church or  
religion and the rituals etc. but it is just another job. Bhagavan had a  
calling - it came to him. Very rare and beautiful.

This guy tours in my country sometimes.   
According to my mother who believes in him, he just stands there, looking upon  
the people.   
I think this is the cleverer version of this woman 'Amritanandamayi' who is

Hi Jyoti,   
I think this reference to woman 'Amritanandamayi' is unwarranted here and I  
don't understand why you suddenly pulled Her into comparison with another  
person.   
I am not here to promote anybody but before criticizing somebody first set the  
facts right -- have you read through Ammachi's life of devotion? Have you  
attended any of her bhajans? Have you taken part in atleast some portion of  
the tireless and non stop humanity service that She is doing? I dont think  
just for money and foreign tours, one will bother to sit 15 hours at a  
stretch for hugging, attends and visits lot of places all over the world  
without the least fatigue, continue in the dress of a holy saint and above all  
, that all smiling face always. I dont think one will undertake all this  
pains just for a livelihood.   
We should always learn good from others, not criticize like this. In  
Amritananday mayi's case it is melting devotion and bhajan.   
I dont think Maharishi will approve this sort of ciriticisms of other saints  
in indirect manner.   
Once someone brought her friend who was following another Guru and started  
comparing that Guru and Maharishee. Maharishi got very angry and replied  
"what rights you have to criticize other Guru? what qualifications you have  
to measure great Mahatmas?"   
The answer is universal for all times.

A Russian friend came to Tiruvannamalai last week and told me about an  
Advaitic organisation in Russia which is offering Certificates in guruship,  
graded according to how many followers you get and of course passing exams.   
One of these certified gurus came to Tiruvannamalai last year with five of his  
followers and visited other gurus here, but declared all of them fake because  
none of them recognised him as a jnani. Upon his return to Russia, he prepared  
some mushrooms for himself, his family and followers -- all of them died.   
I am also reminded of a group here in Tiruvannamalai, who several years ago  
were offering certificates of self-realisation.   
Now there is the phenomena of silent satsang by telephone and silent satsang  
via skype.   
This is the kind of insanity that has hijacked and corrupted Advaita today.   
Misplaced faith is a dangerous thing.

That's right. Here are their Web-pages (in Russian) with the classification of  
gurus amd masters according to their system: http://congress.advayta.org/assotsiatsiya-masterov/klassifikatsiya.html   
and their a system of exams after wich one can receive a certificate  
confirming his (her) status and authirity: http://congress.advayta.org/assotsiatsiya-masterov/sistemyi-attestatsiy.html   
it would be funny if it had not been so fraud   
These are the same people (in fact a kind of totalitarian cult) who organized  
so called "International Advaita Congress" in Moskow

Well, the Russians are puny pikers -- my countrymen in the US of A can out  
guru, out holy spirit and out "plastic jesus" them any day of the week ten  
times over.   
The bottom line, though, is that (excuse me) crap doesn't stick to the truth.   
As soon as a new way is seen to make money out some aspect of "Godbiz",  
hustlers will soon gather for the feast.   
But heck, all they can take is people's money (well, their time also, which is  
worth more than money!). But the truth remains. Those who are turned off  
completely on seeking truth would likely never had sought for it in a serious  
way. The others will have had their appetite whetted for true knowledge -- so,  
even hustlers probably do some "good" although I'd hesitate to say that it is  
to their credit.

Dear soham3,   
It was a humorous comment from me.   
The criteria of the advaitic attestation system is such that the proponent of  
the advaita (Adi Sankaracharya) himself gets excluded.   
I do not want to comment on Adi Sankaracharya's spiritual stature or compare  
him with anyone.   
It is more of personal opinion of individuals.   
However the Self which the saints point to is beyond any comparison.

Dear grhluna,   
False teachers are created by followers which is why there are so many of  
them. After an expose, they may wander around for a while but many will find a  
replacment guru who they think is not false. Even now many who are not  
followers of this particular swami may think how their own guru is genuine.  
The urge to follow something external is one of the most difficult urges to  
deal with.

Dear friends,   
N's case is shocking because he has amassed crores of rupees as wealth and had   
about 2 million followers! In case his fakeness is proved, how many misguided   
persons would be there, left in lurch. What is more intriguing, is : Why  
should   
he run away? He should have sought police protection for his life and then   
explained the facts with computer and graphic experts at his side? He must  
have   
faced the suffering instead of running away. Sri Sankara says in  
Vivekachoodamani,   
wealth, wife or lover, and son are the three attachments, a true Jnani should  
abhor.   
He had the first two, the third one might have also been there? One  
Premananda   
caught about 10 years back, said that he had a dozen children, illegitimate!   
The Tamil channel has identified the woman too. Her name is one R... a cine   
actress!
