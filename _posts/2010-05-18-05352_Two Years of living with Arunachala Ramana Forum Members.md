## Two Years of living with Arunachala Ramana Forum Members  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 18, 2010, 07:03:31 AM

Today, I am completing two years with Sri Arunachala Ramana   
Forum Members. These two years are the best years of my living   
with Bhagavan Ramana and His close devotees from Canada to   
Singapore. I am extremely happy about this association. Many   
members are in touch with me, outside the Forum, through their   
e mails for exchanging their views about the various aspects of   
Bhagavan Ramana's teachings and also their progress in Sadhana.   
These two years also gave me a renewed vigour to visit Sri Ramansramam, at  
least once in a quarter, sometimes more frequently. I could visit Bhagavan  
Ramana's Asramam, and enjoy   
His Presence and absorb His mighty grace, at least 9 times. It   
is all Bhagavan Ramana's Will. Only when He calls, I can go to   
Him, and this has been made possible by His abundant grace.   
This Forum membership also gave me opportunity to read Bhagavan Ramana's  
teachings and also various biographies and notes of the   
devotees and His complete history in 8 volumes, again and again.   
I bow to Him the best among the bipeds.   
Who is representing the essence of Sri Sankara's philosophy,   
Whose grace I am living with, and   
With whose grace I should merge with Him.   
Sri Ramanarpanamastu.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Your posts are very useful. You cover not only Raman's teaching but also other  
spirtual books. It is a pleasure to read and learn lot from one forum. Keep it  
up. I pray Bhagavan to give you long life to serve for Him and His devotees.  
He has selected you to write (ELZHUDUM PANI) like UZHAVARA PANI.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Thank you. You are again back after some break. Hope your   
eyes are okay after the surgery. Time permitting, keep chanting,   
Verse 15 of Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: Kannukku kannai....   
You are the sight within the eye and without eyes, You see.   
Who can see You but Yourself, O Arunachala!   
OR   
You are the all-seeing Witness, seeing all sights and seen by   
none. Who can see You? It is for You to see me and give me   
your abundant grace.

Yes. After nearly two months I could able to connect with this forum. During  
all these days everyday I was in kurushetra. There was a fight in between the  
ego and vichara marga. At the end I told myself everything is scene   
like a movie. This forum helps to be convinced like puting fence and watering  
to a new plant, It is so bad that I forgot my password and created a new one  
yesterday. Anyway even I forget His grace pulls me back.

Yes. After nearly two months I could able to connect with this forum. During  
all these days everyday I was in kurushetra. There was a fight in between the  
ego and vichara marga. At the end I told myself everything is scene   
like a movie. This forum helps to be convinced like puting fence and watering  
to a new plant, It is so bad that I forgot my password and created a new one  
yesterday. Anyway even I forget His grace pulls me back.
