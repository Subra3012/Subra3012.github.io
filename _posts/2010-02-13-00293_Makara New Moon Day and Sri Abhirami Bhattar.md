## Makara New Moon Day and Sri Abhirami Bhattar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 13, 2010, 12:27:19 PM

On one Makara New Moon Day, the Goddess Abhirami in Tirukadaiyur,   
near Mayiladuthurai, in Thanjavur District, caused a miracle for the   
sake of her devotee/temple-priest. The priest's real name is not   
known but he is called Sri Abhirami Bhattar only. This day is celebrated  
every year on the Makara New Moon Day in the temple.   
This year, since Makara New Moon Day had a solar eclipse, the   
festival has been postponed to today, the Kumbha New Moon Day.   
During Sri Bhattar's time when he was the temple priest in Goddess Abhirami  
Temple, Serfoji Maharaja was ruling that place from   
Thanjavur as his capital. Serfoji Maharaja's date is said to be   
1720 AD and 1750 AD. He was the descendent of Maharashtrian   
King, Sivaji.   
Sri Bhattar was practising Siva-raja-yoga and was meditating on   
Goddess Abhirami in his Sahasrara. He soon developed fits of   
ecstasy and bliss and this became almost permanent with him.   
Due to this, the temple pujas and abulations and adornments got   
dislocated or were not properly done. Knowing his high state   
of bliss, some priests assisted him in the work, with due respect   
to Sri Bhattar. But some others were jealous of him and they   
wanted to go and inform King Serfoji. Accordingly, Serfoji was   
informed of this priests 'misdeeds'. They added colour to the scandal telling  
that Sri Bhattar has been in the habit of taking   
liquor and prattling something always and he is not really a   
man of great respect. King Serfoji said: I am coming to Poompuhar ( a sea  
coast near Mayiladuthruai) for this Makara New Moon Day for sea-bath and  
praying to the goddess. At that time, I shall verify the disputes.   
On the morning of New Moon Day, the King went to the sea, had his   
bath and came to the temple with his close associates. Sri   
Bhattar was sitting near a pillar, in a state of ecstasy visioning   
the form of Abhirami, in all her glory. While the priests told the   
king that he was so and so, the King came near him. Sri Bhattar did not even  
stand up and do namaskarams. The king grew angry   
and asked Sri Bhattar: What day is today? Sri Bhattar simply   
said as per his vision of Light of Goddess: Today is Full Moon Day!   
The king said: Alright, you have to show me the full moon this evening. I  
shall see it myself. He ordered the army men to make a tall pillar with 100  
pots tied in a row in a rope and on top of it,   
Sri Bhattar was made to stand. The King said: There is still   
4 Nazhigai time (96 minutes) for the full moon to appear, if it is so. We  
shall arrange to cut one pot every minute. If the moon does not appear, the  
last pot will also be snapped and you have to fall on the huge fire pit and  
die with burns.   
Accordingly, it was arranged. Sri Bhattar knew that his only support is  
Goddess and no one else. He was not afraid. He started singing the famous  
Sri Abhirami Andati (100 songs) in all devotion with tearful eyes. He first  
prayed to KaLLa VaraNa PiLLaiyar, the Ganesa who came as an elephant.  
(Details of this story later....). He was singing melodious heart-melting  
songs on the Mother. The pots were snapped one by one. As he came to the  
song no. 72, the full moon appeared in all its glory. How? The Mother  
appeared on the horizon first and she threw her ear stud (thadangam) on the  
sky and it became a bright full moon.   
I am praying to you to vanquish my deficiency.   
If I take birth again, it is your deficiency and not mine.   
In the large sky, like the thin lightning glowing is your slender   
 waist.   
To make good the deficiency, I pray to you, the bright lotus,   
 on the head of my Lord Siva. (Song No. 72).   
The king and others became dumbfounded and speechless, as they saw the bright  
full moon, on that new moon evening.   
Sri Bhattar was immediately released and the king prostrated to him and  
ordered for huge sums to be given to him (for his livelihood) and relieved of  
the routine temple duties, to pursue his raja yoga sadhana.   
*   
This Sri Abhirami Andati (it is mukta pada sadakam, with the last   
word of the previous work is used as a starting word of the next   
verse. Like Sri Arunachala Padigam of Bhagavan Ramana.   
He also composed two other poems titled Sri Abhirami Ammai Padigam and Sri  
Tirukadaiyur Padigam, each with 10 verses.   
All these are chanted on Fridays in the houses in Tamil Nadu.   
*   
Incidentally, Tirukadaiyur is the place, where Siva kicked Yama to go away to  
enable Sage Markandeya, live for ever, without ageing   
beyond 16 years.   
Even today, elderly couples on their 60th birthday, go to this   
temple, to offer special prayers and pujas for healthy life.   
The temple town has grown in recent times, with boarding and   
lodging facilities. The temple can be reached by car or state-run bus   
from Mayiladuthurai. The distance is about 20 KMs.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Bhagavan is also shiva who kicked yama with the atma jnanam and showed us how  
to live ageless. Shiva did this thruvilaiyadal in thrukkadavur whereas   
Bhagavan did in Thruvannamalai. KALANAI JANATHAL UDHAITHAVAR.

Dear ramanaduli,   
I am happy you have written about this. This made me to see   
whether Bhagavan Ramana has written anything about Markandeya   
who conquered death in Tiru Kadaiyur. Yes. He has written! In   
Sri Ramana Puranam, (which was written by Muruganar but the last   
three hundred or so lines were completed by Bhagavan Himself),   
Bhagavan says in Line 493-500:-   
By meditating upon the twin feet   
of "the Lord who knows what is written"**,   
he who destroys and reduces to nothing   
the burdent of fate, written upon the heads   
of the most excellent of his devotees,   
the brahmachari Markandeay overcame,   
through the intensity of his love   
for the one who ordained his destiny   
the fate that decreed   
that he should die   
as it had been ordained   
You are the exultation of those fierce warriors (of Jnana)   
who, through a love like that of Markandeya,   
exert themselves unrelentingly,   
through the supreme strength of grace,   
free of forgetfulness in the heart   
so that they triumph over fate   
and are no longer tormented by it.   
(** "The Lord who knows what is written" refers to Siva.   
It is He who writes the destiny on our heads and also knows   
fully about it. In Tamil, one of Siva's names is Ezhuttharium   
Peruman, who knows 'the letters', i.e letters of destiny written   
on our heads! In Tiruvottiyur, Siva is called Ezhuttharium Peruman.   
It is here, when Ganapati Muni was having unbearable pain on   
his skull, due to mantra-siddhi, Bhagavan Ramana went skyward   
to go that Ganapati temple, and pressed His palm on Muni's   
head to quell the burning pain.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the information of Thruvottiyur shiva. My friends and me went there  
after karthigai. From the next day onwards the Mulavar Adipureeswar will be  
kept without   
silver kavacham and being offered only punugu. That time I had darshan of  
Ezhuthariyum peruman but the archagar did not tell any thing about this  
importance.   
If we have a good luck we may come across a good informative pujari who would  
tell the importance of the murthi and sthalam. Most of the places they are  
keen on the dakshina. Anyway once again I thank you for this information. This  
is the reason we indians do namaskarams to God so that our destiny could be  
wipped out by   
lord. Brahma is writing our destiny according to our karmas but it can be  
wipped out by doing namaskarams to Shiva. Even Lord nataraja also shows His  
feet by pointing through His left hand means if we come to His feet His right  
hand will bless us. That is saranagathi.   
Ramanaduli
