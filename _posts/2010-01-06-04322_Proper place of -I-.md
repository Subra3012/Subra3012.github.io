## Tiruppavai - 20  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 04, 2010, 05:40:56 AM  
---  
Today is the 20th day of Margazhi (Dhanur) month and it is the   
practice to sing the 20th song of Tiruppavai of AndaL.   
With this song, the reference to Nappinnai is over.   
O the Ocean of Mercy who rush swiftly to the 33 crores of gods,   
to remove their miseries. (1 crore = 10 million), please wake up.   
O the One with great valour to protect the devotees, to remove   
their miseries and the One who is justice and power embodied,   
please wake up. O the beautiful Nappinnai please wake up. Please   
send your husband with gifts of hand-fan and mirror to us and make   
us quickly complete the bath in the river.   
The handfan, mirror, kumkum, turmeric etc., are the gifts given to   
womenfolk by the rich kings and chieftains. For menfolk, sandal   
paste, betel leaves and nuts are usually given as gifts.   
The mirror is called ThattoLi in this song. Those were the days,   
when mirror with glass of chromium plating was not invented. Hence, a thattu,  
large polished silver plate is given, with which one can see oneself for  
combing, dressing up, applying kumkum etc., ThattoLi means the light from the  
silver plate!   
Compared to this the 20th song of Tiruvembavai of Saint Manikkavahchagar has  
more of imagery. 20th song is the last   
song of Tiruvembavai.   
O Salutations to your primordial lotus feet, which confers bliss.   
O Salutations to your creeper like feet, which is the goal for all.   
O Salutations to your golden feet, from where all living beings   
 sprout.   
O Salutations to your flower like feet, which is the enjoyment of   
 all living beings.   
O Salutations to your two feet, which are the final destination   
 for all living beings.   
O Salutations to your lotus feet which are not fathomed by Brahma   
 and Vishnu.   
Salutations to your golden feet, which rule over the living beings,   
 for liberation.   
Salutations to You, let us go for Margazhi bath, O my girl.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 19  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 04:47:21 AM  
---  
Today is the 19th day of Dhanur month, Margazhi and the 19th   
song of Tiruppavai of AndaL is sung in many homes.   
The songs 18,19 and 20 describe Nappinnai, one of Krishna's wives.   
I have given some details about Nappinnai under song 18.   
The song 19 reads: With stump-lamps burning around the room, and on a cot with   
four legs made of tusks of elephants, O Krishna you are still   
sleeping, keeping your broad chest (with flower garlands), on   
the breasts of Nappinnai. Will you not open your mouth and   
say a word? O Nappinnai, with beautiful eyes having lines of   
mascara, will you not wake your husband, in spite of the delay?   
You are not able to leave him even for a second. Is this act,   
adding to your glory? No.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 21  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 05, 2010, 01:20:59 PM  
---  
Today, the 21st day of Margazhi, Dhanur month, the 21st song   
of Tiruppavai by AndaL is sung.   
This is a simple direct song, speaking about the cows in Gokulam,   
the locality of cowherds.   
O son of Nandagopa, in whose sheds the cows give out milk in   
abundance, to fill the vessels and overflow. Please wake up.   
O the valorous, the Lord of our clan, full of brilliance, please wake   
up. Like your enemies come to your house falling on the ground   
(after accepting their defeat), we too are falling at your feet, singing   
Long Live Krishna, Long Live Krishna!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 4  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 04, 2010, 09:27:51 AM

The Verse 88 of Sivananda Lahari is also a pictursque description.   
Yadha kruthambonidhi setu bandana :  Karasthalaatha krutha parvathadhipa   
Bhavani te langitha padmasambava:  Thatdha sivarcha stava bhavana kshama   
O Siva, I am not like Sri Rama who built a bridge across the ocean   
 (to cross over to Lanka after a Siva Puja in Rameswaram.)   
I am not like Sage Agasthya, who could suppress Vindhya mountains   
 with his palms.*   
Nor am I more capable than Brahma**, who was born from the lotus   
 belly bottom of Narayana.   
How can I ever become fit to do Archana, Stotram and Dhyanam?   
(* During Siva-Parvati's marriage at Himalayas, since it was felt   
that the earth south of Vindhyas, would go up due to the weight   
accruing at Himalayas, because of the visits of 33 crores of gods   
and angels, Siva asked Sage Agasthya to go to south of Vindhyas   
to compensate the weight. The Sage, on his way to south, pressed the Vindhya  
mountains with his palms and made it almost flat.   
He then went to the Podigai mountains (near today's Tirunelveli   
town and did penance. He could see the complete details of   
Siva-Parvati wedding in his vision.   
Brahma's capability was not enough to do puja at Siva's head   
(Arunachala Mahatmayam), hence Sankara says that he should   
be more capable than Brahma.)   
Arunachala Siva.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 10:04:45 AM

In the Verse 87 of Sivanananda Lahari, Sri Sankara uses the same   
items viz., clothes, food, and ornaments in a different pageant.   
This verse is also quite beautiful in treating the subject.   
Ashanam garlam panee kalapo   
Vasanam charma cha vaahanam mahoskha   
mama dhasyasi kim kimasthi sambho   
tava padambuja bhakti meva dehi   
O Sambu! Your food is poison. Your ornament is serpents.   
Your dress is animals' skins. Your vehicle is the big Bull.   
What have you got to give me? What great things have you   
got? Please give me only the total devotion to your lotus feet!   
Muruganar says in Padamalai: Your Paadam is Padam. Your   
feet are the Source into which my mind should become quiescent.   
Kalidasa says in Kumara sambhavam: O Pinkapani!* You have   
nothing but you can give all the treasures that one wants. You   
are the Lord of the three worlds, but choose to live in snow capped   
mountains of Himachal. You are the embodiment of all welfare.   
But none can fathom your true state of Consciouness.   
Saint Manikkavachagar uses a different thematic picture: O Sankara! You have given You to me.   
And have taken this poor me to You.   
Who is wiser among the two?   
I got limitless bliss from you,   
What have you got from me?   
O the One who resides in my Heart as your temple,   
O Lord of Tiruperundurai!   
You have taken my body as Your Abode   
What recompense can I pay?   
 \- Kovil Tirupadigam, Decad on Koil (Chidambaram)   
(* Pinakam means in Sanskrit, both serpent and the Mount Meru.   
Siva holds the serpent as the arc of the bow and the Mount Meru   
as the bow and Narayana as the arrow for destroying Tripura.   
But none of these were used. He simply smiled at Tripura and   
it got burnt. Tripura, the three cities, mean mind, intellect and   
ego or mind, body and the worlds.)   
Arunachala Siva.

## Proper place of "I"  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 06, 2010, 02:37:59 PM

The proper place of "I" is the lotus feet of God.   
In all other places it will dance to its own tune.   
In the lotus feet of God it will dance to the divine tune.   
Hari Om.

Dear I,   
What you have said is exactly what Sri Vaishnavites call "Prapatti". Complete  
surrender, Sharanagati, being aware of the I's limitedness. Humbleness is  
effortless. a Sense of giving up.   
Krishna Says in Gita - 18 Chapter, 66 verse: Sarva Dharman Parityajya Maaekam Sharanam Vraja   
Sham Tvaaam Sarva Paapebhyo Mokshayisyaami Ma Sukah   
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver  
you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
