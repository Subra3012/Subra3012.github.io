Once when we went for girivalam we saw some people were standing near by a  
small temple on the way. We asked them   
what is this. They told us this is a idukku pillaiyar koil. If you enter and  
come through it, you would not have   
any more births. Immedietly my friend also tried and came out of other side.  
She also asked me. At first my mind started questioning lot. At end, having  
fear within me whether I could make it or not, I tried and came out.   
I took it as a fun. Because it is not a correct way to become mukthi. I  
wonder, Bhagavan showed us everything.   
But how these practices are being done by the people there.

Idukku Pillaiyar Kovil is a small structure, almost near the   
Eastern side of the giri valam route. There are cavtities on both   
sides and one has to enter on a lying posture and move and come out of the  
front cavity. There is no Pillaiyar or Ganesa inside. It is   
only a structure. People who are not very lien cannot enter and   
come out. My wife who is of a lean frame makes it everytime.   
Even my drivers have gone and come out. I have not ventured   
it since I am somewhat fat. It is only an exercise to try your   
efforts and perseverance. Mukti, I do not know. Bhagavan   
Ramana has not mentioned about it in His conversations. But   
people do it as a ritual in perseverance. It is of course nice, to   
watch my wife going and in coming out!   
Arunachala Siva.
