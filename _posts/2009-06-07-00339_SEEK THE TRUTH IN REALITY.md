## Siva Manasa Puja of a different kind - 6

Starting from Sri Sankara, we have been seeing how different   
saints and sages had performed Siva Puja. They did not do   
anything formally, but in various different ways and Siva   
was pleased.   
Karaikal Amma was a devout wife of a rich merchant, who   
was purchasing and selling precious gems and stones. His   
wife Punitavati was a lady devoted equally to Siva and her   
husband. One day, before lunch, her husband Danavaniga   
had sent two mangoes through a servant to leave them at   
home, which he would eat during lunch. Punitavati was   
preparing the lunch and it was not yet ready. Meantime   
Siva appeared as an old brahmin and asked for bhiksha.   
She had no food ready, and so she gave the brahmin one   
of the two mangoes. The brahmin thanked her and left.   
During lunch Danavaniga asked for mango. She served one.   
It was delicious and so her husband asked for the second.   
Where can she go for the mango? She could have told the   
truth but destiny played its role. She went into the kitchen   
and prayed intently to Siva and a mango appeared on her   
palm! She became happy and served it. Tasting the mango,   
her husband said: How come this mango is many times more   
delicious than the first one? It is heavenly. Punitavati could   
not hide the matter beyond that. She told him the truth. Dananiga could not  
believe her words. He also became curious   
and wanted to 'test' Siva. He asked for a second one to be given by Siva.  
This lady was in great dilemma? What can she do now?   
Her immense faith came to her rescue. She got another one   
on her palm when she prayed again! Danavaniga took that   
third mango and was about to bite. The mango disappeared   
from his hand! Siva answered Punitavati's prayers but did not   
want the fruits of her faith to be tested and tasted by her doubting husband.  
The husband became horripilated and left   
the house in great awe. Punitavati waited for his return for   
long only to hear the news that that chap had married another   
woman and settled down in Nagapattinam, near Karaikal.   
The lady felt that it is her job to pray to Siva and visit places   
instead of wasting any more time at home. She wanted Siva   
to give her an invisible form of a devil so that no outsider could   
see her and spread scandals. The prayer was answered. She   
visited various temples to her heart's content. She went to   
Kailas and asked Siva to show his cosmic dance. Siva told   
her to go to Tiru Alangadu [near Chennai]. She went their   
and witnessed His Cosmic Dance and at the end she merged   
with Him in His Effulgence.   
Out of the 63 Saints of Siva, in temples, she is the only   
who is sitting majestically! All the other saints including   
Mangayarkarasi and Sundaramoorthy's mother are standing   
in the row but the Karaikal Amma, Mother of Karaikal is   
sitting majestically. She is Karaikal Amma, because Siva   
Himself addressed her as Mother.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
It is very nice to read about Karikal ammaiyar. I want to add some more lines  
here. She asked siva to have darshan of His dance and He danced   
and she sang for His dance. This event took in the place of THRUVALAGADU. I  
think this is the rathna sabha. She asked the boon that she should   
always hear His CHALLAGAI OLI. So she sits very close to His feet which was  
raised. Sometimes people add so many things when they give upannasam.   
I have not have the original periya puranam. I want to know whether this story  
goes like above said. Your comment is highly appreciated.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
You are correct in a way. Periya Puranam does not give   
more details about the dance she witnessed at Tiru Alangadu,   
which is of course, the Ratna Sabha, the Court Hall of Ruby.   
But Karaikal Amma has sung a few songs which find place   
in Book XI of 12 Books of Saiva Canon. There she says   
in one decad titled Tiru Alangadu Mootha Tirupathigam,   
the Elder Decad of Tiru Alangadu, that she is hearing the   
sound of Siva's anklets, she is seeing His third eye, she   
is seeing the serpants on his body, the Ganga roaring on   
his matted locks, the crescent moon, which is afraid of the   
serpents, the laughing skulls of many a crore of Brahmas   
on his shoulder and on his palm. These are all mystic visions.   
People with faith believe them, that is all. Saiva Siddhantam   
says that after every 100 Brahmas die, one Vishnu dies. Like   
that several crores of Brahmas and several lakhs of Vishnus   
have met with death. But Siva is beginningless and endless.   
Manikkavachagar also says this in Tiruvachakam. Sri Sankara   
says in Sri Soundarya Lahari: "When Brahma, Indra and Vishnu and all devas  
close their eyes one by one and die, You {Lalita}   
are playing with Siva in the garden of Kailas!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you very much for the clarification. We say Thennadudaiya sivane potri.  
Ennatavarkkum erraiva potri. Why Siva likes the south very much. He did   
64 leelas. In North people know about Ram leela and krishna leela and devi  
also to some extent. But here in south, Lord has done lots of leelas, gave  
darshan   
Tamil literature says Siva and Murgan liked tamil songs to be sung by their  
devotees. To listen tamil songs, He plays some drama in this world. Siva wrote  
wrong tamil song for Dharumi to get golden coins from Pandian king. I want to  
know why Siva played so many plays in south only. As because Madurai Meenakshi  
wanted Him to come down to Madurai from kailas. He became the Mappilai of  
Tamil Nadu. So He got authority to play,   
Anyway Periya puranam is wonderful epic. which moved Bhagavan. People here  
say, they love Tamil but they do not believe God. But Tamil is based on God  
only. Tamil and God cannot be separated. It is my view.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Siva's Abode is Kailas. Arunachala is Siva-swarupa.   
Siva did a lot of holy sports in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Kings   
were all Saivites, excepting for some trespassing into   
Jainism by Pandyas. Tamil = Sivam = Love. Meenakshi   
was Madurai princess and she married Siva. Kamakshi   
is Lalita Tripura Sundari and she came to Kanchipuram to   
do penance and then married Siva, once again after her   
sin of going to Daksha's yajna for which Siva was not   
called. Not satisfied with marriage, she wanted half   
the body of Siva which was conferred in Arunachala.   
That is why Siva is ArdhaNari. There are five temples for   
Siva representing five elements of nature. Since Rama   
and Krishna were born in Ayodhya and Gokula, they   
are more popular there. Siva belongs to the entire universe.   
Muruga is of course, an original Tamil God. Muruga worship   
is very rare in North India.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, What is it that mind does? It produces the thoughts,   
limitless thoughts. If you cease to think, that is, when thoughts   
are annihilated, the mind is killed. Arunachala Siva.

The relation between self and the mind is like rope and the snake.   
While knowledge of rope is real,knowledge of snake imaginary.   
You cannot kill an imaginary snake because it never existed.   
If you focus light to look at the so called snake,   
 you will have the knowledge rope and knowledge of snake disappears.   
Similarly if you focus all the consciousness you have in your hand through   
self-enquiry all the imaginary objective knowledge of mind disappears   
and pure unadulterated adjunctless clear consciousness shines.

Dear all   
Can mind be killed?   
As I understand it, in a fully realized person the ego is killed but not the  
function of ego, Which includes the mind and the body thought.

Dear everyone, thoughtless state is the mindless state.   
The dead mind produces no thoughts and at that point

Dear Sankar, Bhagavan says in Who am I? Atma-swrupa is the one   
and only Reality. Everything is imagination! This world, the jiva i.e   
the individual, and God are all imaginations! But it is very difficult to   
shake off the world, ego (the individual mind) and god. Many of   
us are still doing worship of god in some form or other, be it Siva,   
be it Rama or Krishna or Devi. I told you in the other posts, there are   
several steps given as aids to self realization, in Who am I? Each one   
is difficult. But Bhagavan says in the case of god-worship, do not   
shake it off forcibly. Even a dislike to continue the god-worship in the   
home-altar, is a desire! These things will drop off when the appropriate   
time comes.   
Arunachala Siva.

The drop in the ocean is never separate from the ocean even when drop thinks  
that it is separate from ocean.   
All spiritual practices are aimed at removing the false notion that you are  
separate from your ocean of self.   
There is no need to unite drop and the ocean, because in the first place they  
are never separate and cannot be separated.   
The notion that drop is separate from the ocean is just imaginary and all  
disciplines which aim at uniting the   
drop with the ocean are also imaginary.   
You are a wave in the ocean and the wave is never separate from the ocean even  
though it has a name and form unlike the sea.   
Waves appear and disappear in the ocean only,there is no need to unite the  
wave to the sea.   
All that is required is to nullify the false notion that wave is separate from  
the sea which is not possible because it is   
because of the sea wave has it's existence.

Dear DPRSSN Raju, Nice reply. There is no seeking of   
Truth or Reality, because it is within. All that we have   
to do is to remove the enucmbrances. The room's space   
does not grow, it is the same. We only remove the   
encumbrances, to see that there is space!   
Arunchala Siva.
