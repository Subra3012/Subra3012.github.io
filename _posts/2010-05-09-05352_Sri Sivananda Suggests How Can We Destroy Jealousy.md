There are three ways to destroy jealousy.   
**One is by thinking - "The whole world, with all its enjoyments, wealth and  
luxury is illusory. What do I possibly gain by being jealous of another?"  
**When anyone thinks seriously about this, several times a day, the vrtti  
(thought or feeling) of jealousy slowly dies. This vrtti of jealousy is deep-  
rooted. It is the root of all miseries.   
 **The second way is to have the feeling of universal brotherhood.** You are  
not jealous of your intimate friend or loving brother - because you have  
become one with them, and so you feel that all that belongs to them is yours.  
Do this with everybody. Love everybody as your own brother or friend. Then you  
will have no jealousy.   
 **The third way to destroy jealousy is a developed stage. Just repeat the  
formula, "I am the all" \- "I am the all-in-all". Think that there is nothing  
but Atman, your own Self, everywhere. Jealousy will slowly vanish.** You will  
experience infinite joy.   
 **Man sees his own reflection in all people but foolishly imagines that they  
are different from him and he fights with them. He fights on account of  
feelings of jealousy and hatred.**   
Spiritual discernment is what is most needed. Where there is duality, by  
virtue of ignorance, one sees all things as distinct from the Self, the Atman.  
**When everything is seen as the Self, then there is not even an atom other  
than Self. Duality is the root of misery.**   
Realise non-dual consciousness and you will attain bliss everlasting.   
Your attitude to the universe should be the same as your attitude to yourself.  
Man is a member of a great fraternity. Woman is the counterpart of man.  
Without self-control the new world order can have no lasting strength of  
character. **He who is pure and self-controlled is always peaceful. His life  
is always successful.**

there is no need to destroy jealousy. truth includes all. jealousy is a  
story the mind tells and if it is investigated it will be shown to be nothing  
. simply turn and face the jealousy and let it in all the way, experience it  
fully and be jealous 100% with no chance of ever being not jealous. what a  
great relief there will be in an instant to not have to fight it anymore as  
truth is revealed.

Dear Beloved Abstract,   
The point is it is the mind which tells one not to be jealous sometimes. It  
is the mind which tells one not to be lustful   
sometimes. It is th mind which tells one not to do something   
or other but still does something at other times!   
There is a story about the famous Telugu philosopher-saint   
called Pothana. Pothana was by nature coveting women and sex   
from his youth. He felt guilty and wanted to avoid it. But he   
could not succeed. Then, he decided to become lustful and   
to go to bed with women at will and at all times. After sometime,   
he developed a natural aversion to sex and left it completely.   
It is like the mud and clay sticking on your bare feet, while walking on a  
rainy day. Do not try to wash it off. Continue walking. As the bright sun  
appears after the rains, the clay becomes dry and falls off on its own!   
Arunachala Siva.

This is an outcome of comparisons that we continuously make and become  
unhappy.   
Being aware of the same and its negative impact to ourself is a simple way to  
address the thoughts of Jealousy.   
Nama Sivvaya
