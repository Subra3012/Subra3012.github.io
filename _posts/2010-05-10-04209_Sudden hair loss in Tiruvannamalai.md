## Sudden hair loss in Tiruvannamalai  
Author: Graham              Date: May 10, 2010, 02:50:55 AM

A strange thing has been happening over the past few months to many people  
here in Tiruvannamalai (and elsewhere I am told) - Indians and Foreigners,  
young and old, male and female alike, including myself.   
We are all losing large amounts of hair from our heads and only our heads. The  
hair is coming out roots and all.   
I am sure that many people will put it down to the cellphone towers, which  
according to one person who measured the output, is either 1600 or 16,000  
times the WHO safe limit (she wasn't sure which number was correct, but it was  
at least 1600).   
Others say it is the salt in the water, shampoo, etc. Whatever the cause, it  
is a source of concern for many.   
I would recommend that all foreigners bring a hat of some sort here, as the  
sun can be very damaging to the scalp.

Dear Graham,   
I am surprised at your post. I stayed for three days in T'malai   
for Bhagavan's Aradhana function, 10th to 12th to be precise.   
The sweating was tremendous. Particularly during power cut hours,   
inside the Guest house. Sweat was pouring like rains. The Asramam was the  
only safe haven, since they had round the clock power support.   
Every time, I combed my hair with a lot of water splashed on the head, copious  
hairs had fallen. This was my experience in three days!   
I think it is more to do with the hot climate, (I think it should be 40 deg.  
C. plus, where everyone sweat.   
Perhaps the cell phone towers may also be true. But these may   
not cause immediate damage, I believe.   
I live in Bangalore, where also it is hot but not sweating.   
Arunachala Siva.

In olden days, all munis rishis and sadhus all had lots of hair. I used to  
wonder without any oil, shampoo they were having shiny dark hair. But some of  
them had shaven like our Bhagavan. All siddhas have lots of hair who lives in  
thruvanamalai. I think they used to do lots of pranayamas and know how to keep  
their body cool during summer.   
Some siddhas say this body is mithya and they never used to give important. On  
the other hand Thrumoolar gives lots of important because with the help of  
body only we can attain atma shashatkaram. UDAL VALARTHEN UYUR VALARTHEN. In  
many poems they say this body is MEI. i.e. truth.

The reason for the post is to provide a cautionary warning to Western visitors  
who might not be fully aware of the problems that can arise in extreme  
climate. I will certainly wear a hat from now on.   
My friend Karthik in Chennai, who also suffers from the problem, says it is an  
annual thing due to the heat/humidity combination and a lack of protein. He  
might be right. My hair appears to have started slowly regenerating since  
returning to the UK two weeks ago.   
This year the average afternoon temperature from early April onwards was 43,  
during the night it fell to 30 for a few hours.   
Last year the temperature over the same period was 3-4 degrees lower.

Scientifically, Hair loss is also attributed to high tension as well, tension  
also includes too much dabbling of thoughts intellectually. Spiritual  
analytical thinking is also no exclusion to this as well!
