Dear sir   
If The waking state, sleeping state and dream state all are unreal, then we  
are not leading a real life. The real means   
when we erase the ego completely and live in the bliss. Is it? Some saints  
say, O God I do not want liberation instead I would like to be your slave in  
this world only. Then which is the best life. Leading the normal life with  
fixed on self,   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Real life is beyond the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep.   
This is called Turiya, or the Fourth. Bhagavan has said: There is no   
Turiya. There is only one state."   
Regarding some devotees asking God to permit them live in this   
world or in Vaikunta, or in Kailasa, is a dualistic concept.   
Ramanuja and Madhva preferred this state as per their schools.   
It is like wanting to eat a sugar candy. Sankara said, "I would   
like to become a sugar candy myself."   
Arunachala Siva.
