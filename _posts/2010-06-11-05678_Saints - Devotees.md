**IV (Selections from the Math Diary)   
Volume 5,Questions and Answers  
**Q.Is the division of time into four Yugas astronomical or arbitrary  
calculation?   
A.There is no mention of such divisions in the Vedas. They are arbitrary  
assumptions of Paurânika times.   
Q.What should be our highest ideal of character?   
A.Renunciation.**   
Q.Brahman and Maya cannot be cognised simultaneously. How could the absolute  
reality of either be proved as arising out of the one or the other?   
A.It could be proved only by realisation. **When one realises Brahman, for  
him Maya exists no longer, just as once the identity of the rope is found out,  
the illusion of the serpent comes no more.**   
Q.What is Maya?   
A.There is only one thing, call it by any namematter, or spirit. It is  
difficult or rather impossible to think the one independent of the other. This  
is Maya, or ignorance.   
Q.What is the proof of the self in us not being the product of the body etc.?   
 **A.The "ego" like its correlative "non-ego", is the product of the body,  
mind etc. The only proof of the existence of the real Self is realisation.**

**VII GURU, AVATARA, YOGA, JAPA, SEVA   
Volume 5,Questions and Answers  
Q.Is not Yoga an easy path to that?   
A.(Jokingly) You have said well, I see!Yoga an easy path! **If your mind be  
not pure and you try to follow Yoga, you will perhaps attain some supernatural  
power, but that will be a hindrance. Therefore purity of mind is the first  
thing necessary.**   
Q.How can this be attained?   
A.By good work. Good work is of two kinds, positive and negative. "Do not  
steal"that is a negative mandate, and "Do good to others"is a positive one.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Few Swami Vivekananda Selected Sayings and Utterances  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 10, 2010, 10:12:37 AM  
---  
SAYINGS AND UTTERANCES   
Volume 5, Sayings and Utterances   
1\. Man is born to conquer nature and not to follow it.   
2\. When you think you are a body, you are apart from the universe; when you  
think; you are a soul, you are a spark from the great Eternal Fire; when you  
think you are the Âtman (Self), you are All.   
4\. Strength is in goodness, in purity.   
6\. You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.   
 **15\. To believe that mind is all, that thought is all is only a higher  
materialism.**   
18\. As soon as you make a sect, you protest against universal brotherhood.  
Those who really feel universal brotherhood do not talk much, but their very  
actions speak aloud.   
28\. Have charity towards all beings. Pity those who are in distress. Love all  
creatures. Do not be jealous of anyone. Look not to the faults of others.   
 **31\. There is really but one Self in the universe, all else is but Its  
manifestations.**   
 **36\. Of all the scriptures of the world it is the Vedas alone that declare  
that even the study of the Vedas is secondary. The real study is "that by  
which we realise the Unchangeable". And that is neither reading, for  
believing, nor reasoning, but superconscious perception, or Samâdhi.**   
41\. Let me die a true Sannyâsin as my Master did, heedless of money, of  
women, and of fame! And of these the most insidious is the love of fame!   
 **43. "This is a great land," said Swamiji on one occasion in America, "but I  
would not like to live here. Americans think too much of money. They give it  
preference over anything else. Your people have much to learn. When your  
nation is as old as ours, you will be wiser."**   
59\. Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone.   
67\. Never loved a husband the wife for the wife's sake or the wife the  
husband for the husband's sake. It is God in the wife the husband loves, and  
God in the husband the wife loves. It is God in every one that draws us to the  
one we love, God in everything and in everybody that makes us love. God is the  
only love.   
69\. In everyone is God, the Atman; all else is but dream, an illusion.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ My Experience Of Ramana Maharshi By Rao Saheb Sri K. K. Nambiar  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:49:52 AM  
---  
**It was in the year 1933 that a friend of mine spoke to me about Bhagavan Sri  
Ramana Maharshi and suggested that I should meet him.**   
On reaching Sri Ramanasramam,I went direct to where Sri Bhagavan was seated,  
prostrated myself before him and sat down on the floor at some distance.   
 **One or two incidents during this period may be recounted here, miracles to  
the faithful, but casual coincidences to the sceptics.   
One evening in the year 1936 when I visited the Ashram I decided to ask an  
important question of Sri Bhagavan concerning certain spiritual practices. But  
amidst the solemn hours of Veda Parayana in the evening and during meditation  
that followed I could not make up my mind to ask the question,and returned  
home somewhat disappointed.**   
 **Early next morning, when I was lying half awake, Sri Bhagavan appeared  
before me in a dream and answered the very question which I had failed to put  
to him the previous evening. And before he vanished he also told me that he  
wanted a note-book.** I said I had only one readily available and that it was  
of the octavo pocket-size. He said it was enough. I woke up with a pleasant  
thrill.   
**The dream or vision, whatever one may call it, made such a deep impression  
on my mind that I could not delay carrying out the behest, however strange it  
might seem. After early bath and ablutions I traced out the pocket note-book  
and hurried to the Ashram.** Prostrating myself before Sri Bhagavan as usual,  
I handed over the note-book to him. He received it smiling, and asked me why I  
took it to him, when I related to him, in a whisper, all about my dream.   
**Immediately he called his personal attendant, the late Madhavaswami, and  
remarked to him Did I not ask you last evening to fetch a good notebook to  
write down a Malayalam translation of the Sanskrit text of Sri Ramana Gita?  
You didnt bring one. Here is Nambiar who has brought it for me. It seems he  
had a dream in which I asked him for the book, and he has brought it.** This  
incident aroused a great deal of interest among the devotees.   
 **On another occasion in the same year I dreamt of Maharshi as seated on his  
couch as usual, surrounded by a number of devotees seated on the floor and  
engaged in meditation. Among them I recognised a young devotee from Goa,  
seated in padmasana performing pranayama.** I think he was known by the name,  
Sridhar. While he was doing pranayama, I saw, in the dream, sparks of fire  
rising from the base of his vertebral column up to his head. **Bhagavan,who  
was watching this practicant, interjected There is no need for all this  
gymnastics with breath-control. It is easier and safer to follow the method of  
Self-enquiry as enunciated by me. That is the sum and substance of the dream  
I had.Next day, when I went to the Ashram, I sought out this young Goanese  
Swami. I had no previous acquaintance with him and no occasion even to speak  
to him before. I gave him a full description of the dream I had.** He was  
visibly moved and, somewhat to my embarrassment, embraced me with delight in  
the North Indian fashion.   
**He said Brother, I was all the while waiting for an opportunity to ask  
Bhagavan whether I should continue or give up this practice of pranayama which  
I have been steadily carrying on for the past several years.** Indeed, last  
night while sitting in the presence of Sri Bhagavan I eagerly awaited an  
opportunity to put him the question but I couldnt find a suitable occasion  
for the purpose. Now, there is no need for me to ask him about it. Bhagavan  
answered it through you.   
 **When I was in England last year, I went to see a venerable, old lady, by  
name Mrs. Victoria Doe. She must be nearing 80 and lives in a quiet house at  
17. St. Martins Avenue, Epsom, Surrey, with her only daughter, Miss. Leena  
Doe. She has never come to India, never seen Bhagavan Sri Ramana in flesh and  
blood. Yet, I was deeply moved by her devotion to him. She had read about him,  
prayed to him,meditated on him, and lives in him day in and day out.**   
She showed me sheaves of letters she took from a corner of a shelf, and kissed  
them with great reverence before handing them to me. All the letters were from  
the Ashram and were meticulously preserved for the past several years. She had  
also with her all the English publications of Sri Ramanasramam. She opened one  
of the books and, running her shaky finger along the writing on the first page  
 _With Gracious Blessings from Sri Bhagavan burst into tears of joy and  
devotion. She said Mr. Nambiar,how lucky you are to have been able to be with  
him, to see him and hear him speak. Here, we treasure these books and letters  
as representing him. Now he has sent you here. I feel that he is with us now._  
 Such love, such devotion to the Sage, so tenderly expressed to me, a total  
stranger to her till the other day, moved me to the depths of my being.   
I do not profess competence to interpret Sri Bhagavans philosophy and  
teachings. The first publication I remember to have read on his teachings is  
the booklet entitled Who am I?. Having read it, I felt no need to read other  
books propounding some different approach to the realisation of the Eternal  
Truth. **I am convinced that the method of Selfenquiry suggested in that great  
little book is all that is needed   
for the highest achievement in life, namely, Self-realisation.**

Bhagavan Ramana very rarely accept the gifts brought by devotees.   
He politely refused them on many occasions. Even eatables, if   
brought daily, He would not accept. There were a few lucky devotees, like Mr.  
Nambiar whose gifts were accepted. I think on another occasion, someone or  
may be the same Nambiar brought a costly parker pen and He refused to accept  
stating that His present old ink pen would serve the purpose. One another  
gentleman brought a nice sandal wood walking stick. Bhagavan took it, smelt  
the sandal fragrance and politely refused to accept. He had accepted the corn  
flakes roasted and mixed with chilly powder and salt from Suri Nagamma. Such  
occasions were very rare. He also accepted the 'kadukkai' (Indian myrobalan)  
brought by a villager, since it would cure diarrohea and He was at that time  
suffering from that ailment.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. I agree with you. For a self realized Brahma Jnani, all the   
covenants of yoga sastra come automatically. Bhagavan Ramana   
Himself says in one of His poems: "If under has experienced the   
Self, what else is there to learn?" There are gurus aplenty today,   
who accept golden sandals and keep their feet on that for some   
time, and either give it back to the devotee or keep it for their   
safe-keeping. The devotees, if the sandals are given back, do   
pujas for that sandals. These are all comical. But Bhagavan   
Ramana never wore any slippers or sandals and so this 'comedy'   
could not take place with Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
I found that reading the biographies of saints is like doing parayana  
(circumbulation of mountain or some holy place). Normally all biographies are  
available in the internet. However it still helps to put it in one place,  
because internet is such a huge collection of resources. There is no well-  
defined sequence I follow but put them as and when it occurs to me. Swami  
Sivananda is also in my agenda.

## Re:[34]Thiruvalluvar  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 16, 2010, 10:52:01 AM  
---  
**Thiruvalluvar** : About two thousand years ago there flourished in Mylapore, Madras, a born  
Siddha and a born poet by name Valluvar or, as he is more commonly known,   
**Thiruvalluvar** , which only means, the devotee of the Valluva caste.  
Valluvas are Pariahs (now called Harijans) and their vocation was proclaiming  
the orders of the king by beat of drum. There is a tradition that  
Thiruvalluvar was the son of one Bhagavan, a Brahmin, and Adi, a Pariah woman  
whom he had married.   
Thiruvalluvar was born at Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. He is regarded  
as an Avatara of Brahma. His wife **Vasuki** was a chaste and devoted lady, an  
ideal wife, who never disobeyed the orders of her husband, but always carried  
them out implicitly. Thiruvalluvar showed people that a person could lead the  
life of a Grihastha or householder, and at the same time, lead a divine life  
or a life of purity and sanctity. He showed people that there was no necessity  
to leave the family and become a Sannyasin to lead a divine life of purity and  
sanctity. All his wise sayings and teachings are now in book form and known as  
 **Thirukkural** . These sayings are all in couplets. Here are some of them:  Just as the alphabet A is the beginning of all letters, so also, God is the beginning for this universe.   
 Learn the Shastras completely and then act according to their injunctions.   
 The Anicha flower will fade by smelling, but guests are more sensitive if the hosts turn their faces a bit.   
 Death is like sleeping in the burial ground;   
 birth is like waking in the morning.   
These couplets are 1,330 in number. They contain the essence of the Vedas, the  
Upanishads and the six Darshanas. Thirukkural is regarded as a universal  
Bible. It is another Gita, Koran or Zend Avesta.   
Some aspirants repaired to Thiruvalluvar and enquired: "O sage, which Ashrama  
of life is betterGrihastha or Sannyasa?". Thiruvalluvar did not give any  
answer. He simply kept quiet. He wanted to teach them the glory of Grihastha  
Ashrama by example.   
Thiruvalluvar was taking cold rice in the morning. He said to his wife: "Vasuki, the rice is very hot. Bring a fan to cool it". Thiruvalluvars wife  
was drawing water from the well when Thiruvalluvar called her. She at once  
left the rope and ran to him with a fan to cool the rice. She did not say to  
her husband: "How can the cold rice be hot? Why do you want a fan now?". She  
simply obeyed his commands. The vessel that contained water was hanging half-  
way in the well unsupported, on account of her Pativrata Dharma Shakti. The  
aspirants noticed this phenomenon and the noble conduct of Vasuki and were  
simply struck with amazement.   
About midday, on another occasion, Valluvar called his wife and said, "Bring a  
lamp immediately, O Vasuki! I am stitching the cloth. I cannot see the eye of  
the needle. I cannot pass the thread properly". Vasuki did not say to her  
husband: "It is broad daylight now. Why do you want a lamp? You can see the  
eye of the needle clearly". But she implicitly obeyed his word. The aspirants  
were much inspired by the ideal life of sage Thiruvalluvar and the exalted  
conduct of Vasuki. They did not speak a word to the saint. They took leave of  
the saint and quietly left the place with profound satisfaction. They were  
deeply impressed by the practical and exemplary life led by Thiruvalluvar and  
Vasuki. They learnt the lesson that the life of an ideal householder was in no  
way inferior to that of an ideal Sannyasin who was treading the path of  
Nivritti and austerity in the Himalayan caves and that each was great in its  
own place, time and circumstances.   
Dear readers! Such ladies sit enthroned in the hearts of their husbands. No  
doubt they are hard to find, because such women never advertise themselves;  
but there must be many in our land of Rishis and sages; and unless we maintain  
such a high level of moral purity, we will all be going down in these days of  
modern civilization and scientific advancement. If the husbands of the present  
day behave like Thiruvalluvar, the wives will say, "My husband has become  
senseless. He wants to fan the rice when it is so cold! He wants a light when  
there is broad sunlight". The wives will rebuke their husbands and fight with  
them.   
That house wherein the wife serves the husband with sincere devotion and  
observes **Pativrata Dharma** is heaven on earth. That house wherein the wife  
fights with the husband and disobeys his orders is a veritable hell on earth.  
Ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma need not go to temples. They need not  
practise any Vrata or penance. Service to the husband becomes worship. They  
can realise God through service to their husbands. Husbands also should be  
ideal persons with noble qualities. Husbands are the Gurus for their wives.  
The wives need not get any initiation from any Acharya. Glory to such exalted  
ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma!   
\-- _Swami Sivananda_

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Vasuki's highest chastity is too great to describe.   
Once she was pulling water from a deep well and the bucket   
was half way up to the parapet. Tiruvalluvar called her suddenly   
for some urgent help. She rushed back into the house from the   
back yard. It is said that the bucket half-pulled was simply   
static there at the height left by her without falling down into   
the well.   
Such women, one can see only in some Indian villages or in   
puranas today.   
Arunachala Siva.

Shri Sivananada is originally from a town called Pathamadai,   
near Tirunelveli, in the deep south of Tamil Nadu. He went   
to Rishikesh and other places and he finally settled down at   
Rishikesh and the Ashram was commenced. Sivananada   
Ashram's GURU GITA - English translation, is one of the best   
books on Guru Gita in English .

**Swami Sivananda (1887 - 1963)**   
 **Swami Sivananda** was born on **8th of September, 1887** in the village of  
**Pattamadai** in South India. His father Sri P.S. Vengu Iyer was a great  
devotee of **Lord Shiva** and mother Srimati Parvati Ammal was a god-fearing  
lady. His boyhood name was **Kuppuswamy**.   
Boy Kuppuswamy was intelligent and mischievous. In his boyhood itself he  
showed signs of Tyaga (renunciation) and love for fellow-beings. He used to  
pity the poor, feed the hungry at the door, and make his father throw a pie  
into the hands of pauper passing by. He often got cakes and sweetmeats from  
his mother and distributed them liberally to his younger companions, dogs,  
cats, crows, and sparrows, himself not eating a bit. He used to bring flowers  
and bael leaves for his father's Siva Puja.   
At the Rajah's High School, Ettayapuram, where he studied, Kuppuswamy always  
topped the class and won prizes every year. He had a sweet voice and wonderful  
memory. After the completion of the First Arts Examination, Kuppuswamy went to  
the Medical School in Tanjore to study medicine. He used to be tremendously  
industrious and never went home during the holidays. He would spend the entire  
period in the hospital. He had free admission into the operation theater.  
Kuppuswamy was first in all subjects. He possessed more knowledge than doctors  
with covetable degrees, and in the first year itself he could answer the  
papers which the final year students could not. Kuppuswamy completed the  
course and earned the title of M.B.,C.M. He practiced at Tiruchi.   
Later he got an offer from Malaya from Mr. Robbins to work in the hospital of  
a rubber estate. The young doctor worked very hard. Dr. Kuppuswamy was very  
kind, sympathetic, humorous, witty, and sweet-speaking. Hopeless cases came to  
him, but success was sure. Everywhere people declared that he had a special  
gift from God for the miraculous cures effected in the patients and acclaimed  
him as a very kind and sympathetic doctor with a charming and majestic  
personality. In serious cases, he kept vigil all night. In his private  
practice, Dr. Kuppuswamy used to attend to the poor and often not charge them  
even visiting or consulting fees. Instead he would give them money for special  
diet or to cover their own expenses after discharge from hospital. He gave  
money like water. Once a poor man, drenched to the skin, came to the doctor at  
night. His wife was in birth pangs. The doctor went there at once to her aid,  
and after attending to her, stayed outside the hut in spite of the heavy rain.  
Only after the save delivery of the child did the doctor return home the next  
morning.   
In spite of his busy life, Dr. Kuppuswamy served the Sadhus, Sannyasins, and  
beggars. He attended marriage functions, parties, and other social gatherings.  
Once a Sadhu gave him a book " **Jiva Brahma Aikyam** " by Sri Swami  
Satchidananda. It ignited the dormant spirituality in him. He began to study  
the books of **Swami Rama Tirtha, Swami Vivekananda, Sankara, Imitation of  
Christ, the Bible, and literature of the Theosophical Society**. He was very  
regular in his daily worship, prayer and Yoga Asanas. Study of sacred  
scriptures like the Gita, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata, and the Ramayana was  
done with great devotion. Sometimes he conducted Nandan Charitam and sang  
Bhajans and Kirtans. He practiced **Anahat Laya Yoga** and **Swara Sadhana**.   
Nothing could tempt the doctor. His heart was as pure as the Himalayan snow.  
His immense philanthropy and spirit of service and renunciation endeared him  
to all. People lovingly called him the "Heart of Love". As days passed, he  
reflected more and more and wanted to renounce the world. His heart was  
purified through loving service. At last, Dr. Kuppuswamy, enjoying a lucrative  
practice, renounced the world like Prince Siddartha, in 1923. He left Malaya  
for India.   
At Madras he proceeded to the house of a friend and left his luggage there. He  
began his pilgrimage. At **Benares**, he had the Darshan (vision) of Lord  
Visvanath. He visited Mahatmas (great souls) and temples. At Dhalaj, a village  
on the bank of the Chandrabaga river, he met a postmaster and lived with him.  
He acted as the postmaster's cook, and when the latter arrived home in the  
evening, the doctor was ready to shampoo his legs in spite of his  
remonstrances! It was the postmaster who suggested **Rishikesh** when the  
aspiring doctor wanted a place for solitary meditation.   
Dr. Kuppuswamy reached **Rishikesh** on the 8th of May, 1924. On the 1st of  
June, 1924, there came His Holiness **Sri Swami Visvananda Saraswati**. The  
doctor saw a Guru in the monk and the monk saw a Chela (disciple) in the  
doctor. After a brief exchange of words, Dr. Kuppuswamy was initiated into the  
Sannyas order by Swami Visvananda. Swami Vishnudevanandaji Maharaj, the Mahant  
of Sri Kailas Ashram, performed the Viraja Homa ceremonies. The Guru named the  
doctor Swami Sivananda Saraswati. Swami Visvananda wrote the necessary  
instructions about Sannyas Dharma from Benares. Swami Sivanandaji stayed at  
Swargashram for Sadhana.   
Swami Sivananda dressed to clothe himself, ate to live, and lived to serve  
humanity. A small dilapidated Kutir (hut), not resorted to by others and  
infested with scorpions, protected him from rain and sun. Living in that  
Kutir, he did intense Tapas (austerities), observed silence, and fasted. Often  
he fasted for days on end. He would keep a good stock of bread in his room,  
and for a week have this, together with Ganges water. He would stand up to the  
hips in the ice-cold Ganges in winter mornings and commence his Japa, coming  
out only when the sun appeared. He would spend more than twelve hours in daily  
meditation. With all his intense Tapas, Swamiji did not neglect service of the  
sick. He visited the huts of the Sadhus with medicines, served them, and  
shampooed their legs. He begged food on their behalf and fed them with his own  
hands when they fell sick. He brought water from the Ganges and washed their  
Kutirs. He attended upon cholera and small-pox cases. If necessary, he kept  
vigil through the night by the side of the bed of the ailing Sadhu. He carried  
sick persons on his back to the hospital. With some money from his insurance  
policy that had matured, Swamiji started a charitable dispensary at  
Lakshmanjula in 1927. He served the pilgrims and saw Narayana in them. Swamiji  
practiced all the various Yogas and studied the scriptures. After years of  
intense and unbroken Sadhana, he enjoyed the bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He  
had come to the end of his spiritual journey.   
He used to gather bits of paper and used envelopes, and stitch them into  
little notebooks. He entered some self-instructions in them. Some of the  
instructions found in them read thus: "Give up salt, give up sugar, give up  
spices, give up vegetables, give up chutnies, give up tamarind". In another we  
read: Serve Bhangis, serve rogues, serve inferiors, remove faecal matter,  
clean clothes of Sadhus - take delight, carry water". In another page: "Do not  
revenge, resist not evil, return good for evil, bear insult and injury". On  
some neat little pages we again read: "Forget like a child any injury done by  
somebody immediately. Never keep it in the heart. It kindles hatred. Cultivate  
**Maitri** (friendship), **Karuna** (compassion), **Daya** (mercy), **Prema**  
(love), **Kshama** (forgiveness)". In another paragraph we see: "Develop good  
manners, extreme politeness, courtesy, etiquette, good demeanour, nobility,  
gentleness, mildness. Never be rude, harsh, or cruel. There is nothing to be  
hated in the world. Hatred is ignorance. All contempt for anything or being  
must be removed through love and Vichara (enquiry)".   
Swamiji traveled the whole length and breadth of India during his Parivrajaka  
(wandering monk) life. He visited important places of pilgrimage in the South,  
including **Rameswaram**. He conducted Sankirtan and delivered lectures. He  
visited Aurobindo Ashram and met Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati. At **Ramana  
Ashram**, he had Darshan of **Sri Ramana Maharishi** on the Maharishi's  
birthday. He sang Bhajans and danced in ecstasy with the Bhaktas of Ramana.  
Swamiji went on a trip to **Kailas-Manasarovar** and **Badri**.   
He returned after the pilgrimage, to Rishikesh, and in the year **1936** sowed  
the seed of **The Divine Life Society** on the bank of the holy Ganga. From a  
small beginning the Society grew imperceptibly and it is now the headquarters  
of a world-wide Organization having a large number of Branches both within the  
country and outside. He got the Divine Life Society Registered as a Trust in  
the year 1936, with the main objects of dissemination of spiritual knowledge  
and selfless service of humanity.   
Swami Sivananda's Yoga, which he has significantly called the ' **Yoga of  
Synthesis** ', effects a harmonious development of the 'hand', 'head' and  
'heart' through the practice of Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga.   
On the 14th of July **1963**, the Great Soul Swami Sivananda entered  
Mahasamadhi (departure of a Self-realized saint from his mortal coil) in his  
Kutir on the bank of Ganga, in Shivanandanagar.

**Poems on Mother Kali**   
\- _by Ramprasad_   
Who in this world   
can understand what   
Mother Kali really is?   
The six systems of philosophy   
remain powerless to describe Her.   
She is the inmost awareness   
of the sage who realizes   
that Consciousness alone exists.   
She is the life blossoming within   
the creatures of the universe.   
Both macrocosm and microcosm   
are lost within Mother's Womb.   
Now can you sense   
how indescribable She is?   
The yogi meditates upon Her   
in the six subtle nerve centers   
as She sports with delight   
through the lotus wilderness   
of the pristine human body,   
playing with Her Consort,   
Shiva, the Great Swan.   
When anyone attempts to know Her,   
the singer of this song laughs.   
Can you swim across   
a shoreless ocean?   
Yet the child in me still   
reaches out to touch the moon.   
O wavering mind,   
awaken your upward-flowing awareness.   
Become the sublime warrior Goddess Kali,   
who moves with graceful power   
 through the vast landscape of the body.   
Her divine form, like a black storm cloud   
 illumined by the sun,   
she stands unveiled,   
her long hair falling free like monsoon rain.   
Be lost in awe of her, O mind,   
for you will never comprehend her.   
She dwells as the primal lotus of conscious energy   
 and also as the thousand-petal blossom,   
complete enlightenment.   
She is none other than primordial bliss,   
this great swan ever swimming   
 through the lotus jungle of the subtle body.   
Gaze intently into the blazing heart of joy   
 and you will perceive my blissful Mother,   
matrix of all phenomena.   
The vision of Kali   
 kindles the fire of unitive wisdom,   
burning down conventional barriers,   
pervading minds and worlds with light,   
revealing her exalted beauty   
 as universal flower garden   
and universal cremation ground,   
where lovers merge with Mother Reality,   
experiencing the single taste of nonduality.   
This ardent poet of the Goddess cries: "Every lover longs only   
 to gaze upon the unique Beloved.   
Why close your eyes?   
Why disappear into formless trance?"

I think Sri Ramakrishna used to sing Rama Prasad's poems in   
melting devotion.

Adding to the greatness of Vasuki there is another story. Once one siddha  
Kokannavar came to Vasuki for food. As she was busy in serving her husband  
Thruvalluvar she came little bit late to this siddha and offered food. He got  
angry for attending late. So he looked as if to burn her. Immedietly vasuki  
told him do you think am i a crane which was burnt by you. The siddha was  
surprised at this comment because he burnt a crane as it put his droppings on  
his body when he was meditating. But it happened far away from vasuki's place.  
When she could know this, she might be very powerful than siddha. He felt  
ashamed for his behaviour and went away to meditate further. Simply vasuki was  
a devoted wife and got enlightened. Thruvalluvar's samadhi is in Mylapore.   
In some books say Thruvalluvar belonged to weaver's community. Thruvalluvar  
gave a treasure to the man kind. i.e. Thrukkural

There are several stories about Tiruvalluvar's birth and community.   
Some say he is a Brahmin and some others say that he belongs   
to Seniyar, weaver's community. Because of his secular nature,   
DMK took him as their favourite poet. In Chennai and other places   
of Tamil Nadu, the transport buses used to have a photograph of   
him, (only a drawing), with a book and the writing instrument on his hands.  
DMK carefully made the portrait in such a way, there is   
a upper cloth across his chest so that there is no upaveedam,   
sacred thread, on his chest!   
He did not write anything about moksham in his Tirukural. He   
had the belief that if dharma, artha and kama are properly   
followed by one, the liberation will come automatically. But there   
are 10 couplets about God in the beginning of Tirukural. There   
he mentions God in a very indirect manner without giving scope to   
guess who is that God. For example, he says God is of 8 characteristics. ( a  
la Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram). He again says   
one should hold god's feet to come out of births and deaths, again   
a Hindu concept. Some used to say that in spite of all these descriptions, he  
was a Jain. Nothing is known clearly. Later   
Tamil poets consider him as a Saivite.   
There are 10 commentaries by 10 different scholars on his   
Tirukural. All of them belong to roughly between 4th century   
and 11th century. There are umpteen modern commentaries too.   
The commentary of Parimelazhagar is considered the best.   
Arunachala Siva.
