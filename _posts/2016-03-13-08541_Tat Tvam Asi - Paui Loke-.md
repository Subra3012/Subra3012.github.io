(This is from Mountain Path, Jan. Mar.2008 issue)

This is only an extract from the book of the same name. The book is available  
in Asramam book shop and is   
priced at Rs. 100.00.)   
*   
Self Luminosity of Consciousness: We shall approach this final topic in our chapter on the transcendental Self  
and human experience by   
first identifying all the plausible means of knowing the Self. Thereafter,  
each of the possibilities will be   
critically examined with a view to arrive at the correct answer to the  
question of how the Self can be known.   
The following are the three possibilities that one can think of: 1\. Self is known by an external object;   
2\. the Self is known by another Self. and   
3\. the Self knows itself.   
The first possibility is in admissible. To say that the Self can be known by  
an external object is to say that   
it can be known by not-Self, for whatever is external to the Self is other  
than he Self. i.e.the non Self.   
The non Self, as we have shown, refers to all the objects of the world  
including the mind, the senses and the   
body, which are material and insentient. An object, which is material (jada  
vastu), is not capable of knowing '   
anything. Therefore, the answer that the Self can be known by an external  
object is untenable.

The second, that the Self is known by another Self, is equally unacceptable  
for two main reasons.   
Firstly, this explanation is based on the untenable assumption that there is  
more than one Self. Such   
an assumption is contrary to the central doctrine of Advaita, which holds the  
view that there is only one   
Self. Secondly, the objection is on the ground of logic. Let us, for the  
sake of argument, accept the claim   
that the Self is known by another Self. The immediate question which follows  
would be, 'How is the second   
Self is known?' If the answer is, 'by the third Self', then this again  
invites the question of how the third Self'   
is known. Such a position invariably lands us in the logical difficulty of  
infinite regress (anavastha dosha).   
Thus on both counts, the answer that the Self is known by another Self has to  
be rejected.

This leaves us with the third and final possible answer to the question, viz.,  
the Self knows itself.   
This answer is based on the assumption that the Self is both the knower and  
the known, or the cognizer   
and the cognised, at the same time. This assumption is again untenable.  
Unlike the Self, a material object   
is made up of parts. And any object that is made up of parts is divisible.  
Therefore, it is at least conceivable   
for an object, which is material, that one part may be cogniser and the  
another part, the cognised. However,   
according to Advaita, the Self or Pure consciousness is non dual, homogeneous  
and indivisible. Scriptural   
justification aside, it is common logic that one and the same entity cannot  
be both the subject and the object.   
To use an earlier example, the finger can touch something else but not itself.   
It is therefore clear from the above discussion that all the three  
alternatives are untenable. The question,   
however, remains as to how is the Self known. In the light of Advaita, such a  
question is really a contradiction   
in terms because one only speaks of knowing something when that thing is  
unknown. The Self, unlike any   
object, is never completely unknown. Indeed, to everyone the Self is known.  
The real issue at hand is to what   
degree is the Self known. Everyone knows that there is a spiritual principle  
in him, which is different from the   
body, the senses and the mind. In his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  
Sankara points out that the Self   
is not something unknown to everybody. It is only not fully known. For most  
of us, only the general aspect   
(samanya-amsa) of the Self is known. We know that the Self exists. And we  
make this claim on the ground   
that in the absence of the Self, the mind, the senses and the body will not  
function.

However, the special aspect (Vishesha Amsa) of the Self is unknown to us. That  
is to say, we are ignorant   
of the Self's real nature. Therefore, the Self is known in a general way. This  
is evident from statements,   
such as, 'I know myself', 'I exist', etc., which we all make at one time or  
another. Beyond that, the real   
nature of the Self as truth, consciousness and bliss remains unknown. At  
most, some of us may have the   
intellectual knowledge of the Self from studying the scriptures or listening  
to spiritual discourses.   
The knowledge of the Self, even at the general level, is unlike the knowledge  
of an object, for example,   
a stone or a chair. A stone, for instance, is always an object because it  
has to be known. Being a material   
entity, it can never be the knowing object. As an object, the stone requires  
a subject to know it. The Self,   
however, is not in such a logical predicament. The Self is not an object of  
knowledge in the sense, in which   
a stone or a table is an object of knowledge. These objects are known through  
pramanas, such as   
perception. It is however, impossible to prove the existence of the Self by  
any pramana.

Every pramana functions with the help of, and presupposes, the existence of  
the Self. What is presupposed   
by a pramana can never be proved by it. In the case of the Self, there is no  
need for any proof by any   
pramana. As in the case of building, the existence of the superstructure is  
sufficient proof for the existence   
of the foundation. The question of proof does not arise at all because the  
building cannot exist without   
the foundation. The latter is presupposed by the former. The same  
explanation holds good in the case of the   
Self. Every case of knowing is made possible by the Self, and every time we  
make any knowledge claim,   
we presuppose the existence of the Self. So, the Self does not remain  
unknown. An object requires something   
else to know it. However, being the ground of all experiences, there is  
really nothing apart from the Self to   
know it. 'Where there is duality, there one perceives another, one smells  
another, one tastes another, one   
contacts another, knows another, but where all this is Atman, who is there to  
think, touch and know whom?   
Who can know him by all this is known?....Who can know the knower', declares a  
text from the   
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad. (B.U. 4.5.15). Indeed, the normal mind is an  
instrument of knowledge for ordinary objects. Being a finite entity, it can  
never know the infinite, as the pen will never know or understand   
the writer who is using it. More specifically, the Self being Self-luminous  
(Svaprakasa) is shining all the time,   
revealing its presence. The term 'Svaprakasa' conveys the idea that while  
the Self reveals everything else,   
it itself is not revealed by anything. (Katha Upanishad 2.2.15;  
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.9.). We   
have seen in the earlier sections of chapter that the Self is revealing all  
the time; at the waking level,   
at the dream level and at the deep sleep level. The Self reveals because that  
it is its nature. The Self is   
eternal light. It reveals the world, the body, the senses, and the mind.  
Even in deep sleep, when the mind,   
senses and body are absent, the Self is still revealing. It is like fire,  
where the burning capacity manifests   
when something flammable, like a piece of wood, is brought near it. But  
unlike fire, the revelation of the Self   
is always manifest because it reveals not only the presence of objects, as in  
the case of waking and dream states, but also he absence of objects, as in the  
case of deep sleep. The power of revelation of the Self is manifest in the  
presence as well as the absence of objects.

It is the non relational Self that becomes the Jiva due to avidya. The mind-  
sense-body complex is a product of   
Avidya. What is called the Jiva in association with, or conditioned by, the  
mind-body complex. The Jiva is the   
Self in the body. Though the Self is by its very nature is non relational,  
it becomes relational, as it were,   
with the mind-sense-body complex and gets involved in empirical existence, as  
the knower, agent and enjoyer.   
The Self in itself, which is not involved in any empirical experience, is  
called Turiya, or simply the Fourth. This   
is the Self, which is called Visva at the waking level, Taijasa at the dream  
level, and Prajna at the deep sleep   
level. When all the three levels are transcended, when the Vyavarika is left  
behind, 'That Beyond' where only   
the Self remains is called the Fourth. The Fourth is beyond the three states  
of experience. There is no   
cognition, be it external or internal and all distinctions of knower, known,  
and the knowledge have faded   
into oblivion. It is beyond Avidya. It is, therefore, said to be trans  
empirical and trans relational.

It is Ludwig Wittgenstein who taught us that at the highest level of mystical  
experience, what cannot be   
spoken off can only be shown. Wittgenstein made the distinction between the  
language of saying and the   
language of showing. The language of saying is effective up to certain point.  
Beyond which language is   
ineffective in describing that experience. Here too, the term 'Fourth' is an  
admission of the limitations of   
the language. What can we call the Self per se, which is beyond all  
experiences and therefore, all concepts?   
Since Visva is designated as one, Taijasa as two, and prajna as three, the  
term 'the Fourth' is chosen in keeping with the same parlance to show that the  
Self is by itself and not involved in any kind of experience. It is important  
to underscore that this term does not imply the existence of four Selves.  
Also, one should guard   
against the mistaken notion that the Fourth is referring to a state beyond the  
deep sleep level. As we have   
discussed, the experience is one. The three states are mere super-  
impositions. When the Self becomes conditioned by the limiting adjuncts, it  
is given different names. The truth is that there is only one Self.   
The Self, which is beyond all distinctions and experiences, is called the  
Forth. In the Mandukya Upanishad,   
the Fourth is described as, 'That which is not conscious of the internal  
world, nor conscious of the external world, nor conscious of both the worlds,  
nor a mass of consciousness, nor conscious, nor unconscious;   
which is unseen, beyond empirical dealings, beyond the grasp of the organs of  
action, uninferable, unthinkable, indescribable; whose valid proof consists in  
the single belief in the Self; in which all phenomena cease; and which is  
unchanging, auspicious and non dual. That is the Self and That is to be  
intuited.

According to Sankara, in his commentary on the above text, 'not conscious of  
the internal world' means   
the elimination of dream state. This is followed by the elimination of the  
waking state ('nor conscious of the   
external world') and the state between dream and waking ('nor conscious of  
both worlds'). The state of   
deep sleep is also denied in the expression 'nor a mass of consciousness'.  
Awareness of all objects simultaneously (nor conscious) and ignorance (nor  
unconscious) are ruled out in the Fourth too.   
In this chapter, we have seen how the transcendental Self, is segmented into  
the three states of waking,   
dream and deep sleep. Although the Self remains unchanging and undivided and  
uninvolved, it is called   
Visva, taijasa and prajna at each of the three levels of experience. We have  
also seen how the nameless Self at the waking, dream levels become involved  
and intentional thus giving rise to the knowledge situation. An   
essential feature in both these states is the antahkarana vritti, which makes  
cognition and experience possible.   
In the ultimate analysis, the Self or Brahman from the acosmic standpoint is  
the only reality. As the ever   
luminous revealing effulgence, the Self is always known. Every act of  
cognition and every claim made by the   
Jiva presupposes the Self. Perhaps no where else has this been summed up more  
cogently than the point   
made by Yajnavalkya in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, when he says, 'When the  
sun and the moon have both   
set, the fire has gone out, and the speech has stopped.... the Self serves as  
his (the Jiva) light. It is through   
the light of the Self that he sits, goes out works and returns'. (B.U.4.3.6).  
Being the very basis of experience,   
the Self can never be known.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
