First, you can fly to Chennai International Airport.   
From here you can,   
(a) Rent a taxi and reach Tiruvannamalai. This may cost you a bit.   
(b) Rent a taxi/auto rickshaw to Chennai Bus station (called CMBT- Chennai  
Mofusil Bus Terminal). The rent of the taxi/auto rickshaw to CMBT should not  
cost you much. And from CMBT, there is quite a good frequency of buses going  
to Tiruvannamalai. Buses are generally good and will take around 3 hrs to  
reach Tiruvannamalai. Last time when I travelled, it costed me around Rs.60  
each way.   
Hope this helps you.

Best way to reach Thiruvanamaiai is by Bus from Chennai. You have trains also  
but very much limited services, however you have n no. of buses from CMBT. As  
suggested by Shival, you shall go by Auto/Taxi to CMBT (Koyembedu is the place  
name) and take a bus from there. It would take roughly 3-4 hours from Chennai.   
As far as accomodations are concerned, if you have a reservation you shall  
stay at Asramam (ideal place and highly beneficial) or you have few good  
hotels (do not expect too much) in and around the temple.   
Visit our Bhagavan's abode and be blessed.

Dear friend,   
 From Goa I think you need to reach Bangalore by train and from Bangalore regular bus services are available to Tiruvannamalai.

Hiya Guru grace   
As I understand it expecting anything at all, waiting for a result, looking  
for a goal or any similar mental actions during meditation defiantely  
interferes with meditation.   
Just do it without caring about it.   
If you fall asleep   
.Do it when you are walking, When you are standing up. Do anywhere anytime  
.Stop in the middle of some daily activity and do it.   
Read Ramana's teaching a lot.   
Read one line that you feel inspiring over and over.   
Keep at it !!!   
Don't worry !!   
Let things take the time that they naturally take. That way you wont notice  
the time passing so much.   
Keep Ramana in your thoughts as much as you can.   
Peace   
Mick H

Bhagavan once told Narayana Iyer, 'There are no jnanis. Jnana alone is'. If  
you are a jnani, you don't see anyone as either enlightened or unenlightened.  
You simply abide as the Self. The idea that some beings are more enlightened  
than others only exists for people who think that they are unenlightened.   
 I have heard that Nisargadatta had the utmost respect for Bhagavan. As for  
Bhagavan, he didn't see anything as other than his own Self, and he certainly  
never graded people as being more or less enlightened than himself.

Dear Ramana Follower,   
It is difficult to compare two realized souls,except in terms of  
empirical/physical matters such as their height,weight, time and year of birth  
and so onsuch info is anyway useless.As for the teachings there could be  
small differences and approaches mainly due to different times and environment  
of the gurus and the limitation of the language used.   
As for me, both the jnanis cared for their devotees one living inthe heart  
of Mumbai and another in a small temple town but close to Chennai[madras] a  
large city.They did not retire to forest or in the caves of the  
Himalayas...How fortunate were those thousands of devotees who thronged them--  
including my father who had visited Ramana several times and received their  
Grace!

Perhaps, Raju Balsekhar (Refer: Advaita, Buddha and the Unbroken   
Whole, Zen Publications, Mumbai) has read in detail about both   
Ramana and Nisargadutta Maharaj. He kept a picture of Bhagavan,   
in his study above his desk. He says that both are realized souls and   
guides for humanity. What I feel is that Bhagavan realized the Self,   
and then came to Arunachala to practise "tapas" for the sake of   
devotees and heard and read, and wrote books, again for the sake of devotees.  
In the case of Nisarga Dutta Maharaj, it was the usual order   
reading, tapas and realization.
