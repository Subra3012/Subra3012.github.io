Dear matthias,   
Thanks for sharing this with the members. Even in Karnataka,   
this Buddha Jayanti is celebrated by Hindus. He was born on   
Vaisaka Poornima Day, the full moon day of Bhaisaki month, as   
per Hindu Calendar. Hindu Organizations like Sri Ramakrishna   
Math, Brahma Kumaris movement, are celebrating this day with   
some special prayers and distribution of prasad.   
Hindus call the Buddha as one of the avataras of Vishnu. But   
I think the Buddha would like to call himself more an enlightened   
man than the avatara.   
Arunachala Siva.

yes I agree with you subramaniam, the buddha was no avatara, he was a man like  
the both of us, but his accumulation of merit culminated in perfect  
enlightment in the life of gautama siddharta--   
the same is with ramana maharshi...he was ready because he did his job   
so we should remember today that we also have to do our job in hte right  
way.....   
and I think it is wonderfull that after all the turmoil between buddhism and  
hinduism these two wonderfull religions are moving together...   
I read recently that shankara and his followers where really wild in spreading  
their teachings, the same with nagarjuna and his buddhist teachings..   
I started to study the lankavatara sutra ( a central text of mahayana  
buddhism), wich also shows buddhism moving slowly towards vedantic  
philosophy.. its wonderfull and reminds me very strongly on advaitic  
teachings..   
and who cares if the hindu tantra is better then the buddhist tantra, or if  
madhyamika or advaita is the "real" non dual teaching of human kind?   
just a narrow-minded man

Dear matthias,   
A friend of mine once told me that the "Prajna Parimita Sutra",   
which he had thoroughly read and understood, that Gaudpada's   
Maandukaya Upanishad Karika is the same as the Prajna Parimata.   
Both speak of Ajata Vada.   
Another one told me that the following verse in Chapter IV of   
Gaudapada Karika, refers only to the Buddha.   
 -Chapter IV, Alata Shantih - Quenching of the Fire brand.   
Jnanenaakashaklpena dharmanyo naganopaman   
Jneyabhinna sambhuthruth vandhe dvipadam param   
I bow to that the best among men who by means of knowledge   
which is like Akasa, Pure Space, and non different from the object   
of knowledge (i.e the Dharma), realized the nature of the Dharmas   
(i.e. the Jivas) which are, again, like the Akasa Pure Space.   
Dvipadam, bipeds in the verse, means only men characterized by   
two legs. It can definitely mean the Buddha. Sri Sankara of course,   
says it is Narayana, who appeared in human form in Badrikasramam in Himalayas  
to Gaudapada, to tell the Truth of Ajata Vada.   
In fact, Buddhism and Hinduism, are the branches of the same   
tree. They are showing the same moon, from two different branches. The Truth  
is only one. Hinduism and Buddhism are   
complimenting each other. Sri Sankara himself was called Prasna   
Buddha, the hidden buddha by his antagonists.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanian   
I read the prajnaparamita sutra this morning   
....here is my favourit part of it: "Like a falling star, like a bubble in a stream,   
Like a flame in the wind, like frost in the sun,   
Like a flash of lightning or a passing dream --   
So should you understand the world of the ego.

Dear matthias,   
It is interesting that Gaudapada said the same thing in a different   
fashion. He calls his way as Asparsa Yoga, Asparsa means "not-   
touching, untouch." Yoga means "union". The phrase appears to   
be self contradictory. But what Gaudapada means is that so long   
you are not touched by "ego", your life promotes the happiness of   
all beings, and conduces the well being of all and which is free from   
strife and contradictions and you are united with the Self. Ego is   
the mischief maker. A totally egoless person abides in Atma. The   
Jiva and Atma become one and without duality. All duality occurs   
due to the demon called the ego. The touch of the untouch is   
similar to the 'clapping of one hand' in Zen Buddhism. What is the   
clapping of one hand? As I understand, my Atma pulsates on its own.   
The verse 2 of Alata Shantih reads: I salute this Yoga, known as Asparsa, free from all duality, taught   
to me, the the yoga that promotes the happiness of all beings....   
free from strife and contradictions.   
The Verse 4 reads: The existent cannot again pass into birth. Nor can the non existent be born or  
come into being as existent. [The dispute occurs because of ego.] Ajati is  
absolute non evolution of what exists.   
The benedictory verse on Bhagavan Ramana says: He is the Ocean of Existence - Knowledge and Bliss.   
All the world (with full of ego) are like waves at the periphery.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramniam   
I have a question now, concerning shankara and gaudapada   
you see here in europe we have some nice translaitions of bhagawans work.   
but I never found a good translation (in fact not even a ba done) of shankara  
or gaudapada..if you know some good english translations, with a good  
commentary, of major works from both, please let me know.   
I want to deepen my study of advaita vedanta also...but in german translation  
there is nothing, I never found one work of shankara....   
so when you know a brilliant english translation please let me know   
sarva mangalam

Dear matthias,   
It is nice that you have shown interest on these philosophies.   
I think, the best source is Sri Ramakrishna Math, who have got   
their branches at London, Paris, in Switzerland, in Germany and   
in Italy. I shall get you their addresses soon from the local   
Sri Ramakrishna Math.

yes I agree with you subramaniam, the buddha was no avatara, he was a man like  
the both of us, but his accumulation of merit culminated in perfect  
enlightment in the life of gautama siddharta--   
the same is with ramana maharshi...he was ready because he did his job   
so we should remember today that we also have to do our job in hte right  
way.....   
and I think it is wonderfull that after all the turmoil between buddhism and  
hinduism these two wonderfull religions are moving together...   
I read recently that shankara and his followers where really wild in spreading  
their teachings, the same with nagarjuna and his buddhist teachings..   
I started to study the lankavatara sutra ( a central text of mahayana  
buddhism), wich also shows buddhism moving slowly towards vedantic  
philosophy.. its wonderfull and reminds me very strongly on advaitic  
teachings..   
and who cares if the hindu tantra is better then the buddhist tantra, or if  
madhyamika or advaita is the "real" non dual teaching of human kind?   
just a narrow-minded man

Dear matthias,   
A friend of mine once told me that the "Prajna Parimita Sutra",   
which he had thoroughly read and understood, that Gaudpada's   
Maandukaya Upanishad Karika is the same as the Prajna Parimata.   
Both speak of Ajata Vada.   
Another one told me that the following verse in Chapter IV of   
Gaudapada Karika, refers only to the Buddha.   
 -Chapter IV, Alata Shantih - Quenching of the Fire brand.   
Jnanenaakashaklpena dharmanyo naganopaman   
Jneyabhinna sambhuthruth vandhe dvipadam param   
I bow to that the best among men who by means of knowledge   
which is like Akasa, Pure Space, and non different from the object   
of knowledge (i.e the Dharma), realized the nature of the Dharmas   
(i.e. the Jivas) which are, again, like the Akasa Pure Space.   
Dvipadam, bipeds in the verse, means only men characterized by   
two legs. It can definitely mean the Buddha. Sri Sankara of course,   
says it is Narayana, who appeared in human form in Badrikasramam in Himalayas  
to Gaudapada, to tell the Truth of Ajata Vada.   
In fact, Buddhism and Hinduism, are the branches of the same   
tree. They are showing the same moon, from two different branches. The Truth  
is only one. Hinduism and Buddhism are   
complimenting each other. Sri Sankara himself was called Prasna   
Buddha, the hidden buddha by his antagonists.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanian   
I read the prajnaparamita sutra this morning   
....here is my favourit part of it: "Like a falling star, like a bubble in a stream,   
Like a flame in the wind, like frost in the sun,   
Like a flash of lightning or a passing dream --   
So should you understand the world of the ego.

Dear matthias,   
It is interesting that Gaudapada said the same thing in a different   
fashion. He calls his way as Asparsa Yoga, Asparsa means "not-   
touching, untouch." Yoga means "union". The phrase appears to   
be self contradictory. But what Gaudapada means is that so long   
you are not touched by "ego", your life promotes the happiness of   
all beings, and conduces the well being of all and which is free from   
strife and contradictions and you are united with the Self. Ego is   
the mischief maker. A totally egoless person abides in Atma. The   
Jiva and Atma become one and without duality. All duality occurs   
due to the demon called the ego. The touch of the untouch is   
similar to the 'clapping of one hand' in Zen Buddhism. What is the   
clapping of one hand? As I understand, my Atma pulsates on its own.   
The verse 2 of Alata Shantih reads: I salute this Yoga, known as Asparsa, free from all duality, taught   
to me, the the yoga that promotes the happiness of all beings....   
free from strife and contradictions.   
The Verse 4 reads: The existent cannot again pass into birth. Nor can the non existent be born or  
come into being as existent. [The dispute occurs because of ego.] Ajati is  
absolute non evolution of what exists.   
The benedictory verse on Bhagavan Ramana says: He is the Ocean of Existence - Knowledge and Bliss.   
All the world (with full of ego) are like waves at the periphery.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramniam   
I have a question now, concerning shankara and gaudapada   
you see here in europe we have some nice translaitions of bhagawans work.   
but I never found a good translation (in fact not even a ba done) of shankara  
or gaudapada..if you know some good english translations, with a good  
commentary, of major works from both, please let me know.   
I want to deepen my study of advaita vedanta also...but in german translation  
there is nothing, I never found one work of shankara....   
so when you know a brilliant english translation please let me know

Dear matthias,   
It is nice that you have shown interest on these philosophies.   
I think, the best source is Sri Ramakrishna Math, who have got   
their branches at London, Paris, in Switzerland, in Germany and   
in Italy. I shall get you their addresses soon from the local   
Sri Ramakrishna Math.

Dear matthias,   
Thanks for sharing this with the members. Even in Karnataka,   
this Buddha Jayanti is celebrated by Hindus. He was born on   
Vaisaka Poornima Day, the full moon day of Bhaisaki month, as   
per Hindu Calendar. Hindu Organizations like Sri Ramakrishna   
Math, Brahma Kumaris movement, are celebrating this day with   
some special prayers and distribution of prasad.   
Hindus call the Buddha as one of the avataras of Vishnu. But   
I think the Buddha would like to call himself more an enlightened   
man than the avatara.

Another one told me that the following verse in Chapter IV of   
Gaudapada Karika, refers only to the Buddha.   
 -Chapter IV, Alata Shantih - Quenching of the Fire brand.   
Jnanenaakashaklpena dharmanyo naganopaman   
Jneyabhinna sambhuthruth vandhe dvipadam param   
I bow to that the best among men who by means of knowledge   
which is like Akasa, Pure Space, and non different from the object   
of knowledge (i.e the Dharma), realized the nature of the Dharmas   
(i.e. the Jivas) which are, again, like the Akasa Pure Space.   
Dvipadam, bipeds in the verse, means only men characterized by   
two legs. It can definitely mean the Buddha. Sri Sankara of course,   
says it is Narayana, who appeared in human form in Badrikasramam in Himalayas  
to Gaudapada, to tell the Truth of Ajata Vada.   
In fact, Buddhism and Hinduism, are the branches of the same   
tree. They are showing the same moon, from two different branches. The Truth  
is only one. Hinduism and Buddhism are   
complimenting each other. Sri Sankara himself was called Prasna   
Buddha, the hidden buddha by his antagonists.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanian   
I read the prajnaparamita sutra this morning   
....here is my favourit part of it: "Like a falling star, like a bubble in a stream,   
Like a flame in the wind, like frost in the sun,   
Like a flash of lightning or a passing dream --   
So should you understand the world of the ego.

Dear matthias,   
It is interesting that Gaudapada said the same thing in a different   
fashion. He calls his way as Asparsa Yoga, Asparsa means "not-   
touching, untouch." Yoga means "union". The phrase appears to   
be self contradictory. But what Gaudapada means is that so long   
you are not touched by "ego", your life promotes the happiness of   
all beings, and conduces the well being of all and which is free from   
strife and contradictions and you are united with the Self. Ego is   
the mischief maker. A totally egoless person abides in Atma. The   
Jiva and Atma become one and without duality. All duality occurs   
due to the demon called the ego. The touch of the untouch is   
similar to the 'clapping of one hand' in Zen Buddhism. What is the   
clapping of one hand? As I understand, my Atma pulsates on its own.   
The verse 2 of Alata Shantih reads: I salute this Yoga, known as Asparsa, free from all duality, taught   
to me, the the yoga that promotes the happiness of all beings....   
free from strife and contradictions.   
The Verse 4 reads: The existent cannot again pass into birth. Nor can the non existent be born or  
come into being as existent. [The dispute occurs because of ego.] Ajati is  
absolute non evolution of what exists.   
The benedictory verse on Bhagavan Ramana says: He is the Ocean of Existence - Knowledge and Bliss.   
All the world (with full of ego) are like waves at the periphery.   
Arunachala Siva.

They alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.   
Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourself weak, weak you  
will be, if you think yourself strong, strong you will be.   
Faith in God, Faith in ourselves, this is the secret of greatness.   
How can we see evil unless it is in us?   
Only those who want nothing are masters of Nature.   
You cannot believe in God, until you believe in yourself.   
Everything can be sacrificed for truth, but truch cannot be sacrificed for  
anything.   
Seek the science of the maker, and not that of the made.   
Work on with the intrepidity of a lion, but at the same time, with tenderness  
of love.   
Impure imagination is as bad as impure action.   
Truth must have no compromise.   
Thirst for name and fame is the worst filth.   
There is nothing holier in the world than to keep good company.   
What we want is neither happiness nor misery; If the mind is pleased with  
praise, it will be displeased with blame.   
To work you have the right, but not to the result.   
The greatest sin is to think yourself weak.   
Dare to come to Truth even through hell.   
What we call nature, fate, is simply God's Will.   
Choose the highest ideal and live your life up to that.   
The whole ocean is present at the back of each wave.

Dear matthias,   
Thanks for sharing this with the members. Even in Karnataka,   
this Buddha Jayanti is celebrated by Hindus. He was born on   
Vaisaka Poornima Day, the full moon day of Bhaisaki month, as   
per Hindu Calendar. Hindu Organizations like Sri Ramakrishna   
Math, Brahma Kumaris movement, are celebrating this day with   
some special prayers and distribution of prasad.   
Hindus call the Buddha as one of the avataras of Vishnu. But   
I think the Buddha would like to call himself more an enlightened   
man than the avatara.   
Arunachala Siva.

yes I agree with you subramaniam, the buddha was no avatara, he was a man like  
the both of us, but his accumulation of merit culminated in perfect  
enlightment in the life of gautama siddharta--   
the same is with ramana maharshi...he was ready because he did his job   
so we should remember today that we also have to do our job in hte right  
way.....   
and I think it is wonderfull that after all the turmoil between buddhism and  
hinduism these two wonderfull religions are moving together...   
I read recently that shankara and his followers where really wild in spreading  
their teachings, the same with nagarjuna and his buddhist teachings..   
I started to study the lankavatara sutra ( a central text of mahayana  
buddhism), wich also shows buddhism moving slowly towards vedantic  
philosophy.. its wonderfull and reminds me very strongly on advaitic  
teachings..   
and who cares if the hindu tantra is better then the buddhist tantra, or if  
madhyamika or advaita is the "real" non dual teaching of human kind?   
just a narrow-minded man

Dear matthias,   
A friend of mine once told me that the "Prajna Parimita Sutra",   
which he had thoroughly read and understood, that Gaudpada's   
Maandukaya Upanishad Karika is the same as the Prajna Parimata.   
Both speak of Ajata Vada.   
Another one told me that the following verse in Chapter IV of   
Gaudapada Karika, refers only to the Buddha.   
 -Chapter IV, Alata Shantih - Quenching of the Fire brand.   
Jnanenaakashaklpena dharmanyo naganopaman   
Jneyabhinna sambhuthruth vandhe dvipadam param   
I bow to that the best among men who by means of knowledge   
which is like Akasa, Pure Space, and non different from the object   
of knowledge (i.e the Dharma), realized the nature of the Dharmas   
(i.e. the Jivas) which are, again, like the Akasa Pure Space.   
Dvipadam, bipeds in the verse, means only men characterized by   
two legs. It can definitely mean the Buddha. Sri Sankara of course,   
says it is Narayana, who appeared in human form in Badrikasramam in Himalayas  
to Gaudapada, to tell the Truth of Ajata Vada.   
In fact, Buddhism and Hinduism, are the branches of the same
