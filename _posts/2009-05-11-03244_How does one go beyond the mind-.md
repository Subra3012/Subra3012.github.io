## How does one go beyond the mind?

There are many starting points -- they all lead to the same goal. You may  
begin with selfless work, abandoning the fruits of action; you may then give  
up thinking and end in giving up all desires. Here, giving up (tyaga) is the  
operational factor. Or, you may not bother about any thing you want, or think,  
or do and just stay put in the thought and feeling 'I am', focussing 'I am'  
firmly in your mind. All kinds of experience may come to you -- remain unmoved  
in the knowledge that all perceivable is transient, and only the 'I am'  
endures.

Dear Nagaraj,   
The same idea has been conveyed by Bhagavan Ramana in Who am I?   
Sivaprakasam Pillai asked Him: What is the difference between non-   
attachment and jnana?   
Bhagavan replied: "Non attachment and Jnana are not different. Both   
are the same. Non attachment is where the mind does not go after   
any objects/persons. Jnana is where no object/person appears.   
Arunachala Siva.
