14. I alone am the peaceful Self. I alone am the permanent. Bliss is the supreme measure.   
This, which is visible, is nothing at all.   
15\. I alone am omnipresent. I alone am the well established. Bliss is the  
supreme measure.   
This, which is visible, is nothing at all.   
16. I alone am the individual Self. I alone am the beyond the beyond. Bliss is the supreme measure.   
This, which is visible is nothing at all.   
17\. I alone am the import of the sacred utterances. I alone am Sankara, the  
bestower of auspiciousness.   
Bliss is the supreme measure. This, which is visible, is nothing at all.   
18. I alone am the impossible goal. I alone am the illuminator. Bliss is the supreme goal. This,   
which is visible, is nothing at all.   
19. I alone am me, me only. I alone am myself, my own Self. I am the highest Bliss. I am indeed   
consciousness.   
20\. I alone am the pure Self. I alone am full of truth. I alone am the void  
Self. i alone am the all-   
reaching.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
