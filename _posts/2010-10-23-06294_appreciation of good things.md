While appreciating the good things in the world, do we get lost in our  
sadhana?

One can definitely appreciate good things in life. But one should   
not desire to possess them. They will come to you, if they are   
ordained for you.   
Once when someone started plucking all flowers from the trees   
in the Hill, Bhagavan chided that devotee, saying: "Why do   
you want all of them? Are not the flowers more beautiful in the   
trees? Are not the flowers that have already fallen on the ground,   
enough for your puja?"   
Arunachala Siva.**
