As promised I would like to share some of my expereinces at the dzogchen  
teachings...   
I should mention that dzogchen buddhism is actually not buddhism in a usual  
sense it has a position like advaita vedanta to vedanta...you could say that  
dzogchen is buddhist advaita vedanta and advaita vedanta is vedantic  
dzogchen...   
First I should say that the teacher keith dowman is a direct disciple of  
dudjom rinpoche, who is seen as the greatest dzogchen teacher of the 20th  
century...and keith dowman together with other westerners (I know three who  
are allowed to teach) could be seen like the early translators and schoolars  
who brought dzogchen from india to tibet (just in the western sense)......   
now to the teaching structure: first is a sitting, (9 breath to clean the mind), then you are advised to  
abide in the nature of the mind...thats all   
you start with intoning the seed syllable Hung (the seed syllable of the  
mind)...this intoning is the actual refuge practice to dharma sangha and  
buddha, but in the dzogchen practice you take refuge to the nature of mind (to  
your "self" if you like), taking refugeis usually a long prayer but in  
dzogchen "hung" is enough...   
the you sit for 10-20minutes (as I mentioned no advice is given but to abide  
as in the nature of mind)...   
and after the sitting the teacher intones a "hung" followed by a "Phat", Phat  
is very loud it is almost shouted....and sound like the bursting of a bubble,  
this is usefull to end any sort of trance like states (wich usually arise out  
of fabricates unnatural meditaitons....) and on the other hand it is an  
indicator almost a souting out that one will not stop to meditate.....so there  
you can see the contradictory nature of it all...on one side you intone phat  
to "burst the bubble" of eventually arising trance like states and on the  
other hand you say you will not stop to meditate anymore...   
after this followed teachings based on miphams "voice of vajra-awareness"  
\--"an aspiration for the indivisibility of starting point, path and goal from  
the manjusri dzogchen"   
and this was it for the next two days....   
to use the words of keith dowman: dzogchen is non-action, non-meditation...the  
teachings use the intellect to destroy the intellect witht he highest buddhist  
dialectics (that are not longer buddhistic...) you're feeling of self is  
slowly deconstructed over a piriod of hours....and on the second day I totally  
lost my sense of self, I felt sick, I wanted to vomit started to cry  
etc....fear arose...existential fear...on the other hand I had many insights,  
many non verbal expereinces of the timeless......   
you are trainded to be "an old man basking the sun" this is an indicator of  
the non activity na dnon meditational side, actuall unteachable dzogchen..   
on the other hand we had some rushen teacings (there are inner, outer and  
secret rushen teachiings)   
these are meant to open the window for dzogchen meditation to sponteaniuosly  
arise..   
we practiced inner rushen practices: the red hung breath and the blue hung  
breath (red beeing the active and blue the passice)   
you visualize the hung inside the body and then breath it out..everything it  
touches is either (pacified and revealinf hte skylike nature=blue or every  
thing start to burn, until no more substantiallity is left=red), then breath  
in and the same happens wit body mind....this is an aid to "learn" what is  
real and what is unreal...   
so i just can say that I tasted the very essence of buddhism, and it tasted  
very good...the problem is that there is no fruit, no state..nothing to  
gain...so I do not know what happend but in a way it feels and felt  
good...and I want more...   
there was a strong transmission of energy in way, it was an initiatory  
expereince....even if I did not enter samdhi (I was short before lossing any  
sense of self...but i was tooo scared), but anyway there was some sort of  
transmission and that foma liniage thatgoes bakc to padmashambava (the seocnd  
incarnation of buddha) and also of shakyamuni.....it is said that dzogchen is  
actually the way of all great masters and buddhas, it is the first and last  
primordial yoga that leads to perfect enlightment.....that is of course not  
existing   
hope this is of any use for you

Dear Matthias,   
I was reading about dzogchen and found it to be very similar to advaita in its  
principles.   
One thing that I specially liked is inner sky gazing which helps to  
effectively dis-identify from any thought objects during meditation and just  
be with the inner sky.

yes alot of similarities...I think this is because of the similarity of the  
realisation...   
what is a primary factor of dzogchen is the blessing of the lineage....going  
back to garab dorje and padmasambhava....it is an unbroken lineage of nondual  
realisation...and scholarship... therefore the blessing of the lineage is very  
strong...maybe you attend a seminar someday, you will feel it, Iam sure..   
and sky gazing is an important practice, yet it was just mentioned on the edge  
of the teaching I attended. Keith dowman just said that while we rest in the  
nature of mind we should jump into the thoughts and emotions with this skylike  
gaze..this will revelate their self liberated nature...   
I also liked that there is nothing to be changed or altered during meditaiton  
and you are just constantly reminded on the intrinsic self liberated nature of  
everything that arises...great teachings I will attend some more weekend  
retreats.....I catched fire and I want more
