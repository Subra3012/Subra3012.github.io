While doing self enquiry slowly man can understand saranagathi thathva. As  
Bhagavan says when everything is taken care of God we should not worry.   
Now can we wish best things for others. Sometimes things never do happen the  
way man wishes. Ordinary man gets agitated whereas the spiritual   
seeker understands it is our prarabda. Is it good to wish or just keep  
watching?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Wishing others in times of distress is always good, whether others   
are spiritual or not. I am not sure whether our wishes would change   
the course of their prarabdha, but I am sure that these wishes give   
them a lot of peace and this itself is a tonic for their distress.   
Arunachala Siva.

To give comfort we say do not worry, God is there, He will help you. But due  
to prarabda when things turn upside down, opposite people loose their faith.  
It is also their prarabda. They ask when every thing is fixed according to  
the prarabda why we have to pray to God. I do not have answer. Young people  
they expect lot   
in short time and pray to God. It is very difficult to explain them about the  
law of nature, law of karma and prarabda. Actually I will we should pray to  
God to give strength to face the situations whatever it may be rather people  
ask God to grand such such manner to them. To understand the karma theory, we  
should have   
God's grace. Otherwise people get frustrations in life.

Dear I,   
There is this one prayer, it is called as the Serenity Prayer, written by  
Reinhold Niebuhr, a theologian:  **God grant me the serenity   
to accept the things I cannot change;   
courage to change the things I can;   
and wisdom to know the difference.**   
Living one day at a time;   
Enjoying one moment at a time;   
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;   
Taking, as He did, this sinful world   
as it is, not as I would have it;   
Trusting that He will make all things right   
if I surrender to His Will;   
That I may be reasonably happy in this life   
and supremely happy with Him   
Forever in the next.   
Amen.   
This covers the entirety all all religions put together.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent quote and that is the truth. The question of destiny   
has been asked by many devotees and Bhagavan Ramana has   
replied: "Yes. Everything is pre-destined." Devaraja Mudaliar   
then asked Him: "Suppose, I pick up this hand-fan for waving for   
breeze and then keep it down after sometime. Is this also pre-   
destined?" Bhagavan smiled and said: "Yes. Everything is pre-   
destined."   
Then, Ramanaduli, what power on earth can change the course   
of destiny? It is only God/Guru's Grace. Nothing shall prevent.   
our destiny excepting Guru's Grace. To obain Guru's Grace, we should pray,  
meditate and eventually surrender. That is all.   
*   
Oh, You are like my mother, who gives her breasts for suckling!   
If you do not give, this lowly dog, I shall suffer like an uncared baby*   
I trust You, please give me your Grace!   
O Mother, I shall rest at your feet.   
But why are you not gracing me?   
You have taken hold of me, this lowly dog, as your slave,   
Am I saying No, due to some mistrust, I do not know!   
 \- Ananda Maalai, Garland of Bliss, Tiruvachakam, Verse 5   
 Manikkavachagar.   
*   
Arunachala Siva.
