## Eckhart Tolle

It is coincidental. Some friends are writing about Eckhart Tolle   
in the Forum. I happened to read a book review in Mountain   
Path, on his book "A NEW EARTH" [Penguin India, Rs 300.00).   
I have not read any of his books. I am in two minds, whether   
to buy such books. Anyway the review, as given in MP, further   
abridged by me.   
The author says that the purpose of his latest book A NEW EARTH, is to 'bring  
about a shift in consciousness, that is to   
say, to awaken.' And that the mere reading of the book can   
awaken those who are ready. This would place the book in   
the category of very rarefied sacred writing, an arguable assertion for sure.  
Nevertheless the author's presentation   
is most readable, accessible, and practical so would be of   
interest to anyone seriously concerned with personal and   
global transformation.   
His argument starts like this: All spiritual traditions have two   
core insights. First, the "normal state of mind "of most human   
beings contains a strong element of what we might call "dysfunction", --  
'maya' in the Hindu tradition, 'dhukka' in the   
Buddhist and then secondly, 'the good news is the possibility   
of a radical transformation of human consciousness' variously known as  
enlightenment, liberation or awakening.   
The first half is devoted to describing the ego, the root cause of this  
dysfunction. Tolle shows the reader very vividly all the   
'normal', everyday strategies that our ego uses to constantly reassure  
ourselves that we exist and any honest reader will   
certainly but uncomfortably recognize all of them in themselves. But there  
are some other which are more subtle and subversive... like constant need for  
more, complaining and resentment. All these emotions constitute what Tolle  
calls the 'pain body'. The author defines it as a 'semi autonomous energy  
form' that thrives in negative thinking and is addicted to unhappiness. The  
'pain body' is not only individual but also partakes of humanity, which is a  
history of continuous tribal warfare, enslavement, pillage, rape, torture, and  
other forms of violence. This pain lives in the collective psyche of  
humanity.   
The good news, the way out of this dysfunction comprises the second half of  
the book, which is mostly author's reiteration of his first book, THE POWER  
OF NOW. This is about, primarily dis-identifying with form and discovering  
one's true identity through being present in the now. There is hardly any new  
material in the second book, as Tolle would himself admit.   
Tolle says that this recognition of illusion is also its ending. BUT IF ONLY  
IT WERE THIS EASY.   
Probably due to the phenomenal international success of THE POWER OF NOW, and  
his own experience as a very popular New   
Age Guru, Tolle feels that the humanity is desparately searching   
for a new consciousness, and hence this book and his optimistic ending: The  
foundation for a new earth is a new heaven, -- the   
awakened consciousness. The earth, -- external reality -- is only its outer  
reflection.   
Nothing is "going " to make is free, because only the present moment can make  
us free.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
I have read the book "A NEW EARTH" several months ago.   
It is a good book.   
I feel it is always good to know how other people express spiritual  
feelings...   
Everyone has their own unique way; there are variations in experiences,  
although there is a common underlying theme.   
The book is meant to be read slowly with introspection...   
it is written in simple style and the ways of the ego are brought out with  
great details.   
Another good reading is from Anadi, formerly Aziz Kristof.   
I would recommend interested persons to read this site: The Teaching of Enlightenment: http://www.anaditeaching.com/   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear Subramanian,   
 God's creation is perfect beyond any doubt. There is not a lest bit of  
imperfection anywhere at all. Including the corrupt, Dirt, sewage, Excreta,  
Filth, Bad words, insult, and all those things that we Hate & etc... are also  
one of many aspects of the Great Lord. Since beyond doubt, we know that there  
is only one energy - Brahman - God, even the so called Satans, Evil Tantriks,  
Black Magicians also derive their energy from the same Pure single energy of  
the One Lord. In the same way, all knowledge, opinions and variations in  
interpretations and books etc... also represent the same glory of the Single  
Atman - Brahman in its own glorious way. Sri Ramana remained unmoved when  
miscreants urinated on him!   
Truth is the light that cannot be hidden at all. In any place, in all places  
it shows itself like the High Beam striking at our eyes. when This Light is  
seen the rest (filth, doubt, controversial subject, etc...) also becomes part  
of that Light only.   
I have come to find that the Truth is the same everywhere, it is the eternal  
consciousness. The Truth is but only the Truth alone. Call it Vedantic Truth,  
Bibilic Truth, Islamic Truth, Satanic Truth, the Black Magic Truth. With the  
consciousness, one is never scared about himself. He never changes. Even when  
trained by a Satan, Black Magician, Evil Tantriks. Or even when attacked by  
them. these all will be found to be only illusion!   
It was only because of this that I was also able to appreciate U G  
Krishnamurty, His criticisms of Budha, Jesus & Shankara did not ridicule me.  
Because I know what a Budha, Shankara, Jesus really is - Consciousness.   
Eckhart Tolle is an excellent thinker. His views very much correspond to our  
own Vedic lore.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
I have absolutely no quarrel against Tolle. In fact, Mountain   
Path has given a good review of the book. What they said   
particularly was: 1. The second half of the second book is a repetition of the   
first book, which was already a best seller.   
2. Leaving the objective knowledge and remaining within   
is not that easy as it is portrayed in the book. It needs   
a lot of practice, chitta suddhi etc.,   
When I typed: Why such books? I meant only that what is   
the use of reading books endlessly particularly when every   
new book talking about Advaita is only a new packaging of   
the old goods. That is all. All said and done, I may buy these   
two books also. All these are vasanas.   
Arunachala Siva.
