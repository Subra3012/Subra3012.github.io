## Aids to self-realization and Who am I?

Bhagavan prescribes many aids to self-realization in Who am I?   
He says that since all books say only control of mind as a final truth,   
there is no use in reading books endlessly. Since the Self is within   
five sheaths, it is futile to search it in books. But in our lives, we   
are quite different. From the younger days, we start with romantic,   
crime and science fiction. Then we read stuff like Camus, Kafka and   
Sartre. The we move to Western philosphy and try to understand   
Kant, Spinoza, Hegel and Nietzsche. At that stage we come to Indian   
philosophy and read J Krishnamurthi, Osho, Zen teachers like   
Watts, Humphreys and Dr. Suzuki. Finally we arrive at Sankara and   
Bhagavan. Even here we go on reading many many books by Sankara and on  
Bhagavan. Perhaps with Guru's grace, we shall end all these and   
sit in Silence, when even books of Ramana may not interest us.   
Arunachala Siva.

My dear non duel, Your request for clarification of certain   
Tamil words.   
Sri is literally one full of riches and virtues. It is used as a   
word of respect to each other, but is more meaningful than   
Mister. It also means 'Honourable'.   
Pranams or Namaskarams mean literally obeisances. This   
is used again towards elders and gurus. The elders and   
gurus use the word Aasirvadham which means best wishes   
and blessings.   
Namaste is the word like Greetings. It also means namaskrams   
or pranams. But this is used when one sees another person.   
Ji is a appendix after the personal noun or name to indicate   
respect. It is like saying: Non duel, sir !   
All these words are either Sanskrit or Hindi words which are   
freely used in Tamil and other Indian languages also. If you want   
classic Tamil words, which are not invariably used are: Pranams / Namaste - Vanakkam   
Ji - 'avargal'   
Sri - 'Thiru' '   
We can use to address Bhagavan as: Bhagavan Ramana, Vanakkam   
Bhagavan Ramana avargal   
Thiru Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
Infact, the Tamil word Tiruvannamalai means Thiru-Annamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.
