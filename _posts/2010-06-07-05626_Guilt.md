1\. THOU seest many stars at night in the sky, but findest them not when the  
sun rises. Canst thou say that there tare no stars, then, in the heaven of  
day? So, O man,because thou beholdest not the Almighty in the days of thy  
ignorance, say not thsft there is no God.   
 **2\. Four blind men went to see an elephant. One touched the leg of the  
elephant, and said, ' The elephant is like a pillar,' The second touched the  
trunk, and said,'The elephant is like a thick stick or club.' The third  
touched the belly, and said, ' The elephant is like a big jar.' The fourth  
touched the ears, and said,' The elephant is like a winnowing basket' Thus  
they began to dispute amongst themselves as to the figure of the elephant. A  
passer-by seeing them thus quarrelling, said,' What is it that you are  
disputing about ? ' They told him everything, and asked him to arbitrate. That  
man said, None of you seen the elephant. The elephant is not like a pillar,  
its legs are like pillars. It is not like a big water-vessel, its belly is  
like a water-vessel. It is not like a winnowing basket, its ears are like  
winnowing baskets. It is not like a thick stick or club, but its proboscis is  
like that. The elephant is the combination of all these.* In the same manner  
those quarrel who have seen one aspect only of the Deity.**   
3\. In a potter's shop there are vessels of different shapes and forms pots,  
jars, dishes, plates, &c. but all are made of one clay. So God is one, but is  
worshipped in different ages and climes under different names and aspects.   
4\. The Master said: 'Everything that exists is God.' The pupil understood it  
literally, but not in the true spirit. While he was passing through a street,  
he met with an elephant. The driver (mdhut) shouted aloud from his high  
place,' Move away, move away ! ' The pupil argued in his mind,Why should I  
move away ? I am God, so is the elephant also God. What fear has God of  
Himself?' Thinking thus he did not move. At last the elephant took him up by  
his trunk, and dashed him aside. He was Ay.. severely hurt, and going back to  
his Master, he related the whole adventure. The Master said, A11 right, you  
are God. The elephant is God also, but God in the shape of the elephant-driver  
was warning you also from above. Why, did you not pay heed to his warnings ? '   
5.The human body is like a boiling pot, and the mind and the senses are like  
water, rice or potato, &c.in it. Put the pot with its ingredients on the fire  
; it will be so hot as to" burn your finger when you touch it. But the heat  
does not belong to the pot, nor anything contained in it, but is in the fire.  
So it is the fire of Brahman in man that causes the mind and. the senses to  
perform their functions, and when that fire ceases to act, the senses ] also,  
or the organs, stop.   
The swan, can separate the milk from water; it drinks only the milk, leaving  
the water untouched. Other birds cannot do so. Similarly God is intimately  
mixed up with Maya ordinary men cannot see Him separately from Maya., Only  
the Paramahamsa (the great soul here is a punon the word c hamsa/ which means  
both soul and swan) throws off Maya, and takes up God only.   
A perfect man is like a lotus-leaf in the water or like a mud-fish in the  
marsh. Neither of these is polluted by the element in which it lives.   
Ornaments cannot be made of pure gold. Some alloy must be mixed with it. A man  
totally devoid of Maya will not survive more than twenty-one days. So long as  
the man has body, he must have some Maya, however small it may be, to carry on  
the functions of the body.   
So long as no child is born to her, the newly-married girl remains deeply  
absorbed in her domestic duties. But no sooner is a son born, than she leaves  
off all her household concerns, and no longer finds any pleasure in them. On  
the contrary, she fondles the newborn baby the livelong day, and kisses it  
with intense joy. Thus man, in his state of ignorance, performs all sorts of  
worldly works, but no sooner does he see the Almighty, than he finds no longer  
any relish in them. On the contrary, his happiness now consists only in  
serving the Deity and doing His works   
alone.   
Little children play with dolls in a room apart just as they like, but as soon  
as their mother comes in they throw aside the dolls and run to her crying,  
'Mamma, Mamma ! " You also are now playing in this world deeply absorbed with  
the dolls of wealth, honour, and fame, and I have no fear or anxiety. But if  
you once see the Divine Mother entering in, you will not find pleasure any  
more in wealth, honour, and fame. Leaving off all these you will run to Her.   
A true devotee who has drunk deep of the Divine Love is like a veritable  
drunkard, and, as such, cannot always observe the rules of propriety.   
 **Sugar and sand may be mixed together, but the ant rejects the sand and goes  
off with the sugar-grain ; so pious men sift the good from the bad.**   
He is truly a pious man who is dead even in this life,i,e. whose passions and  
desires have been all destroyed as in a dead body.   
A spring cushion is squeezed down when one sits upon it, but it soon resumes  
its original shape when the pressure is removed. So it is with worldly men.  
They are full of religious sentiments, so long as they hear religious talks ;  
but no sooner do they enter into the daily routine of the world, than they  
forget all those high and noble thoughts, and become as impure as before.   
This world is like a stage, where men perform many parts under various  
disguises. They do not like to take off the mask, unless they have played for  
some time. Let them play for a while, and then they will leave off the mask of  
their own accord.   
What you wish others to do, do yourself.   
There are two Egos in man, one ripe and the other unripe. The ripe Ego  
thinks,Nothing is mine ; whatever I see, or feel, or hear, nay, even this body  
is not mine, I am always free and eternal.' The unripe Ego, on the  
contrary,thinks,' This is my house, my room, my child, my wife, my body, &c.'   
The sun can give heat and light to the whole world,but it can do nothing when  
the clouds are in the sky and shut out its rays. Similarly, sokmg as egoism is  
in the soul,God cannot shine upon the heart.   
Once upon a time conceit entered the heart of the Divine Sage Nirada, and he  
thought there was no greater devotee than fyimself. Reading his heart, the  
Lord Sir! Vishmi said, Narada, go to such and such a place, there is a great  
Bhakta of mine there, and cultivate his acquaintance,' Narada went there and  
found an agriculturist, who rose early in the morning, pronounced the name of  
Hari only once, and taking his plough went out to till the ground all day  
long. At night he went to bed after pronouncing the name of Hari once more.  
Narada said within himself,   
'* How can this rustic be called a lover of God ? I see him busily engaged in  
worldly duties, and he has no signs of a pious man in him.' Narada then went  
back to the Lord and said all he thought of his new acquaintance. The Lord  
said, 'N&rada, take this cup full of oil, go round this city and come back  
with it, but beware lest a drop of it fall to the ground.' Narada did as he  
was told, and on his return he was asked, 'Well, Narada, how often did you  
remember me in your walk?' Not once, my Lord replied Narada, 'and how could I  
when I had to watch this cup brimming over with oil?' The Lord then said, e  
This one cup of oil did so divert your attention that even, you did forget me  
altogether, but look to that rustic who, carrying the heavy load of a family,  
still remembers me, twice every day.'   
The heavier scale of a balance goes down while the lighter one rises up.  
Similarly he who is weighed down with too many cares and anxieties of the  
world, goes down to the world, while he who has less cares rises up towards  
the Kingdom of Heaven.   
So long as one does not become simple like a child,one does not get Divine  
illumination. Forget all the worldly knowledge that thou hast acquired, and  
become as ignorant I about it as a child, and then thou wilt get the knowledge  
of I the True.   
It is very pleasant to scratch a ringworm, but the after-sensation is very  
'painful and intolerable; so the pleasures of the world are very pleasant in  
the beginning but their after-consequences are very terrible to contemplate.   
Where is God? How can we get to Him?   
A. There are pearls in the sea, you must dive deep again and again until you  
get the pearls. So there is God in the world, but you should persevere to see  
Him.   
He who would learn to swim must attempt swimming for some days. No one can  
venture to swim in the sea after a single day's practice. So if you want to  
swim in the sea of Brahman, you must make many ineffectual attempts at first,  
before you can successfully swim therein.   
When does a man get his salvation? When his egoism dies.   
 **The truly devotional and spiritual practice suited for this Iron-age (Kali-  
yuga) is the constant repetition of the name of the Lord of Love.**   
In what condition of the mind does God-vision take place ? God is seen when  
the mind is tranquil. When the mental sea is agitated by the wind of desires,  
it cannot reflect God, and then God-vision is impossible.

Without awakening one's own inner consciousness, one cannot realize the All-  
pervading Consciousness. The inner consciousness must be awakened through  
God's grace.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Vivekananda says it is selfishness to think I'll have a child for myself  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 07, 2010, 10:40:16 AM  
---  
**THE PREPARATION   
Volume 4, Addresses on Bhakti-Yoga  
He who wants to love God must get rid of extreme desires, desire nothing  
except God. **This world is good so far as it helps one to go to the higher  
world. The objects of the senses are good so far as they help us to attain  
higher objects.** We always forget that this world is a means to an end, and  
not an end itself. If this were the end we should be immortal here in our  
physical body; we should never die. **But we see people every moment dying  
around us, and yet, foolishly, we think we shall never die; and from that  
conviction we come to think that this life is the goal. That is the case with  
ninety-nine per cent of us.**   
This notion should be given up at once. This world is good so far as it is a  
means to perfect ourselves; and as soon as it has ceased to be so, it is evil.  
So wife, husband, children, money and learning, are good so long as they help  
us forward; but as soon as they cease to do that, they are nothing but evil.  
If the wife help us to attain God, she is a good wife; so with a husband or a  
child. **If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if  
not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the  
better.**   
The next is Abhyâsa, practice. The mind should always go towards God. No other  
things have any right to withhold it. It should continuously think of God,  
though this is a very hard task; yet it can be done by persistent practice.  
What we are now is the result of our past practice. Again, practice makes us  
what we shall be. So practice the other way; one sort of turning round has  
brought us this way, turn the other way and get out of it as soon as you can.  
Thinking of the senses has brought us down here  to cry one moment, to  
rejoice the next, to be at the mercy of every breeze, slave to everything.  
This is shameful, and yet we call ourselves spirits.   
Go the other way, think of God; **let the mind not think of any physical or  
mental enjoyment, but of God alone.** When it tries to think of anything else,  
give it a good blow, so that it may turn round and think of God. As oil poured  
from one vessel to another falls in an unbroken line, as chimes coming from a  
distance fall upon the ear as one continuous sound, so should the mind flow  
towards God in one continuous stream. We should not only impose this practice  
on the mind, but the senses too should be employed. Instead of hearing foolish  
things, we must hear about God; instead of talking foolish words, we must talk  
of God. Instead of reading foolish books, we must read good ones which tell of  
God.   
 **The greatest aid to this practice of keeping God in memory is, perhaps,  
music.** The Lord says to Nârada, the great teacher of Bhakti, "I do not live  
in heaven, nor do I live in the heart of the Yogi, but where My devotees sing  
My praise, there am I". Music has such tremendous power over the human mind;  
it brings it to concentration in a moment. You will find the dull, ignorant,  
low, brute-like human beings, who never steady their mind for a moment at  
other times, when they hear attractive music, immediately become charmed and  
concentrated. Even the minds of animals, such as dogs, lions, cats, and  
serpents, become charmed with music.   
The next is Kriyâ, work  doing good to others. The memory of God will not  
come to the selfish man. The more we come out and do good to others, the more  
our hearts will be purified, and God will be in them. According to our  
scriptures, there are five sorts of work, called the fivefold sacrifice.  
First, study. A man must study every day something holy and good. Second,  
worship of God, angels, or saints, as it may be. Third, our duty to our  
forefathers. Fourth, our duty to human beings. Man has no right to live in a  
house himself, until he builds for the poor also, or for anybody who needs it.  
The householder's house should be open to everybody that is poor and  
suffering; then he is a real householder. **If he builds a house only for  
himself and his wife to enjoy, he will never be a lover of God.**   
Then there is Kalyâna, purity, which comprises the following: Satya,  
truthfulness. He who is true, unto him the God of truth comes. Thought, word,  
and deed should be perfectly true. Next Ârjava, straightforwardness,  
rectitude. The word means, to be simple, no crookedness in the heart, no  
double-dealing. Even if it is a little harsh, go straightforward, and not  
crookedly. Dayâ, pity, compassion. Ahimsâ, not injuring any being by thought,  
word, or deed. Dâna, charity. There is no higher virtue than charity. The  
lowest man is he whose hand draws in, in receiving; and he is the highest man  
whose hand goes out in giving. The hand was made to give always. Give the last  
bit of bread you have even if you are starving. You will be free in a moment  
if you starve yourself to death by giving to another. Immediately you will be  
perfect, you will become God. People who have children are bound already. They  
cannot give away. They want to enjoy their children, and they must pay for it.  
**Are there not enough children in the world? It is only selfishness which  
says, "I'll have a child for myself".**   
God is not to be reached by the weak. Never be weak. You must be strong; you  
have infinite strength within you. How else will you conquer anything? How  
else will you come to God? At the same time you must avoid excessive  
merriment, Uddharsha, as it is called. A mind in that state never becomes  
calm; it becomes fickle. Excessive merriment will always be followed by  
sorrow. Tears and laughter are near kin. People so often run from one extreme  
to the other. Let the mind be cheerful, but calm. Never let it run into  
excesses, because every excess will be followed by a reaction.   
These, according to Ramanuja, are the preparations for Bhakti.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says A Quiet Mind is All we Need  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 07, 2010, 10:47:57 AM  
---  
Questioner: I am not well. I feel rather weak. What am I to do?   
Maharaj: Who is unwell, you or the body?   
Q: My body, of course.   
M: Yesterday you felt well. What felt well?   
Q: The body.   
M: You were glad when the body was well and you are sad when the body is  
unwell. Who is glad one day and sad the next?   
Q: The mind.   
M: And who knows the variable mind?   
Q: The mind.   
M: The mind is the knower. Who knows the knower?   
Q: Does not the knower know itself?   
M: The mind is discontinuous. Again and again it blanks out, like in sleep or  
swoon, or distraction. There must be something continuous to register  
discontinuity.   
Q: The mind remembers. This stands for continuity.   
M: Memory is always partial, unreliable and evanescent. It does not explain  
the strong sense of identity pervading consciousness, the sense 'I am'. Find  
out what is at the root of it.   
Q: However deeply I look, I find only the mind. Your words 'beyond the mind'  
give me no clue.   
M: While looking with the mind, you cannot go beyond it. To go beyond, you  
must look away from the mind and its contents.   
Q: Where does it all lead me?   
M: When the mind is kept away from its preoccupations, it becomes quiet. If  
you do not disturb this quiet and stay in it, you find that it is permeated  
with a light and a love you have never known; and yet you recognise it at once  
as your own nature. Once you have passed through this experience, you will  
never be the same man again; the unruly mind may break its peace and  
obliterate its vision; but it is bound to return, provided the effort is  
sustained; until the day when all bonds are broken, delusions and attachments  
end and life becomes supremely concentrated in the present.   
Q: The very words 'I' and 'universal' are contradictory. One excludes the  
other.   
M: They don't. The sense of identity pervades the universal. Search and you  
shall discover the Universal Person, who is yourself and infinitely  
more.Anyhow, begin by realising that the world is in you, not you in the  
world.   
Q: To know perfectly I need a perfect mind.   
 **M: A quiet mind is all you need. All else will happen rightly, once your  
mind is quiet. As the sun on rising makes the world active, so does self-  
awareness affect changes in the mind. In the light of calm and steady self-  
awareness inner energies wake up and work miracles without any effort on your  
part.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says indians destroy evil by suffering  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 07, 2010, 11:16:35 AM

**THE RAMAYANA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California,  
January 31, 1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses**   
Rama and Sita are the ideals of the Indian nation. All children, especially  
girls, worship Sita. **The height of a woman 's ambition is to be like Sita**,  
the pure, the devoted, the all-suffering! When you study these characters, you  
can at once find out how different is the ideal in India from that of the  
West. For the race, Sita stands as the ideal of suffering.   
**The West says, "Do! Show your power by doing." India says, "Show your power  
by suffering." The West has solved the problem of how much a man can have: India has solved the problem of how little a man can have. The two extremes,  
you see. **Sita is typical of India  the idealised India. The question is not  
whether she ever lived, whether the story is history or not, we know that the  
ideal is there. There is no other Paurânika story that has so permeated the  
whole nation, so entered into its very life, and has so tingled in every drop  
of blood of the race, as this ideal of Sita.   
Sita is the name in India for everything that is good, pure and holy   
everything that in woman we call womanly. If a priest has to bless a woman he  
says, "Be Sita!" If he blesses a child, he says "Be Sita!" They are all  
children of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the patient, the all-  
suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through all this suffering  
she experiences, there is not one harsh word against Rama. She takes it as her  
own duty, and performs her own part in it. Think of the terrible injustice of  
her being exiled to the forest! But Sita knows no bitterness. That is, again,  
the Indian ideal. Says the ancient Buddha, "When a man hurts you, and you turn  
back to hurt him, that would not cure the first injury; it would only create  
in the world one more wickedness." Sita was a true Indian by nature; she never  
returned injury.   
Who knows which is the truer ideal? The apparent power and strength, as held  
in the West, or the fortitude in suffering, of the East?   
 **The West says, "We minimise evil by conquering it." India says, "We destroy  
evil by suffering, until evil is nothing to us, it becomes positive  
enjoyment."** Well, both are great ideals. Who knows which will survive in the  
long run? Who knows which attitude will really most benefit humanity? Who  
knows which will disarm and conquer animality? Will it be suffering, or doing?

## Re:[15] Guilt

Quote from: Joey_ on April 18, 2010, 10:10:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on April 15, 2010, 01:15:25 PM  
Quote  
what did Sri Ramana say about guilt?   
He said: "In the vast ocean of cause and effect, actions happen and impermanent results  
follow. If one takes them as my actions the idea of having a free will gets  
stronger. **This sense of personal doership gives rise to a feeling of guilt  
or pride and effectively blocks the spiritual understanding that everything  
happens according to the will of God. "**   
Sri Bhagavan also said: The thinking mind can be temporarily suspended through the control of breath.  
**It can be annihilated only when there is total understanding that God 's  
will prevails all the time and the different forms are only puppets having no  
free will of their own. With this understanding three beautiful things happen: there is no one to feel guilty or proud, to get frustrated or to have a  
sense of enmity. Life becomes simple.**   
and:  **When the enquiry, What is the thinking mind? occurs, the thinking mind  
understands intuitively that it has no free will and stops thinking itself to  
be the doer and gives way to the feeling of I AM. This is the Direct path.**   
This is all I needed to hear! Now I will atleast intellectually always know  
that guilt is just part of egos surviving methods.   
I'm very sorry, but I found out that these were from commentary of 'Upadesa  
Saram', not from the original text itself. But still this quote is from Sri  
Bhagavan himself and it should be enough   
"But still the You are always pure. It is your senses and body which tempt you  
and which you confuse with your real Self. So first know who is tempted and  
who is there to tempt. But even if you do commit adultery, do not think about  
it afterwards, because you are yourself always pure. You are not the sinner."   
And here is a couple more: " **The only freedom** man has is to strive for and acquire the jnana which  
will enable him not to identify himself with the body. The body will go  
through the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha and a man is free either  
to identify himself with the body and be attached to the fruits of its  
actions, or to be detached from it and be a mere witness of its activities."   
"Whatever this body is to do and whatever experiences it is to pass through  
was already decided when it   
came into existence."   
"How is the mind known to us? Owing to its activities, namely,   
thoughts. **Whenever thoughts arise remember they are all modes   
of God and they cannot be otherwise**, this is enough; this is   
the surrender of the mind. Can anything exist independent of God? All is God  
alone.   
He acts through all. Why worry ourselves?"

Dear Joey, I think all realised souls said that guilt is not good.It makes you  
weak and depressed.Sri Ramakrishna was always saying that every sinner can be  
a saint,and every saint can be a sinner.You will reap the fruit of your every  
action.Thats punishment.Whay then need to feel guilty?Just try to learn from  
that experience,and then close that door forewer.Only then you can go forward.

If you had been guilty due to any acts in the past, forget about   
them. Do not do any act of guilt, from now on. Nurturing thoughts   
about guilt are the greater pain or sin, than the act per se.   
Doing guilt again and again and then seeking forgiveness from   
God/Guru is the most despicable act. It is not like week-end   
washing of your soiled clothes, through a washing machine.   
This is what Bhagavan Ramana cautioned against.   
Arunachala Siva.
