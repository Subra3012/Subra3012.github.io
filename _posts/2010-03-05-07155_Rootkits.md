## Report of malware on other websites

Anti-virus software on my computer detected a trojan horse type of malware   
on Nithyananda's website - in the link 'ashrams&centers' on his website  
homepage.   
I am not sure if it is appropriate to report malware on other websites here,   
but I report it for other members' safety,   
thinking that somebody might visit his website out of curiousity just like I  
did.

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thank You so much for sharing and explaining all this! It is truly a wonder  
what they can do,and how many ways they are using to jeopardize peoples  
privacy.   
I have noticed what You have said,about possibility to turn on our computer  
camera,and watch us. I am not sure is that is it,but once i have noticed sound  
like taking picture coming from my computer. From that moment,i put the  
sticker on my laptop camera.   
Thank You once more,Sir!   
With love and prayers,
