Brahmasri Nochur Venkatraman, while explaining Ulladu Narpadu, cites   
several verses from Proudanubhuti, which is by Sri Sankara. I want   
readers to let me know what this book is and is there any other name   
for that book?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Subramanian,   
Praudha Anubuthi seems to be a short work of Adi Sankarar; A Sanskrit version  
is available at   
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/shankara_works.html

Dear kannan, Thank you and welcome to the Forum.   
Dear grhluna,   
If you want to do bhajans with self enquiry laced into it, please buy   
CDs or audio tapes of Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam, the five verses,   
from Sri Ramanasramam or Ramananjali, the music wing of Ramana   
Maharshi Centre for Learning, Sanjay Nagar, Bangalore. The Asramam   
version is preferable.   
Arunachala Siva.
