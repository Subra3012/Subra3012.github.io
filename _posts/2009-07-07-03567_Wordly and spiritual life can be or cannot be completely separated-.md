Can we maintain our existence with or without the help of materialistic world?   
Is it possible to completely give up of the worldly resources?   
Whether a line can be drawn between these? If yes Please throw some light on  
it.   
Roshan

Dear Roshan,   
Only a few Jnanis who have attained the Self, can throw the   
world out and live without the world. Even in their cases,   
the world comes on their own and feeds him.   
But for most of us, we have to be in the world and pursue   
bhakti, saranagati, [surrender], and self enquiry along with   
our work [karma] for our bread and butter. This cannot be   
avoided. One can even marry and beget children. The Self   
Realization does not depend on these qualifications or non-   
qualifications. Only thing we have to remember is that the   
world is, anityam, impermanent. Bhagavan Ramana says   
that this anityam is also duhkam, sorrow. But one has to   
experience this sorrow amidst some happiness and should   
realize the Nityam, the Permanent, the Bliss of the Self.   
Fear of death and futility of life is to be constantly remembered, but we  
cannot shake off the world so easily.   
Bhagavan Ramana tells one story. There is a frog. It sees   
a fly within some centimetres of its tongue and it wants   
to jump and gulp the fly. BUT AT THE SAME IT DOES NOT   
REMEMBER THAT IT IS ALREADY IN A SNAKE'S MOUTH! Even   
amidst the impending death, it looks for its prey. We are all   
like that. There are only two things as the first two invocatory   
verses of Sad Darsnam of Bhagavan says: 1. Remember the only permanent, eternal thing. The Self.   
2. Have the fear of death and then seek the feet of God or   
Siva, to conquer death.   
Arunachala Siva.
