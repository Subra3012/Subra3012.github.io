## Fear is good or bad

People should get fear or not. I think the fear pushes us further development.  
The same fear gave the Moola manthra i.e.   
Who am I to Bhagavan. He was fortunate to go in right direction, whereas many  
people do not. and they get more confused.   
If we do not arrive to the final spot, we always have a funny feeling always.  
To get over it, there is His way, that is the only way. Practising self  
enquiry.   
Experts give comments please

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Fear for each and everything in life is not advised by   
elders. But fear to commit sin should be there, to help   
us avoid us sins as far as practicable. Fear to God, which   
is called bhaya-bhakti is recommended by elders. Fear   
to God along with devotion to him makes us get attached   
to him and surrender to his golden feet at the end. Fear   
comes out of respect for him, like a servant towards the   
king, who salutes when king comes near. Why? The   
king is powerful and he can punish you. God is the most   
powerful being and therefore, devotion mixed with fear   
for him is advised by elders. This fear goes off after sometime,   
when bhakti becomes total.   
Ingersoll was an atheist. He was in his death bed. The   
priests came to his bedside to give some holy water, as per   
Christian practices, and also to read a verse from Bible.   
Ingersoll did not object to it and he is reported to have   
said: All along I did not believe in God, and I was even   
abusing him. Now I believe that if there is a God, he will   
punish me. Perhaps I have erred throughout my life.   
Christian priest said: Do not worry. Atleast now you are   
seeking retribution, he will surely forgive you!"   
Arunagiri Nathar says: "I have committed countless sins.   
Taking many many births, Brahma is tired of giving me   
fresh births, and Yama is tired of giving me deaths. The   
jackal and the vulture have become tired of eating my   
burning flesh in the cremation ground. Let me first be   
afraid of you then be devoted to you, so that you can   
save me and place me at your feet, O Muruga."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the reply. I too feel like Arunagiri swamigal. I pray to Bhagavan,  
this birth should be last. Yesterday I was reading Ramanodhyam.   
When Alzhagamai fell sick, Bhagavan prayed to Arunachala to grant her for long  
life. She should not die before her realisation. After reading   
those page, I prayed to Him, Bhagavan please grant this boon also. Alzhagami  
was so fortunate. ENNA THAvam CHEIDHANALZHO, ALZHAGAMAI   
ENGUM NERAI PARABRAHMAN AVALUKKAhA PRARTHANAI CHEIYA.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Nice Tamil poem on Azhagamma. She and Sundaram Iyer   
must have done great dhavam to give birth to a such an   
avatara called Ramana. Bhagavatam says that forefathers   
and mothers thirty generations before and thirty generations   
after a Brahma Jnani get liberation. Even Hiranyakashyap   
got liberation because Prahlada was his son.   
Azhgamma came to see Bhagavan four times. First time,   
she came around 1911-12 {fifteen years after Bhagavan   
came to Arunachala}. Bhagavan wrote a slip of paper   
stating that "The ordainer takes care of all. It is better   
to keep silent." She returned home. Again next year or   
so, she came. She stayed in Echammal's house for a couple   
of days had darshan of Bhagavan Ramana and returned.   
On the third occasion only, this fever happened. Bhagavan   
FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT READY FOR LIBERATION. IT IS   
BETTER FOR HER TO LEAD THE LIFE FURTHER, TO WORK IT   
OUT. So, He prayed to Arunachala in four heart melting songs   
to give her some more years of life, by curing illness. THIS   
IS THE ONLY SONG IN WHICH BHAGAVAN ASKED SOMETHING   
WORLDLY, FROM ARUNACHALA. In no other songs, He asked for anything like that.  
Azhagamma got well and returned to   
Madurai.   
After two or three years, when life's problems became un-   
manageable -- Nagaswami, the first son had died, the second   
son Venkatraman had gone to Arunachala and the third son   
Nagasundaram's wife had died and so he also left for Tiruvannamalai to be  
with his brother. There was utter poverty. One brother in law (not  
Nellaipapa Iyer) had also passed away. The Tiruchuzhi was sold. She became  
really a destitute. She came to Bhagavan Ramana as her only refuge not only  
for her   
remaining years in the world but also for the priceless   
reward of self realization in 1922.   
Arunachala Siva.

Fear is illusory. Its only resistance which enhances the non existing fear,  
don't resist anything, accept things as they are. Its only when the ideas of  
the ego are threatened, fear creeps up. But by the power of your awareness,  
consciousness of the fear, accept the situation, fear disappears as its was  
not there in first place at all.   
Infact Ego and Fear are not different. Ego itself is fear, Fear itself is Ego.   
There is no fear, resistance, ideas, agenda for the Consciousness awareness.  
Be as this. Fear is not yours its only the Ego's. There is nothing to fear.   
Face fear face to face. Face everything face to face. Your third Eye -  
Consciousness will destroy every illusion and leave only Bhasma (Truth). You  
are That Shiva. Your Consciousness is the third eye of Shiva. This is the  
Shiva Tattva about his Third Eye. You are Shiva Swaroopa.   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Fear is due to the mind. For the one who has controlled   
the mind, there is no fear. If one like Bhagavan Ramana   
could kill the mind, he becomes the boldest human being   
in the world. As Nagaraj said, we are the Third Eye of Siva,   
from where Skanda came out to kill the demons with whom   
even Brahma, Vishnu and Indra feared. June 20th is the   
40th anniversary of man's landing on the moon. On that   
day Neil Armstrong and Col. Collins landed on the moon.   
Edward Aldrin was in the mothercraft, still circling the moon   
for his friends to join him after the mission. Normal Mailer   
has written a non-fiction called Fire on the Moon, about the   
psychology of astronauts. He interviewed them in detail   
before the mission. The one question that was the most   
important was: How will you manage the worst situations?   
The worst situation could me many. The failure of the craft,   
loss of oxygen, sudden death due to some unknown problems, re-entry problem,  
[in which Kalpana Chawla and others died]. All problems revolve around death.  
Death is the most primordial fear. Neil Armstrong, [who later became a Jesuit  
Father!]   
said: Problem of liquidation? Why we should fear that? We are always with  
God. It is God who runs the show!"   
Saint Tiruvukkarasar sang: What is there to fear about?   
What things will erupt which can give fear to us? We have   
got the Panchaksharam.   
Panchaksharam is called Anju-Ezhutthu in Tamil. Five letters. Anju also  
means 'to fear'. The saint-poet has made pun on   
this word!   
Arunachala Siva.
