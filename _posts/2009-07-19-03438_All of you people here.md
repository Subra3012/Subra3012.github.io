## Tenth Man-a funny tale with high philosophy  
Author: arcsekar            Date: July 19, 2009, 12:20:25 PM  
---  
There was a Guru with ten stupid students.He asked the students to cross the  
river and wait for him on the other bank.He warned them about   
the depth and current of the river. Asked them to exercise care and caution.   
The scary students mangaged to cross the river and reached the other side of  
the river.Out of anxiety,they wanted to check about safe arrival of the entire  
group of ten.The first one proceeded without first counting himself and ended  
up with ""Nine"Ã¶nly.Startled, they organised recounting, but the score never  
crossed Nine ;because each of them inadvertently omitted to include himself in  
the count.They cried in chorus about the loss of one of their team members and  
cursed the river.   
At last, the Guru came on the scene.He understood their problem. He gave a  
blow to each of the students to call out numbers.One..Two..Three   
the last one shouted Ten. The total tallied.Students beamed with joy that all  
of them are very much alive and kicking.Thus the Guru solved a   
non-existent problem.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to narrate this funny story to explain the need for Self  
Enquiry.   
In the book Kaivalya Navaneetham (Tamil) published by Sri Ramanashram,the  
philosophy underlying the story is well expounded.   
 Story line Philosophy   
a)Every student forgetting to count himself  
a)Ignorance of Self -Agnanam.We disregard the Self and direct our thoughts   
 on other objects exeternal to us   
b)Tenth Man not found  
b)Illusion-Maya. Mind filters the Reality. Unreal things appear as Real   
c)Crying over the missing person  
c)Wrong identification--Vikshepa. We identify ourselves with Body/Mind   
 Jeeva Bodam- and undergo sufferings.   
d)Guru asked the students to call out numbers  
d)Indirect knowledge-Paroksha Gnanam-Guru can only give some   
 techniques to find out the Truth.Seeker has to work out the same   
e)Joy of students, when they discovered the tenth student e)Direct  
knowledge-Aparoksha Gnanam.Bliss of Self. The tenth man was   
 only a rediscovery of what was already there.We are always the Self   
 before and after realisation.When realisation dawns we regain the happy   
 state which is our Nature.   
Therefore, let us keep our attention always on the Self and be happy.

Dear tradere,   
Suppose i see a flower, a rose, say. The flower is beautiful. So when i see  
you, as a friend, i want to share the beauty of the flower with you. But you  
do not know the flower. So how do i introduce you to the flower ?   
I will have to show you the flower. .. Right? That is the only way that it is  
possible.   
Now, the "second hand quotes" are like telling "Rose is beautiful". . If you  
have not seen it, its a waste! coz whether or not the rose is beautiful. .. u  
cannot appreciate it! After some time you find it really disgusting, coz i am  
repeating the same thing and it makes no sense!   
Ok, so then, we agree we need to share the vision... i say, ok, come with me  
ill show you the rose. .. and i take you... as i walk... suddenly you turn  
away... surprised, i question you! and you say "Sir, this cannot be the way to  
roses!". Why? Coz in my school so and so person said this. ... now that is  
the first problem. you need to agree to allow me to show.   
So if these criteria are satisfied we can journey into it! and we can share a  
vision.   
Love!   
Silence

Great analogy. Except, you have not seen the flower. You have heard the  
words of someone who has seen the flower. Rather than do whatever is  
necessary to see the flower, you talk about seeing flowers. Thus the obvious  
hypocrisy. I'm a hypocrite too, but I see it. Why don't you?

Dear tradere,   
How do u say that?   
**" Rather than do whatever is necessary to see the flower, you talk about  
seeing flowers"**   
And when i offered to show the flower to you. ..   
why did you not follow this advice of yours?   
Please see. .. if you think a realized person cannot be writing in here or  
that a realized person should be in himalayas or some such place. .. eating  
nothing etc. ..   
if you have some such ideas, its was totally futile to write here. u should  
have gone to the jungles or himalayas and sought.   
now suppose you thought there could be someone here. .. may be you have met  
one ! or may be not...   
We can brand ourselves. .. we can label ourselves as hypocrites, intelligent  
people, real fools etc later. .. lets first get to the matter and try to share  
the vision. .. what do u say ?   
Love!

Dear tradere,   
Seeing a flower, not seeing a flower, seeing a flower through   
someone else or the Guru: "Who is this man? Is it not our   
ego, to find these words and elaborate on these?"   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was sitting on the Hall. Devaraja Mudaliar   
asked Him: "Bhagavan! You are telling Grace is ever flowing. How   
is that I am not able to receive the Grace? Is it not flowing to me?"   
Bhagavan Ramana smiled and then said in Tamil: "Oye! Who is   
coming in between you and the guru's grace? You please keep away   
and the Grace will flow to you!" The first "you" is the ego of the   
devotee and the second "you" is the individual devotee. For all of us, mind  
jumps out earlier than the Heart!   
Arunachala Siva.

Infact many people went to Ramana himself but returned without Realization.  
Many people lived so close to Ramana and yet involved in politics etc.   
Ramana could have given any of them silent diksha [silently reveal the Self]  
... but they were not seeing. ..   
Ramana sat there silent and ever Blissful. .. and yet they were not looking at  
him.   
its like the story of two birds illustrated in the vedanta. .. Ramana was  
seated. .. people jumped from one fruit to another. .. everytime they found a  
fruit that is bitter, they looked at Ramana, went to him and stayed there for  
some time. .. and again they would move out to seek some fruit or the other  
fruit!

Dear amiatall,   
All of us are Self Realized. What we have not been realizing   
is the fact that clouds of ignorance, Ajnana [anger, lust, hypocrisy,   
hate verbal duels to prove a point ec.,], are hiding the ever shining   
Self or the Brahman. The Forum may, perhaps, help a few serious   
seekers to have the clouds of ignorance removed. It is like removing   
the smoke by rubbing with a cloth of a glass cover of the chimney. Then the  
chimney is pure without hiding the Light within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. The chimney is full of, say one ton of smoke that it might   
take several births to complete the polishing work, since our   
polishing work is done through a small cloth which is also full   
of smoke!

Dear amiatall,   
Small cloth - I meant the mind/ego. It is small because it   
is almost nothing, as Bhagavan Ramana said on another occasion.   
The mind in insubstantial.   
Yes. The mind is the policman and the thief. The policman and   
the thief example was told by Bhagavan Ramana to highlight   
the fact, that the mind cannot comprehend the Self. Because   
the Self is beyond thinking, because ratiocination, beyond books,   
and it is comprehended by anubhava, or experience. The Self   
is Experience. All that are mental products, books, logic, thoughts   
are outside. After a deep sleep, one gets up in the morning   
and says: "I had a good sleep." No one says during the sleep that   
he slept well! All descriptions of the Self in the books are all   
thoughts. All the books are all the spitted saliva of the experiencer!   
Now how the mind can enquire the mind? There is no other go.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Ashatakam Verse 5: With the mind that is stone, the Ruby has to be discovered,   
by rubbing against the mind, another stone! The mind becomes   
the Self! The stone becomes the Ruby!   
The question of polisher and the polished comes with this   
mind grinding the mind. There is really only one. The mind, the polisher  
becomes the polished, the Ruby.   
Now we know the flame in the chimney. We know the cloth. Then what/where is  
the soot or smoke? The Self is blemishless, taintless. But the Self is  
covered by the vasanas [the latent tendencies of good and bad] coming through  
several births, which are mind products. Only this soot or the smoke has to  
be polished. For that one has to use   
the mind. Again mind rubbing the mind to find it as Ruby.   
Mani Kadainthu ena manam manam ennum kallil maru ara   
kadaiya nin arul oli mevum..... A. Ashtaakam., Verse 5.
