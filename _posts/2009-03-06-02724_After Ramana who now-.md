## After Ramana who now?  
Author: karthikeyan M       Date: March 06, 2009, 06:14:42 PM

I have visited Ramana Ashram many times, but the word Ashram echoes again and  
again in my ears saying is there a successor for Ramana who I could seek his  
blessings and teachings.   
Thanks

Dear Karthikeyan M   
I'm sure there are no formal "successors," as such.   
But do board members place any emphasis on whether there may or may not be  
living jnanis who have an "affiliation" with Sri Ramana Maharshi?   
Or do most tend to focus solely on Sri Bhagavan?   
With kind regards   
Paul

Hi Karthikeyan M and Paul, my view on the subject is that I will continue to  
try and put into practise Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings that mean something  
to me. Others will take away other teachings that mean something to them.   
Since Jnanis are 'very few and far between' or should it be . (The was for  
the understatement.) the next one that becomes known may be half way around  
the world and they might be more than decades apart or it could be the  
opposite. No one knows.   
In the meantime my view is its worth doing a little research to find a Jnani.   
Yours Sincerely.   
Paul.

Dear karthikeyan, Paul Coucher and paul,   
There is no 'after Ramana'. Bhagavan Ramana is always there as   
the One without a second. He is not living in a body, after 14th   
April 1950. And that is all. I am with the one, who does not search   
for a living Jnani and so on. The search is spurious and is not necessary, if  
one could repose faith in a particular Jnani, living   
or not living now.   
The Asrmam is run by a group of family members and is run as   
a Trust. Let us know worry whether they are Jnanis or not. They are doing a  
great service to people in India and abroad.   
Arunachala Siva.

The time - the moment when you got in touch Bhagawan (or your Guru) He  
immediately, that very moment has occupied your Self (Pravesham).   
Bhagawan always used to tell devotees that God, Guru and the Self are not  
different, they are all the same. He says, first a person prays to God to  
fulfill his desires, then a times comes when he does not pray for the  
fulfillment of his desires, but for God himself, then God appears to him in  
some form of the other, human or non human, to guide him as a Guru in answer  
to his prayers.   
Bhakthi to your Guru is just not praying alone, but for each moment, thinking  
how my Guru would have acted for this particular situation, thinking thus, one  
should introspect. As the Self is now occupied by Bhagawan, that guidance will  
definetely be there.   
Just for example, suppose, you are worried, some incident has happened, you  
are perplexed. What to do? Think about Bhagawan, how he would have dealt with  
this situation? your Self (Bhagawan) will reply to you. WHat would bhagawan  
would have done? He would remain relaxed, these incidents would not have  
affected Bhagawan. He would have just let it be. What ever happens in the end  
is for my own good only. Why to worry?   
So Bhagawan(or your Guru) is there in us, as our own Self, he will guide us!   
Listen to your inner voice, it will never misguide you, it will never tell  
lies, it always knows the truth, it always knows the right path, it knows  
everything as Bhagawan is your Self.   
Suppose somebody is angry at you? Insulting you? introspect, what would  
Bhagawan have done for such a situation? He would least care, he would be  
quiet and would handle patiently and whatever insults is being thrown at you  
will not bother you. why should it?   
This is true Guru Bhakthi   
Nagaraj

Yes. Bhakti is of two types. Bhakti for certain results to happen.   
Then, bhakti for God's sake and nothing else. Bhagavan Ramana said even  
surrenders could be partial or total. We all do partial surrenders to get  
things happen. This, after some time, becomes   
total surrender, leaving everything at God's feet. Let anything   
happen, it will be as per god's will. This is total surrender. Poorna bhakti  
and Poorna Saranagati take us to godhead.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvembavai: We shall only prostrate to your devotees' Feet.   
We shall do service only to Your devotees!   
Only such devotees have to be our husbands!   
We shall do service to them as per their wishes.   
If You could give this, we shall not see night and day!   
What if, if sun rises in any direction in the morning?   
Arunachala Siva.
