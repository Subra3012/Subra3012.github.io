## To have a near glimpse of the Brahman

Its an innate desire of every spiritual aspirant to see, feel what the Brahman  
is, here is one nice way by which on can feel, perceive the Brahman or the  
Consciousness.   
Lay down flat, breath in and out for sometimes, begin to watch your breath,  
normilise your body. now breath in a long breath and then slowly breath out  
and stay in that state without breathing as long as you are comfortable. now  
look within, stay flat, don't move an inch, no matter whatever discomfort you  
feel, remember that all the disscomfiture is not yours but your body's. You  
can perceive your heart beats. stay motionless. keep observing within.   
Now, apart from the heart beat, (whatever else is there is the Real YOU) there  
will be some other thing that is alive and sharp, it's you, this is  
Consciouness. You are this, you are not your body, not your heart, not your  
legs, hands, and all other organs. Not even your eyes, if you observe, you  
will be looking within NOT throught your eyes, you are looking withing through  
your conscioussness, you don't need those pair of eyes here.   
This is just a peek into the eternal Consciousness. You will see that you are  
totally different from your body and all other perceiving objects.   
Sri Ramana

Close your eye - that is Brahman that is inside you   
Open your eye - that is Brahman that is outside you   
You are a part from Brahman and you merge to Brahman ' as long as atma stays  
in a person he is experiencing Brahman.

Dear karthikeyan,   
Most of us, Ramana devotees, get that glimpse for a trice.   
To stay permanently in the Self, as Bhagavan Ramana did   
when He was just 16 years, in Madurai, we need that great   
Guru's help, the Sun, the Son of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Good technique. I think this is what happens during Pranayama and Shavasana  
also during Yoga practices. Once we learn to listen to our own breathing and  
gradually take control of it (or become conscious of it), our mind also  
queitens down and we begin to see ourself for what we really are. So Hatha  
yoga coupled with the "Who Am I" enquiry does benefit us by speeding us to  
the truth.   
Some saints, like Sri Ramana & Sri Ramakrishna, totally ignored health of  
their bodies and concentrated only on enquiry and bhakti kind of worships.  
Whereas some others such as Swami Sivananda, Yogananda Paramahamsa and some  
new age Gurus emphasize on doing Hatha yoga practises to help the body support  
our sadhana. It could be different for different people, but why this opposite  
approach? Didn't in olden yugas like Satya and Tretha, people lived healthily  
and wealthily(!) for long and attain moksha? Why this "starve the body" kind  
of approach in an age when we already have lots of problems? Both Sankara and  
Vivekananda left their bodies in their thirties, imagine what they could have  
done if only they had lived long (many more people could have been benefited).  
Just my thoughts.

Dear Mohan,   
I feel we can't say people in earlier yugas "Starved", but you see, the body  
requires its fuel in the form of food and water, but how much is required is  
something which needs to be thought about. Sri Ramana Maharshi had just  
handful of food in the afternoon and thats it, he just had a cup of coffee in  
the evening and thats all. His intake was only minimal, the body just  
requires that much. Because of his realisation, he knew how much is enough.  
Another point is that most of us, definitely eat more than required and its  
mostly impelled by our tongue, we eat for taste more than for body.   
But we don't have answers for several mysteries, like why Shankara,  
Vivekananda lived only 30 - 40 years. Elders say that once they finish their  
reason for their coming down here, they depart. But we don't know. Mysteries  
are best left as mysteries! Where as saints like Chandrashekhara Saraswathi of  
Kanchi Math lived for 100 years, I have heard of many siddhars living in  
Tiruvannamalai who are more than 100+ years....   
Elders have said Sadhana has been changing from ages to ages. In Kali Yuga,  
Very tough and vigorous Tapas during Treta Yoga, Sacrifice and Yajnas during  
Dwapara Yuga and simply Nama Smarana during Kalli Yuga....   
For example, definitely whatever Dharma prevailed some 400 years back, same  
quality of Dharma would have deteriorated 200 years back and we can't say same  
Dharma prevails now as it was some 200 years back... similarly, we cant say  
today's Dharma to prevail some 100 years afterwards.   
Really in such complicated life as today's who could have understood the  
Brahma Tattva of Vedanta and of Shankara in age of Commerce, Computers and  
only money.... If not for Sri Ramana Maharshi advent on Earth, Vedanta would  
have diminished drastically. Ramana Maharshi's inflluence is far wide than it  
is grasped. Even people of other maths and saints in North India and others  
even if they don't know who Ramana Maharshi is, they still talk and teach  
their students about this "I" which Ramana Preached. He simplified the Brahma  
Jnanam just by 3 simple Statements - "Who am I"   
Glory be to Ramana. What Ramana has done will stand like a thousand fold  
pillar for many Yugas to come. He will and is the SUN for aspirants at all  
times all Yugas.

One more way that flashed to me today to have a glimpse of Brahman is this -  
In night or in day, just cover all the windows with really dark curtain so  
that not a dot of light comes in. Let there be absolute silence. not even fan  
running. Just sit still in darkness. what can we see? abosolutely nothing.  
Blank, Darkness. we cant even see our own body, we cant see our own self we  
cant see anything.   
Now see who is seeing, your body also cant be seen, but somebody is seeing.  
even thoughts reduce, it does not jump like monkey.   
This when you observe is "I" consciousness, it is even something behind your  
thoughts for it can see even thoughts.

Dear Nagaraj and others,   
Yes. In the earlier centuries, even amidst plenty, people   
took only very little food just to keep the mind away from   
sleep due to over-eating. When the mind is alert, it would   
be helpful to do Sadhana.   
Even Jnani lived a particular number of years according   
to their will. Prarabdha had no say in that matter with   
regard to them. Tiru Jnana Sambandhar lived only 16 years.   
Ramana lived for 70 years. Sankara lived 32 years and so   
was Manikkavachagar. Kanchi Chandraskehara Saraswati   
lived for 100 years.   
Arunachala Siva.
