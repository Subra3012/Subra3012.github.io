The pupils of the Tendai school used to study meditation even before   
Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised   
one another to observe seven days of silence.   
On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun auspiciously.   
But when night came, and the oil lamps were growing dim, one of the   
pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: "Fix those lamps!"   
The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. He remarked: " We are not supposed to say a word."   
The third then asked: " You two are stupid. Why are you talking?"   
The fourth one then said with a beaming smile: " I am the only one   
who has not talked!"   
Bhagavan Ramana has said that True Silence is the silence of the mind!

## The Concept of Soma Skanda  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 08, 2009, 08:30:36 AM  
---  
We have all seen the bronze icon of Siva-Skanda-Parvati, in Siva   
temples. This is called Somaskanda. Sa + Uma + Skanda, the icon   
where Skanda is in between Soma (Siva) and Parvati (Uma). This   
is the family.   
The appearance of Somaskanda icon is of later origin. In the earliest   
Siva temples, this was not there. There is one temple in Madurai, called   
Immaiyil Inbam Nalhuvar, temple, where Siva is supposed to give happiness  
during this birth itself, without waiting for our next birth.   
Here, behind Sivalinga, there is a Somaskanda icon.   
The first one who sings about Somaskanda is Tiruvnavukkarasar, one of the  
great four Saiva Saints. He says in his Tevaram: Nam Kadambanai   
Petraval Banginan... meaning, the One who is the consort of one who   
has given birth to Muruga, the wearer of Kadamba flower garlands.   
Sundaramoorthy also sings in his song: "Ponnar Meniyane Pul tholai   
arai kisaithu..... about the concept of Somaskanda. This song was   
composed in a place called Tirumazhapadi.   
The reason why Saiva poets brought in this concept is that during   
4th to 5th Century, Jainas and Buddhists had a sway in Tamil Nadu   
and they were propagating the idea of celibacy to everyone to reach   
Godhead. Saivites thought that this was too much and advocated that   
even householders can attain Siva's Abode, through the prescribed   
dharma for them. To point out that even Siva is a householder, Adi   
Kutumbini, they brought about the concept of Soma-Skanda-Uma.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam, that "Siva is the Master   
of the chakra holding Vishnu, and the father of Velan, the spear holding   
Muruga. Azhiyan Nadan Nal Velan Thathai....Tiur Porchunnam v.3   
Arunachala Siva.

Joshu went to a place where a monk had retired to meditate and   
asked him: "What is, is what?"   
The monk raised his fist.   
Joshu replied: "Ships cannot remain where the water is too shallow."   
And he left.   
A few days later, Joshu went again to visit the monk and asked   
the same question.   
The monk answered the same way.   
Joshu said: "Well given, well taken, well killed, well saved."   
And he bowed to the monk.   
Mummon's Comments: The raised first was the same both times.   
Why is it Joshu did not admit the first and approved the second one.   
Where is the fault?   
Whoever answers this know that Joshu tongue has no bone so he   
can use it freely. Yet perhaps, Joshu is wrong. Or, through the monk,   
he may have discovered his mistake.   
If anyone thinks that the one's insight exceeds the other's, he   
has no eyes.   
The light if the eyes is as a comet,   
And Zen's activity is as lightning.   
The sword that kills the man   
Is the sword that saves the man.

A monk named Seizei asked Sozan: " Seizei is alone and poor.   
Will you give him supper?"   
Sozan asked Seizi: "Seizei?"   
Seizei responded: "Yes, sir."   
Sozan said: "You have Zen, the best wine in China, and have already   
finished three cups, and still you are saying that they did not even   
wet your lips."   
Mummon's Comments: Seizei overplayed his hand. Why was it so?   
Because Sozan had eye and knew with whom to deal. Even so,   
I want to ask: "At what point did Sezei drink wine?"   
The poorest man in China,   
The bravest man in China,   
He bravely sustains himself.   
Yet wish to rivel the wealthiest.

## Arudra Darsanam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 10, 2009, 06:08:53 AM  
---  
Today is the day of Arudra Darsanam, the day in Dhanur month,   
in the asterism of Arudra, Nataraja, the Dancing God of Chidambaram,   
performs the Ananda Tandava. It was on this day, when Siva went   
to Daruka forest and conferred the upadesa of Jnana, to the sages   
of Daruka forest, who were following karma marga, thinking that   
karmas (actions, rituals, sacrifices) alone would confer liberation.   
Siva went there as Bhikshatana, the beggar going for alms, with   
Sivakamavalli (Paravati). Seeing his arresting beauty, the wives of   
sages lost their balance, and with lustful eyes and food in their arms,   
they came out of the cottages to give alms to Siva. The sages got   
angry, chanted mantras and poured ghee in the sacrificial fire and   
sent those abhichara mantras towards Siva for harming. They sent a   
tiger, then an elephant and then a dwarf demon called Apasmara to   
kill Siva. Siva conquered them all and then showed his Dance of Bliss   
to them! In Chidambaram this festival is celebrated very early in   
the morning, around 6 am and Nataraja comes out for people's darshan.   
The Chidambara Mahatmayam, describes this dance of Siva. I am giving   
a few lines of David Smith from his book the Dance of Siva.   
Then to Parvati, the Lord said   
'Drink the essence of this Tandava,'   
and He commanded Nandikesavara,   
'O bull enjoy.'   
And then he sage-bulls   
who had been stupefied were humble   
and said 'O Siva! O Sankara! O God!'   
........   
........   
The Sambhu was splendid in the dance,   
His eyes dancing with compassion,   
purifying the forest with the lustre of His gentle smile.   
To destroy the sin   
that they had accumulated in life after life,   
He showed that auspicious foot that was slightly curved.   
Through the compassion of the God of Gods,   
those ascetics saw the festival for their eyes   
that is the divine Tandava Dance of Supreme Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

A travelling monk asked an old woman the road to Taizan, a popular   
temple supposed to give wisdom to the one who worships there.   
The old woman said: "Go straight ahead." When the monk proceeded   
a few steps, she said to herself: "He also is a common churchgoer."   
Someone told this incident to Joshu, who said: "Wait until I investigate."   
The next day, he went and asked the same question, and the old woman   
gave the same answer.   
Joshu remarked: "I have investigated the old woman."   
Mummon's Comments: The old woman understood how war is planned,   
but she did not know how spies sneak in behind her tent. Old Joshu   
played the spy's work and turned the tables on her, but he was not an   
able general. Both had their faults. Now I want to ask you: What was   
the point of Joshu investigating the old woman?   
When the question is common   
The answer is also common   
When the question is sand in a bowl of boiled rice   
The answer is stick in the soft mud.

The high priest Tsu-an was a commoner by birth. He was a selfless   
man, upright and honest. Not only did he study Zen, he was also   
well versed in all the genteel arts of the tea ceremony, incense   
compounding, flower arranging, and so on. Tsu-an also studied   
medicine. He developed a method to convert the polluted water   
into potable water.   
Tsu-an died in the year 1750 at the age of eighty. At noon of the day,   
he passed away. He felt his own pulse and declared that his life   
would end before the hour was up. As it turned out, he actually died   
within the hour, leaving behind this parting verse: The original religion   
is realized without beginning   
As my eyes close for ever,   
my essence is true emptiness.

Bassui wrote the following letter to one of his disciples, who   
was about to die: "The essence of your mind* is not born, so it will never die. It   
is not an existence, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness   
which is a mere void. It has neither colour nor form. It enjoys   
no pleasures and suffers no pains.   
"I know you are very ill. Like a good Zen student, you are facing   
the sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering,   
but question yourself: What is the essence of this mind? Think only   
of this. You will need no more. Covet nothing. Your end which is   
endless is as a snowflake dissolving in pure air."

## Siva Mahimnah Stotram - 1  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 12, 2009, 08:13:34 AM  
---  
Today is Swami Vivkekananda' birthday. He used to chant this Siva   
Mahimnah Storam often with accompanying music. Sri Ramakrishna   
once attained Samadhi by chanting this poem. This is written by   
one Pushpadanta. It is a poem full of praise to Siva, his greatness   
beyond the three gods and his valour.   
Verse 5: To fulfil what desire, having what body, what instruments,   
support, and materials does the creator indeed create the three worlds?   
This kind of vain argumentation with regard to Thee -- whose Divine   
nature is beyond the reach of intellect makes the perverted vociferous   
to the delusion of mankind.   
Verse 7: There are different paths (of realization) as enjoined by the   
three Vedas, Sankhya, Yoga, Pasupata doctrine and Vaishnava Sastras.   
Persons following different paths -- straight or crooked -- according   
as they consider that this path is best or that one is proper, due to   
differences in temperaments, reach Thee alone just as river enters

Verse 8: O Giver of boons! A great bull, a wooden club, an axe, a tiger   
skin, (holy) ashes, a human skull and the like -- these are Thy sole   
possessions, though by the mere casting of eyes, Thou gave to gods,   
great treasures, which they enjoy. Indeed, the image of sense-objects   
cannot delude one whose delight is in the Self.   
Verse 10: O Girisa! Brahma trying above and Vishnu trying below,   
failed to measure Thee who took the form of a pillar of fire. Afterwards,   
when they praised Thee with great devotion and faith, Thou revealing   
Thyself to them of Thy own accord, indicating whether Thy worhsip   
can go without bearing result.   
Verse 14: O Three-eyed ONe, it is not that the dark stain on the throat   
of Thee who drank poison as an act of mercy to gods and demons at   
their being panicky at the threatened destruction of the universe all   
on a sudden, has not beautified Thee. Even deformity is admirable in   
one who is given to freeing the world of fear.

The layman Sasaki Doppu studied Zen with Ganseki. He later recounted   
how he had asked his teacher, "What is Buddha?" Ganseki replied: The good heart is Buddha."   
The layman added, "What is most basic in the human world is a good   
heart. Therefore the normal mind is called the Way."   
He also expressed these ideas in a verse on Shinto, the Spirit Religion: The defilement known as taboo   
is made up by the human mind;   
people who know the divine mind   
are themselves divine.   
He also wrote: The sun my eyes,   
the sky my face,   
my breath the wind,   
mountains and rivers   
turn out to be me.

## Siva Mahimnah Stotram - 1  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 12, 2009, 08:13:34 AM

Today is Swami Vivkekananda' birthday. He used to chant this Siva   
Mahimnah Storam often with accompanying music. Sri Ramakrishna   
once attained Samadhi by chanting this poem. This is written by   
one Pushpadanta. It is a poem full of praise to Siva, his greatness   
beyond the three gods and his valour.   
Verse 5: To fulfil what desire, having what body, what instruments,   
support, and materials does the creator indeed create the three worlds?   
This kind of vain argumentation with regard to Thee -- whose Divine   
nature is beyond the reach of intellect makes the perverted vociferous   
to the delusion of mankind.   
Verse 7: There are different paths (of realization) as enjoined by the   
three Vedas, Sankhya, Yoga, Pasupata doctrine and Vaishnava Sastras.   
Persons following different paths -- straight or crooked -- according   
as they consider that this path is best or that one is proper, due to   
differences in temperaments, reach Thee alone just as river enters   
the ocean.   
Verse 8: O Giver of boons! A great bull, a wooden club, an axe, a tiger   
skin, (holy) ashes, a human skull and the like -- these are Thy sole   
possessions, though by the mere casting of eyes, Thou gave to gods,   
great treasures, which they enjoy. Indeed, the image of sense-objects   
cannot delude one whose delight is in the Self.   
Verse 10: O Girisa! Brahma trying above and Vishnu trying below,   
failed to measure Thee who took the form of a pillar of fire. Afterwards,   
when they praised Thee with great devotion and faith, Thou revealing   
Thyself to them of Thy own accord, indicating whether Thy worhsip   
can go without bearing result.   
Verse 14: O Three-eyed ONe, it is not that the dark stain on the throat   
of Thee who drank poison as an act of mercy to gods and demons at   
their being panicky at the threatened destruction of the universe all   
on a sudden, has not beautified Thee. Even deformity is admirable in   
one who is given to freeing the world of fear.

Verse 16: In order to save the world, when Thou danced, the earth   
wondered at the striking of Thy feet, whether it would not come to   
a sudden end; so felt the spatial region along with the planets, oppressed   
by the movement of Thy iron-cub-like arms; and the heaven became   
then miserable -- its side being struck by Thy waving matted locks.   
Ah, Thy very mighiness is the cause of trouble!   
Verse 18: When Thou wanted to burn the three cities (Tripura),   
which were but a piece of straw (to Thee), the earth was Thy   
chariot, Brahma Thy charioteer, the great mountain Meru, Thy bow,   
the sun and the moon the wheels of Thy chariot, Vishnu, Thy arrow   
\-- why this paraphernalia? The Lord is not dependent on others.   
He was playing with things at His command.   
Verse 19: O Destroyer of Tripura, Hari rooted out his lotus-eye   
(to make up for the deficiency) when one flower was missing in   
his offering of a thousand lotuses to Thy feet. This great devotion   
transformed into a discus (Sudarsana Chakra) is alert in proecting   
the devotees in this world.   
Verse 21: Thou Giver of refuge! Even the sacrifice where Daksha,   
the Lord of creation, expert in sacrifices, was the sacrificer, Rishis   
were priests, gods were supervisors, was destroyed by Thee, (though   
Thou are) bent upon giving fruits of the sacrifices. Surely, the sacrifice   
causes injury to the sacrificers in the absence of devotion.   
Verse 23: O Destoryer of Tripura! O Giver of boons! Even on seeing   
in front the god of love, bow in hand, burnt like a piece of straw in   
a trice by Thee, if Uma, proud of her beauty, thinks that Thou art   
under her fascination, because, she was allowed to occupy half of   
Thy body, on account of her austerities, ah, surely the young women are under  
delusion!   
Verse 25: Thou art indeed that unspeakable truth which the Yogis   
realize through meditation on the Self, on controlling the breath   
according to the scriptural directions, and realizing which they shed   
tears of thrilling joy, and swimming, as it were, in a pool of nectar,   
enjoy inner bliss.

Kaigen championed the neglected study of Buddhist and Zen   
lierature in the middle of the nineteenth century. Many people   
thought he was just a scholar, not realizing that he was an enlightened   
Zen Master.   
Kaigen first studied scriptural Buddhism with the great Zen Master   
Sengai. Later he studied Zen meditation with Seisetsu and Tankai.   
At one point Kaigen went to Kyoto to study at the academics of the   
other schools of Buddhism. Disturbed by what he found, he wrote: At the Fifth Avenue bridge,   
I turn my head and look;   
east, west, south, north,   
ignorant monks are many!   
Later on, Zen Master Doukon explained: "Poeple of the time all   
considered Kaigen to be widely learned, with a powerful memory.   
And it is true.   
"However, he also had three Zen teachers and found out the innermost   
secrets of Zen, finally receiving the seal of approval from Zen Master   
Tankai. People of his time thought that Kaigen was a teacher of doctrinal   
Buddhism, but that was not his reality.   
"What Kaigen was worried about was that there were many Zen followers with  
sterile intellects and few who understood the principles of the Teaching. It  
was because of this that he concentrated on preaching literary Zen, in order  
to develop and guide young seekers.   
"Kaigen's attention was focussed on rescuing people from the decadence of the  
times. He didn't have time to pay any mind to other things. This is  
precisely what made him great."

Settan became a monk when he was only ten years old. One day he   
decided to go travelling to find a real guide, and he asked his mentor  
permission to leave. His master refused.   
Determined to find the Way, Settan decided to go without telling anyone.  
Hanginga note on the temple gate saying, "Unless I attain the Way, I will  
never enter this gateway again!", he left.   
Finding his way to the congregation of Zen Master Torin, Settan sat in  
meditation, day and night. Torin was one of the few enlightened teachers left  
in those days, and his method was stern and unpredictable.   
One day Settan finally decided he had no more time to waste. Climbling up to  
the top of a building, he veered that he would not come down alive unless he  
attained enlightenment that night.   
Sitting in deep meditation, all through the night, by dawn Settan still had  
not broken through. Getting up in disguist, he went to the railing to jump  
off the building to his death.   
All of a sudden, just as he was abot to step over, he heard a cock crow.   
At that moment Settan's mind opened up, and he was greaty enlightened.   
Overwhelmed with joy, Settan hurried to the teacher. When Master   
Torin saw him, at once he affirmed: "You have broken through!"

## Siva Mahimnah Stotram - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 13, 2009, 08:17:45 AM

Pushpadanta says: Verse 2: Thy greatness is beyond the reach of mind and speech. Who will (duly)  
praise That which even the Vedas describe with trepidation, by the method of  
'Not this', 'Not this' \-- how many qualties does That possess?   
and can be perceived whom? Yet to the form taken later, whose mind and speech  
do not turn?   
Verse 15: O Lord, the god of love whose arrows do not fail anywhere in the  
world of gods, demons, and men but are always successful, became   
an object of memory merely by looking upon Thee as an ordinary god.   
For an insult to the self controlled, does not conduce to good.   
Verse 20: The sacrifices* being destroyed, Thou ever remained the connecting  
link between the sacrificers and the fruit of the sacrifice. When does the  
destroyed sacrifice bear fruit, if not accompanied by the worship of the  
Lord?** Therefore knowing Thee to be the giver of fruits   
and puttin faith in the Vedas, people become resolute about the performance of  
sacrificial rites.   
(* In Daruka forests, the sages were doing sacrifices and their egos got   
bloated and they were telling that sacrifices alone would give fruits  
including liberation. Siva then appeared before them as a beggar with   
Uma. The wives of sages became enthralled with the beauty of Siva and they  
were going behind Him. The minds of sages also got infatuated with the beauty  
of Uma. Then, getting angry the sages sent out a tiger, an elephant and then  
a apasmara, a dwarf demon, representation of agglomeration of sins. Siva  
killed the tiger and wore its skin as his loincloth and killed the elephant  
and wore its skin as His upper robe,   
kept the apasmara, the demon under His right leg and danced!   
He then told the sages about the sublimity of Jnana Marga and advised that  
mere karmas by themselves would not bear fruit without devotion to the God,  
who is the giver of boons/fruits. This is also the meaning of the first verse  
of Bhagavan Ramana's Upadesa Saram.   
Verse 22: O Lord, the fury of Thee who became a hunter with a bow in hand,  
has not left Brahma thogh, keenly peirced by Thy arrow, and   
terror stricken, he wanted to feel to the heavens.

Joso the Buddhist monk was a student of the famous haiku master   
Basho. His religious practices and attainments were generally kept   
secret, and he was mostly known as a poet.   
After unsuccessfully trying to become a samurai warrior, he freed himself from  
wordly affairs to become a Zen monk. After the death of his teacher   
Basho, he led a secluded life in a cave. He wrote Buddhist scriptures on   
pebbles with one Chinese letter for each pebble and piled them up into a  
traditional Scripture Mound.   
In commomeration of the occasion of his retirement from the world,   
Joshu composed this poem in formal Chinese style: Having carried its house   
on its back for years   
a snail turns into a slug   
and thereby gains its freedom.   
In the burning houses,   
his greatest fear   
was that his spit would dry;   
Now seeking the rain of religion   
he enters a forested hill.

Zobo pursued only literary studies before someone warned him that   
was not the way to ultimate truth. Then he went to a Zen master   
and learned contemplate on emptiness. It took a long time for Zobo   
to attain realization. Eventually, he got to the point where he was so   
absorbed in concentration that he forgot to eat and sleep. Oneday   
when he was sleeping due to utter exhaustion, his master struck him   
to wake him up and all at once he realized enlightenment.   
Zobo was not even sixty years old when he passed away in 1840.   
On the brink of death, he wrote a final verse.   
Zobo at sixty! Here is his real estate: When eight clouds are standing, I piss at the sky.   
It is a wonder, and a pity too,   
I did not kill all the imitation Zen in the world.

For the past twenty-odd years I have read S. S. Cohen's English translation of  
the Srimad Bhagavata and found it to be an invaluable source of both spiritual  
and day-to-day guidance.   
This work, along with Tripura Rahasya and Advaita Bodha Deepika, was  
recommended by Bhagavan for those who found difficulty in understanding His  
teachings.   
For those who are unfamiliar with this work, you can find extracts on this  
website under the News and Articles section - go to: http://www.arunachala-

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.   
 **Prostrations to the Lotus Feet of our Beloved Bhagawan**

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.
