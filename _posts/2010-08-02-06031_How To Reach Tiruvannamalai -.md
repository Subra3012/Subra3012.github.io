**That man [Ramana] was sitting there. From his very presence I felt "What!  
This man -- how can he help me? This fellow who is reading comic  
strips,cutting vegetables, playing with this, that or the other -- how can  
this man help me? He can't help me." Anyway, I sat there.   
Nothing happened; I looked at him, and he looked at me. "In his presence you  
feel silent, your questions disappear, his look changes you" \-- all that  
remained a story,fancy stuff to me. I sat there. There were a lot of questions  
inside, silly questions -- so, "The questions have not disappeared.**   
I have been sitting here for two hours, and the questions are still there. All  
right, let me ask him some questions" \-- because at that time I very much  
wanted moksha.   
This part of my background, moksha, I wanted. "You are supposed to be a  
liberated man" \-- I didn't say that. "Can you give me what you have?" \-- I  
asked him this question, but that man didn't answer, so after some lapse of  
time I repeated that question -- **" I am asking 'Whatever you have, can you  
give it to me?'"   
He said, "I can give you, but can you take it?"** Boy! For the first time this  
fellow says that he has something and that I can't take it.Nobody before had  
said "I can give you," but this man said "I can give you, but can you take  
it?"   
Then I said to myself "If there is any individual in this world who can take  
it, it is me, because I have done so much sadhana, seven years of sadhana. He  
can think that I can't take it, but I can take it. If I can't take it, who can  
take it?" \- -- that was my frame of mind at the time -- you know, (Laughs) I  
was so confident of myself.   
 **I didn 't stay with him, I didn't read any of his books, so I asked him a  
few more questions: "Can one be free sometimes and not free sometimes?" He  
said "Either you are free, or you are not free at all." There was another  
question which I don't remember.  
He answered in a very strange way: "There are no steps leading you to that." But I ignored all these things.These  
questions didn't matter to me -- the answers didn't interest me at all. **But  
this question "Can you take it?". .. "How arrogant he is!" \-- that was my  
feeling.   
Although he felt Ramanaâs responses were arrogant, he nevertheless resolved  
to try to attain Ramanaâs state of being.

Perhaps UGK had not taken a vessel that was not fit enough to take Bhagavan 's  
grace and teachings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Even N.R KrishnaMurthy Iyer had simililar kind of feelings for the initial  
moments when he met Guru ramana for the first time.   
But guru ramana's grace his attitude was changed.

Kamsa, the uncle of Sri Krishna was always worried about how to get rid of the  
eighth child of his imprisoned sister Devaki, who was destined to kill him as  
per the akasha-vani (voice from the sky). As the birth of the eight child  
approached Kamsa started getting visions of Sri Vishnu which made him  
sleepless and restless.   
Devarshi Narada seeing the state of Kamsa asked Sri Krishna: "My Lord, it is said that anyone who thinks of you attains you. Now Kamsa  
seems to be thinking of you continuously, will he also attain you?"   
Sri Krishna smiled and replied: "Yes".   
Devarshi Narada then asked: "Then what is the difference between a devotee and  
Kamsa if both of them are going to attain you?"   
Sri Krishna smiled and replied: "A person attains me according to his bhava. A  
devotee thinks of me as God, so he will attain me as God; Kamsa thinks of me  
as enemy, so he will attain me accordingly."   
A person who has the bhava of God in a neem tree will feel it as divine.   
Another person who has the bhava of wood in a neem tree will get only wood.   
This is Shraddha. Infinity is pervaded underlying everything.   
A person attains as per his Shraddha.   
One of the main message of Swami Vivekananda was to awaken the Shraddha in  
ourselves.

Dear silentgreen,   
Very true.   
Krishna says that any bhava intense enough towards him will take   
that person to his Abode.   
Krodha - hate - Sisubala and Hiranyakasyap   
Bhaya - fear - Kamsa and Duryodhana   
Kama - lust - Gopikas and one Chandrika who was a hunchback and an incense  
seller.   
Prema - pure love - Rukmini and Satyabama   
 [heard in a discourse]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anil,   
**   
If you come to Chennai, you have to again catch a train to Tindivanam and  
alight and then catch another train to Tiruvannamalai. From T'malai Railway  
Station, you have to take   
an autorickshaw and come to the Asramam.   
It is better to catch a bus which takes you directly to Tiruvannamalai from  
Chennai. But from Chennai Central Railway Station, you have to come to  
Koyambedu Bus Stand, which is about 12 kms. You can cover by auto. Speak  
English. Not many understand Hindi in Tamizh Nadu.   
If you can afford, you can come directly by taxi up to the Asramam, for which  
charges would be Rs 2000+ one way.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anil,   
Yes. Katpadi is definitely closer to Tiruvannamalai than Chennai   
or Bangalore. You can alight at Katpadi and catch a bus and come   
to Tiruvannamalai. It may take about 3+ hours. Taxis may also   
be plying from Katpadi to Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.
