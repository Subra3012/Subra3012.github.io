## A Dream

Last night I saw a dream: I am in Sri Ramana Ashram; a much smaller and  
informal set up. I was sitting in a corner. The environ was pious but nothing  
similar to what I saw during my solitary visit to the Ashram way back in  
1992/93. However, there was a temple of Lord Krishna attached to the Ashram.  
Some people came up lovingly towards me and asked me to prostrate at the  
temple. I did it faithfully. Sudeenly, I saw in my mind a similar  
ashram/temple in another place closer to my own area. This one was even  
smaller but it was not primarily of Bhagwan Sri Ramana. it was of Swami  
Yogananda but in the dream I felt a deep inner incling which kept reaasuring  
me that both were same.   
I see many dreams but hardly remember any one of them. This one was also lost  
as I woke up but it strangely came back with assuring happy feelings when I  
was practicing my daily pranayam and prayers.   
I made it a point to write it here but without any specific purpose or  
enquiry!``

Dear ghosh,   
Such good dreams are happy auguries. Many times, such dreams   
give us new insights.   
Arunachala Siva.
