Dear non duel, It is quite sometime, since we heard from you.   
Today's menu is Kothavariakai Kootu. Kothavaraikai is called   
Indian culster beans. It is narrower in size than the regular   
beans, with a needle like top. It is more tasty.   
Cut kothavarai kai into small pieces, after throwing away the   
neddle tops. Keep them in a basin of water. Take a pan,   
put tamarind paste and water and boil it. Add required salt,   
coriander and asafoetiday. When it is boiling, mix the cut pieces   
of kothavarai kai and stir and boil it further till the whole thing   
becomes a thick gravy. Put off the burner. Take separately,   
a pan, put gingeley oil, mustard seeds, bengal gram and toor dhal   
heat the mixture, till mustard seeds start bursting. Put off the   
burner and add the mixture to the thick gravy. Add coriander   
and curry leaves and stir thoroughly.   
Kothavarai kai kootu is ready. This can be taken with rice or   
bread.   
Arunachala Siva.

One day Bhagawan is doing Girivalayam and he is alone.Some illeterate people  
prompted one teen aged boy to hold Bhagawan's feet tightly and to tell him   
he wont leave the feet unless he confers moksha to him.Bhagawan jokularly said  
first you have to give me moksha by leaving my feet and my moksha is in your  
hands   
now.The boy laughed and left the feet of Bhagawan.

Dear Dr. Raju, There is a simlar story. Once a visitor pestered   
Bhagavan, by repeating: Give me power to realize like Ramakrishna   
gave to Vivekananda. Bhagavan said after a while: All right.   
I shall give you. But, are have prepared yourself like Vivekananda.   
Tell me. The visitor thought for a while and left quietly! Again,   
one Western lady came to Bhagavan in a hurry, and exclaimed   
"Bhagavan, give me salvation, give me salvation!" Bhagavan,   
as usual, kept quiet. After a while, the lady repeated: Give   
me salvation, I have to catch a train now!" Bhagavan did not   
say anything and she left. After that, Bhagavan said: "She is   
thinking that she can get salvation, as she purchases some grocery,   
in the stores!"   
Arunachala Siva.
