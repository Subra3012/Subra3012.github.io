One day Bhagawan is doing Girivalayam and he is alone.Some illeterate people  
prompted one teen aged boy to hold Bhagawan's feet tightly and to tell him   
he wont leave the feet unless he confers moksha to him.Bhagawan jokularly said  
first you have to give me moksha by leaving my feet and my moksha is in your  
hands   
now.The boy laughed and left the feet of Bhagawan.

Dear Dr. Raju, There is a simlar story. Once a visitor pestered   
Bhagavan, by repeating: Give me power to realize like Ramakrishna   
gave to Vivekananda. Bhagavan said after a while: All right.   
I shall give you. But, are have prepared yourself like Vivekananda.   
Tell me. The visitor thought for a while and left quietly! Again,   
one Western lady came to Bhagavan in a hurry, and exclaimed   
"Bhagavan, give me salvation, give me salvation!" Bhagavan,   
as usual, kept quiet. After a while, the lady repeated: Give   
me salvation, I have to catch a train now!" Bhagavan did not   
say anything and she left. After that, Bhagavan said: "She is   
thinking that she can get salvation, as she purchases some grocery,   
in the stores!"   
Arunachala Siva.
