## Disturbing News

I have been reading in the Indian newspapers that the government is planning  
to start an iron ore mine at Kavuthi Malai and Vediappan Malai. These places  
are on the girivalam route. Is this even a possibility? I cannot even imagine  
what inconveniences, devotees and other pilgrims will have to face, if this  
project goes through.   
This project is going to uproot farmers from 10 villages. The farmers have  
been strongly protesting as per the newspapers.   
Is there anything which we as devotees can do, or voice our opinions in this  
matter.

Dear Disciple,   
I also saw a TV programme on the issue of iron ore mining in   
Vediappan Malai. Jindal is trying to get approval from Government.   
Fortunately, for the present, after obtaining the public opinion of   
the villagers in and around, about 20000 people, the Government   
has postponed the decision to give approval to Jindal. The proposed   
iron ore mining, will affect the eco system of the villages and the villagers'  
lives. It will cause break in the girivalam route to an   
extent of 1.5. kms and government will have to lay new road,   
a diversion route, for this stretch. We can only hope and pray that   
this project should not come through. Bhagavan Ramana will   
take care.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian R.,   
I am very glad to hear that the government has postponed giving the permission  
to Jindal company. I hope and pray that the government never gives permission  
for this project.   
In today's papers I read that the Environment Law Alliance World Wide (E-Law)  
US and also our local forest officials have said that the area is ecologically  
fragile and would be ironical for anyboby to say that it is not.   
As you have rightly mentioned let us leave it to Bhagvan, and by his grace the  
ecology and the sanctity of the area will be preserved.   
Om Shri Ramana.
