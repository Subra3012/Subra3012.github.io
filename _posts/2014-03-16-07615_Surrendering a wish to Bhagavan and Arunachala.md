Pardon my audacity dear friends, but i heard this song from a movie and i  
couldn't help but relate it to our beloved Arunachala -   
Kinna Sohna Yaar Heere Vekh Di Nazaara (x2)   
What a beautiful scenery Heer is looking at   
(Heer is looking at her beloved Ranjha)   
Ranjha Mera Ranjha   
O my Ranjha (lover)   
(The above couple of lines are referring to Heer-Ranjha,   
a famous romantic couple in Indian History, similar to Romeo-Juliet)   
Manjha Chaar Da Bechaara   
The poor guy is resting on the bed   
O Ranjha, Mera Ranjha (x4)   
O Ranjha, my Ranjha   
Main Heer Haan Teri   
I?m Your Heer   
Main Peedh Haan Teri   
I?m Your partner (life-partner)   
Je Tu Baddal Kaala   
If You are a black cloud   
Main Neer Haan Teri   
I?m the water (that rains)   
Kar Jaaniye Ranjhe   
I?ll do it Ranjha   
Ho Darr Jaaniye Ranjhe   
If I feel scared Ranjha   
Ho Burro Teri Ya Socha   
If I think bad about You   
Mar Jaaniye Ranjhe   
I?ll die Ranjha   
Mera Ranjha Main Ranjhe Di   
Ranjha is mine, I?m Ranjha?s   
Ranjha Hai Chit Chor   
Ranjha is a heart stealer   
Je Karke Woh Mil Jaaye Ta   
I want to achieve/attain him whatever happens   
Ki Chahinda Hai Haur   
What more do I need?   
O Mera Mera Ranjha   
O my Ranjha!   
O Ranjha, Mera Ranjha (x3)   
O Ranjha, my Ranjha   
Teri Aan Haan Ranjhe   
You are my honour Ranjha   
Teri Shaan Haan Ranjhe   
You are my pride Ranjha   
Dil Vich Maiyyo Tadka   
In my heart-beats there lies   
Teri Jaan Haan Ranjhe   
Your soul Ranjha   
Ki Kara Sukkan Lagiya   
I feel very happy   
Ho Mora Mukkan Lagiya   
I feel complete now as   
Ho Mainu Mil Gaya Ranjha   
I?ve achieved my Ranjha   
Nabz Haan Rukkad Lagiya   
And my pulse seems to have stopped   
Mera Ranjha Main Raanjhe Di   
Ranjha is mine, I?m Ranjha?s   
Ranjha Hai Chit Chor   
Ranjha is a heart stealer   
Hun Ta Mainu Mil Gaya Ranjha   
If I achieve Ranjha   
Ki Chahinda Hai Haur   
What more do I need?   
O Mera Mera Ranjha   
O my Ranjha!   
O Ranjha, Mera Ranjha (x3)   
O Ranjha, my Ranjha

When i heard this i was moved to tears thinking about my Arunachala Siva.  
Again as i mentioned, pardon my audacity for relating a movie song.

Dear Vinod,   
There is nothing wrong. All names and forms are in Arunachala which is  
Paramaatman (the Self.). The Self is the same   
only names and forms are different. I know one person who always says Tirupati  
Muruga, Tirupati Muruga! Are   
Sri Venkateswara and Muruga different? (The reason however, was that it is  
believed that Tirupati Lord is Muruga   
only.)   
Further the term Arunachala is all inclusive. The Arunachala Mahatmyam says  
chanting Arunachala once is equivalent to chanting   
a ten million times the Panchaksharam, Namasivaya.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear Vinod,   
Remembering Arunachala even once paves the way for liberation. in this very  
life as written by Sadhu OM in his Arunachala Venba.   
For some reason, the Supreme Brahman has taken the form of this hill and can  
be remembered by his form or by incantation of his name.   
So if we can remember Arunachala alll the time, by incantation of his name  
what more is needed to be aspired for.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Namaste Jewell and Vinodji: Yes, it will be nice to have more trees on the left side of the road and  
regular trimming of the ones on the right.   
I can't say that about dogs. Much as I love them, their barking (all night  
long) disturbs me.   
Tiruvannamalai is very noisy and some of the noise is from TV sets. If you  
live in Ramana Nagar you know what I mean.   
Early morning when the rest of us are just waking up, doing sun salutation,  
meditating or generally enjoying the quiet and beauty of Arunachala, TV sets  
will be turned on full blast to some Guru talking in some Indian language. So  
if you have two or three neighbours, there are two or three TV sets that are  
blasting out the same damn talk.   
I have promised myself that I will never donate to this guru who used to come  
to Tiruvannamalai regularly and cannot any more. Arunachala kept him away. HA!  
HA! The lesson for him was that if you are guru, you are responsible for how  
your disciples/ devotees behave _(or in this case misbehave and disturb the  
peace of their neighbours)._   
So, yes, I would recommend that there be no TV sets, radios or loudspeakers  
allowed within the city of Tiruvannamalai just as it is banned in Tirupati and  
Vaishno Devi.   
Frankly, in my opinion, if you live in Tiruvannamalai and feel the need for a  
TV, then you are not ready for Arunachala. That is a dead giveaway. YOU ARE  
JUST NOT READY FOR ARUNACHALA. "We have the money", "we are spending our  
retirement years here" or any such excuse is not acceptable. Find another  
place to pollute.   
Also, there are some people who talk very loudly and disturb the peace and  
then there are some who are so peaceful. When I asked my maid servant why  
that is so in Tiruvannamalai, she replied: "Those people (not her community)  
eat a lot of salt and chillies. It makes them very agitated."   
Maybe community leaders or the local media can increase public awareness about  
this. People on the spiritual path should eat sattvic food without a lot of  
salt and chillies. If you love your salt and chillies or pizzas for that  
matter, then find some place else to live until your vasanas let go of you.   
Vinodji, I agree about the building of houses but that I am sure will come in  
time as the government, the Arunachaleswarar temple and Ramana Ashram play a  
greater role in the development of Tiruvannamalai.   
Come, let us pray that Arunachala blesses them with making the right decisions  
and they have the money, technology and will power to quieten and beautify  
Tiruvannamalai quickly. I have faith it will happen. The government has  
managed to enforce order in Tirupati and Vaishno Devi, I am sure it is capable  
of doing it in Tiruvannamalai as well.

Namaste dear Child of Arunachala and dear Vinod!   
Indeed,all You both mentioned should be done. I am for that,that in all places  
around the world should be preserved nature and animal life. I prefer when it  
is untouched and wild nature more,than buildings,houses and traffics.  
Somehow,we spoil everything we come in touch with.   
So also about Tiru and Arunachala,such Holy place,Lord Shiva Himself,Reality  
itself.   
I also love dogs,animals of all kinds and nature. By respecting this beautiful  
place,we get respect from it too. Not to mention enjoyment of walking  
beautiful green paths,with birds singing and heartbreaking site to watch.   
I never have been to Tiru,but i truly hope i will come one day in one peaceful  
and serene town.   
Regarding pictures,i find them all by chance. For this one i tiped "burning  
candle animated gif".   
I also found one excellent community site with lots of rare  
photographies,named "pinterest".   
With love and prayers,
