On Raja-Yoga   
Volume 6, Notes Of Class Talks And Lectures   
The first stage of Yoga is Yama.   
To master Yama five things are necessary:  **1) Non - injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.   
2) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed.   
3) Non - covetousness in thought, word, and deed.   
4) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.   
5) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.**   
Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it. Then comes  
Asana, or posture, of a devotee. The seat must be firm, the head, ribs, and  
body in a straight line, erect. Say to yourself that you are firmly seated,  
and that nothing can move you. Then mention the perfection of the body, bit by  
bit, from head to foot. Think of it as being clear as crystal, and as a  
perfect vessel to sail over the sea of life.   
Pray to God and to all the prophets and saviors of the world and holy spirits  
in the universe to help you.   
Then for half an hour practice Pranayama or the suspending, restraining, and  
controlling of the breath, mentally repeating the word Om as you inhale and  
exhale the breath. Words charged with spirit have wonderful power.   
The other stages of Yoga are: (1) Pratyahara or the restraint of the organs of  
sense   
from all outward things, and directing them entirely to mental impressions;  
(2) Dharana or steadfast concentration; (3) Dhyana or meditation; (4) Samadhi  
or abstract meditation. It is the highest and last stage of Yoga. Samadhi is  
perfect absorption of thought into the Supreme Spirit, when one realises, "I  
and my Father are one."   
Do one thing at a time and while doing it put your whole soul into it to the  
exclusion of all else.

Q: How can I know whether I have purity of mind or not?   
A: If you have Vairagya (dispassion or indifference to sensual enjoyments),  
that is a sign of Chitta Suddhi or purity of mind. No sensual desires or  
Vasanas will arise in the mind.   
Q: What is the purpose of God creating the world?   
A: This is a transcendental question or Atiprasna. You will know the purpose  
when you attain Self-realisation or Brahma Jnana. The finite mind that is  
conditioned in time, space and causation cannot get an answer to a question  
that relates to transcendental matters.   
Q: What is the use of repeating the Mantra again and again?   
A: It gives force. It intensifies the spiritual Samskaras.   
Q: When I concentrate, so many thoughts arise in my mind. How can I avoid  
them? Can I suppress them?   
A: Do not try to suppress them with force. The thoughts will manifest with  
redoubled force. They will rise up frequently also. You will tax your will and  
waste your energy. Be a silent witness of these thoughts. Say unto yourself: "I have no concern with these thoughts." Be indifferent. All useless worldly  
thoughts will die by themselves.   
Q: How to prevent bad dreams?   
A: Study any religious book. Meditate for half an hour just before retiring to  
bed. You will have no bad dreams.   
Q: What are the signs of a person who has no Ahamkara or egoism?   
A: He will not identify himself with his body. He will be free from pride,  
likes, dislikes, jealousy, anger and hypocrisy.   
Q: Why does evil exist in the world?   
A: Change the angle of vision or Drishti. All evils will disappear. Evil is  
negative good. Evil exists to glorify good. It has a raison d'etre, reason for  
its existence. Evil and good are relative terms. What is good at one time is  
evil at another time. What is good for one is evil for another. Understand  
this and become wise. Behold the one Atman in all forms and beings. Evil and  
good are mental creations. Transmute evil into good by Atma-Drishti. There is  
good in evil also.   
Q: How to lead the life of unity?   
A: This is attained by service, charity, sharing what you have with others,  
cultivating cosmic love and realising the one Atman seated in the hearts of  
all, through constant Brahmachintana or meditation on Atman.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 2 - Swami Vivekananda Lessons on Raja Yoga

**Six Lessons On Raja-Yoga   
Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses  
God alone is our goal. Failing to reach God, we die.   
Three things are necessary to the student who wishes to succeed.   
**First. Give up all ideas of enjoyment in this world and the next, care only  
for God and Truth.** We are here to know truth, not for enjoyment. Leave that  
to brutes who enjoy as we never can. Man is a thinking being and must struggle  
on until he conquers death, until he sees the light. He must not spend himself  
in vain talking that bears no fruit. Worship of society and popular opinion is  
idolatry. **The soul has no sex, no country, no place, no time.**   
Second. Intense desire to know Truth and God. Be eager for them, long for  
them, as a drowning man longs for breath. Want only God, take nothing else,  
let not "seeming" cheat you any longer. Turn from all and seek only God.   
Third. The six trainings: First -- restraining the mind from going outward.  
Second -- restraining the senses. Third -- turning the mind inward. Fourth --  
suffering everything without murmuring. Fifth -- fastening the mind to one  
idea. Take the subject before you and think it out; never leave it. Do not  
count time. Sixth -- think constantly of your real nature. Get rid of  
superstition. Do not hypnotise yourself into a belief in your own inferiority.  
Day and night tell yourself what you really are, until you realise (actually  
realise) your oneness with God.   
Without these disciplines, no results can be gained.   
We have to go beyond sense limit and transcend even reason, and we have the  
power to do this.   
 **Ignorance, fickleness, jealousy, laziness, and excessive attachment are the  
great enemies to success in Yoga practice.** The three great requisites are: First. Purity, physical and mental; all uncleanness, all that would draw the  
mind down, must be abandoned.   
Second. Patience: At first there will be wonderful manifestations, but they  
will all cease. This is the hardest period, but hold fast; in the end the gain  
is sure if you have patience.   
Third. Perseverance: Persevere through thick and thin, through health and  
sickness, never miss a day in practice.   
 **Talk as little as possible.**   
Keep your thoughts on virtue; what we think we tend to become.   
This Yoga is known as the eightfold Yoga, because it is divided into eight  
principal parts. These are: First -- Yama. This is most important and has to govern the whole life; it has  
five divisions:  _1st. Not injuring any being by thought, word, or deed.   
2nd. Non - covetousness in thought, word, or deed.   
3rd. Perfect chastity in thought, word, or deed.   
4th. Perfect truthfulness in thought, word, or deed.   
5th. Non - receiving of gifts. _   
Second -- Niyama. The bodily care, bathing daily, dietary, etc.   
Third -- Asana, posture. Hips, shoulders, and head must be held straight,  
leaving the spine free.   
Fourth -- pranayama, restraining the breath (in order to get control of the  
Prana or vital force).   
Fifth -- Pratyahara, turning the mind inward and restraining it from going  
outward, revolving the matter in the mind in order to understand it.   
Sixth -- Dharana, concentration on one subject.   
Seventh -- Dhyana, meditation.   
Eighth -- Samadhi, illumination, the aim of all our efforts.   
Pranayama has three parts: 1st. Puraka -- inhaling.   
2nd. Kumbhaka -- restraining.   
3rd. Rechaka -- exhaling.   
Before we can control the mind we must study it.   
We have to seize this unstable mind and drag it from its wanderings and fix it  
on one idea. Over and over again this must be done. By power of will we must  
get hold of the mind and make it stop and reflect upon the glory of God.   
 **The easiest way to get hold of the mind is to sit quiet and let it drift  
where it will for a while. Hold fast to the idea, "I am the witness watching  
my mind drifting. The mind is not I." Then see it think as if it were a thing  
entirely apart from yourself. Identify yourself with God, never with matter or  
with the mind.**   
Picture the mind as a calm lake stretched before you and the thoughts that  
come and go as bubbles rising and breaking on its surface. Make no effort to  
control the thoughts, but watch them and follow them in imagination as they  
float away. This will gradually lessen the circles. For the mind ranges over  
wide circles of thought and those circles widen out into ever - increasing  
circles, as in a pond when we throw a stone into it. We want to reverse the  
process and starting with a huge circle make it narrower until at last we can  
fix the mind on one point and make it stay there. Hold to the idea, "I am not  
the mind, I see that I am thinking, I am watching my mind act", and each day  
the identification of yourself with thought and feeling will grow less, until  
at last you can entirely separate yourself from the mind and actually know it  
to be apart from yourself.   
When this is done, the mind is your servant to control as you will. The first  
stage of being a Yogi is to go beyond the senses. When the mind is conquered,  
he has reached the highest stage.   
The body is the objective view of what we call mind (subjective). We, the  
Self, are beyond both body and mind; we are "Atman", the eternal, unchangeable  
witness. The body is crystallised thought.   
Do not let the thoughts grasp you; stand aside, and they will die away.   
 **Follow these holy thoughts; go with them; and when they melt away, you will  
find the feet of the Omnipotent God. This is the superconscious state; when  
the idea melts, follow it and melt with it.**

## Tension and boring  
Author: ramanaduli          Date: June 11, 2010, 09:33:07 PM  
---  
Now a days every one is saying there is full of tension and life is boring.  
Even a 1std school going kid is saying I got tensed and bored. Before 50 years  
it is not like that. Why it is happening? I think people is living far away  
from the natural life.   
Some where I read it... God gives gives gives and forgives   
but man gets gets gets and forgets.....   
no gratitude to anybody.

## Re:[1] Tension and boring  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: June 12, 2010, 09:52:19 AM  
---  
A person who was standing by, just watched some 8 - 10 people running  
frantically together each trying to run faster and faster. Seeing them he  
asked one of them, "hey, why and where are you guys running?,' to which, one  
guy who was running, turned his head, and as he was running, answered, "hmm, I  
don't know, I saw they were all running and so I also joined them, come you  
too join us"   
Thats how the world is functioning today, we're dancing to the dictates of the  
society and its trends!   
The society and its culture makes it mandatory to BE something, and  
practically imposes certain standards for happiness! They would be along the  
lines of: 1\. One should be very worldly wise - today we see kids who are catagorised a  
prodigy, there is immense presure on other kids and the spirit behind that is  
to outperform each other.   
2\. One's standard of living should be better than the others for happiness   
3\. One has to perform so many sacrifices and pujas so as to seem "pious" in  
the eyes of others for their happiness   
4\. One has to be very orthodox or very NON-orthodox to make a statement about  
oneself and one's happiness.   
5\. One has to own very many luxuries in order to be happy.   
6\. One has to be modern, and being religious is the straightest and shortest  
road to becomming an outcaste   
7\. Irony of ironies - Today if you follow rules you are termed "Gandhi", Its  
too cool to break rules, and pay couple of bucks to the cop and get away and  
talk about it to friends and laugh about it   
8\. You MUST be up to date on "current affairs", (which is invariably a  
rendition of other people's "affairs") daily happenings in the 24 Hr news  
channels and you need to giveout your "esteemed" opinions to the "stalwarts"  
to maintain your aura of intelligence and earn their respect and awe so that  
it may be of some use tomorrow (never mind that you don't even know what your  
parent / spouse / child likes, and you have no "time" to find out what they  
think or feel and if you even use the word Guru - damn you!!!)   
9\. You have to maintain relationships so that they could be of use to you  
tomorrow and NEVER for just pure love.   
10\. You ought to earn your food.   
11\. You should own a luxury car, bike, model house, have a cook, servent.   
12\. You should have some clout with some political guy or some big guy,   
13\. You should visit some new restaurents, pubs, mingle, especially if you  
are single!! (a bachelor who goes to the temple or reads a religious book is  
verily a freak of nature and should not be associated with at all, lest you be  
tainted as well. Sorrow of sorrows, it is mostly the parents who insist that  
these "abnormal" people be cut off from their childrens' lives)   
14\. Once in a year, go to Tirupathi, Srirangam, etc... and dissolve your  
Paapams or sins.   
15\. You have to be employed in a big company   
16\. You need to earn a minimum of 50k tp 1lac for a decent living   
17\. You should have travelled abroad, worked there and earned in dollars   
18\. Its cool to have your own house, 72" Plasma TV, Apple Mac comp, Ipod, and  
all the latest gadgets   
19\. Contrary to point 13, YOu should be too spiritual to leave a mark or  
statement, show everybody that you are apiritual, and you are close to Guru-  
hood. You should be associated with some organisations, spiritual  
org.Philanthropic org., Spiritual Gurus, Service oriented, etc... to raise  
your esteem and earn respect and admiration   
20\. You should leave your family and parents in dire want and perhaps even  
hunger and go do "service" in these organisations.   
21\. You should shout loudly at people when they make mistake and fight back  
for the same reason when somebody else shouts at us.   
22\. You should wear cool clothes, otherwise you belong to the old school of  
thought and hence have no place in the world... you are past your sell by  
date!   
23\. You should observe Madi and Aacharams to be too orthodox and earn the  
respect of being very orthodox   
24, you should know by heart all slokas, the Gita, Sahasranaamams etc.. so  
that you can sing to others just so that they know that you know all these  
even without seeing the script.   
25\. Gratitude, sharing happiness and sorrows are to be avoided for your  
happiness!   
26\. You will be made to not follow rules.   
27\. Even if you want a legal bill, you will not be given for it is stupid to  
pay tax.   
28\. Today, only if you decorate Gods in temple and at homes with countless  
flowers, you will experience divinity, and the presence of Gods   
29\. Killing cockroaches at home is essential   
30\. Ants get killed by themselves as they come on our way and we stamp them  
even without noticing it.   
31\. Stones are to be thrown at dogs, They cant come near you, we should get  
scared or shout at them and pish them off.   
32\. You should wear a new dress ever week atleast.   
33\. Have a cell phone, talk for long time, gossip   
34\. discuss others' personal life & pass judgement about what is right and  
wrong.   
35\. Make our lives "easy" by encouraging nuclear plant, modern vehicles,spoil  
the earth and then pop in Vitamin tablets.   
36\. When you go for Purohit duty, you phone should ring some cinema song, and  
you should talk in between homams and while chanting mantras.   
37\. Adamance can get you what ever you want, thats a cool attitude   
38\. You should have/own a Panchayatana Puja only after retirement, you should  
do Puja etc... only when we get time for it. (which is basically after you  
finish exporting your child to some fancy place abroad and are stuck alone and  
jobless at home - what our grandparents used to simply say - saagara  
kaalathula shankara shankaraa!! Meaning, you take the lord's name on your  
dying breath after wasting your entire life on frivolous and trivial things  
not even worth thinking about)   
39\. Learning vedas at young age is wasting time. there is time for all these  
in future, not now   
40\. Irregular food habits and at odd times.   
41\. By the age of 4 - 5 you should know your ambition, what you want to  
become, Doctor, Computer professional, etc... and also be able to dance like  
adults, sing like adults, talk like adults   
42\. you should be able to tell PJ's poor jokes and be smart   
43\. you should get within first 5 ranks   
44\. Its fashionable to be Naughty and Mischievous. .....   
The list can continue endlessly...   
One has to enquire Who am 'I' enquire into Self...

## Re:[2] Tension and boring  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 12, 2010, 10:18:53 AM

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Nagaraj has given an excellent reply. We are all running, running,   
running all through our lives with out being still and looking within.   
This tension in the worldly life is necessary to some extent. Otherwise, a  
person loses all motivation in life. One should   
neither be like high a strung bow nor like a bow where the string is loosened  
completely. There must be some spring action, in the bow.   
From another point of view, we are increasing our tension by increasing our  
desires. We keep on collecting trophies and the   
glass cupboard is full of trophies - still we do not stop. This is   
what is not advised in life.   
In management, they used to say, after careful preparation and   
winning an interview for promotion, the person promoted gets   
depression. This is called Success Depression. He does not   
sit and enjoy his promoted status. Somehow he feels depressed   
and restless. Why? Because he wants to quickly prepare for another  
promotional interview, this time the goal is a bigger cabin   
and three telephone lines and a more cozy sofa and a lot more of power!   
Where is the end?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj ji   
What you said it is 100% true. My childhood days were not like this. But I am  
worried to see my grand kid's days.   
There is no way to escape for them. They are trapped in this modern clutch.  
Every day every minute seeing them and comparing the life to olden days, I  
chant Bhagavan's name and His words.. who am I.   
The no.41 what you have quoted is 100% correct. In Madras, I do not want to  
tell the name of the school. when the parents go for the kid's admission they  
are asked by the school head master, which line you want to put your kid,  
whether doctor, engineer according to that field we would shape him.   
In my days, we were taught to be honest and true. At the end I feel I am not  
fit to this world.   
all parents want to be identified by their children like she is the mother of  
super kid, successful boy etc. etc.   
It is kali kalam. that is all.

In response to the incident in Lakshmi's post, I thought this would be very  
appropriate. Anyone who ever has a child or is involved in any role in the  
upbringing of a child SHOULD read and remember this. These are the words of a  
famous poet...   
 **On Children**   
 _Kahlil Gibran_   
Your children are not your children.   
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.   
They come through you but not from you,   
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.   
You may give them your love but not your thoughts,   
For they have their own thoughts.   
You may house their bodies but not their souls,   
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,   
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.   
You may strive to be like them,   
but seek not to make them like you.   
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.   
You are the bows from which your children   
as living arrows are sent forth.   
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,   
and He bends you with His might   
that His arrows may go swift and far.   
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;   
For even as He loves the arrow that flies,   
so He loves also the bow that is stable.

Dear Nagaraj ji,   
Very beautiful quotes. This should be printed as a greeting card and to be  
given to the people when they   
become a parent.

Dear I, (ramanaduliji)   
Yes, when we see the current scenario, we just feel the need for the people  
around, our society, culture to change for good, its our souls deepest desire  
for such happiness. Sri Ramana Bhagavan also says the same -   
Every souls desire for Happiness, and there is nothing wrong in it, but the  
only mistake we make is to depend our happiness on external change, but real  
happiness lies within ourselves. That happiness is absolutely independent from  
any external disturbances. The world will keep going, great souls like Sri  
Ramana Bhagavan keep coming to restore faith in humanity and Self.   
Even after any turbulance in our society, after hearing so many untoward  
incidents, etc.. when we look at Bhagavan, we get attracted to our Self, that  
eternal peace.

## Tension and boring

Now a days every one is saying there is full of tension and life is boring.  
Even a 1std school going kid is saying I got tensed and bored. Before 50 years  
it is not like that. Why it is happening? I think people is living far away  
from the natural life.   
Some where I read it... God gives gives gives and forgives   
but man gets gets gets and forgets.....   
no gratitude to anybody.

A person who was standing by, just watched some 8 - 10 people running  
frantically together each trying to run faster and faster. Seeing them he  
asked one of them, "hey, why and where are you guys running?,' to which, one  
guy who was running, turned his head, and as he was running, answered, "hmm, I  
don't know, I saw they were all running and so I also joined them, come you  
too join us"   
Thats how the world is functioning today, we're dancing to the dictates of the  
society and its trends!   
The society and its culture makes it mandatory to BE something, and  
practically imposes certain standards for happiness! They would be along the  
lines of: 1\. One should be very worldly wise - today we see kids who are catagorised a  
prodigy, there is immense presure on other kids and the spirit behind that is  
to outperform each other.   
2\. One's standard of living should be better than the others for happiness   
3\. One has to perform so many sacrifices and pujas so as to seem "pious" in  
the eyes of others for their happiness   
4\. One has to be very orthodox or very NON-orthodox to make a statement about  
oneself and one's happiness.   
5\. One has to own very many luxuries in order to be happy.   
6\. One has to be modern, and being religious is the straightest and shortest  
road to becomming an outcaste   
7\. Irony of ironies - Today if you follow rules you are termed "Gandhi", Its  
too cool to break rules, and pay couple of bucks to the cop and get away and  
talk about it to friends and laugh about it   
8\. You MUST be up to date on "current affairs", (which is invariably a  
rendition of other people's "affairs") daily happenings in the 24 Hr news  
channels and you need to giveout your "esteemed" opinions to the "stalwarts"  
to maintain your aura of intelligence and earn their respect and awe so that  
it may be of some use tomorrow (never mind that you don't even know what your  
parent / spouse / child likes, and you have no "time" to find out what they  
think or feel and if you even use the word Guru - damn you!!!)   
9\. You have to maintain relationships so that they could be of use to you  
tomorrow and NEVER for just pure love.   
10\. You ought to earn your food.   
11\. You should own a luxury car, bike, model house, have a cook, servent.   
12\. You should have some clout with some political guy or some big guy,   
13\. You should visit some new restaurents, pubs, mingle, especially if you  
are single!! (a bachelor who goes to the temple or reads a religious book is  
verily a freak of nature and should not be associated with at all, lest you be  
tainted as well. Sorrow of sorrows, it is mostly the parents who insist that  
these "abnormal" people be cut off from their childrens' lives)   
14\. Once in a year, go to Tirupathi, Srirangam, etc... and dissolve your  
Paapams or sins.   
15\. You have to be employed in a big company   
16\. You need to earn a minimum of 50k tp 1lac for a decent living   
17\. You should have travelled abroad, worked there and earned in dollars   
18\. Its cool to have your own house, 72" Plasma TV, Apple Mac comp, Ipod, and  
all the latest gadgets   
19\. Contrary to point 13, YOu should be too spiritual to leave a mark or  
statement, show everybody that you are apiritual, and you are close to Guru-  
hood. You should be associated with some organisations, spiritual  
org.Philanthropic org., Spiritual Gurus, Service oriented, etc... to raise  
your esteem and earn respect and admiration   
20\. You should leave your family and parents in dire want and perhaps even  
hunger and go do "service" in these organisations.   
21\. You should shout loudly at people when they make mistake and fight back  
for the same reason when somebody else shouts at us.   
22\. You should wear cool clothes, otherwise you belong to the old school of  
thought and hence have no place in the world... you are past your sell by  
date!   
23\. You should observe Madi and Aacharams to be too orthodox and earn the  
respect of being very orthodox   
24, you should know by heart all slokas, the Gita, Sahasranaamams etc.. so  
that you can sing to others just so that they know that you know all these  
even without seeing the script.   
25\. Gratitude, sharing happiness and sorrows are to be avoided for your  
happiness!   
26\. You will be made to not follow rules.   
27\. Even if you want a legal bill, you will not be given for it is stupid to  
pay tax.   
28\. Today, only if you decorate Gods in temple and at homes with countless  
flowers, you will experience divinity, and the presence of Gods   
29\. Killing cockroaches at home is essential   
30\. Ants get killed by themselves as they come on our way and we stamp them  
even without noticing it.   
31\. Stones are to be thrown at dogs, They cant come near you, we should get  
scared or shout at them and pish them off.   
32\. You should wear a new dress ever week atleast.   
33\. Have a cell phone, talk for long time, gossip   
34\. discuss others' personal life & pass judgement about what is right and  
wrong.   
35\. Make our lives "easy" by encouraging nuclear plant, modern vehicles,spoil  
the earth and then pop in Vitamin tablets.   
36\. When you go for Purohit duty, you phone should ring some cinema song, and  
you should talk in between homams and while chanting mantras.   
37\. Adamance can get you what ever you want, thats a cool attitude   
38\. You should have/own a Panchayatana Puja only after retirement, you should  
do Puja etc... only when we get time for it. (which is basically after you  
finish exporting your child to some fancy place abroad and are stuck alone and  
jobless at home - what our grandparents used to simply say - saagara  
kaalathula shankara shankaraa!! Meaning, you take the lord's name on your  
dying breath after wasting your entire life on frivolous and trivial things  
not even worth thinking about)   
39\. Learning vedas at young age is wasting time. there is time for all these  
in future, not now   
40\. Irregular food habits and at odd times.   
41\. By the age of 4 - 5 you should know your ambition, what you want to  
become, Doctor, Computer professional, etc... and also be able to dance like  
adults, sing like adults, talk like adults   
42\. you should be able to tell PJ's poor jokes and be smart   
43\. you should get within first 5 ranks   
44\. Its fashionable to be Naughty and Mischievous. .....   
The list can continue endlessly...   
One has to enquire Who am 'I' enquire into Self...

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Nagaraj has given an excellent reply. We are all running, running,   
running all through our lives with out being still and looking within.   
This tension in the worldly life is necessary to some extent. Otherwise, a  
person loses all motivation in life. One should   
neither be like high a strung bow nor like a bow where the string is loosened  
completely. There must be some spring action, in the bow.   
From another point of view, we are increasing our tension by increasing our  
desires. We keep on collecting trophies and the   
glass cupboard is full of trophies - still we do not stop. This is   
what is not advised in life.   
In management, they used to say, after careful preparation and   
winning an interview for promotion, the person promoted gets   
depression. This is called Success Depression. He does not   
sit and enjoy his promoted status. Somehow he feels depressed   
and restless. Why? Because he wants to quickly prepare for another  
promotional interview, this time the goal is a bigger cabin   
and three telephone lines and a more cozy sofa and a lot more of power!   
Where is the end?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj ji   
What you said it is 100% true. My childhood days were not like this. But I am  
worried to see my grand kid's days.   
There is no way to escape for them. They are trapped in this modern clutch.  
Every day every minute seeing them and comparing the life to olden days, I  
chant Bhagavan's name and His words.. who am I.   
The no.41 what you have quoted is 100% correct. In Madras, I do not want to  
tell the name of the school. when the parents go for the kid's admission they  
are asked by the school head master, which line you want to put your kid,  
whether doctor, engineer according to that field we would shape him.   
In my days, we were taught to be honest and true. At the end I feel I am not  
fit to this world.   
all parents want to be identified by their children like she is the mother of  
super kid, successful boy etc. etc.   
It is kali kalam. that is all.   
Ramanaduli
