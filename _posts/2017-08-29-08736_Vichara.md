Maharshi clearly shows us the simplicity of our True Nature, and the direction  
in which to look.   
 _M.: Know the pure state, your own real nature, by keenly observing the interval between two thoughts...   
 This interval (is) the abiding, unchangeable reality, your true being   
 [Guru Vachaka Kovai, Godman]._   
There are two common responses to this statement made by Maharshi. First,  
resting in the interval does not satisfy me. Or secondly, I am a jnani, my  
work is complete.   
When the spaciousness between thoughts is recognised it is invariably seen  
only through layers of ego attachments. Consequently, on first recognising the  
interval between thoughts it does not satisfy because it is only seen through  
multiple attachments. This is akin to viewing a beautiful landscape through  
obscured glass.   
 _D.: On enquiry into the origin of thoughts there is a perception of 'I'. But it does not satisfy me.   
 M.: Quite right. The perception of 'I' is associated with a form, maybe the  
body. There should be nothing associated with the pure Self.   
 The Self is the unassociated, pure Reality, in whose light, the body, the  
ego, etc. shine. On stilling all thoughts the pure consciousness remains over   
 [Talks]._   
Equally, on recognising the interval between thoughts, to conclude "I am a  
jnani, my work is complete", despite the fact the view is obscured by  
attachment to mind/body/world, is a grave error and the mischief of maya.

_M.: Take no notice of the ego and its activities, but see only the light  
behind. Abiding in the Self, one need not worry about the mind._   
Why should I care for this mind!   
It is a puff of smoke.   
Best to look away, have nothing to do with it.

_M.: Simply through your powerful attention to Being, become the reality,  
the vast eye,_ __ _the unbounded space of consciousness._   
To discover something.   
To dis - cover.   
To cease covering.   
Knowing only thoughts, concepts, the unbounded space of consciousness is  
covered and remains hidden.   
Cease covering with a simple shift of attention to that sense of Being-ness,  
that all without fail, possess. One need not fight thoughts, nor stop them,  
nor do anything other than make a simple shift to your own eternal Being-ness.   
Initially, that Being-ness is only a glimpse. It is still "seen" through the  
lens of attachments. Perseverance, and IT becomes the only view.

What is the most obvious?   
What is always there when one looks?   
Is it not the sense of "me", the sense "I exist"!   
Maharshi says, " _Asked who wakes up from sleep you say 'I'. Now you are told  
to hold fast to this 'I'. If it is done the eternal being will reveal  
itself_."   
How wonderful! How beautifully clear! That unavoidable and obvious "me-ness",  
that is always there when one looks. Just attend to it. Attend to it. Attend  
to it. And " _the eternal being will reveal itself_." Or more aptly  
(perhaps!), the "me-ness" fades away.

**Dreaming   
**   
Is it not amazing** that at night when we dream we do not realise we are  
dreaming,   
We take the dream events and dream people to be very real.   
It is only on waking in the morning that we realise it was all a dream   
Despite all the happenings in my dream not only do **I remain untouched**,   
but **I need change nothing** about what is only a dream.   
Likewise, the jnani, having awoken from the dream, says to the person, you are  
dreaming.   
The person objects, but my suffering, my pains, my struggles?   
It is only on **" WAKING UP"** that the suffering, the pains, the struggles,   
that are now taken to be so very real, are seen as they truly are,   
**A Dream.**

Maharshi points to the great simplicity of Self in his answer below.   
But despite this simplicity, there remains an enormous chasm between the jnana  
and ajnani.   
The ajnani sinks then rises up, sinks then rises up, sinks then rises up. The  
jnana does not.   
D.: There are times when persons and things take on a vague, almost  
transparent form, as in a dream. One ceases to observe them as from outside,  
but is passively conscious of their existence, while not actively conscious of  
any kind of selfhood. There is a deep quietness in the mind. Is it, at such  
times, ready to dive into the Self? Or is this condition unhealthy, the result  
of self-hypnotism? Should it be encouraged as a means of getting temporary  
peace?   
M.: **There is consciousness along with quietness in the mind; this is exactly  
the state to be aimed at.** The fact that the question has been framed on this  
point, without realising that it is the Self, shows that the state is not  
steady but casual.

The inevitability of imagining a separate "I", is that the "I" will be slapped  
by life.   
Sometimes the slap is light, sometimes not so light.   
In my own life I have had many slaps, more that I can count.   
The gift of the cross that one bears is that it is a reminder.   
A reminder that there is no way in the world for this "I", other than  
Maharshi's Vichara.   
 _Whose suffering is this?_   
 _Who am I?   
_

_He who engages in investigation starts holding on to himself, asks 'Who am  
I?' and the Self becomes clear to him.   
(Maharshi_)   
 "holding on to himself" is simply to cease scattering attention   
when attention is scattered, ask "Who am I?" and scattering ceases   
if scattering is finally brought to an end, never again returning, only Self  
remains

"Death of Mind does not mean Thoughtlessness".....   
Despite this the sadhak is nevertheless required to strive towards mental  
stillness as this is the only means by which the illusory ego ceases.   
 _Be still and know that I AM God. So stillness is the aim of the seeker.   
 All that is required to realise the True Self is to "Be Still" [Maharshi]._   
At ego "death" it is found that the Self is thought-free, yet mind may or may  
not continue to have thoughts as per its destiny.   
 _In the realised man the mind may be active or inactive, the Self alone remains for him [Maharshi]._

Maharshi's Teachings are simple. One of my favourite uncomplicated Teachings  
is " _keep quiet_ ".   
To keep quiet is to ignore thoughts. One does not need to stop them, change  
them, nor object to them. Just ignore them.   
_D.: What do you advise me to do?_   
 _M.: Why should you do anything and what should you do? Only keep quiet. Why  
not do so?_

I have long argued that it is easy to mistake ones sense of beingness or  
existence with the true Self, when in fact what is actually contacted is the  
false ego merely resting. This error often leads such a person to conclude "my  
work is complete" and "I am a Teacher".   
An alternative way to express my point is to **consider the perceived and the  
perceiver**.   
A thing perceived, including the perceiver recognising itself, is always  
"other", is always secondary to Source, an add-on, a dualistic state. It can  
be rejected as "not I".   
If any claim is to be made, the best one can say is, " **I am that that  
enables perception. I am not what can be perceived** ".   
Of course only direct "seeing" into the Truth that I am neither the perceived  
nor the perceiver will appease the aspirant. Otherwise the subject remains as  
intellectual philosophising.   
Maharshi asserted that this I am neither the perceived nor the perceiver is  
dis-covered via the inquiry "Who am I?", or by remaining quiet.

[1] perceived, [2] perceiver, [3] beyond both perceived and perceiver   
[1] the ajnani typically knows only what is perceived, namely concepts and  
desires   
[2] Vichara turns attention away from what is perceived to the perceiver of  
concepts and desires; and thereby what is perceived becomes known as " **not  
I** ".   
[3] focusing attention upon the perceiver (the mirage that parades as ego),  
the perceiver itself also becomes known as " **not I** ".   
Identification is dvaita. Non-identification ("not I") is advaita.

_Disciple: How is one to realise the Self?_   
 _Maharshi: Whose Self? Find out._   
 _D: Mine, but who am I?_   
 _M: Find out yourself._   
 _D: I don 't know how._   
 _M: Just think over the question. Who is it that says "I don't know?" Who is  
the 'I' in your statement? What is not known?_   
 _D: Somebody or something in me._   
 _M: Who is that somebody? In whom?_   
A wonderful Teaching!   
As long as there is someone to know something, or something to be known, ego  
flourishes.
