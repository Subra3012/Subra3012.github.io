**Chapter 28 All Suffering is Born of Desire**   
Questioner: I come from a far off country. I had some inner experiences on my  
own and I would like to compare notes.   
Maharaj: By all means. Do you know yourself?   
Q: I know that I am not the body. Nor am I the mind.   
M: What makes you say so?   
Q: I do not feel I am in the body. I seem to be all over the place everywhere.  
As to the mind, I can switch it on and off, so to say. This makes me feel I am  
not the mind.   
M: When you feel yourself everywhere in the world, do you remain separate from  
the world? Or, are you the world?   
Q: Both. Sometimes I feel myself to be neither mind nor body, but one single  
all-seeing eye. When I go deeper into it, I find myself to be all I see and  
the world and myself become one.   
M: Very well. What about desires? Do you have any?   
Q: Yes, they come, short and superficial.   
M: And what do you do about them?   
Q: What can I do? They come, they go. l look at them. Sometimes I see my body  
and my mind engaged in fulfilling them.   
M: Whose desires are being fulfilled?   
Q: They are a part of the world in which I live. They are just as trees and  
clouds are there.   
M: Are they not a sign of some imperfection?   
Q: Why should they be? They are as they are, and I am as I am. How can the  
appearance and disappearance of desires affect me? Of course, they affect the  
shape and content of the mind.   
M: How did you come to your present state?   
Q: Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings have put me on my way. Then I met one  
Douglas Harding who helped me by showing me how to work on the 'Who am I ?'   
 **Q: What is love?   
M: When the sense of distinction and separation is absent, you may call it  
love.   
Q: What is happiness?   
M: Harmony between the inner and the outer is happiness. On the other hand,  
self-identification with the outer causes is suffering.**   
Q: What is the real cause of suffering?   
M: Self-identification with the limited (vyaktitva). Sensations as such,  
however strong, do not cause suffering. It is the mind bewildered by wrong  
ideas, addicted to thinking: 'I am this' 'I am that', that fears loss and  
craves gain and suffers when frustrated.   
Q: A friend of mine used to have horrible dreams night after night. Going to  
sleep would terrorise him. Nothing could help him.   
M: Company of the truly good (satsang) would help him.   
Q: Generally one cannot find such friendship.   
M: Seek within. Your own self is your best friend.   
Q: Why is life so full of contradictions?   
M: It serves to break down mental pride. We must realise how poor and  
powerless we are. As long as we delude ourselves by what we imagine ourselves  
to be, to know, to have, to do, we are in a sad plight indeed. Only in  
complete self-negation there is a chance to discover our real being.

Questioner: On all sides I hear that freedom from desires and inclinations is  
the first condition of self-realisation. But I find the condition impossible  
of fulfilment. Ignorance of oneself causes desires and desires perpetuate  
ignorance. A truly vicious circle!   
Maharaj: There are no conditions to fulfil. There is nothing to be done,  
nothing to be given up. Just look and remember, whatever you perceive is not  
you, nor yours. It is there in the field of consciousness, but you are not the  
field and its contents, nor even the knower of the field. It is your idea that  
you have to do things that entangle you in the results of your efforts -- the  
motive, the desire, the failure to achieve, the sense of frustration -- all  
this holds you back. Simply look at whatever happens and know that you are  
beyond it.   
Q: Does it mean I should abstain from doing anything?   
M: You cannot! What goes on must go on. If you stop suddenly, you will crash.   
Q: Has devotion (bhakti) any place in your teaching?   
M: When you are not well, you go to a physician who tells you what is wrong  
and what is the remedy. If you have confidence in him, it makes things simple: you take the medicine, follow the diet restrictions and get well. But if you  
do not trust him, you may still take a chance, or you may study medicine  
yourself! In all cases it is your desire for recovery that moves you, not the  
physician.   
Without trust there is no peace. Somebody or other you always trust -- it may  
be your mother, or your wife. Of all the people the knower of the self, the  
liberated man, is the most trust-worthy. But merely to trust is not enough.  
You must also desire. Without desire for freedom of what use is the confidence  
that you can acquire freedom? Desire and confidence must go together. The  
stronger your desire, the easier comes the help. The greatest Guru is helpless  
as long as the disciple is not eager to learn. Eagerness and earnestness are  
all-important. Confidence will come with experience. Be devoted to your goal  
-- and devotion to him who can guide you will follow. If your desire and  
confidence are strong, they will operate and take you to your goal, for you  
will not cause delay by hesitation and compromise.   
The greatest Guru is your inner self. Truly, he is the supreme teacher. He  
alone can take you to your goal and he alone meets you at the end of the road.  
Confide in him and you need no outer Guru. But again you must have the strong  
desire to find him and do nothing that will create obstacles and delays. And  
do not waste energy and time on regrets. Learn from your mistakes and do not  
repeat them.   
Q: What is wrong with the universe?   
M: **Forgetting your Self is the greatest injury;** all the calamities flow  
from it. Take care of the most important, the lesser will take care of itself.  
You do not tidy up a dark room. You open the windows first. Letting in the  
light makes everything easy. So, let us wait with improving others until we  
have seen ourselves as we are -- and have changed. There is no need to turn  
round and round in endless questioning; find yourself and everything will fall  
into its proper place.   
Q: How can the universal be responsible for the particular?   
M: **All life on earth depends on the sun. Yet you cannot blame the sun for  
all that happens, though it is the ultimate cause.** Light causes the colour  
of the flower, but it neither controls, nor is responsible for it directly. It  
makes it possible, that is all.   
Q: Yet, there is a body and you do take care of it.   
M: The power that created the body takes care of it.

Bhagavan Ramana has also said that the Guru is the Self within.   
If the seeker is sincere and devoted, a Guru with a body would   
appear to him and push his mind into the Self. The inner guru,   
viz., the Self will pull him back to it for curling up. For Saint   
Manikkavachagar, Siva appeared before him in Tiruvidai Maruthur   
and gave pada-diksha. So also for Sundarmurty. For Jnana   
Samabandha, Siva appeared before him, with his consort Parvati, when he was a  
three year old kid, and Mother Parvati gave him   
her breast milk.   
Many devotees have questioned Bhagavan Ramana as to why He   
did not have a human guru. He has replied, that the Self, the inner guru had  
completed the job. Or Arunachala had come in the form   
of a visitor to his house and mentioned his name. The visitor   
had told that he was coming from Arunachalam, Tiruvannamalai   
and the mere name struck the chord in His mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna on Wife interference in Spiritual life  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 05:25:25 PM

**M. (to Sri Ramakrishna)** : "What should one do if one's wife says: 'You are  
neglecting me. I shall commit suicide?' "   
 **Sri Ramakrishna : (in a serious tone): "Give up such a wife if she proves  
an obstacle in the way of spiritual life. Let her commit suicide or anything  
else she likes. The wife that hampers her husband's spiritual life is an  
ungodly wife."**   
Immersed in deep thought, Sri Ramakrishna stood leaning against the wall.  
Narendra and the other devotees remained silent a few minutes. The Master  
exchanged several words with them; then, suddenly going to M., he whispered in  
his ear: "But if a man has sincere love for God, then all come under his  
control  the king, wicked persons, and his wife.   
 **Sincere love of God on the husband 's part may eventually help the wife to  
lead a spiritual life. If the husband is good, then through the grace of God  
the wife may also follow his example."**   
This had a most soothing effect on M.'s worried mind. All the while he had  
been thinking: "Let her commit suicide. What can I do?"   
M. (to Sri Ramakrishna): "This world is a terrible place indeed."   
Sri Ramakrishna (to the devotees): "That is the reason Chaitanya said to his  
companion Nityananda, 'Listen, brother, there is no hope of salvation for the  
worldly-minded.' "   
On another occasion the Sri Ramakrishna had said to M. privately: " **Yes,  
there is no hope for a worldly man if he is not sincerely devoted to God. But  
he has nothing to fear if he remains in the world after realizing God.** Nor  
need a man have any fear whatever of the world if he attains sincere devotion  
by practising spiritual discipline now and then in solitude. **Chaitanya had  
several householders among his devotees, but they were householders in name  
only, for they lived unattached to the world. "**
