## Bhagavan Ramana and Sankara  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2008, 04:28:30 PM  
---  
When I read Sri Ramana Ashotra (hymn of 108 names of Bhagvan   
by Viswanatha Swami, describing His life), daily in the morning, I   
am not but able to compare Bhagavan Ramana, with Sankara. Sankara   
lost his father, Siva Guru, before he was six. Bhagavan Ramana also   
lost His father when He was about twelve. When Sankara went for   
begging food, one poor lady gave him a gooseberry fruit, Sankara   
made golden gooseberries rain in her home, through his famous   
Kanakadhara Stotram. When Bhagavan went for alms, one gentleman,   
who was playing cards on the portals of his house gave Him food, and he   
was blessed later with a famous Upadesa called Vichara Sangraham. He   
is none other than Gambiram Seshayyar. Sankara went to Kaladi, his   
village in Kerala, skyward, and gave salvation to his mother. But in   
the case of Bhagavan, since He was Unmoving, Arunachala, He made   
His mother come to Him. The poor lady came not once but 4 times and   
on the fourth occasion, after placing her on probation and removing   
all the false prides of caste, creed, and 'achara' and after removing   
all the knots of karma, He bestowed her salvation, with the merager   
of "i" with the Absolute. As in case of Jnana Sambandha, who had   
milk from Goddess Uma on the banks of a tank in Sirkali, Bhagavan   
was offered with the milk of Goddess Unnamualai in Tiruvannamalai   
temple through the temple priest! Arunachala Siva.

## forum devotees and their fate  
Author: ksksat27            Date: April 23, 2013, 05:59:42 PM

Dear all,   
In David Godman blog, there used to be a person Nandu Narasimhan and suddenly  
he expired. Atleast that news reached all of us due to some connection with  
his friends.   
but many devotees who come here may not have anybody in their circle know  
about this forum.   
Suddenly if something happens, we will not be there to convey the same to  
this forum.   
So if possible, everyone tell about this forum to a trustworthy relative or  
friend so that they will post about us when we would have left this world.   
this may appear silly but this has deep meaning.   
what happens is, we are all devotees of Sri Ramana.   
If one devotee falls down in the running towards moksha or slipped while  
alighting the boat, the other devotees will give hands, speaking like what  
happend to Mr. X Bhai ? Where is he not be found now? Has he been left out?   
That devotee with much fracture may be crying, but the other devotees come to  
him, lift him saying 'Bha don't worry, even if you are not having much  
strenght, you have come to satsang, we will take you along in our shoulders"   
Here the less scoring, and fail mark children are especially loved by  
devotees and God, for no one coming here will be left alone, he will be  
lifted up, grace marks added and somehow pushed by all our devotion to cross  
the final boundary towards the Absolute.

Dear Sri Krishnan,   
This is so sweet idea. I am deeply thouched by it.   
It is in the spirit of our Great Bhagavan. He always took care of  
everybody,and acceped all. His heart embraced everyone.   
When someone is going through hard times,he needs helping hand and comforting  
words from friends. And where can we find better friends then among people who  
are traveling on the same path,so to say.   
Thank You for such a beautiful and indeed friendly thoughts.   
With love and prayers,

Friends,   
I came across this article on the passing away of Dr Suryanarayana Raju (June  
2014): http://luthar.com/2014/06/30/in-memoriam-dr-suryanarayana-raju/   
 I have had the opportunity of reading some of his writings on upadesa saram.I  
find his name referred in this Forum by a few members.   
Nandi Narasimhan, the other devoee who passed away earlier-I have had the  
opportunity to exchange mails.   
We will always recall these devotees with fondness and Gratitude.   
Namaskar.

Dear Ravi,   
I am sad to know the news. Incidentally is it Dr. P.V.S.S.N. Raju, who is a  
child specialist and who has written   
books on Self Inquiry and Upadesa Saram. He is from Hyderabad. He was also  
writing in this Forum for some time   
years ago. Prasanth Ramana Maharshi may know more information.   
Arunachala Siva.

Passing away of Dr. P.V.S.S.N. Raju is really sad news.   
I never met him face-face but had privilege to exchange few personal emails  
and help a bit in creating pdfs for his collection of articles labelled "self  
enquiry"..   
http://www.esnips.com/doc/0c14f88c-4266-42bc-a3b9-aea141e3d1c6/Commentaries-

http://www.scribd.com/doc/35545193/Commentaries-on-Self-Enquiry-by-Dr-Raju   
As subramanian garu said he used to be active member in this forum in the  
past.   
Sometime during August 2010 he said he suffered from Crohn's disease and gall  
stones and underwent right hemicolectomy and cholecystectomy.

I also remember Dr Raju garu saying sometime in 2010 that it seems 2nd son of  
Sri Sundaram,President of Ramanasramam is dead after prolonged illness after  
an accident in USA.   
It seems Dr.Srinivas suffered from severe fever followed by severe weakness of  
his limbs and for the time being he is bed ridden.   
Can anyone pls confirm the same?

I have PMed Sanjay.   
Sri Anil -- i have no clue, probably others here know him.   
One quick question, what did you understand from Sri Nisarghadatta Maharaj?  
I love to hear fresh about Maharaj in a new perception though I know his  
teachings. Please start a post to discuss

in firm dispassion, be free of passion and happy.**

its elimination is known as liberation. It is simply by not being   
attached to changing things that the everlasting joy of attainment   
is reached.**

Ignorance itself is nothing, so what need have you of   
desire to understand?**

 **Kingdoms, children, wives, bodies, pleasures - these have all   
been lost to you, life after life, attached to them though you were.**
