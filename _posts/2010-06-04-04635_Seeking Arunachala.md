Arunachala Maahatmyam, Tamil version is available in the Asramam.   
I am not sure about the English version. Regarding Arunachala Puranam, this  
original Tamil work is again available in the Asramam.   
You may kindly write to Asramam, Tiruvannamalai 606 603, India   
and find out.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. I agree with you. The levels of one's vasanas, good and bad   
have a role in determining the time of self realization. Vivekachoodamani  
says: "Vasana kshayam moksham."   
Arunachala Siva.

I guess it arunachala refers to the holy hill at Thiruvannamalai in Tamil  
Nadu, where the Annamalaiyar Temple, a temple of Lord Shiva is located. But i  
never been there as i wish..

Dear jpalmer,   
Yes. Arunachala is Tiruvannamalai. Siva there is called   
Arunachaleswara or Annamalaiyar. Before you decide to visit,   
kindly refer, if you want, the various guidances mentioned   
under the Topics Arunachala and Asramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Pranayams to everyone.   
Let me share the experience of arunachala.   
In April 1998, we(me and my uncle) decided to do first giripradakshanam and  
started our journey to arunachala from madras. I had a small bag with a rudram  
book, a walk-man with rudram tape, and rayban sunglasses and a a dhoti. My  
uncle had a rurdram book, some camphors and a dhoti.   
When we started our journey,I mentioned to my uncle that we need to buy some  
matchboxes for litting the camphor's when we worship the different lingams and  
he nodded on the same. In next couple of minutes a seller came in the bus,  
offering to sell cigarette lighters for Rs5 each and my uncle bought couple of  
it. I objected to this, and he argued with me that Agni is all the same,  
whether in lighter or in a matchbox.   
We reached arunachala in the evening, and being a chitra full moon on that  
day, the devotees rush was heavy. From the entrance of the temple, we took an  
auto, and he mentioned that one way trip is Rs.15 to ramanashram, and we  
agreed. All of a sudden, when we were getting down, in ramanashram, the auto  
driver mentioned that we can pay Rs25 for the round trip and he will wait in  
the gates of ramanashram to get us back to the temple. we agreed. He  
mentioned, that we can leave the bag in the auto itself, and he will take care  
of them.   
When we came back, the auto was gone. We walked back to the temple and my  
uncle was cursing the fate. I mentioned that if the belongings were us, then  
it will return else it is gone. My uncle snubbed me, that I am so much  
philosophical.   
When we reached the entrance of the temple, suddenly the same auto driver came  
in front of us and started apologizing to us and he mentioned that he got a  
trip in ramanashram and came to temple and vowed to returned back in next  
20minutes, thinking that we will stay at least an hour in ramanashram. We were  
delighted and surprised, how he could have found us in the millions of people  
on that full moon day. He brought us both of the bags and handed over and  
started leaving. In the spur of moment, I realized that we had not paid his  
trip fare, and called him again to handover his Rs15. He took and in a split  
second gone.   
Then only, we noticed that we had not checked our belongings in his presence,  
and hurriedly looking for it. Surprising mine was everything there( glass,  
walk man, book, dhoti) and also of uncles except the...   
lighter.   
My uncle was moved in tears, and he realized that even though the agni is all  
same, still the channel is most important for enlightenment.   
I have a strong prayer for arunachala, and like to see the place with  
cleanliness since it is one of the sacred places of the universe. I am eagerly  
waiting for the day, when arunachala answer's my prayers.   
I have many spiritual experiences with arunachala, and I will write in the  
blog often.

Dear Maheswaran,   
Welcome to the blog.   
Your post about Girivalam. Such miracles, big or small do happen   
in and around the Hill. The Hill itself is a mystery. Please do   
write about your experiences for us to share.   
Once I met Mr.J. Jayaraman, the Librarian in the centenary library at   
about 2.30 PM, on an afternoon, (I was given accommodation   
in the Morvi Guest House). He was talking to me for quite some   
time and told me about great advaita books written in Tamil   
Verses. Most of us know only about Vivekachoodamani and   
Kaivalya Navaneetham. Mr. J said that there are 16 such books.   
Next morning, I went for Girivalam and was seeing the Lingams   
and also went to Isanya Math at the eastern side. I went inside   
the Isanya Desikar Math and prayed to the Lingam. There, the priest showed me  
some books published by Kovilur Math and sold   
there, all brand new books. I could get three volumes and it   
contained 9 of the 16 books mentioned by Mr. J. I also purchased   
one set for Mr. J and gave it to him next morning.   
Miracles do happen __ even today!   
Arunachala Siva.
