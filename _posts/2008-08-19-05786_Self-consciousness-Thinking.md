## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Reason Why Angaraparna Addresses Arjuna As 'tapatya'  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 18, 2010, 01:10:57 PM

**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 173 - 177**   
Pandavas, along with their mother start walking towards Panchala, to obtain  
Draupadi as their wife. At nightfall they reach the banks of river Ganga. A  
gandharva king by name Angaraparna (Blazing chariot), was bathing in that  
river along with his wives and retinue.   
Arjuna approaches water to quench thirst, and the gandharva challenges Arjuna  
for a fight, saying that during nightfall, men are not supposed to enter  
Ganga.   
Arjuna asks Gandharva, why he fought with them, chastised them for entering  
Ganga, as they are not at fault. Angaraparna replies "Even though you are not  
at fault, and I know that you are from Kuru race, I also know the knowledge  
and power of your preceptor Drona, I also know that you five brothers are  
noble and well learned, and good fighters, yet I censured you.   
The reason is, you have completed your studies, yet you have not taken a wife  
and you have not taken up any mode of life and wandering in forest. Lastly,  
being of nobility, you dont have a priest who can guide you on the path of  
virtue, you have not appointed one."   
Gandharava addresses Arjuna as 'Tapatya'. Arjuna was curious to know why he is  
called as Tapatya, as he is son of Kunti and should be called as Kaunteya.   
Gandharva king Angaraparna then tells him the story of Tapati, daughter of  
Surya the sun god.   
There was a king named Samvarana, was a just ruler of earth. Once when he was  
on a hunting expedition, he saw the daughter of Sun god, Tapati, in a dazzling  
golden light. He immediately falls in love with that damsel and requests her  
hand. She says, only her father, Surya can determine who has to be her  
husband. Samvarna then, prays to his chief priest Sage Vashishta, who ascends  
to the world of light, illuminated by Surya and requests his daughter's hand  
for Samvarna. Sun god agrees to that and marries off his daughter tapati to  
Samvarana. They have a illustrious son by name Kuru, on whose name the entire  
race is known as Kauravas.   
 **On Hearing this story Arjuna wanted to know about Sage Vashishta.**   
Gandharva then tells about Sage Vashishta, "Vashishta is the foremost among  
sages. he is the manasa putra (mind-born son) of the creator Brahmaji. His  
wife is Arundhati. He has fully conquered all the 6 enemies of any person, viz  
kama (unreasonable desires), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment  
and delusion), madha (pride) and matsarya (jealousy).   
He is conversant in all Vedas. King Vishwamitra, to spite Vashishta has killed  
all his sons. Even then Vashishta did not retaliate, and exterminate the race  
of Kusikas, to which Vishwamitra belongs. Instead he forgave him. He could  
have brought back his children from the world of death, through his ascetic  
power. Even that he did not do, as he does not want to interfere in natural  
order of things. He has helped many Kings, by being their priest, in putting  
them on the path of virtue. So, O Tapatya, you should also appoint a good  
priest for you."

Is it true that when the attention in "I"thought goes outwards it becomes  
thinking and when it turn inwards it remains as self-conscious being?

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, When the thoughts go outwards, these   
are Jagat-Jeeva-Isvara. These are unreal. When the thoughts   
go inwards it is self-enquiry. Nevertheless, both are thoughts.   
This inward thought ultimately curls up into the Self. Then   
there are no thoughts, the thought-less state is the Self. "Jagat   
is where everything is seen. Swarupa is where nothing is seen."   
(Who am I?)   
Arunachala Siva.

what is outward and what is inward   
To the one who thinks he is body, outward is one thing and inward is another.   
to the one who thinks he is mind, the thoughts are inward, the world is  
outward.   
to the one who knows himself as the self, the mind is outward too ! But then,  
suddenly, what is inward and what is outward ! there then, is nothing outward,  
only inward !   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
 We are ordinary human beings functioning with body bound"I",so in our present state of understanding outer and inner   
seems to be real because we feel outer is separate and contrary to us.So while  
dealing with them we have use the words outer and inner for the sake   
of understanding.If you are really in a state where outer and inner is not  
relevent,there is no need for you to read all this.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Both of you are correct.   
In the mind-body complex, in which all of us are, there is   
outward and inward. All seekers who are asking doubts   
do have outwards and inwards. This is in the path to self   
enquiry. Bhagavan's suggestion is: No doubt all thoughts are   
coming, but, first restrict it to one thought: Who am I? Then,   
try to annhiilate that one thought also by merging in the Self.   
Getting angry with srkudai, dear DRPVSSN Raju, is quite natural,   
because, our thoughts are questioned by another's thoughts.   
Dear srkudai, do not feel upset, because our thoughts are   
not appreciated. When we all reach a thoughtless state, there   
will be no letters in the Forum, and on that day, when Graham   
closes the Forum, all of us are self realized!!!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 If i am angry and intolerant towards anybody just because they differ from my point of view i do not deserve to be a   
follower of Bhagawan.I feel that the purpose of questions and answers should  
not be deviated by quoting theoretical portions of   
some scriptures or sayings of the master.I feel that main purpose of forum is  
to exchange the ideas regarding practical aspect of   
self-enquiry rather than exchange of theoretical aspects only which takes us  
nowhere.Theoretically we are all self but why Bhagawan   
spent 54yrs in propagating self-enquiry,it is because we have not actualised  
the self.I feel that we should not forget the ground realities.   
Some forum members may have superior understanding than others but they should  
respond according to the present understanding   
of the questioner and they should take into account of the understanding of  
other forum members.All this i am writing in the best   
interest of Arunachala Ramana forum which gave us the opportunity to  
participate in an important subject of self-enquiry.   
Because an honorable member like sri subramanian feels that i have hurt the  
feelings of srkudai i tender my unconditional apology to srkudai.

Dear Raju,   
 I know that, at this level of conversation, you would not be angry with me for differing..   
That is the reason why i did not comment on it. Please do not apologize   
there is no reason for it.   
As Sri Ramana's disciples we are brothers along the path and we do have right  
to differ and learn from the differences.   
Love!

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Thank you for showing the care. I am not the least depressed. Differences are needed for discussions otherwise, all of us can just keep repeating the same thing and where would there be a need for discussion ?   
In any case, that post was out of good will for both of us, so thank you.  
Please do keep correcting us if we ever err.   
Love!

Dear Raju and srkudai, Nice exhange of ideas and all is well   
that ends well. As Socrates said: I have every right to say   
that you are wrong. But I have no right for stopping you   
from what you say." We are all having doubts and seek   
clarifications from other members and if they say some thing,   
it is for us to get convinced and accept or reject. But, we have   
no right to prevent their opinions/views/convictions.   
Dear srkudai, You have said: Thoughtlessness is NOT Self realization.   
I am still pondering over it. I shall not answer till I know what   
is right or wrong. But who am I to prevent you from saying what   
you feel or get convinced about?   
Arunachala Siva.

As Guru Ramana says,   
Be like an actor in a movie in the external world.   
If we look on the Self as the ego then we become the ego, if as the mind we  
become the mind, if as the body we become the body.It is the thought which  
builds up sheaths in so many ways. The shadow on the water is found to be  
shaking. Can anyone stop the shaking of the shadow? If it should cease to  
shake you would not notice the water but only the light. Similarly to take no  
notice of the ego and its activities, but see only the light behind. **The ego  
is the I-thought.** The true I is the Self.   
Just as when you walk, you involuntarily take steps, so too in your actions;  
but the thought-free state is not affected by your actions.   
In Yoga Vasishtha it is said, What is Real is hidden from us, but what is  
false, is revealed as true. We are actually experiencing the Reality only;  
still, we do not know it. Is it not a wonder of wonders?   
 **The quest Who am I? is the axe with which to cut off the ego.**
