Chapter 17: !. Ribhu: Listen to me, O Nidagha, the most secretive and the compendium of  
all systems of philosophy.   
This duality and non duality are naught. The peaceful Brahman is alone, is  
ever.   
2. I alone am the supreme Brahman. I alone am the higher than the highest. This duality and non   
duality are naught. The peaceful Brahman alone is, ever.   
3\. i alone am the peaceful Self. I alone am the all reaching. I alone am  
them pure   
Self, I alone am the eternal.   
4\. I alone am the Self in diversity. I alone am the attribute-less.I alone  
am the perpetual Self. i alone   
am the cause.   
5\. I alone am the whole world. This too am I alone. I alone am the joyous  
Self.I alone am the bestower   
of liberation.   
6. I alone am conscious. I alone am full of awareness. I alone am consciousness. I am ever the interior   
of all.   
7\. I alone am the Self of beings. All that is physical is but me. I am  
verily you, indeed I am, verily,   
I indeed am.   
8\. I alone am the individual Self, verily I am. I alone am the supreme Lord,  
ever. I alone am the Lord   
ever. I alone am myself always.   
contd.,
