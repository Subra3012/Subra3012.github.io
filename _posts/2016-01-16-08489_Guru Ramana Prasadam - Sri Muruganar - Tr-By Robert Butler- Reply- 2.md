319: Know that the perfectly pure Self will well up as a flood of deep peace in the  
hearts of those who have   
come to know reality as it really is through inquiry. What is required is to  
perform worship of that Self   
with a collected mind, so that the thoughts melt away through the power of a  
true love that is free of guile.   
358: I was without deep devotion, lacking in good qualities, a mere neophyte amidst  
the company of His   
devotees, yet within my heart my Lord bestowed the gift of grace, the  
limitless supreme bliss of divine   
silence, and I expected a unique love for Him, welling up abundantly within my  
heart.   
391: The mind that is intoxicated with the sense of 'I' is annihilated in the  
flooding bliss of the true knowledge   
of the Self. The consciousness that remains immersed in Sivam, unable to rise  
arrogantly (as 'I'),   
is my natural puja.   
262: As I flourished through union with the pure intelligence of the Lord, who  
destroyed my mind's defilement   
and ruled me through His grace, I saw and grasped eternal life, the  
unsurpassed bliss of the auspicious   
state of liberation, the state which is none other than the subtle awareness  
that is the supreme expanse   
of divine silence.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
