## Dry Roti and Green Chillies  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 16, 2009, 08:59:53 AM

In Norther Karnataka [ Where Purandara Dasa was born],   
that is the present Bidar, Dharward, Raichur, Bijapur districts,   
the food habit changes, from rice to roti or chapatti. There   
the poor labourers take dry rotis and green chillies for their   
lunch. They cannot afford ghee roasted rotis and sabji, vegetables. The  
Saint has sung a wonderful song with these   
badvara roti [the poor man's dry rotis] and green chillies   
hasi-mensinkai.   
The man takes first roti with three green chillies. [Chillies   
are famous in that area, we have got Bydgi chillies, Raichur   
chillies and Guntur chillies]. The roti represents the individual   
soul and three green chillies to start with, represent three   
basic traits, kama, krodha and moha. In due course, man   
is not satisified with three chillies alone. He wants the roti   
and its taste hotter, so he takes five chillies. Adding madha   
and mascharya! With these five chillies, he suffers burning   
and pain in stomach. As he becomes aged, he leaves these   
and take only the red chillies, [Red means Efflugence also]   
which are said to be less hot, if not exposed to sun. He finds Narayana or  
Siva as the only support for his roti   
i.e. individual soul!   
The green chillies also represent Prakriti or Maha Maya, the   
goddess Uma, who first shows him the pleasures of the world, which he has to  
go through, find it uninteresting at some stage and then come to Narayana or  
Siva.   
Purandara Dasa says, for the poor, only chillies are the essentials, i.e God's  
name is essential for overcoming worldly sorrows. This God's name which is  
three, Rama, Rama, Rama becomes five, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama Rama in due  
course. Badavarukku adhara.... For poor, it is the support. Then for the  
family welfare also this is the only food. Manaikku Ahara.... Then finally  
the red chillies, the glorius Vittala [Panduranga] reveals Himself as the  
avasra, the need. Bidukadaikku avasara...   
Bidukadai - Liberation.

## A Question  
Author: sky person          Date: June 15, 2009, 11:01:52 AM

Hi All   
I have a question.   
It is said that a Jnani see all others as Jnanis.   
So why did Ramana say that Lakshmi the cow became enlightened, when to him   
all are Jnanis.   
ps how does one pronounce 'Jnani' ?   
Thanks Sky ^^^ Om

Dear Skyperson,   
If I were to ask this question to myself - I'd say honestly I don't know!  
Anything more would only be a speculation and a spoon full for the thoughts to  
relish.   
So the best course would be to be wait and see it for myself. Summa Iru - Stay  
still.   
Only a Jnaani can know this. For us its mere speculation.   
Well the best spelling to pronounce Jnani would be "nnyaani" a very small "g"  
comes into play - "ingnnani" comes hidden when you pronounce where "G" is very  
little - just. 25% of its complete sound.

Dear skyperson,   
Jnani is spelt as Jnani. Some books spell it as Gnani.   
Both are correct.   
Bhagavan Ramana saw every being as Jnani. But did   
Cow Lakshmi know that it is a Jnani? Seeing every   
being as Jnana Swarupa, is the view of the Jnani.   
Since you and I can know that we are not Jnanis,   
we can speak it out to Bhagavan Ramana. The Cow   
Lakshmi could not speak to others. But it must have definitely   
spoken to Bhagavan Ramana: "I have come here specifically   
to you for deliverence or become a Jnani." You and I   
cannot listen to what other non-humans say. Nowadays   
rich men and women who breed pet dogs, speak to their   
dogs! Is it not? That is how Bhagavan Ramana also should   
have spoken to Cow Lakshmi. He called all beings as he or   
she and never as it or that. You must be knowing that.   
Further in puranas, we read that great avataras spoke   
to non human beings too. Tiru Moolar spoke to the calves   
which have lost their master. Krishna must have also spoken   
to some beings like that. Bhagavan Ramana is also an   
avatara or Jnani like Tirumoolar and Krishna. He is an   
avatara of Skanda and Tiru Jnana Sambandha. Or if you   
don't like that theory you can definitely call Him as a   
great Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

My dear non duel, Your request for clarification of certain   
Tamil words.   
Sri is literally one full of riches and virtues. It is used as a   
word of respect to each other, but is more meaningful than   
Mister. It also means 'Honourable'.   
Pranams or Namaskarams mean literally obeisances. This   
is used again towards elders and gurus. The elders and   
gurus use the word Aasirvadham which means best wishes   
and blessings.   
Namaste is the word like Greetings. It also means namaskrams   
or pranams. But this is used when one sees another person.   
Ji is a appendix after the personal noun or name to indicate   
respect. It is like saying: Non duel, sir !   
All these words are either Sanskrit or Hindi words which are   
freely used in Tamil and other Indian languages also. If you want   
classic Tamil words, which are not invariably used are: Pranams / Namaste - Vanakkam   
Ji - 'avargal'   
Sri - 'Thiru' '   
We can use to address Bhagavan as: Bhagavan Ramana, Vanakkam   
Bhagavan Ramana avargal   
Thiru Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
Infact, the Tamil word Tiruvannamalai means Thiru-Annamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.
