## The moment of Truth  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 16, 2009, 10:47:38 AM  
---  
From T.S. Eliot's Little Gidding. (1942):-   
 If you came this way,   
Taking any route, starting from anywhere,   
At any time or any season,   
It would always be the same; you would have to put off   
Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,   
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity   
Or carry a report. You are here to kneel,   
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more   
Than order of words, the conscious occupation   
Of the praying mind, or the sound of voice praying.   
And what the dead had no speech for, when living,   
They can tell you, being dead; the communication   
Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of   
 the living.   
Here the interection of the timeless moment,   
is England and nowhere. Never and always.   
Arunachala Siva.
