Dear Devotees,   
As a humble devotee like everyone of you, i felt an urge to convey that the  
devotees may please be informed that it is best to refer to the materials and  
books presented and sold by the official website of Sri Ramanasramam alone  
(http://bookstore.sriramanamaharshi.org/) As the works available in here alone  
can be considered the most authentic for your study and reflections on the  
teachings of Sri Bhagavan.   
In todays world, in times of information overload, in platforms such as  
Internet, there are plenty of information and in-depth information, analyses  
and deep study in to the teachings of Sri Bhagavan. Devotees are best advised  
to not take these materials as granted. Do not even depend on the information  
available here in this forum for granted. Always make sure about the  
authenticity of the words, statements, observations by Self Effort by checking  
if they genuinely stated by Sri Bhagavan.   
There are random information and studies available everywhere, it could prove  
be a great stepping stone in ones sadhana that might end up creating needless  
confusions. This is not to discourage reading the various information  
available instantly. There is a reason by we need to pay some money and buy  
books, for our study, than that of simply downloading pdf files from internet  
for free!   
Keep simple things fist. Go by the Rules. It will never fail.   
Thank you.

**_Association with those engaged in sense gratification is the path of  
bondage,   
while association with a saintly persons leads to liberation,even if performed  
in ignorance.   
 When one's work here is not performed for the sake of a higher, more  
righteous life,   
when one's righteous life does not lead to detachment   
and when one's detachment does not lead to devotion of the Lotus Feet of the  
Lord,   
one is a dead while being alive.

**The Name Ceremony and His Pranks**  
 **Sri Garga said: 'He, this son of Rohini, will with His transcendental qualities be the  
pleasure of all his folk. Therefore He will be called Rama. Because of His  
extraordinary strength He will also be known as Bala,and because of not  
existing separately from the Yadus, He will further be known as Sankarshana  
[the unifier]. And this one,the son of Yashoda, has according to the yuga  
accepted forms with a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna (of a  
dark complexion, see). This child previously was born somewhere else as the  
son of Vasudeva and therefore the ones who know this will speak about this  
child of yours as the glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms  
according to the qualities and activities of His appearances. These are known  
to me, but the common people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd  
this child will always act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His  
support you will easily overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past,  
when there was a faulty regime, He has protected pious souls who were  
disturbed by rogues so that they, with those bad elements defeated, could  
flourish. Just like the ones faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the  
Asuras, those who are as fortunate to associate with this child in love and  
affection, will not be overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the  
greatest care raising this child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and  
fame this son of yours is as good as Narayana!'**   
 **Sri S 'uka said: 'After Garga thus fully had informed them about the Supreme Soul [the way He  
had manifested in the form of the two boys] and had left for his place, Nanda,  
being blessed with all good fortune, considered himself most blessed. Shortly  
thereafter Rama and Kes'ava were crawling around in Gokula on their hands and  
knees enjoying their childhood. Crawling like snakes through the mud of the  
cow place while dragging their feet behind them, they produced a sweet sound  
with their ankle bells, but when they, charmed by those sounds,  
enthusiastically followed the ankle bells of other people, they became afraid  
and quickly returned to their mothers. When their mothers closed their, by the  
mud charmingly colored, bodies in their arms, they allowed them to drink from  
the milk which, because of the great love for each of their sons, flowed from  
their breasts. And when they, while they were sucking, looked into their  
mouths they were delighted with the greatest ecstasy to discover that their  
teeth were growing. From within their houses watching the children play  
outside in Vraja, they laughed and forgot their household being amused to see  
how the two boys caught the ends of the calves' tails and were dragged around  
by them. When the mothers during their household duties could not find a way  
to check Them being engaged in Their tireless play with the cows, with fire,  
with sharp-toothed animal beaks [of dogs and monkeys], with swords, water,  
birds and thorns, they were unsettled. Rama and Krishna very soon without the  
help of their knees oh King, with ease began to walk around on their legs  
alone in Gokula.**   
 **The Supreme Lord together with Balarama playing with the other kids in  
Vraja then awakened a heavenly bliss in the ladies of Vraja. The gopis were  
eager just to hear time and again about His childish pranks, assembled in the  
presence of His mother and said: 'Once He untimely released the calves and  
smiled about the anger that gave rise to. Some or another way He stole the  
palatable curd, milk and butter from the pots, ate from it and also gave each  
monkey a share. When they refuse to eat [having enough], He breaks the pot and  
when He cannot find any [food to feed the monkeys], He gets angry at the  
people of the house and goes around pinching the babies.**   
 **[With the pots] hung out of reach He devises a way by piling up things or  
turning over a mortar and then finds His way to the contents by making a hole  
in the hanging pot. Awaiting the time that the gopis are busy with their  
household affairs, He with the necessary light from the radiating jewels on  
His body manages to find His way in a dark room! He is so naughty that He  
sometimes freely urinates in a clean spot in our houses and that cunning,  
resourceful thief now sits there like a nice boy!' The gopis present there  
discussed all these matters, but when they saw Him sitting in front of them,  
looking afraid with His beautiful face, the gopis were happy to see Him. They  
with their complaints against Him truly could not be angry with Him and having  
a good time had to smile only.

**_The Glories of Srimad Bhagavatam_**  
 By the Supreme Lord,out of His mercy,this tale of wisdom was first in  
full revealed to Brahma,who fearful of a material existence sat upon the lotus  
that grew from His navel. From the beginning to the end it is filled with  
accounts on detachment, delighting the saintly and godly with the nectar of  
its many narrations about the Lord and His pastimes. In accord with the  
essence of all vedanta philosophy,it deals with the One Reality Without a  
Second, with the Absolute Truth that is non-different from the One Soul, and  
its prime goal is liberation and exclusive devotion.   
He who gives the Bhagavatam as a gift in his full glory on the day of the full  
moon in the month Bhadra [August/September] reaches the supreme destination.  
Other classical collections of stories and scriptures are prominent in the  
assembly of the saintly only for as long as one does not listen to the great  
ocean of nectar which is the Bhagavatam. The Srimad Bhagavatam indeed is said  
to be the essence of all Vedanta philosophy; someone satisfied by its  
nectarean taste is never attracted to any other influence. Of all Puranas this  
one is just like what the Ganges is in relation to all rivers flowing towards  
the sea, what Acyuta is in relation to all deities and what Shambhu [Shiva] is  
in relation to all devotees. Just like Kasi [Benares] is unsurpassed among  
all holy places, Srimad Bhagavatam is matchless among all the Puranas, o  
twice-born ones. Srimad Bhagavatam is the spotless Purana most dear to the  
devotes of Vishnu, in which the perfectly pure and supreme spiritual knowledge  
is celebrated of no one less but the best of devotees; in it is revealed,  
together with the knowledge, the detachment and the devotion, the freedom from  
all fruitive labor which will deliver that person,who serious in his  
conviction with devotion listens, studies and chants it properly.   
I meditate upon the incomparable torch light of the Immortal Truth that is  
Free from Sorrow,and long ago was revealed to the Brahma, by whom this  
transcendental knowledge,pure and uncontaminated, was spoken to Narada the  
great sage,who delivered it to Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, who next expounded it  
to the king of the yogis Sukadeva, who out of his mercy on his turn revealed  
it to king Parikchit the grace of the Fortunate One.   
 Obeisances to Him, the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Witness,who  
mercifully explained this to the deity who desired liberation. Obeisances to  
him, the king of the yogis, Sukadeva Gosvami, the personal manifestation of  
the Absolute Truth who freed Parikchit from the snake of material existence.   
O Lord, You are our Master, the Lord of the Divinity,   
therefore please make it so that we life after life at Your feet may find  
Love.   
I offer my salutations to Him, the Supreme Lord,   
whose Holy name destroys all sins,   
and by Whose Grace this misery is extinguished."

**_Bondage and Liberation Explained   
and the Saintly Person,His Devotion,Characteristics and Behavior_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: My dear Uddhava, due to the influence of the material modes of nature, which  
are under My control, the living entity is sometimes designated as conditioned  
and sometimes as liberated. In fact, however, the soul is never really bound  
up or liberated, and since I am the Supreme Lord of maya, which is the cause  
of the modes of nature, I also am never to be considered liberated or in  
bondage. There is lamentation, bewilderment, happiness, distress and the  
acceptance of a material body because of illusion. Material life repeating  
itself is merely an idea that is just as unreal as a dream. Please Uddhava,  
understand that knowledge and ignorance are two forms of Myself that, created  
by My original potency, give rise to the liberation and bondage of the  
embodied beings. The bondage of the living entity, that is part of My Oneness  
oh great intelligence, is there since time immemorial because of ignorance,and  
the opposite, liberation is there because of knowledge. Let Me now My dear,  
dilate on the different characteristics of the opposing nature of being  
conditioned and being liberated, an opposition that is found in one and the  
same practice. Two birds of a similar nature and friends of each other, one  
day make a nest in a tree. One of them eats from the fruits of the tree, while  
the other does not eat, even though he is the strongest of the two. The one  
not eating the fruits of the tree, is conscious and knows both himself and the  
other one, while the one that eats does not have a clue. The latter is always  
bound, while the one full of knowledge is eternally liberated. Although  
engaged in a body an enlightened person does not abide by the body, like  
having risen from a dream. A foolish person abides by the body even though he  
is not engaged in the body, like seeing a dream. Someone not enlightened is  
invariably obliged to the false ego that thinks in accord with the senses that  
are directed by the gunas and the sense objects. The ignorant soul who thus,  
by fate ordained, was caught here in this body because of his by the gunas  
generated karmic activities, thinks: 'I am the doer'. An intelligent person  
is not bound that way. Wherever he goes, rests, sits, walks, bathes, sees,  
touches, smells, eats, hears and so on, he is detached with the qualities he  
experiences. Though being situated in the material world, he, turned away from  
its ruling powers and assisted by the most expert and in detachment sharpened  
vision, cuts with all doubts. Just as the sky, the sun and the wind do not  
attach themselves, he neither attaches to the separateness of things, like he  
has awakened from a dream. The person whose functions of the life breath,  
senses, mind and intelligence are free from desires, is liberated, despite  
being situated in a body,that is ruled by the natural modes. One's body is  
sometimes for some reason attacked by animals or destructive people and  
sometimes one is worshiped [by a lover or a follower]. An intelligent person  
is never seriously moved when that happens. With an equal vision having moved  
beyond the notion of good and bad, a wise man will neither praise those who  
are behaving very well or speaking excellently, nor criticize others who are  
acting or expressing themselves poorly. Someone satisfied within should live  
free from acting(doership), without saying a word and not contemplating good  
or evil and that way wander around like being dumb. When someone well versed  
in the Vedic literatures is not absorbed in the Supreme, the fruit of his  
effort, his work, will be like that of someone taking care of a cow that gives  
no milk. Oh Uddhava, he who takes care of a cow that gives no milk, an  
unchaste wife, a body fully dependent upon others, children without service,  
wealth wrongly spent, and speaks about Vedic knowledge without [ever]  
mentioning Me, will suffer one misery after another. A wise person My dear  
Uddhava, will not accept words [or texts] devoid of My purifying activities or  
desired appearances as l?la-avataras for the sake of the maintenance, creation  
and annihilation of the world. When one desirous of knowledge thus gives up  
the misconception of a [material] diversity as existing [separately] of the  
soul, one should put an end to one's materialistic life and fix one's  
purified mind upon Me, the All-pervading One. In case you are not able to  
steady your mind on the spiritual platform, then dedicate, not deviating [from  
the regulative principles], all your actions to Me without expecting anything  
in return. When one with belief listens to, sings about and constantly  
remembers the narrations about My birth and activities that purify the entire  
world and also expresses them dramatically, and thereto, for My sake, under My  
protection regulates one's faith, sensual pleasure and finances [the  
purushartas], one will develop an unflinching devotion unto Me, the One  
Eternal, oh Uddhava. By the devotion as acquired in the [sat-sanga]  
association with devotees, someone very easily will be able to attain My  
refuge that those pure souls undoubtedly will show him.'  
**The Supreme Lord said: 'When someone is merciful, causes no harm, is tolerant towards all embodied  
beings, is firmly anchored in the truth, an irreproachable soul, is equal-  
minded and helpful towards everyone; when someone is of an intelligence that  
is not disturbed by material desires, is of restraint, is soft-natured, pure-  
hearted, non-possessive, not worldly, eats little, is peaceful, steady, has Me  
for his shelter and is thoughtful; when someone is vigilant, a profound soul,  
of a firm resolve, has conquered the shath-guna [different forms of material  
misery], offers respect, inspires, is friendly, compassionate and learned;  
when someone knows the qualities and shortcomings as taught by Me, and,  
worshiping Me, is even willing to give up all his religious preferences, he  
belongs to the best of the truthful ones. Whether someone knows Me like this  
or not, knows who I am or how I exist, when he is exclusively devoted to Me, I  
count him among the best devotees. Seeing, touching and worshiping My  
appearance in this world, My devotees render service and offer prayers of  
glorification and obeisance, to which they regularly sing about My qualities  
and activities. Hearing the topics about Me they always with faith meditate  
upon Me oh Uddhava, and offer as servants in full surrender all that they  
acquire. Discussing My birth and activities they take great delight in  
engaging with musical instruments and songs and dance, with discussions and  
festivals in My sacred houses. Sacrificing at all celebrations and annual  
festivities as mentioned in the Vedic literatures and their tantras, they  
observe vows and are of initiation in relation to Me. With faithfully  
installing My deity they endeavor, for themselves as also for others, by  
working for flower gardens, orchards, playgrounds, cities and temples. Sincere  
as servants they serve Me by thoroughly cleaning and dusting the house or the  
temple, washing it with water, sprinkling it with scented water and making  
mandalas. Modestly without pride, not advertising their devotional service  
they not even use for themselves the light of the lamps presented to Me and  
offer Me articles most dear to them or most desirable in the material world.  
With that kind of offering one qualifies for immortality.   
 The sun, the fire, the brahmins, the cows, the devotees, the sky, the wind,  
the water, the earth, the self and all living beings, My dearest, constitute  
the places of My worship. In the sun one can find Me by offering selected  
verses from the three Vedas (Gayatri and the Surya-namskar]. In fire one finds  
Me with oblations of ghee. One can find Me as the best among the scholars when  
one worships Me by offering them hospitality. With the cows, My dear, you  
reach Me by means of offerings of grass and such. One finds Me in the devotees  
by honoring them with loving friendship. I am found in the sky [of one's inner  
space] when one is fixed in meditation in the heart. In the air one finds Me  
by considering it the most important [life giving principle of prana, by means  
of pranayama]. In water one can find Me by using articles of worship together  
with water. In the earth [one finds Me] with confidential mantras and within  
the self one can find Me by offering food to the embodied soul. One may  
worship Me as the knower of the field in all living beings by seeing Me as  
equally present everywhere. Peacefully being absorbed in Me thus meditating  
these different places, one should be of worship for My transcendental form  
that is equipped with the conch shell, the disc, the club and the lotus  
flower. Someone who with his mind fixed on Me thus worships Me with pious  
works [as mentioned], obtains loving service unto Me and has My remembrance  
because of his fine service.   
Oh Uddhava, apart from the loving devotion(dedication) realized through  
association(satsanga) with My devotees, there are no means that actually work,  
for I am the path of life, the refuge, for the ones of virtue.

**_The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra_**   
_Upon the prayers of the God-conscious,from the great king Dasaratha,the  
Absolute Truth appeared in four forms,the Supreme Lord in person and three  
expansions of Him; they were thus known as Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and  
Satrughna. O King,you have more than enough heard through the nice  
descriptions by the many seers and knowers of the Reality of His  
transcendental exploits as the husband of Sita. Faithful to the teachings  
[answering to a promise his father made] He abandoned the royal position and  
wandered from forest to forest on His bare lotus feet that were as tender as a  
hand palm, accompanied by His loved ones,Sita and Lakshmana, who relieved Him  
of His fatigue on the path. _**   
**_He was [by Ravana] separated from His sweetheart Sita because of  
disfiguring Shurpanakha [the sister of Ravana who got her nose cut off],and  
found support from His loyal devotee and servant, the king of the monkeys  
Hanuman. Over the ocean, that was afraid of His eyebrows raised in anger,the  
bridge was constructed to Lanka, the residence of Ravana,and He became, like a  
forest fire,burning the envious ones, the king of Ayodhya. May His mercy be  
upon us._**   
_May His Mercy be upon us, who in sage Vis 'vamitra's arena of sacrifice,  
in the presence of Lakshmana, killed the great chiefs of the Rakshasas, the  
wanderers of the dark that were headed by Marica.   
It was He,who of all the heroes in the world in the hall where Sita would  
select her husband,took up the mighty bow of Shiva that had to be carried by  
three hundred men. Fastening the string, o King, and bending it broke the bow  
in two,the way a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugar cane. By the victory He  
gained the hand of the divine girl named Sita, who in her qualities, behavior,  
age and limbs was a perfect match for Him,she the Goddess of Fortune who had  
acquired a position on His chest. On His way home with her, He met and  
defeated, the deep-rooted pride of Bhrigupati [Parasurama] who three times  
[seven, thus twenty one times] had rid the earth of the seed of the [burden of  
unrighteous] rulers. Bowing His head to the command of His father, who in his  
attachment had made a promise to his wife that He had to abandon the kingdom,  
residence, opulence, relatives and friends, He with his wife left to live in  
the forest like a liberated soul. Living there He, as He wandered around, met  
with great difficulties. He maimed the body of the Rakshasa's sister [Ravana]  
because she had a [by lust] spoiled mind and then, with His invincible bow and  
arrows in His hands, had to kill the fourteen-thousand of her many friends  
headed by Khara, Tris'ira and Dushana._**   
_Oh king, when the ten-headed Ravana heard the stories about Sita, it  
stirred his heart and made him lust to see her. [The demon] Marica in the form  
of a golden deer then lured Rama away from their stay,and was killed by Him  
with a sharp arrow just as Shiva killed Daksha. While He and His brother  
were in the forest, the unprotected daughter of the king of Videha [or  
Janaka],Sita, was kidnapped by the most wicked Rakshasa. Rama then wandering  
around like a man who, attracted to women, is in distress being separated  
from his wife, thus gave an example of how and where attachment all leads to.  
After having performed the funeral rites for him who had died for His sake  
[the eagle Jathayu], He killed Kabandha [a headless monster] and became  
friends with the leaders of the monkey hordes so that He, informed by them  
about Sita, could deliver her. He whose feet are worshiped by Brahma and  
Shiva, but appeared as a normal man, next killed Valli [a wicked brother of  
Hanuman]. Then He, accompanied by the monkey soldiers, proceeded to the shore  
of the ocean. The [god of the] ocean silent with fear because of His angry  
glance - from which all the crocodiles and sharks were agitated - carried, in  
assuming a personal form, on his head all that was needed to worship Him and  
said, upon reaching the lotus feet, the following: 'We, the dull-minded, are truly not capable, oh Supreme One, to know You as  
the one Original Person and Supreme Master of all Universes who resides in the  
core of the heart. For the God-conscious ones are the result of Your goodness,  
the controllers of the people have resulted from Your passion, while the  
rulers of the material elements sprang from Your mode of ignorance. But You oh  
Lord, are the Master over all these modes. You may cross [my waters] as You  
like! Just conquer that son of Vis'rava called Ravana who is like urine to the  
three worlds and thus regain Your wife oh hero. Build a bridge here and Your  
fame will spread. In the future the great kings and heroes from all directions  
will glorify You for it.' _**   
**_After the Master of the Raghu dynasty with all sorts of mountain peaks,with  
trees and plants, that were transported by hand by the mighty monkeys, had  
constructed a bridge in the ocean, He, helped by the directions of Vibhishana  
[a virtuous brother of Ravana], together with the soldiers led by Sugriva,  
N?la and Hanuman set foot on [the island of] Lanka, that just before had been  
set afire [by Hanuman 's tail]. There the houses of pleasure, granaries,  
treasuries, palace doors and city gates, assembly houses, turrets and [even  
the] pigeon houses were taken by force and dismantled by the Vanara [monkey]  
leaders who, just like an elephant herd, turned the squares and crossroads  
with all their flags and golden water pots on the rooftops, into one swirling  
river. All the Rakshasa soldiers with their hard to defeat swords, lances,  
bows, barbed missiles and spears, firebrands, javelins and scimitars [a curved  
sword], lined up in front of Him who was surrounded by Sugriva, Lakshmana,  
Hanuman, Gandhamada, N?la, Angada, Riksha, Panasa and others.The commanders of  
the soldiers of the Ruler of the Raghu dynasty [Rama], together hurried  
forward to fight the enemy followers of Ravana moving on foot and seated on  
elephants, chariots and horses who, condemned by the anger of mother Sita,  
were out of luck in the battle. With trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows  
they were all killed by the [monkey] warriors lead by Angada and others. The  
Rakshasa leader seeing that his forces were defeated, thereupon fuming with  
anger drove his vehicle towards the brilliantly radiating Rama who, seated on  
the shining chariot of Indra that Matali [the driver] had brought, struck him  
with the sharpest arrows. Rama said to him: 'You scum of the earth, since you  
oh criminal, like a dog have kidnapped My helpless wife, I, as Time itself, as  
someone not failing in His heroism, will personally punish you today for that  
shameless act, you abominable evildoer!'   
 Thus rebuking him He released the arrow He had fixed on His bow and that  
arrow pierced his heart like a thunderbolt. Vomiting blood from his ten mouths  
he fell down from his heavenly vehicle. His men then roared: 'Alas, what has  
happened to us?', just like pious people do when they fall down.

**_cont..._**   
_Thereafter the many thousands of wives of the demons, headed by  
Mandodar[Ravana 's wife], came out of Lanka and lamented upon approaching  
[their dead husbands]. Embracing their beloved ones and their friends who were  
all killed by Lakshmana's arrows, they beat their breasts and cried pitiably,  
which [for the victors] was something pleasant to hear:  'Oh alas, now he has been killed who has protected us all! Oh Ravana, cause  
of our cries, now the state of Lanka bereft of your good self turn for  
shelter, is defeated by the enemy? Oh greatest patron, under the spell of  
lusty desires you, not knowing the influence of mother Sita, have arrived at a  
situation like this. Because of what you did oh glory of the dynasty, we and  
the state of Lanka are now without a protector, your body is there as fodder  
for the vultures and your soul is destined for hell.'   
Sri Suka said: 'Vibhishana,with the approval of the King of Kosala [Rama],  
performed for the family the funeral rites that for a deceased one have to be  
observed in order to save him from hell. The Supreme Lord thereupon found His  
sweetheart [Sita] back in an ashoka forest sitting in a small cottage at the  
foot of a shimshapa [as'oka] tree. Sick from being separated from Him she was  
emaciated. Rama seeing the poor plight of His sweetheart was filled with  
compassion. When she saw her beloved, her lotus-like mouth was overwhelmed  
with a great joy. The Supreme Lord put Vibhishana in charge of the rule over  
Lanka's Rakshasas for the duration of a kalpa. He placed Sita on His vehicle  
and then ascended Himself together with Hanuman and the brothers [Lakshmana  
and Sugr?va the commander] to return to His home town [Ayodhy?] and conclude  
the period of the vow [that He would stay away for fourteen years]. To  
celebrate His uncommon activities He on His way was showered with a choice of  
fragrant flowers offered by the higher class and was joyfully praised by the  
seer of the Absolute Truth [Brahma] and the ones belonging to him. Lord  
Ramacandra, the One of Great Compassion, was very sorry to hear that His  
brother Bharata was lying down on a kus'a mat, had matted locks, ate barley  
cooked in cow's urine and had covered Himself with tree bark. Bharata hearing  
about His arrival took the two sandals on His head [that Rama had left behind  
on the throne to represent Him] and came, accompanied by all citizens, the  
ministers and the priests, to welcome His eldest brother. Departing from His  
camp Nandigrama He was accompanied by songs, the sounds of musical  
instruments, the constant recitation of mantras performed by brahmins, by gold  
embroidered flags on golden chariots that were pulled by the most beautiful,  
with gold caparisoned horses and by soldiers in gold covered armor.  
Approaching in procession with nicely dressed courtesans and servants as also  
with soldiers on foot and everything else that would befit a royal reception,  
like the wealth of all kinds of jewelry, He fell down at the lotus feet with  
an ecstatic love that softened the core of His [ascetic] heart and filled His  
eyes with tears. Placing the two slippers before His brother, He stood with  
folded hands and tears in His eyes. Then He was embraced by Rama who, bathing  
Him with the water from His eyes, held Him in His arms for a long time. Rama,  
Lakshmana and Sita together offered the scholars and the others worthy of  
worship personally their obeisances and also received these in return from all  
the citizens. Seeing their Lord returning after so many years the citizens of  
Kosala waved with their upper garments, offered Him garlands and began to  
dance in great jubilation. The sandals were carried by Bharata, the whisk and  
luxurious fan were carried by Vibhishana and Sugriva, a white parasol was  
carried by the son of the wind god [Hanuman] and the bow and two quivers were  
carried by S'atrughna. Sita held the waterpot with water from the holy places,  
Angada held the sword made of gold and the King of the Rikshas [Jambavan, the  
leader of the bears who also participated in the war] held the shield oh King.  
Sitting on Kuvera's heavenly chariot [the 'Pushpaka' captured from Ravana] He,  
the Supreme Lord devotedly being worshiped by the women and the reciters oh  
King, appeared as brilliant as the moon risen among the planets._**   
_After properly being welcomed by His brother He was festively received in  
the city of Ayodhya. Upon entering the royal palace He paid mother Kaikeyi,  
His other stepmothers and His own mother [Kaus 'alya] His respects. The  
spiritual teachers, friends of their age and the youngsters were all of  
worship and their welcome was returned befittingly by Rama, the princess of  
the Videhas [Sita] and Lakshmana. The mothers reviving like bodies awakening  
from sleep, while keeping their sons on their lap, wetted them with a  
continuous flow of tears in letting go of their grief [over having been  
separated for so long]. According to the vidhi the matted locks were shaven  
off by the family priest [Vashishthha] and the elders of the family, after  
which, with the water of the four oceans and other paraphernalia, a bathing  
ceremony was performed like it was done for King Indra. Thus having been fully  
bathed, nicely dressed, decorated and garlanded, He shone brightly with His  
brothers and His wife. Pleased with the surrender [of His brother] He accepted  
the throne offered to Him, as also the citizens who, serving according to  
their nature with their status orientation, all deserved His protection for  
that quality. Rama was therein just like a father and was by them therefore  
also accepted as their father.   
Although this all happened in Treta-yuga, the period became like Satya-Yuga  
because of Rama's presence as the ruling king,who with His full respect of  
dharma,made all living beings happy. The forests, the rivers, the hills and  
the mountains, the lands, the islands, the oceans and the seas offered all the  
living beings all they could wish for oh best of the Bharatas. During the  
period that Rama, the Lord in the Beyond, was king, there was no suffering, no  
disease, old age, bereavement, distress, lamentation, fear and exhaustion or  
dying against one's will. Having sworn that He would not take another woman  
He, as a saintly king pure in His character and dharma, by His personal  
dutifulness was an example for the householders. Sita in loving service of her  
husband was, because of her good character, always humble and submissive.  
Being chaste and afraid [to make mistakes], she bashfully with understanding  
for her husband's position captivated His mind.'_**

**_Dhruva Leaves Home for the Forest_**  
 **Maitreya said:  'None of the the Kumaras or the other sons of Brahma: Narada, Ribhu, Hamsa,  
Aruni and Yati, lived a householder's life, for they were celibate [urdhva  
retasah, sending their seed upwards]. Oh slayer of enemies, Mrisha, the wife  
of [another son of Brahma called Irreligion or] Adharma produced the two  
children Dambha [Bluffing] and Maya [Cheating], but they were taken by a demon  
ruling the south-west called Nirriti who had no children. From those two Lobha  
[Greed] and Nikrita [Cunning] were born oh great soul. And from the both of  
them there were Krodha [Anger] and Himsa [Malice]. From these two [also  
irreligiously being bound in incest] Kali and the sister called Durukti  
[Harsh Speech] were born. Oh best of the truthful, bound to Durukti Kali  
produced Bhaya [Fearfulness] and Mrityu [Death] and of those two combined  
Yatana [Excessive Pain] and Niraya [Hell] took birth. I thus explained to you  
in short the cause of the devastation [of landing in hell because of  
irreligion]. Someone who hears this description three times o pure one, will  
lead a pious life and see the contamination of his mind being washed away.   
 Next I will describe the dynasty famous for its virtuous activities, oh best  
of the Kurus, that evolved from the Manu called Svayambhuva, who was a part of  
a plenary portion of the Supreme Lord. Uttanapada and Priyavrata, the two sons  
of Queen Satarapa and her husband were, as parts of of the Supreme Lord  
Vasudeva, there for the protection and maintenance of the world. Of the two  
wives of Uttanapada, Suniti and Suruci, Suruci was far more dear to the  
husband than the other one Suniti, who had a son called Dhruva. When the king  
one day was patting the son of Suruci named Uttama whom he had placed on his  
lap, he turned away Dhruva who also tried to get on his lap. Queen Suruci who  
was very proud enviously spoke to Dhruva, the child of the co-wife that tried  
to get on his lap, in such a way that the king could hear it. 'My dear child,  
you don't deserve to seat yourself where the king sits because, even though  
you were born as a son of the king, you were not born from my womb. Oh child,  
you don't understand that, because you are not my own but from the womb of  
another woman, the thing you desire is out of your reach. You can seat  
yourself on the throne of the king if you want, but only if you, by means of  
penance, have satisfied the Lord and by His mercy have found a place in my  
womb for yourself [to be born again].'**   
 **Maitreya said: 'Pierced by the harsh words of his stepmother, he out of anger began to  
breathe heavily as a snake struck by a stick, and when he saw his father  
silently looking on, he began to weep and ran away to his mother. Having  
heard from the others what had happened Suniti lifted her heavily breathing  
son whose lips were trembling on her lap, feeling very sorry over what was  
said by the co-wife. Losing her composure she cried with a fire of grief which  
burned like dry leaves and when she remembered the things said by the other  
wife she spoke through the haze of tears that fell from her lotuslike face.  
Not knowing how to curb the anger the lady breathed heavily and said to her  
son: 'Do not wish others anything inauspicious my dear son, a person will have to  
suffer himself from the ill he wishes others. The truth of what mother Suruci  
has told you,about having taken birth from the womb of me, the unfortunate  
one, and that you grew up on the milk from my breast, is that the king feels  
ashamed, he regrets it to have accepted me for his wife. (19) All that your  
stepmother has told you is true. If you want to sit on the throne just like  
Uttama, then just engage yourself without being envious my dear son, in  
worshiping the lotus feet of Adhokshaja, the Lord of Transcendence. The  
unborn One, your great-grandfather Brahma, no doubt acquired his supreme  
position in the universe and the qualifications to create, from worshiping the  
One whom we know by His lotus feet and who can be approached by those who in  
self-regulation have conquered the mind. Likewise Manu, your worshipable  
grandfather, achieved liberation and the heavenly and earthly happiness that  
is so difficult to achieve by other means, because he was of an unflinching  
devotion and great charity. Take shelter with Him, the Kindhearted One my  
dear boy, for people who want to get liberated follow the path of His lotus  
feet. Worship the Supreme Lord by fixing your mind upon His image, thinking of  
nothing else and being faithful to your original sense of duty with Him.  
Looking for someone else I wouldn't know any one but the Lord with the lotus  
eyes who could mitigate your sorrow. Even de Goddess of Fortune who is  
worshiped by others my dear, is always with a lotus flower in her hand looking  
for Him.'   
Maitreya said: 'Thus having heard the purposeful words of the mother he,  
mindfully keeping himself under control, left his father's house. Narada who  
came to hear about it and understood his intentions, was surprised and with  
the hand that could expel all sin touching his head he exclaimed: How  
wonderful are the powerful ksatriyas! They cannot tolerate even a slight  
infringement upon their prestige. Just imagine! This boy is only a small  
child, yet harsh words from his stepmother proved unbearable to him. Narada  
then said: 'Why is it that you, a child normally fond of sports and games, at  
present feel insulted because of not being respected? My dear Dhruva, if you  
feel that your sense of honor has been insulted, you still have no cause for  
dissatisfaction. This kind of dissatisfaction is just an illusion; every  
living being is controlled by his previous actions, and therefore there are  
different varieties of life for enjoying or suffering. Therefore you should be  
satisfied oh dear one. Whatever it is that fate has in stall for a person, is  
by someone who is intelligent recognized as a way leading to the Supreme. But  
the yoga your mother told you to do for elevating yourself to His mercy, is to  
my opinion too difficult for a person like you. The greatest sages even, who  
were on the path of detachment for many births, in the trance of their strict  
yoga practice never came to understand what they were looking for. Stop  
therefore now with this insistence of yours, it'll take you nowhere. Save that  
[quest] for the future, then you'll find ample opportunity [to engage in adult  
matters like these]. Any embodied soul who is of peace with whatever happiness  
or distress that destiny reserves for him, can reach the Light. With someone  
better one should be pleased, with someone of a lesser quality one should be  
compassionate and with someone equal one should be friendly. Thus fostering no  
desires one is never affected by tribulations.'

**Dhruva said: 'This balance of mind you talk about oh Lordship, is a quality of people who  
are merciful with those less wise, but for persons like us it is very  
difficult to see it the way you said it. I was born a ruler and I'm not that  
tolerant. Pierced by the harsh words of mother Suruci I cannot have a heart  
like you. Please tell me about an honest way to pursue my desire for a  
superior position in the three worlds oh brahmin, a position not even  
attainable for others like my father, grandfather and forefathers. You as a  
worthy descendant of Brahma playing the vina, alike the sun travel all around  
the world for the sake of its welfare.'   
Maitreya said: 'Narada was very pleased to hear what Dhruva said, whereupon he  
compassionately replied to give the boy good advice. Narada told him: 'The path your mother told you about,of fully absorbing yourself in rendering  
service to the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, constitutes the highest perfection in  
life. For him who seeks the supreme benefit of the self by what is known as  
dharma, artha,kama and moksha, the worship of the Lord His lotus feet is the  
only way. For that purpose, my dear, go with my blessing to the bank of the  
Yamuna and be purified by the sacredness of the Madhuvana forest where the  
Lord is always present. When you have taken a bath in that river, - which  
performed correctly three times a day is a most auspicious thing to do - you  
should sit down on a sitting place you have prepared. You should meditate upon  
the Supreme Spiritual Master with an undisturbed mind. Thereto you must, in  
relation to the life breath and the senses, gradually with the help of the  
threefold breath control [of pranayama: controlling the ingoing, the outgoing  
and balanced breath] give up the impurities of your mind. Always prepared to  
be merciful meditate on the Lord, on Him who with His pleasing mouth and  
enchanting look, His straight nose, arched eyebrows and intelligent forehead,  
is the beauty of the demigods. Youthful, attractive in all His limbs and with  
lips and eyes as reddish as a rising sun, He, as the shelter of the  
surrendered souls who is transcendental in every respect, is the one offering  
protection. Marked with the Srivatsa [a few white hairs on His chest] and of a  
deeply bluish [gray] color, He is the original Personality garlanded with  
flowers, showing the conch shell, the disc, the club and lotus flower in His  
four hands. The garments of yellow silk He wears are complemented by a helmet,  
pearl earrings, a necklace, bracelets and the Kausthuba jewel. Pleasing as  
well the eye as the mind, He has small bells of gold around His waist and His  
ankles,and is of a superior calm, peace and serenity. He occupies His place on  
the whorl of the lotus of the hearts of those who in worship unite with His  
glittering lotus feet. You should this way regularly envision the smiling of  
the Lord who is so affectionate with the devotees, and thus fully attentive  
let your mind meditate upon the greatest of all benedictors. The mind thus  
meditating the very auspicious form of the Supreme Lord is, being  
transcendentally enriched, very soon freed from all material contamination and  
will never wander off from that position.**   
 **Please hear from me the very, very confidential mantra to pray oh prince,  
from which recited aloud for seven days a person may behold what moves through  
the ether [planets, heavenly beings, thoughts]. 'Om namo bhagavate  
vasudevaya' [my respects for the Supreme Lord Vasudeva]. With this mantra  
[called the dvadas'akshara mantra] the learned one conversant with the  
differences according to time and place should exercise respect for the  
physical appearance of the Lord the way it should be done with the help of the  
different paraphernalia. One purifies with the help of water, garlands of  
forest flowers, roots, different fruits and vegetables, fresh grass, buds,  
bark and by offering tuls? leaves, which are very dear to the Lord your  
master. You can [being alone in the forest] begin with procuring and  
worshiping a deity made of physical elements like earth and water [clay], and  
therewith as a sage be of full self-control in peace,checking your speech and  
eat frugally whatever the forest offers. Meditate [thereto] upon the  
inconceivable activities that by the Supreme Lord of Wisdom in the form of an  
avat?ra were performed in order to exercise His supreme will and potencies. In  
service of the Supreme Lord you should respect Him in your heart with the  
mantras that embody Him in the way the previous teachers performed their  
devotional service as I have told you. When the Supreme Lord thus with your  
engagement in service by your body, mind and words,is worshiped with love and  
dedication, He will increase the devotion of the devotees who are sincerely  
and seriously engaged and will award them with what they desire in regard of  
the spiritual life and what belongs to it. Being serious in bhakti-yoga about  
your liberation you must in complete detachment from all sense-gratification  
unrelenting exercise a respect that is steeped in love for Him directly.'   
Thus being addressed by Narada, the son of the king circumambulated him  
offering his obeisances and went to the Madhuvana forest which, imprinted with  
the feet of the Lord, was the right place for him to be.

**Thus being addressed by Narada, the son of the king circumambulated him  
offering his obeisances and went to the Madhuvana forest which, imprinted with  
the feet of the Lord, was the right place for him to be. When Dhruva entering  
the forest thus had withdrawn himself, the respected sage thought it wise to  
pay the king a visit in his palace. Seated there comfortably, he spoke to him.  
Narada said: 'Dear King, your face appears to be withering, what are you  
thinking so deeply about? Have you lost your way with the gratification of  
your senses, the religion or the economy?'   
The king replied: 'Oh brahmin, my son, my sweet boy who is only five years old  
and actually a great personality and devotee, I have, being too attached to my  
wife and too hard-hearted, banished from here together with his mother. I  
worry whether the helpless boy whose face is like a lotus, without being  
protected by anyone in the forest, oh brahmin, isn't starving or being tired  
having laid down hasn't been devoured by wolves. Alas, how cruel I was being  
conquered by a woman. Just imagine how utterly hard-hearted I was denying him  
all affection when he out of love tried to climb on my lap.'**   
 **Narada said: 'Do not I say, do not be aggrieved about your son. He is well  
protected by the God oh master of men, you don't know how widespread His  
influence is all over the world. The boy is a master. After performing what  
is impossible for even the greatest personalities around, he, in favor of your  
reputation, will come straight back to you dear King.'   
Maitreya Muni said: 'The king, having heard what Narada told him, began to  
think about his son and neglected his opulent kingdom. Meanwhile the Original  
Personality was worshiped by Dhruva, after taking a bath and fasting that  
night, with perfect attention the way Narada had advised it. For the first  
month worshiping the Lord he only ate, to the bare necessity of preserving his  
body, fruits and berries in the morning after every third night. The next  
month the innocent boy continued his respect for the Almighty by eating every  
sixth day as mentioned, on those days preparing his food from grasses and  
leaves gone dry. With the third month passing he, fully absorbed in his  
respect for the Lord of Wisdom, Uttamas'loka, each ninth day drank water only.  
That way continuing into the fourth month, he by controlling his breath,  
meditating in worship of God, only ate air every twelfth day. By the fifth  
month in full control of his breath the son of the king, meditating upon the  
Creator, without moving stood on one leg like a column. With his mind fully  
controlled concentrating in the heart, he meditated with no other thoughts  
than the thought of the Supreme Lord His form, upon Him, the resting place for  
the senses and their objects. Keeping his mind focussed on the foundation, the  
cosmic intelligence of the reality, the master of the primal ether [pradhana]  
and the person, the Supreme Spirit, all the three worlds began to tremble. As  
he remained standing on his one leg he, the child of the king, with the one  
half [of his body] pressed down the earth with his big toe bent, just like the  
king of elephants does when he as a boat balances left and right with every  
step. Because he in the full of his meditation had stopped his breathing and  
closed all the gates of his body, he thus by confining the life air was  
suffocating all the worlds so that soon all the great souls from all places  
sought their refuge with the Lord.   
The godly said: 'We don't understand this oh Supreme Lord, the flow of the  
universal breath is obstructed! Therefore oh reservoir of goodness so kind to  
the needy, we all approach You for shelter to be saved from this calamity.'   
The Supreme Lord replied: 'Fear not, this choking of your life air happens on  
account of the son of King Uttanapada who is fully absorbed in thoughts of Me.  
I will ask the boy so strong in his determination of penance to stop with  
this. Please return to your homes.'

**_Dhruva Returns Home from the Forest_**  
 **Maitreya said: 'They [the demigods], thus being freed from all fear,  
offered the Lord of the wide strides their obeisances, upon which they  
returned to their three worlds. The Lord with the thousand faces  
[Sahasrashirsha] then got on the back of Garuda and went to the Madhuvana  
forest in order to see His servant [Dhruva]. He who strengthened by his  
meditation in yoga observed Him brilliant as lightening manifested on the  
lotus of his heart, all of a sudden noticed that He had disappeared, but  
looking around he then saw Him standing right before him in the same form.  
With Him present before him he, confounded, fell to the ground prostrating his  
body like a rod to offer Him his obeisances. As he looked at Him, it was as if  
the boy was drinking Him with his eyes, like he was kissing Him with his mouth  
and embracing Him with his arms. Seeing that he wanted to glorify Him but  
didn't know how, the Lord, who is the prayer in the heart of each,  
understanding the boy mercifully touched his forehead with His conch shell.  
Thus being inspired with the ability to say just what he wanted, he, slowly  
offering his prayers in the love of his devotion, could understand what the  
supreme of the soul was all about and that he would be the Dhruva of renown  
and fame whose world couldn't be denied.   
 Dhruva said: 'Let me offer my obeisances to You, the Supreme Lord and  
Original Person, who as the One within, from Your internal potency commanding  
the universal energy, entering my words and breath,has brought to life my  
passive senses as well as my other limbs, my hands, legs and skin. You are the  
One, Supreme Lord who, after by His own potency creating this vast outer world  
called maya, next as the Original Personality has entered here to appear  
differently in the time-bound qualities the way fire does in fire wood. Like a  
man awakening from his sleep, the one of surrender to You could see this  
entire universe by dint of the knowledge given by You oh my Lord. How can  
anyone conversant with Your actions forget Your lotus feet that are the  
shelter of all who desire liberation, oh friend of the distressed? It suffers  
no doubt that You, the cause of liberation from birth and death, are like a  
desire tree to those who, under the influence of the outer world, miss the  
proper concept of life and worship You with ulterior motives in their desire  
for the gratification of the senses of this bag of bones, a gratification that  
is even available to persons in hell. The bliss of Your magnificence,that for  
embodied souls may experience when they meditate upon Your lotus feet or when  
they hear the stories of Your devotees, is never found with the impersonal  
supreme [Brahman], nor does it compare to what is experienced in [personally]  
elevated positions from which one has to fall down being destroyed by the  
sword of death. Let it be so that I may enjoy the intimate association of  
those who are constantly engaged in Your devotional service oh Unlimited One,  
of those great devotees by whose purified hearts one can easily cross the  
terrible and vast ocean of dangers that is material existence. Let it be so  
that I go mad of drinking the nectar of the stories about Your qualities.They  
so high-principled my dear Lord, never think of the material body, their  
relating to their sons, friends, home, wealth and wife; they, oh One of the  
Lotus Navel, have achieved the association with those who in their hearts  
always hanker after the fragrance of Your lotus feet. The animals, trees,  
birds, reptiles, gods, demons and men, driven by the material energy are found  
throughout the universe in different forms of existence and are for several  
reasons seen and not seen oh Unborn One. That I know, but about this  
transcendental form, oh Supreme One I knew not, I do not know but the end of  
my argument. At the end of each epoch the Supreme Lord withdraws all of this  
universe into His belly, lying down in self-reflection in the company of  
Ananta S'esha as His bed. From the ocean of His navel the golden abode  
sprouted, with Brahma on the whorl of the lotus. Him, that Supreme Lordship I  
offer my obeisances. You are the eternally liberated, uncontaminated Supreme  
Soul full of knowledge, the changeless, authentic Original Person, the Supreme  
Lord and ruler of the three modes, the continuing intelligence throughout all  
actions of the intellect, the transcendental vision and witness, the  
maintainer, enjoyer and the one whose position differs from all the others.  
You, in whose nature always the different opposing energies of knowledge and  
ignorance are found, You who are that continuing Brahman, You the cause of the  
material manifestation, the original and unlimited One who is simply blissful,  
I offer my respects. Compared to other benedictions Your lotus feet are the  
true one oh my Lord, and thus You as such are the personification of the goal  
of life of each person oh beloved Fortunate One. You, eager to bestow Your  
mercy, maintain the ones poor of heart like me, the way a cow keeps a calf.'   
Maitreya said: 'After thus truly being worshiped by means of the fine  
intelligence of his good intentions only, the Supreme Lord who is always there  
in favor of His devotees spoke to him, after first having congratulated him.   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I know about the determination within your heart oh  
son of the king. Since you are sworn to piety, I shall grant you all the  
fortune, even though it is a wish difficult to fulfill. Never before My good  
boy, there was anyone who managed to settle for such a brightly glowing place  
known as the planet of Dhruva, around which all the other planets and  
constellations of stars are circling like a group of bulls does running  
stationary around a central pole [for crushing grain]. It is the planet around  
which, keeping it to their right, along with the stars, all great sages of the  
forest move circumambulating like Dharma, Agni, Kas'yapa and S'ukra whose  
lives stretch beyond a millennium. As soon as your father has left for the  
forest, you will be awarded the entire world. It will be under the pious  
protection of your rule uninterrupted for thirty-six thousand years in full  
control of your faculties. When your brother Uttama, being killed during a  
hunt, is sought in the forest by his most afflicted mother, she will run into  
a forest fire. After performing great sacrifices for Me, the heart of all  
sacrifice, and having distributed great charities, you will, after having  
enjoyed the blessings of this world, at the end of your life be able to  
remember Me. Thereafter you will head for My abode that is worshiped on all  
planets and is situated above those of the rishis. Having gone there, you will  
never come back.'   
...Unto anyone with whose qualities and friendship the Supreme, Lord Hari, is  
pleased, all living beings offer their respect...**

**_An Old Brahmin Friend Visits Krishna_**  
_Sri Suka said: 'There was a certain friend of Krishna called Sudama, a brahmin well versed in  
the Vedas, who was of peaceful mind,in control of his senses, and detached  
from the sense objects. As a householder he subsisted on that what came on its  
own accord. His wife was, just like him, poorly dressed and emaciated of  
hunger. Faithful to her husband,but distressed by the poverty she, with her  
face dried up and trembling legs, approached him and said: 'Is it not so oh  
brahmin, oh master of devotion, that the Husband of Sri is your friend and  
that that best one of the Satvatas is filled with compassion for the  
brahmins,willing to give them shelter? Please approach Him, my most gracious  
man, for He, the Ultimate Shelter of the Saintly Souls, will then provide you  
with abundant wealth because you have such a hard time maintaining your  
family. If the Lord of the Bhojas, Vrishnis and Andhakas who is now present in  
Dvaraka, even gives Himself to a person who just remembers His lotus feet,  
then what would the Spiritual Master of the Universe not do for people of  
worship who are not so much interested in money, success and sensual  
pleasures?'   
The brahmin who thus repeatedly was begged by his wife then thought: 'The  
sight of Uttamashloka is indeed the highest attainment.'   
He took the decision to visit Him and asked her: 'If there is anything in the  
house that I can bring as a gift my good woman, please give it to me!' She  
begged with the other brahmins for four fists of husked and parched rice,  
wrapped it in a piece of cloth and gave it to her husband to bring as a gift.   
Sudama, the best of the scholars, took it with him and on his way to Dvaraka  
wondered: 'How will I ever get this audience with Krishna?' Together with a  
couple of local brahmins the scholar passed three gates and guard stations and  
walked between the houses of Acyuta's faithful followers, the Andakas and  
Vrishnis. One normally could not go there and so he felt so blessed,as if he  
had attained the bliss of the Pure Spirit. He next entered one of the opulent  
sixteen thousand residences of the Lord's queens. Acyuta who sat on His  
consort's bed, saw him from a distance, immediately rose and came forward to  
close him gladly in His arms. The Lotus-eyed One in touch with the body of His  
dear friend, the wise brahmin, extremely ecstatic affectionately began to  
cry._**   
_Having him seated on the bed The Supreme Lord of All the Worlds fetched  
some items to honor His friend and washed his feet. Than took the same water  
on His head oh King. The Purifier anointed him with divinely fragrant  
sandalwood and aloe-wood paste and kunkuma. He gladly honored His friend with  
aromatic incense and series of lamps and offered him bethel nut and a cow.  
Next He spoke a word of welcome. The goddess was personally of service by  
carefully fanning with a yak's tail the dirty and poorly dressed, emaciated  
twice-born soul, whose veins could be seen. The people in the palace thus  
seeing Krishna engaged in His spotless reputation, were amazed about the  
intense love with which the unkempt looking soul, the avadhuta, was honored.  
'What pious deeds has he performed, this unwashed, condemned and lowly  
mendicant deprived of all prosperity in the world? How can he with reverence  
be served by the Spiritual Master of the Three Worlds who is the abode of Sri?  
Leaving the goddess sitting on her bed He embraced him as an older  
brother!'_**   
_Taking hold of each other 's hands oh King, they discussed the charming  
topics of the past when they together lived in the school of their spiritual  
master   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh brahmin, after the guru received his remuneration  
from you and you returned home oh knower of the dharma, did you marry a  
suitable wife or not? With your mind occupied by household affairs, you were  
not driven by desires and I also know that you do not take much pleasure oh  
wise soul, in the pursuit of material happiness. Some people perform their  
worldly duties without being disturbed by desires in their minds. Acting to  
set an example as I do, they shake off the propensities that naturally arise.  
Do you, oh brahmin, still remember our stay in the gurukula? It is there that  
a twice-born soul learns to understand what needs to be known and thus manages  
to transcend his ignorance. One is born twice my dear friend: after first  
being born materially, one secondly manifests through a spiritual master, a  
bestower of spiritual knowledge like Myself, who teaches what the duties are  
for all spiritual orders, or stages of life. Among those engaged in their  
duties in this world, they [who thus are twice born] are the expert knowers of  
the true welfare oh brahmin, for they cross over the ocean of material  
existence with the help of the words stemming from Me in the form of the  
spiritual master. I, the Soul of All Beings, am not as satisfied by ritual  
worship, a new life, austerity or self-control as I am by faithful service to  
the spiritual master. Oh brahmin, do you still remember what we did, when we  
were living with our spiritual master, and once by the wife of our guru were  
sent away to fetch firewood? Having entered a big forest oh brahmin, all out  
of season, a fierce harsh thundering wind arose with rain. With the sun  
having set we, with all directions covered in darkness and with all the water  
around us, could neither recognize the direction nor high or low areas.  
Constantly heavily besieged by the fierce wind and water in that flood, we did  
not know what way to go and in distress wandered through the forest holding  
each other's hands. Our guru Sandapani knew this and at sunrise set out to  
search for us, his disciples. The acarya then found us suffering.   
'Oh you children, for my sake you have to suffer heavily! In your devotion for  
me you have disregarded that what is most dear to all living beings: the  
comfort of your body! Well, this is what disciples should do to pay the debt  
to their spiritual master: being perfectly pure in their love, they must be  
willing to offer the spiritual master their very self and possessions. I am  
satisfied with you my dear boys, oh best of the brahmins. May your desires be  
fulfilled and may in this world and the next your words, your mantras, never  
lose their attraction.' Many things like this happened when we were living at  
the house of the guru. Only by the mercy of the spiritual master a person will  
find fulfillment and attain peace.'   
The brahmin said: 'What more is there for me to achieve in life oh God of  
Gods, oh Guru of the Universe, than to have lived together at the guru's house  
with You whose every desire is fulfilled? Oh Almighty One, Your body,  
constituting the fertile field of all welfare, comprises the Absolute Truth  
that is celebrated in the Vedas. Your residing with spiritual masters is  
nothing but an extraordinary role-play!

**_The Brahmin Honored: Lord Krishna the Lord of the Brahmins_**  
_Sri Suka said:  'He, Bhagavan Krishna, the True Goal of the Devotees, the Lord Who Perfectly  
Knows the Minds of All Beings, in this manner conversing with this best one  
among the brahmins, then, in His dedication to the ones of learning, laughed  
and spoke with a smile and a loving glance to His dear friend.   
The Supreme Lord said:  'What gift have you brought for Me from home oh friend? Even the slightest  
that in pure love is offered by devotees, turns into something immense for Me,  
whereas not even the greatest that is being presented by non-devotees pleases  
Me. Whoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit and water with devotion, that  
offer brought from the heart by a soul of good habits I accept  
wholeheartedly!"   
But the twice-born soul thus being addressed, was too embarrassed, bowed down  
his head and did not offer the few hands of rice grains to the Husband of the  
Goddess of Fortune, oh King. As the direct witness in the heart of all living  
beings fully aware of the reason why he had come, Lord thought: 'He worshiped  
Me in the past and never desired opulence,and he, My friend,came in order to  
keep his chaste and devoted wife happy, I will give him riches not attainable  
for [even] the immortals.' With that in mind He Himself from under the  
garment of the twice-born one snatched away the rice grains that were tied in  
a bundle and said: 'What is this? Have you brought this for Me My dear friend?  
That gives Me the greatest pleasure! These rice grains satiate Me and the  
whole universe that I am!'_**   
_Speaking thus He took a handful to eat and a second one, whereupon  
Sri[Rukmini devi], devoted to Him, the One Supreme, seized His hand for the  
beaten grains were hard to digest. 'That oh Soul of Each and Everyone, is  
enough to make a person wishing to satisfy You, prosper in this world and the  
next with all opulence available.'   
After to his satisfaction having drunk and eaten,the brahmin spent that night  
in Acyuta's palace. He thought he had attained heaven. The next day dear King,  
as he returned home, he was honored by Him, the Self-satisfied Maintainer of  
the Universe who made Sudama happy as he walked along the path. Even though he  
had received no wealth from Krishna and had been too embarrassed to ask for it  
himself, he on his way home was filled with joy about the meeting he had with  
the Great One:  'Ah, what a privilege it is to have witnessed the devotion of the Lord of the  
Brahmins for the twice-born souls. He who carries Lakshmi in His chest  
embraced the poorest wretch! Who am I? A destitute sinner! And who is Krishna?  
The temple of Sri! And He, this friend of the brahmins, closed me in His arms!  
He seated me on the bed of His consort like one of His brothers. Tired as I  
was, I was fanned by His queen holding a [yak-tail] hair fan. Being served  
with sincerity with a massage for my feet and such, I was worshiped like a  
demigod by the God of Gods, the Godhead of the Scholars! The worship of His  
feet is the root of all perfections and opulence that man in his emancipation  
may find in heaven, on earth and in the lower regions. 'If this poor soul  
acquires opulence he, delighting in excess, will not remember Me', He must  
have thought in His grace, and thus did not grant me the slightest amount of  
wealth.'   
Thus lost in thought he arrived at the vicinity of his home. There he found  
himself placed before high rising palaces rivaling the sun, the fire and the  
moon. On all sides they were surrounded by wonderful courtyards and gardens  
swarming with hordes of cooing birds, ponds full of lilies and day and night  
blooming white lotuses. There were well adorned and ornamented men and women  
with deer-like eyes.   
 'What is this, whose place is this, how could this come about?' This way  
paining his mind he was welcomed by the men and women with a luster like the  
demigods, who most fortunately loudly sang to instrumental music. His wife,  
hearing that her husband had arrived, extremely jubilant quickly appeared  
excitedly from the house like she was the goddess of fortune manifesting  
herself from her abode. Seeing the husband she was so devoted to, she solemnly  
held her head down embracing him within her heart, with closed eyes filled  
with tears because of her eagerness and love. He stood amazed at the sight of  
his wife who, shining in the midst of maidservants with golden lockets around  
their necks, radiated like a goddess. Pleased, he together with her entered  
his home,that with its hundreds of gem-studded pillars resembled the palace of  
the great Indra. There were ivory beds ornamented with gold [with bedding]  
white as foam and couches with golden legs, yak tail fans, golden chairs with  
soft cushions and canopies hung with strings of pearls. Seeing the sparkling  
clear quartz walls inlaid with precious emeralds as also the shining jeweled  
lamps and the women decorated with jewels, the brahmin, now free from worries  
with all the excessive opulence, reasoned about the cause of his unexpected  
prosperity:  'This prosperity here, of me always so unlucky and poverty stricken, must be  
the consequence of the glance that He, the Best of the Yadus who is of the  
Greatest Opulence, has cast on me. It is no doubt my Friend, the most exalted  
among the Dasharhas and Enjoyer of Unlimited Wealth, who, without saying a  
word, like a cloud [pouring rain] has given me this opulence when He, with me  
in His presence, noticed that I came begging. After having accepted with  
pleasure a palmful of roasted rice that I brought, this very day He makes  
something insignificant of the great gift He gives and something great of the  
meager gift of a friend [like me]. May there life after life, repeatedly be  
my love, friendship, sympathy and servitude for Him, the Supremely  
Compassionate Reservoir of Transcendental Qualities, as also my adherence to  
the intimate association with His devotees. The Supreme and Never Born Lord  
does not bestow the wonderful opulences - a kingdom and material assets - upon  
His devotee when he fails in understanding. In His wisdom He sees how the  
false pride [the arrogance, the conceit with the wealth, ] leads to the  
downfall of the wealthy.'   
Sudama this way firmly being fixed in intelligence, was most devoted to  
Janardana and enjoyed free from intense desire [for wealth or profit] together  
with his wife. Therewith he always kept in mind that he,sooner or later,would  
have to abandon the objects of his senses. The brahmins are even the master of  
Him, the God of Gods, Hari, the Master and Lord of Sacrifice. There exists no  
higher worshipable deity than them. By thus recognizing the Unconquerable One  
as being conquered by His own servants he, the learned friend of the Supreme  
Lord, was released from his bondage to the material self. By the force of his  
meditation upon Him he soon attained His abode, the destination of the  
truthful ones.   
The human being who hears about this sympathy for the brahmins of the Lord of  
the Brahmins, will find love for the Supreme Lord and be freed from the  
bondage of karma.

**The Name Ceremony and His Pranks**  
 **Sri Garga said: 'He, this son of Rohini, will with His transcendental qualities be the  
pleasure of all his folk. Therefore He will be called Rama. Because of His  
extraordinary strength He will also be known as Bala,and because of not  
existing separately from the Yadus, He will further be known as Sankarshana  
[the unifier]. And this one,the son of Yashoda, has according to the yuga  
accepted forms with a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna (of a  
dark complexion, see). This child previously was born somewhere else as the  
son of Vasudeva and therefore the ones who know this will speak about this  
child of yours as the glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms  
according to the qualities and activities of His appearances. These are known  
to me, but the common people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd  
this child will always act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His  
support you will easily overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past,  
when there was a faulty regime, He has protected pious souls who were  
disturbed by rogues so that they, with those bad elements defeated, could  
flourish. Just like the ones faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the  
Asuras, those who are as fortunate to associate with this child in love and  
affection, will not be overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the  
greatest care raising this child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and  
fame this son of yours is as good as Narayana!'**   
 **Sri S 'uka said: 'After Garga thus fully had informed them about the Supreme Soul [the way He  
had manifested in the form of the two boys] and had left for his place, Nanda,  
being blessed with all good fortune, considered himself most blessed. Shortly  
thereafter Rama and Kes'ava were crawling around in Gokula on their hands and  
knees enjoying their childhood. Crawling like snakes through the mud of the  
cow place while dragging their feet behind them, they produced a sweet sound  
with their ankle bells, but when they, charmed by those sounds,  
enthusiastically followed the ankle bells of other people, they became afraid  
and quickly returned to their mothers. When their mothers closed their, by the  
mud charmingly colored, bodies in their arms, they allowed them to drink from  
the milk which, because of the great love for each of their sons, flowed from  
their breasts. And when they, while they were sucking, looked into their  
mouths they were delighted with the greatest ecstasy to discover that their  
teeth were growing. From within their houses watching the children play  
outside in Vraja, they laughed and forgot their household being amused to see  
how the two boys caught the ends of the calves' tails and were dragged around  
by them. When the mothers during their household duties could not find a way  
to check Them being engaged in Their tireless play with the cows, with fire,  
with sharp-toothed animal beaks [of dogs and monkeys], with swords, water,  
birds and thorns, they were unsettled. Rama and Krishna very soon without the  
help of their knees oh King, with ease began to walk around on their legs  
alone in Gokula.**   
 **The Supreme Lord together with Balarama playing with the other kids in  
Vraja then awakened a heavenly bliss in the ladies of Vraja. The gopis were  
eager just to hear time and again about His childish pranks, assembled in the  
presence of His mother and said: 'Once He untimely released the calves and  
smiled about the anger that gave rise to. Some or another way He stole the  
palatable curd, milk and butter from the pots, ate from it and also gave each  
monkey a share. When they refuse to eat [having enough], He breaks the pot and  
when He cannot find any [food to feed the monkeys], He gets angry at the  
people of the house and goes around pinching the babies.**   
 **[With the pots] hung out of reach He devises a way by piling up things or  
turning over a mortar and then finds His way to the contents by making a hole  
in the hanging pot. Awaiting the time that the gopis are busy with their  
household affairs, He with the necessary light from the radiating jewels on  
His body manages to find His way in a dark room! He is so naughty that He  
sometimes freely urinates in a clean spot in our houses and that cunning,  
resourceful thief now sits there like a nice boy!' The gopis present there  
discussed all these matters, but when they saw Him sitting in front of them,  
looking afraid with His beautiful face, the gopis were happy to see Him. They  
with their complaints against Him truly could not be angry with Him and having  
a good time had to smile only.

**_The Glories of Srimad Bhagavatam_**  
 By the Supreme Lord,out of His mercy,this tale of wisdom was first in  
full revealed to Brahma,who fearful of a material existence sat upon the lotus  
that grew from His navel. From the beginning to the end it is filled with  
accounts on detachment, delighting the saintly and godly with the nectar of  
its many narrations about the Lord and His pastimes. In accord with the  
essence of all vedanta philosophy,it deals with the One Reality Without a  
Second, with the Absolute Truth that is non-different from the One Soul, and  
its prime goal is liberation and exclusive devotion.   
He who gives the Bhagavatam as a gift in his full glory on the day of the full  
moon in the month Bhadra [August/September] reaches the supreme destination.  
Other classical collections of stories and scriptures are prominent in the  
assembly of the saintly only for as long as one does not listen to the great  
ocean of nectar which is the Bhagavatam. The Srimad Bhagavatam indeed is said  
to be the essence of all Vedanta philosophy; someone satisfied by its  
nectarean taste is never attracted to any other influence. Of all Puranas this  
one is just like what the Ganges is in relation to all rivers flowing towards  
the sea, what Acyuta is in relation to all deities and what Shambhu [Shiva] is  
in relation to all devotees. Just like Kasi [Benares] is unsurpassed among  
all holy places, Srimad Bhagavatam is matchless among all the Puranas, o  
twice-born ones. Srimad Bhagavatam is the spotless Purana most dear to the  
devotes of Vishnu, in which the perfectly pure and supreme spiritual knowledge  
is celebrated of no one less but the best of devotees; in it is revealed,  
together with the knowledge, the detachment and the devotion, the freedom from  
all fruitive labor which will deliver that person,who serious in his  
conviction with devotion listens, studies and chants it properly.   
I meditate upon the incomparable torch light of the Immortal Truth that is  
Free from Sorrow,and long ago was revealed to the Brahma, by whom this  
transcendental knowledge,pure and uncontaminated, was spoken to Narada the  
great sage,who delivered it to Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, who next expounded it  
to the king of the yogis Sukadeva, who out of his mercy on his turn revealed  
it to king Parikchit the grace of the Fortunate One.   
 Obeisances to Him, the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Witness,who  
mercifully explained this to the deity who desired liberation. Obeisances to  
him, the king of the yogis, Sukadeva Gosvami, the personal manifestation of  
the Absolute Truth who freed Parikchit from the snake of material existence.   
O Lord, You are our Master, the Lord of the Divinity,   
therefore please make it so that we life after life at Your feet may find  
Love.   
I offer my salutations to Him, the Supreme Lord,   
whose Holy name destroys all sins,   
and by Whose Grace this misery is extinguished."

**_Bondage and Liberation Explained   
and the Saintly Person,His Devotion,Characteristics and Behavior_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: My dear Uddhava, due to the influence of the material modes of nature, which  
are under My control, the living entity is sometimes designated as conditioned  
and sometimes as liberated. In fact, however, the soul is never really bound  
up or liberated, and since I am the Supreme Lord of maya, which is the cause  
of the modes of nature, I also am never to be considered liberated or in  
bondage. There is lamentation, bewilderment, happiness, distress and the  
acceptance of a material body because of illusion. Material life repeating  
itself is merely an idea that is just as unreal as a dream. Please Uddhava,  
understand that knowledge and ignorance are two forms of Myself that, created  
by My original potency, give rise to the liberation and bondage of the  
embodied beings. The bondage of the living entity, that is part of My Oneness  
oh great intelligence, is there since time immemorial because of ignorance,and  
the opposite, liberation is there because of knowledge. Let Me now My dear,  
dilate on the different characteristics of the opposing nature of being  
conditioned and being liberated, an opposition that is found in one and the  
same practice. Two birds of a similar nature and friends of each other, one  
day make a nest in a tree. One of them eats from the fruits of the tree, while  
the other does not eat, even though he is the strongest of the two. The one  
not eating the fruits of the tree, is conscious and knows both himself and the  
other one, while the one that eats does not have a clue. The latter is always  
bound, while the one full of knowledge is eternally liberated. Although  
engaged in a body an enlightened person does not abide by the body, like  
having risen from a dream. A foolish person abides by the body even though he  
is not engaged in the body, like seeing a dream. Someone not enlightened is  
invariably obliged to the false ego that thinks in accord with the senses that  
are directed by the gunas and the sense objects. The ignorant soul who thus,  
by fate ordained, was caught here in this body because of his by the gunas  
generated karmic activities, thinks: 'I am the doer'. An intelligent person  
is not bound that way. Wherever he goes, rests, sits, walks, bathes, sees,  
touches, smells, eats, hears and so on, he is detached with the qualities he  
experiences. Though being situated in the material world, he, turned away from  
its ruling powers and assisted by the most expert and in detachment sharpened  
vision, cuts with all doubts. Just as the sky, the sun and the wind do not  
attach themselves, he neither attaches to the separateness of things, like he  
has awakened from a dream. The person whose functions of the life breath,  
senses, mind and intelligence are free from desires, is liberated, despite  
being situated in a body,that is ruled by the natural modes. One's body is  
sometimes for some reason attacked by animals or destructive people and  
sometimes one is worshiped [by a lover or a follower]. An intelligent person  
is never seriously moved when that happens. With an equal vision having moved  
beyond the notion of good and bad, a wise man will neither praise those who  
are behaving very well or speaking excellently, nor criticize others who are  
acting or expressing themselves poorly. Someone satisfied within should live  
free from acting(doership), without saying a word and not contemplating good  
or evil and that way wander around like being dumb. When someone well versed  
in the Vedic literatures is not absorbed in the Supreme, the fruit of his  
effort, his work, will be like that of someone taking care of a cow that gives  
no milk. Oh Uddhava, he who takes care of a cow that gives no milk, an  
unchaste wife, a body fully dependent upon others, children without service,  
wealth wrongly spent, and speaks about Vedic knowledge without [ever]  
mentioning Me, will suffer one misery after another. A wise person My dear  
Uddhava, will not accept words [or texts] devoid of My purifying activities or  
desired appearances as l?la-avataras for the sake of the maintenance, creation  
and annihilation of the world. When one desirous of knowledge thus gives up  
the misconception of a [material] diversity as existing [separately] of the  
soul, one should put an end to one's materialistic life and fix one's  
purified mind upon Me, the All-pervading One. In case you are not able to  
steady your mind on the spiritual platform, then dedicate, not deviating [from  
the regulative principles], all your actions to Me without expecting anything  
in return. When one with belief listens to, sings about and constantly  
remembers the narrations about My birth and activities that purify the entire  
world and also expresses them dramatically, and thereto, for My sake, under My  
protection regulates one's faith, sensual pleasure and finances [the  
purushartas], one will develop an unflinching devotion unto Me, the One  
Eternal, oh Uddhava. By the devotion as acquired in the [sat-sanga]  
association with devotees, someone very easily will be able to attain My  
refuge that those pure souls undoubtedly will show him.'  
**The Supreme Lord said: 'When someone is merciful, causes no harm, is tolerant towards all embodied  
beings, is firmly anchored in the truth, an irreproachable soul, is equal-  
minded and helpful towards everyone; when someone is of an intelligence that  
is not disturbed by material desires, is of restraint, is soft-natured, pure-  
hearted, non-possessive, not worldly, eats little, is peaceful, steady, has Me  
for his shelter and is thoughtful; when someone is vigilant, a profound soul,  
of a firm resolve, has conquered the shath-guna [different forms of material  
misery], offers respect, inspires, is friendly, compassionate and learned;  
when someone knows the qualities and shortcomings as taught by Me, and,  
worshiping Me, is even willing to give up all his religious preferences, he  
belongs to the best of the truthful ones. Whether someone knows Me like this  
or not, knows who I am or how I exist, when he is exclusively devoted to Me, I  
count him among the best devotees. Seeing, touching and worshiping My  
appearance in this world, My devotees render service and offer prayers of  
glorification and obeisance, to which they regularly sing about My qualities  
and activities. Hearing the topics about Me they always with faith meditate  
upon Me oh Uddhava, and offer as servants in full surrender all that they  
acquire. Discussing My birth and activities they take great delight in  
engaging with musical instruments and songs and dance, with discussions and  
festivals in My sacred houses. Sacrificing at all celebrations and annual  
festivities as mentioned in the Vedic literatures and their tantras, they  
observe vows and are of initiation in relation to Me. With faithfully  
installing My deity they endeavor, for themselves as also for others, by  
working for flower gardens, orchards, playgrounds, cities and temples. Sincere  
as servants they serve Me by thoroughly cleaning and dusting the house or the  
temple, washing it with water, sprinkling it with scented water and making  
mandalas. Modestly without pride, not advertising their devotional service  
they not even use for themselves the light of the lamps presented to Me and  
offer Me articles most dear to them or most desirable in the material world.  
With that kind of offering one qualifies for immortality.   
 The sun, the fire, the brahmins, the cows, the devotees, the sky, the wind,  
the water, the earth, the self and all living beings, My dearest, constitute  
the places of My worship. In the sun one can find Me by offering selected  
verses from the three Vedas (Gayatri and the Surya-namskar]. In fire one finds  
Me with oblations of ghee. One can find Me as the best among the scholars when  
one worships Me by offering them hospitality. With the cows, My dear, you  
reach Me by means of offerings of grass and such. One finds Me in the devotees  
by honoring them with loving friendship. I am found in the sky [of one's inner  
space] when one is fixed in meditation in the heart. In the air one finds Me  
by considering it the most important [life giving principle of prana, by means  
of pranayama]. In water one can find Me by using articles of worship together  
with water. In the earth [one finds Me] with confidential mantras and within  
the self one can find Me by offering food to the embodied soul. One may  
worship Me as the knower of the field in all living beings by seeing Me as  
equally present everywhere. Peacefully being absorbed in Me thus meditating  
these different places, one should be of worship for My transcendental form  
that is equipped with the conch shell, the disc, the club and the lotus  
flower. Someone who with his mind fixed on Me thus worships Me with pious  
works [as mentioned], obtains loving service unto Me and has My remembrance  
because of his fine service.   
Oh Uddhava, apart from the loving devotion(dedication) realized through  
association(satsanga) with My devotees, there are no means that actually work,  
for I am the path of life, the refuge, for the ones of virtue.

**_The Pastimes of Lord Ramacandra_**   
_Upon the prayers of the God-conscious,from the great king Dasaratha,the  
Absolute Truth appeared in four forms,the Supreme Lord in person and three  
expansions of Him; they were thus known as Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and  
Satrughna. O King,you have more than enough heard through the nice  
descriptions by the many seers and knowers of the Reality of His  
transcendental exploits as the husband of Sita. Faithful to the teachings  
[answering to a promise his father made] He abandoned the royal position and  
wandered from forest to forest on His bare lotus feet that were as tender as a  
hand palm, accompanied by His loved ones,Sita and Lakshmana, who relieved Him  
of His fatigue on the path. _**   
**_He was [by Ravana] separated from His sweetheart Sita because of  
disfiguring Shurpanakha [the sister of Ravana who got her nose cut off],and  
found support from His loyal devotee and servant, the king of the monkeys  
Hanuman. Over the ocean, that was afraid of His eyebrows raised in anger,the  
bridge was constructed to Lanka, the residence of Ravana,and He became, like a  
forest fire,burning the envious ones, the king of Ayodhya. May His mercy be  
upon us._**   
_May His Mercy be upon us, who in sage Vis 'vamitra's arena of sacrifice,  
in the presence of Lakshmana, killed the great chiefs of the Rakshasas, the  
wanderers of the dark that were headed by Marica.   
It was He,who of all the heroes in the world in the hall where Sita would  
select her husband,took up the mighty bow of Shiva that had to be carried by  
three hundred men. Fastening the string, o King, and bending it broke the bow  
in two,the way a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugar cane. By the victory He  
gained the hand of the divine girl named Sita, who in her qualities, behavior,  
age and limbs was a perfect match for Him,she the Goddess of Fortune who had  
acquired a position on His chest. On His way home with her, He met and  
defeated, the deep-rooted pride of Bhrigupati [Parasurama] who three times  
[seven, thus twenty one times] had rid the earth of the seed of the [burden of  
unrighteous] rulers. Bowing His head to the command of His father, who in his  
attachment had made a promise to his wife that He had to abandon the kingdom,  
residence, opulence, relatives and friends, He with his wife left to live in  
the forest like a liberated soul. Living there He, as He wandered around, met  
with great difficulties. He maimed the body of the Rakshasa's sister [Ravana]  
because she had a [by lust] spoiled mind and then, with His invincible bow and  
arrows in His hands, had to kill the fourteen-thousand of her many friends  
headed by Khara, Tris'ira and Dushana._**   
_Oh king, when the ten-headed Ravana heard the stories about Sita, it  
stirred his heart and made him lust to see her. [The demon] Marica in the form  
of a golden deer then lured Rama away from their stay,and was killed by Him  
with a sharp arrow just as Shiva killed Daksha. While He and His brother  
were in the forest, the unprotected daughter of the king of Videha [or  
Janaka],Sita, was kidnapped by the most wicked Rakshasa. Rama then wandering  
around like a man who, attracted to women, is in distress being separated  
from his wife, thus gave an example of how and where attachment all leads to.  
After having performed the funeral rites for him who had died for His sake  
[the eagle Jathayu], He killed Kabandha [a headless monster] and became  
friends with the leaders of the monkey hordes so that He, informed by them  
about Sita, could deliver her. He whose feet are worshiped by Brahma and  
Shiva, but appeared as a normal man, next killed Valli [a wicked brother of  
Hanuman]. Then He, accompanied by the monkey soldiers, proceeded to the shore  
of the ocean. The [god of the] ocean silent with fear because of His angry  
glance - from which all the crocodiles and sharks were agitated - carried, in  
assuming a personal form, on his head all that was needed to worship Him and  
said, upon reaching the lotus feet, the following: 'We, the dull-minded, are truly not capable, oh Supreme One, to know You as  
the one Original Person and Supreme Master of all Universes who resides in the  
core of the heart. For the God-conscious ones are the result of Your goodness,  
the controllers of the people have resulted from Your passion, while the  
rulers of the material elements sprang from Your mode of ignorance. But You oh  
Lord, are the Master over all these modes. You may cross [my waters] as You  
like! Just conquer that son of Vis'rava called Ravana who is like urine to the  
three worlds and thus regain Your wife oh hero. Build a bridge here and Your  
fame will spread. In the future the great kings and heroes from all directions  
will glorify You for it.' _**   
**_After the Master of the Raghu dynasty with all sorts of mountain peaks,with  
trees and plants, that were transported by hand by the mighty monkeys, had  
constructed a bridge in the ocean, He, helped by the directions of Vibhishana  
[a virtuous brother of Ravana], together with the soldiers led by Sugriva,  
N?la and Hanuman set foot on [the island of] Lanka, that just before had been  
set afire [by Hanuman 's tail]. There the houses of pleasure, granaries,  
treasuries, palace doors and city gates, assembly houses, turrets and [even  
the] pigeon houses were taken by force and dismantled by the Vanara [monkey]  
leaders who, just like an elephant herd, turned the squares and crossroads  
with all their flags and golden water pots on the rooftops, into one swirling  
river. All the Rakshasa soldiers with their hard to defeat swords, lances,  
bows, barbed missiles and spears, firebrands, javelins and scimitars [a curved  
sword], lined up in front of Him who was surrounded by Sugriva, Lakshmana,  
Hanuman, Gandhamada, N?la, Angada, Riksha, Panasa and others.The commanders of  
the soldiers of the Ruler of the Raghu dynasty [Rama], together hurried  
forward to fight the enemy followers of Ravana moving on foot and seated on  
elephants, chariots and horses who, condemned by the anger of mother Sita,  
were out of luck in the battle. With trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows  
they were all killed by the [monkey] warriors lead by Angada and others. The  
Rakshasa leader seeing that his forces were defeated, thereupon fuming with  
anger drove his vehicle towards the brilliantly radiating Rama who, seated on  
the shining chariot of Indra that Matali [the driver] had brought, struck him  
with the sharpest arrows. Rama said to him: 'You scum of the earth, since you  
oh criminal, like a dog have kidnapped My helpless wife, I, as Time itself, as  
someone not failing in His heroism, will personally punish you today for that  
shameless act, you abominable evildoer!'   
 Thus rebuking him He released the arrow He had fixed on His bow and that  
arrow pierced his heart like a thunderbolt. Vomiting blood from his ten mouths  
he fell down from his heavenly vehicle. His men then roared: 'Alas, what has  
happened to us?', just like pious people do when they fall down.

**_cont..._**   
_Thereafter the many thousands of wives of the demons, headed by  
Mandodar[Ravana 's wife], came out of Lanka and lamented upon approaching  
[their dead husbands]. Embracing their beloved ones and their friends who were  
all killed by Lakshmana's arrows, they beat their breasts and cried pitiably,  
which [for the victors] was something pleasant to hear:  'Oh alas, now he has been killed who has protected us all! Oh Ravana, cause  
of our cries, now the state of Lanka bereft of your good self turn for  
shelter, is defeated by the enemy? Oh greatest patron, under the spell of  
lusty desires you, not knowing the influence of mother Sita, have arrived at a  
situation like this. Because of what you did oh glory of the dynasty, we and  
the state of Lanka are now without a protector, your body is there as fodder  
for the vultures and your soul is destined for hell.'   
Sri Suka said: 'Vibhishana,with the approval of the King of Kosala [Rama],  
performed for the family the funeral rites that for a deceased one have to be  
observed in order to save him from hell. The Supreme Lord thereupon found His  
sweetheart [Sita] back in an ashoka forest sitting in a small cottage at the  
foot of a shimshapa [as'oka] tree. Sick from being separated from Him she was  
emaciated. Rama seeing the poor plight of His sweetheart was filled with  
compassion. When she saw her beloved, her lotus-like mouth was overwhelmed  
with a great joy. The Supreme Lord put Vibhishana in charge of the rule over  
Lanka's Rakshasas for the duration of a kalpa. He placed Sita on His vehicle  
and then ascended Himself together with Hanuman and the brothers [Lakshmana  
and Sugr?va the commander] to return to His home town [Ayodhy?] and conclude  
the period of the vow [that He would stay away for fourteen years]. To  
celebrate His uncommon activities He on His way was showered with a choice of  
fragrant flowers offered by the higher class and was joyfully praised by the  
seer of the Absolute Truth [Brahma] and the ones belonging to him. Lord  
Ramacandra, the One of Great Compassion, was very sorry to hear that His  
brother Bharata was lying down on a kus'a mat, had matted locks, ate barley  
cooked in cow's urine and had covered Himself with tree bark. Bharata hearing  
about His arrival took the two sandals on His head [that Rama had left behind  
on the throne to represent Him] and came, accompanied by all citizens, the  
ministers and the priests, to welcome His eldest brother. Departing from His  
camp Nandigrama He was accompanied by songs, the sounds of musical  
instruments, the constant recitation of mantras performed by brahmins, by gold  
embroidered flags on golden chariots that were pulled by the most beautiful,  
with gold caparisoned horses and by soldiers in gold covered armor.  
Approaching in procession with nicely dressed courtesans and servants as also  
with soldiers on foot and everything else that would befit a royal reception,  
like the wealth of all kinds of jewelry, He fell down at the lotus feet with  
an ecstatic love that softened the core of His [ascetic] heart and filled His  
eyes with tears. Placing the two slippers before His brother, He stood with  
folded hands and tears in His eyes. Then He was embraced by Rama who, bathing  
Him with the water from His eyes, held Him in His arms for a long time. Rama,  
Lakshmana and Sita together offered the scholars and the others worthy of  
worship personally their obeisances and also received these in return from all  
the citizens. Seeing their Lord returning after so many years the citizens of  
Kosala waved with their upper garments, offered Him garlands and began to  
dance in great jubilation. The sandals were carried by Bharata, the whisk and  
luxurious fan were carried by Vibhishana and Sugriva, a white parasol was  
carried by the son of the wind god [Hanuman] and the bow and two quivers were  
carried by S'atrughna. Sita held the waterpot with water from the holy places,  
Angada held the sword made of gold and the King of the Rikshas [Jambavan, the  
leader of the bears who also participated in the war] held the shield oh King.  
Sitting on Kuvera's heavenly chariot [the 'Pushpaka' captured from Ravana] He,  
the Supreme Lord devotedly being worshiped by the women and the reciters oh  
King, appeared as brilliant as the moon risen among the planets._**   
_After properly being welcomed by His brother He was festively received in  
the city of Ayodhya. Upon entering the royal palace He paid mother Kaikeyi,  
His other stepmothers and His own mother [Kaus 'alya] His respects. The  
spiritual teachers, friends of their age and the youngsters were all of  
worship and their welcome was returned befittingly by Rama, the princess of  
the Videhas [Sita] and Lakshmana. The mothers reviving like bodies awakening  
from sleep, while keeping their sons on their lap, wetted them with a  
continuous flow of tears in letting go of their grief [over having been  
separated for so long]. According to the vidhi the matted locks were shaven  
off by the family priest [Vashishthha] and the elders of the family, after  
which, with the water of the four oceans and other paraphernalia, a bathing  
ceremony was performed like it was done for King Indra. Thus having been fully  
bathed, nicely dressed, decorated and garlanded, He shone brightly with His  
brothers and His wife. Pleased with the surrender [of His brother] He accepted  
the throne offered to Him, as also the citizens who, serving according to  
their nature with their status orientation, all deserved His protection for  
that quality. Rama was therein just like a father and was by them therefore  
also accepted as their father.   
Although this all happened in Treta-yuga, the period became like Satya-Yuga  
because of Rama's presence as the ruling king,who with His full respect of  
dharma,made all living beings happy. The forests, the rivers, the hills and  
the mountains, the lands, the islands, the oceans and the seas offered all the  
living beings all they could wish for oh best of the Bharatas. During the  
period that Rama, the Lord in the Beyond, was king, there was no suffering, no  
disease, old age, bereavement, distress, lamentation, fear and exhaustion or  
dying against one's will. Having sworn that He would not take another woman  
He, as a saintly king pure in His character and dharma, by His personal  
dutifulness was an example for the householders. Sita in loving service of her  
husband was, because of her good character, always humble and submissive.  
Being chaste and afraid [to make mistakes], she bashfully with understanding  
for her husband's position captivated His mind.'_**

**_Dhruva Leaves Home for the Forest_**  
 **Maitreya said:  'None of the the Kumaras or the other sons of Brahma: Narada, Ribhu, Hamsa,  
Aruni and Yati, lived a householder's life, for they were celibate [urdhva  
retasah, sending their seed upwards]. Oh slayer of enemies, Mrisha, the wife  
of [another son of Brahma called Irreligion or] Adharma produced the two  
children Dambha [Bluffing] and Maya [Cheating], but they were taken by a demon  
ruling the south-west called Nirriti who had no children. From those two Lobha  
[Greed] and Nikrita [Cunning] were born oh great soul. And from the both of  
them there were Krodha [Anger] and Himsa [Malice]. From these two [also  
irreligiously being bound in incest] Kali and the sister called Durukti  
[Harsh Speech] were born. Oh best of the truthful, bound to Durukti Kali  
produced Bhaya [Fearfulness] and Mrityu [Death] and of those two combined  
Yatana [Excessive Pain] and Niraya [Hell] took birth. I thus explained to you  
in short the cause of the devastation [of landing in hell because of  
irreligion]. Someone who hears this description three times o pure one, will  
lead a pious life and see the contamination of his mind being washed away.   
 Next I will describe the dynasty famous for its virtuous activities, oh best  
of the Kurus, that evolved from the Manu called Svayambhuva, who was a part of  
a plenary portion of the Supreme Lord. Uttanapada and Priyavrata, the two sons  
of Queen Satarapa and her husband were, as parts of of the Supreme Lord  
Vasudeva, there for the protection and maintenance of the world. Of the two  
wives of Uttanapada, Suniti and Suruci, Suruci was far more dear to the  
husband than the other one Suniti, who had a son called Dhruva. When the king  
one day was patting the son of Suruci named Uttama whom he had placed on his  
lap, he turned away Dhruva who also tried to get on his lap. Queen Suruci who  
was very proud enviously spoke to Dhruva, the child of the co-wife that tried  
to get on his lap, in such a way that the king could hear it. 'My dear child,  
you don't deserve to seat yourself where the king sits because, even though  
you were born as a son of the king, you were not born from my womb. Oh child,  
you don't understand that, because you are not my own but from the womb of  
another woman, the thing you desire is out of your reach. You can seat  
yourself on the throne of the king if you want, but only if you, by means of  
penance, have satisfied the Lord and by His mercy have found a place in my  
womb for yourself [to be born again].'**   
 **Maitreya said: 'Pierced by the harsh words of his stepmother, he out of anger began to  
breathe heavily as a snake struck by a stick, and when he saw his father  
silently looking on, he began to weep and ran away to his mother. Having  
heard from the others what had happened Suniti lifted her heavily breathing  
son whose lips were trembling on her lap, feeling very sorry over what was  
said by the co-wife. Losing her composure she cried with a fire of grief which  
burned like dry leaves and when she remembered the things said by the other  
wife she spoke through the haze of tears that fell from her lotuslike face.  
Not knowing how to curb the anger the lady breathed heavily and said to her  
son: 'Do not wish others anything inauspicious my dear son, a person will have to  
suffer himself from the ill he wishes others. The truth of what mother Suruci  
has told you,about having taken birth from the womb of me, the unfortunate  
one, and that you grew up on the milk from my breast, is that the king feels  
ashamed, he regrets it to have accepted me for his wife. (19) All that your  
stepmother has told you is true. If you want to sit on the throne just like  
Uttama, then just engage yourself without being envious my dear son, in  
worshiping the lotus feet of Adhokshaja, the Lord of Transcendence. The  
unborn One, your great-grandfather Brahma, no doubt acquired his supreme  
position in the universe and the qualifications to create, from worshiping the  
One whom we know by His lotus feet and who can be approached by those who in  
self-regulation have conquered the mind. Likewise Manu, your worshipable  
grandfather, achieved liberation and the heavenly and earthly happiness that  
is so difficult to achieve by other means, because he was of an unflinching  
devotion and great charity. Take shelter with Him, the Kindhearted One my  
dear boy, for people who want to get liberated follow the path of His lotus  
feet. Worship the Supreme Lord by fixing your mind upon His image, thinking of  
nothing else and being faithful to your original sense of duty with Him.  
Looking for someone else I wouldn't know any one but the Lord with the lotus  
eyes who could mitigate your sorrow. Even de Goddess of Fortune who is  
worshiped by others my dear, is always with a lotus flower in her hand looking  
for Him.'   
Maitreya said: 'Thus having heard the purposeful words of the mother he,  
mindfully keeping himself under control, left his father's house. Narada who  
came to hear about it and understood his intentions, was surprised and with  
the hand that could expel all sin touching his head he exclaimed: How  
wonderful are the powerful ksatriyas! They cannot tolerate even a slight  
infringement upon their prestige. Just imagine! This boy is only a small  
child, yet harsh words from his stepmother proved unbearable to him. Narada  
then said: 'Why is it that you, a child normally fond of sports and games, at  
present feel insulted because of not being respected? My dear Dhruva, if you  
feel that your sense of honor has been insulted, you still have no cause for  
dissatisfaction. This kind of dissatisfaction is just an illusion; every  
living being is controlled by his previous actions, and therefore there are  
different varieties of life for enjoying or suffering. Therefore you should be  
satisfied oh dear one. Whatever it is that fate has in stall for a person, is  
by someone who is intelligent recognized as a way leading to the Supreme. But  
the yoga your mother told you to do for elevating yourself to His mercy, is to  
my opinion too difficult for a person like you. The greatest sages even, who  
were on the path of detachment for many births, in the trance of their strict  
yoga practice never came to understand what they were looking for. Stop  
therefore now with this insistence of yours, it'll take you nowhere. Save that  
[quest] for the future, then you'll find ample opportunity [to engage in adult  
matters like these]. Any embodied soul who is of peace with whatever happiness  
or distress that destiny reserves for him, can reach the Light. With someone  
better one should be pleased, with someone of a lesser quality one should be  
compassionate and with someone equal one should be friendly. Thus fostering no  
desires one is never affected by tribulations.'

**Dhruva said: 'This balance of mind you talk about oh Lordship, is a quality of people who  
are merciful with those less wise, but for persons like us it is very  
difficult to see it the way you said it. I was born a ruler and I'm not that  
tolerant. Pierced by the harsh words of mother Suruci I cannot have a heart  
like you. Please tell me about an honest way to pursue my desire for a  
superior position in the three worlds oh brahmin, a position not even  
attainable for others like my father, grandfather and forefathers. You as a  
worthy descendant of Brahma playing the vina, alike the sun travel all around  
the world for the sake of its welfare.'   
Maitreya said: 'Narada was very pleased to hear what Dhruva said, whereupon he  
compassionately replied to give the boy good advice. Narada told him: 'The path your mother told you about,of fully absorbing yourself in rendering  
service to the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, constitutes the highest perfection in  
life. For him who seeks the supreme benefit of the self by what is known as  
dharma, artha,kama and moksha, the worship of the Lord His lotus feet is the  
only way. For that purpose, my dear, go with my blessing to the bank of the  
Yamuna and be purified by the sacredness of the Madhuvana forest where the  
Lord is always present. When you have taken a bath in that river, - which  
performed correctly three times a day is a most auspicious thing to do - you  
should sit down on a sitting place you have prepared. You should meditate upon  
the Supreme Spiritual Master with an undisturbed mind. Thereto you must, in  
relation to the life breath and the senses, gradually with the help of the  
threefold breath control [of pranayama: controlling the ingoing, the outgoing  
and balanced breath] give up the impurities of your mind. Always prepared to  
be merciful meditate on the Lord, on Him who with His pleasing mouth and  
enchanting look, His straight nose, arched eyebrows and intelligent forehead,  
is the beauty of the demigods. Youthful, attractive in all His limbs and with  
lips and eyes as reddish as a rising sun, He, as the shelter of the  
surrendered souls who is transcendental in every respect, is the one offering  
protection. Marked with the Srivatsa [a few white hairs on His chest] and of a  
deeply bluish [gray] color, He is the original Personality garlanded with  
flowers, showing the conch shell, the disc, the club and lotus flower in His  
four hands. The garments of yellow silk He wears are complemented by a helmet,  
pearl earrings, a necklace, bracelets and the Kausthuba jewel. Pleasing as  
well the eye as the mind, He has small bells of gold around His waist and His  
ankles,and is of a superior calm, peace and serenity. He occupies His place on  
the whorl of the lotus of the hearts of those who in worship unite with His  
glittering lotus feet. You should this way regularly envision the smiling of  
the Lord who is so affectionate with the devotees, and thus fully attentive  
let your mind meditate upon the greatest of all benedictors. The mind thus  
meditating the very auspicious form of the Supreme Lord is, being  
transcendentally enriched, very soon freed from all material contamination and  
will never wander off from that position.**   
 **Please hear from me the very, very confidential mantra to pray oh prince,  
from which recited aloud for seven days a person may behold what moves through  
the ether [planets, heavenly beings, thoughts]. 'Om namo bhagavate  
vasudevaya' [my respects for the Supreme Lord Vasudeva]. With this mantra  
[called the dvadas'akshara mantra] the learned one conversant with the  
differences according to time and place should exercise respect for the  
physical appearance of the Lord the way it should be done with the help of the  
different paraphernalia. One purifies with the help of water, garlands of  
forest flowers, roots, different fruits and vegetables, fresh grass, buds,  
bark and by offering tuls? leaves, which are very dear to the Lord your  
master. You can [being alone in the forest] begin with procuring and  
worshiping a deity made of physical elements like earth and water [clay], and  
therewith as a sage be of full self-control in peace,checking your speech and  
eat frugally whatever the forest offers. Meditate [thereto] upon the  
inconceivable activities that by the Supreme Lord of Wisdom in the form of an  
avat?ra were performed in order to exercise His supreme will and potencies. In  
service of the Supreme Lord you should respect Him in your heart with the  
mantras that embody Him in the way the previous teachers performed their  
devotional service as I have told you. When the Supreme Lord thus with your  
engagement in service by your body, mind and words,is worshiped with love and  
dedication, He will increase the devotion of the devotees who are sincerely  
and seriously engaged and will award them with what they desire in regard of  
the spiritual life and what belongs to it. Being serious in bhakti-yoga about  
your liberation you must in complete detachment from all sense-gratification  
unrelenting exercise a respect that is steeped in love for Him directly.'   
Thus being addressed by Narada, the son of the king circumambulated him  
offering his obeisances and went to the Madhuvana forest which, imprinted with  
the feet of the Lord, was the right place for him to be.

**Thus being addressed by Narada, the son of the king circumambulated him  
offering his obeisances and went to the Madhuvana forest which, imprinted with  
the feet of the Lord, was the right place for him to be. When Dhruva entering  
the forest thus had withdrawn himself, the respected sage thought it wise to  
pay the king a visit in his palace. Seated there comfortably, he spoke to him.  
Narada said: 'Dear King, your face appears to be withering, what are you  
thinking so deeply about? Have you lost your way with the gratification of  
your senses, the religion or the economy?'   
The king replied: 'Oh brahmin, my son, my sweet boy who is only five years old  
and actually a great personality and devotee, I have, being too attached to my  
wife and too hard-hearted, banished from here together with his mother. I  
worry whether the helpless boy whose face is like a lotus, without being  
protected by anyone in the forest, oh brahmin, isn't starving or being tired  
having laid down hasn't been devoured by wolves. Alas, how cruel I was being  
conquered by a woman. Just imagine how utterly hard-hearted I was denying him  
all affection when he out of love tried to climb on my lap.'**   
 **Narada said: 'Do not I say, do not be aggrieved about your son. He is well  
protected by the God oh master of men, you don't know how widespread His  
influence is all over the world. The boy is a master. After performing what  
is impossible for even the greatest personalities around, he, in favor of your  
reputation, will come straight back to you dear King.'   
Maitreya Muni said: 'The king, having heard what Narada told him, began to  
think about his son and neglected his opulent kingdom. Meanwhile the Original  
Personality was worshiped by Dhruva, after taking a bath and fasting that  
night, with perfect attention the way Narada had advised it. For the first  
month worshiping the Lord he only ate, to the bare necessity of preserving his  
body, fruits and berries in the morning after every third night. The next  
month the innocent boy continued his respect for the Almighty by eating every  
sixth day as mentioned, on those days preparing his food from grasses and  
leaves gone dry. With the third month passing he, fully absorbed in his  
respect for the Lord of Wisdom, Uttamas'loka, each ninth day drank water only.  
That way continuing into the fourth month, he by controlling his breath,  
meditating in worship of God, only ate air every twelfth day. By the fifth  
month in full control of his breath the son of the king, meditating upon the  
Creator, without moving stood on one leg like a column. With his mind fully  
controlled concentrating in the heart, he meditated with no other thoughts  
than the thought of the Supreme Lord His form, upon Him, the resting place for  
the senses and their objects. Keeping his mind focussed on the foundation, the  
cosmic intelligence of the reality, the master of the primal ether [pradhana]  
and the person, the Supreme Spirit, all the three worlds began to tremble. As  
he remained standing on his one leg he, the child of the king, with the one  
half [of his body] pressed down the earth with his big toe bent, just like the  
king of elephants does when he as a boat balances left and right with every  
step. Because he in the full of his meditation had stopped his breathing and  
closed all the gates of his body, he thus by confining the life air was  
suffocating all the worlds so that soon all the great souls from all places  
sought their refuge with the Lord.   
The godly said: 'We don't understand this oh Supreme Lord, the flow of the  
universal breath is obstructed! Therefore oh reservoir of goodness so kind to  
the needy, we all approach You for shelter to be saved from this calamity.'   
The Supreme Lord replied: 'Fear not, this choking of your life air happens on  
account of the son of King Uttanapada who is fully absorbed in thoughts of Me.  
I will ask the boy so strong in his determination of penance to stop with  
this. Please return to your homes.'

**_Dhruva Returns Home from the Forest_**  
 **Maitreya said: 'They [the demigods], thus being freed from all fear,  
offered the Lord of the wide strides their obeisances, upon which they  
returned to their three worlds. The Lord with the thousand faces  
[Sahasrashirsha] then got on the back of Garuda and went to the Madhuvana  
forest in order to see His servant [Dhruva]. He who strengthened by his  
meditation in yoga observed Him brilliant as lightening manifested on the  
lotus of his heart, all of a sudden noticed that He had disappeared, but  
looking around he then saw Him standing right before him in the same form.  
With Him present before him he, confounded, fell to the ground prostrating his  
body like a rod to offer Him his obeisances. As he looked at Him, it was as if  
the boy was drinking Him with his eyes, like he was kissing Him with his mouth  
and embracing Him with his arms. Seeing that he wanted to glorify Him but  
didn't know how, the Lord, who is the prayer in the heart of each,  
understanding the boy mercifully touched his forehead with His conch shell.  
Thus being inspired with the ability to say just what he wanted, he, slowly  
offering his prayers in the love of his devotion, could understand what the  
supreme of the soul was all about and that he would be the Dhruva of renown  
and fame whose world couldn't be denied.   
 Dhruva said: 'Let me offer my obeisances to You, the Supreme Lord and  
Original Person, who as the One within, from Your internal potency commanding  
the universal energy, entering my words and breath,has brought to life my  
passive senses as well as my other limbs, my hands, legs and skin. You are the  
One, Supreme Lord who, after by His own potency creating this vast outer world  
called maya, next as the Original Personality has entered here to appear  
differently in the time-bound qualities the way fire does in fire wood. Like a  
man awakening from his sleep, the one of surrender to You could see this  
entire universe by dint of the knowledge given by You oh my Lord. How can  
anyone conversant with Your actions forget Your lotus feet that are the  
shelter of all who desire liberation, oh friend of the distressed? It suffers  
no doubt that You, the cause of liberation from birth and death, are like a  
desire tree to those who, under the influence of the outer world, miss the  
proper concept of life and worship You with ulterior motives in their desire  
for the gratification of the senses of this bag of bones, a gratification that  
is even available to persons in hell. The bliss of Your magnificence,that for  
embodied souls may experience when they meditate upon Your lotus feet or when  
they hear the stories of Your devotees, is never found with the impersonal  
supreme [Brahman], nor does it compare to what is experienced in [personally]  
elevated positions from which one has to fall down being destroyed by the  
sword of death. Let it be so that I may enjoy the intimate association of  
those who are constantly engaged in Your devotional service oh Unlimited One,  
of those great devotees by whose purified hearts one can easily cross the  
terrible and vast ocean of dangers that is material existence. Let it be so  
that I go mad of drinking the nectar of the stories about Your qualities.They  
so high-principled my dear Lord, never think of the material body, their  
relating to their sons, friends, home, wealth and wife; they, oh One of the  
Lotus Navel, have achieved the association with those who in their hearts  
always hanker after the fragrance of Your lotus feet. The animals, trees,  
birds, reptiles, gods, demons and men, driven by the material energy are found  
throughout the universe in different forms of existence and are for several  
reasons seen and not seen oh Unborn One. That I know, but about this  
transcendental form, oh Supreme One I knew not, I do not know but the end of  
my argument. At the end of each epoch the Supreme Lord withdraws all of this  
universe into His belly, lying down in self-reflection in the company of  
Ananta S'esha as His bed. From the ocean of His navel the golden abode  
sprouted, with Brahma on the whorl of the lotus. Him, that Supreme Lordship I  
offer my obeisances. You are the eternally liberated, uncontaminated Supreme  
Soul full of knowledge, the changeless, authentic Original Person, the Supreme  
Lord and ruler of the three modes, the continuing intelligence throughout all  
actions of the intellect, the transcendental vision and witness, the  
maintainer, enjoyer and the one whose position differs from all the others.  
You, in whose nature always the different opposing energies of knowledge and  
ignorance are found, You who are that continuing Brahman, You the cause of the  
material manifestation, the original and unlimited One who is simply blissful,  
I offer my respects. Compared to other benedictions Your lotus feet are the  
true one oh my Lord, and thus You as such are the personification of the goal  
of life of each person oh beloved Fortunate One. You, eager to bestow Your  
mercy, maintain the ones poor of heart like me, the way a cow keeps a calf.'   
Maitreya said: 'After thus truly being worshiped by means of the fine  
intelligence of his good intentions only, the Supreme Lord who is always there  
in favor of His devotees spoke to him, after first having congratulated him.   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I know about the determination within your heart oh  
son of the king. Since you are sworn to piety, I shall grant you all the  
fortune, even though it is a wish difficult to fulfill. Never before My good  
boy, there was anyone who managed to settle for such a brightly glowing place  
known as the planet of Dhruva, around which all the other planets and  
constellations of stars are circling like a group of bulls does running  
stationary around a central pole [for crushing grain]. It is the planet around  
which, keeping it to their right, along with the stars, all great sages of the  
forest move circumambulating like Dharma, Agni, Kas'yapa and S'ukra whose  
lives stretch beyond a millennium. As soon as your father has left for the  
forest, you will be awarded the entire world. It will be under the pious  
protection of your rule uninterrupted for thirty-six thousand years in full  
control of your faculties. When your brother Uttama, being killed during a  
hunt, is sought in the forest by his most afflicted mother, she will run into  
a forest fire. After performing great sacrifices for Me, the heart of all  
sacrifice, and having distributed great charities, you will, after having  
enjoyed the blessings of this world, at the end of your life be able to  
remember Me. Thereafter you will head for My abode that is worshiped on all  
planets and is situated above those of the rishis. Having gone there, you will  
never come back.'   
...Unto anyone with whose qualities and friendship the Supreme, Lord Hari, is  
pleased, all living beings offer their respect...**

**_An Old Brahmin Friend Visits Krishna_**  
_Sri Suka said: 'There was a certain friend of Krishna called Sudama, a brahmin well versed in  
the Vedas, who was of peaceful mind,in control of his senses, and detached  
from the sense objects. As a householder he subsisted on that what came on its  
own accord. His wife was, just like him, poorly dressed and emaciated of  
hunger. Faithful to her husband,but distressed by the poverty she, with her  
face dried up and trembling legs, approached him and said: 'Is it not so oh  
brahmin, oh master of devotion, that the Husband of Sri is your friend and  
that that best one of the Satvatas is filled with compassion for the  
brahmins,willing to give them shelter? Please approach Him, my most gracious  
man, for He, the Ultimate Shelter of the Saintly Souls, will then provide you  
with abundant wealth because you have such a hard time maintaining your  
family. If the Lord of the Bhojas, Vrishnis and Andhakas who is now present in  
Dvaraka, even gives Himself to a person who just remembers His lotus feet,  
then what would the Spiritual Master of the Universe not do for people of  
worship who are not so much interested in money, success and sensual  
pleasures?'   
The brahmin who thus repeatedly was begged by his wife then thought: 'The  
sight of Uttamashloka is indeed the highest attainment.'   
He took the decision to visit Him and asked her: 'If there is anything in the  
house that I can bring as a gift my good woman, please give it to me!' She  
begged with the other brahmins for four fists of husked and parched rice,  
wrapped it in a piece of cloth and gave it to her husband to bring as a gift.   
Sudama, the best of the scholars, took it with him and on his way to Dvaraka  
wondered: 'How will I ever get this audience with Krishna?' Together with a  
couple of local brahmins the scholar passed three gates and guard stations and  
walked between the houses of Acyuta's faithful followers, the Andakas and  
Vrishnis. One normally could not go there and so he felt so blessed,as if he  
had attained the bliss of the Pure Spirit. He next entered one of the opulent  
sixteen thousand residences of the Lord's queens. Acyuta who sat on His  
consort's bed, saw him from a distance, immediately rose and came forward to  
close him gladly in His arms. The Lotus-eyed One in touch with the body of His  
dear friend, the wise brahmin, extremely ecstatic affectionately began to  
cry._**   
_Having him seated on the bed The Supreme Lord of All the Worlds fetched  
some items to honor His friend and washed his feet. Than took the same water  
on His head oh King. The Purifier anointed him with divinely fragrant  
sandalwood and aloe-wood paste and kunkuma. He gladly honored His friend with  
aromatic incense and series of lamps and offered him bethel nut and a cow.  
Next He spoke a word of welcome. The goddess was personally of service by  
carefully fanning with a yak's tail the dirty and poorly dressed, emaciated  
twice-born soul, whose veins could be seen. The people in the palace thus  
seeing Krishna engaged in His spotless reputation, were amazed about the  
intense love with which the unkempt looking soul, the avadhuta, was honored.  
'What pious deeds has he performed, this unwashed, condemned and lowly  
mendicant deprived of all prosperity in the world? How can he with reverence  
be served by the Spiritual Master of the Three Worlds who is the abode of Sri?  
Leaving the goddess sitting on her bed He embraced him as an older  
brother!'_**   
_Taking hold of each other 's hands oh King, they discussed the charming  
topics of the past when they together lived in the school of their spiritual  
master   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh brahmin, after the guru received his remuneration  
from you and you returned home oh knower of the dharma, did you marry a  
suitable wife or not? With your mind occupied by household affairs, you were  
not driven by desires and I also know that you do not take much pleasure oh  
wise soul, in the pursuit of material happiness. Some people perform their  
worldly duties without being disturbed by desires in their minds. Acting to  
set an example as I do, they shake off the propensities that naturally arise.  
Do you, oh brahmin, still remember our stay in the gurukula? It is there that  
a twice-born soul learns to understand what needs to be known and thus manages  
to transcend his ignorance. One is born twice my dear friend: after first  
being born materially, one secondly manifests through a spiritual master, a  
bestower of spiritual knowledge like Myself, who teaches what the duties are  
for all spiritual orders, or stages of life. Among those engaged in their  
duties in this world, they [who thus are twice born] are the expert knowers of  
the true welfare oh brahmin, for they cross over the ocean of material  
existence with the help of the words stemming from Me in the form of the  
spiritual master. I, the Soul of All Beings, am not as satisfied by ritual  
worship, a new life, austerity or self-control as I am by faithful service to  
the spiritual master. Oh brahmin, do you still remember what we did, when we  
were living with our spiritual master, and once by the wife of our guru were  
sent away to fetch firewood? Having entered a big forest oh brahmin, all out  
of season, a fierce harsh thundering wind arose with rain. With the sun  
having set we, with all directions covered in darkness and with all the water  
around us, could neither recognize the direction nor high or low areas.  
Constantly heavily besieged by the fierce wind and water in that flood, we did  
not know what way to go and in distress wandered through the forest holding  
each other's hands. Our guru Sandapani knew this and at sunrise set out to  
search for us, his disciples. The acarya then found us suffering.   
'Oh you children, for my sake you have to suffer heavily! In your devotion for  
me you have disregarded that what is most dear to all living beings: the  
comfort of your body! Well, this is what disciples should do to pay the debt  
to their spiritual master: being perfectly pure in their love, they must be  
willing to offer the spiritual master their very self and possessions. I am  
satisfied with you my dear boys, oh best of the brahmins. May your desires be  
fulfilled and may in this world and the next your words, your mantras, never  
lose their attraction.' Many things like this happened when we were living at  
the house of the guru. Only by the mercy of the spiritual master a person will  
find fulfillment and attain peace.'   
The brahmin said: 'What more is there for me to achieve in life oh God of  
Gods, oh Guru of the Universe, than to have lived together at the guru's house  
with You whose every desire is fulfilled? Oh Almighty One, Your body,  
constituting the fertile field of all welfare, comprises the Absolute Truth  
that is celebrated in the Vedas. Your residing with spiritual masters is  
nothing but an extraordinary role-play!

**_The Brahmin Honored: Lord Krishna the Lord of the Brahmins_**  
_Sri Suka said:  'He, Bhagavan Krishna, the True Goal of the Devotees, the Lord Who Perfectly  
Knows the Minds of All Beings, in this manner conversing with this best one  
among the brahmins, then, in His dedication to the ones of learning, laughed  
and spoke with a smile and a loving glance to His dear friend.   
The Supreme Lord said:  'What gift have you brought for Me from home oh friend? Even the slightest  
that in pure love is offered by devotees, turns into something immense for Me,  
whereas not even the greatest that is being presented by non-devotees pleases  
Me. Whoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit and water with devotion, that  
offer brought from the heart by a soul of good habits I accept  
wholeheartedly!"   
But the twice-born soul thus being addressed, was too embarrassed, bowed down  
his head and did not offer the few hands of rice grains to the Husband of the  
Goddess of Fortune, oh King. As the direct witness in the heart of all living  
beings fully aware of the reason why he had come, Lord thought: 'He worshiped  
Me in the past and never desired opulence,and he, My friend,came in order to  
keep his chaste and devoted wife happy, I will give him riches not attainable  
for [even] the immortals.' With that in mind He Himself from under the  
garment of the twice-born one snatched away the rice grains that were tied in  
a bundle and said: 'What is this? Have you brought this for Me My dear friend?  
That gives Me the greatest pleasure! These rice grains satiate Me and the  
whole universe that I am!'_**   
_Speaking thus He took a handful to eat and a second one, whereupon  
Sri[Rukmini devi], devoted to Him, the One Supreme, seized His hand for the  
beaten grains were hard to digest. 'That oh Soul of Each and Everyone, is  
enough to make a person wishing to satisfy You, prosper in this world and the  
next with all opulence available.'   
After to his satisfaction having drunk and eaten,the brahmin spent that night  
in Acyuta's palace. He thought he had attained heaven. The next day dear King,  
as he returned home, he was honored by Him, the Self-satisfied Maintainer of  
the Universe who made Sudama happy as he walked along the path. Even though he  
had received no wealth from Krishna and had been too embarrassed to ask for it  
himself, he on his way home was filled with joy about the meeting he had with  
the Great One:  'Ah, what a privilege it is to have witnessed the devotion of the Lord of the  
Brahmins for the twice-born souls. He who carries Lakshmi in His chest  
embraced the poorest wretch! Who am I? A destitute sinner! And who is Krishna?  
The temple of Sri! And He, this friend of the brahmins, closed me in His arms!  
He seated me on the bed of His consort like one of His brothers. Tired as I  
was, I was fanned by His queen holding a [yak-tail] hair fan. Being served  
with sincerity with a massage for my feet and such, I was worshiped like a  
demigod by the God of Gods, the Godhead of the Scholars! The worship of His  
feet is the root of all perfections and opulence that man in his emancipation  
may find in heaven, on earth and in the lower regions. 'If this poor soul  
acquires opulence he, delighting in excess, will not remember Me', He must  
have thought in His grace, and thus did not grant me the slightest amount of  
wealth.'   
Thus lost in thought he arrived at the vicinity of his home. There he found  
himself placed before high rising palaces rivaling the sun, the fire and the  
moon. On all sides they were surrounded by wonderful courtyards and gardens  
swarming with hordes of cooing birds, ponds full of lilies and day and night  
blooming white lotuses. There were well adorned and ornamented men and women  
with deer-like eyes.   
 'What is this, whose place is this, how could this come about?' This way  
paining his mind he was welcomed by the men and women with a luster like the  
demigods, who most fortunately loudly sang to instrumental music. His wife,  
hearing that her husband had arrived, extremely jubilant quickly appeared  
excitedly from the house like she was the goddess of fortune manifesting  
herself from her abode. Seeing the husband she was so devoted to, she solemnly  
held her head down embracing him within her heart, with closed eyes filled  
with tears because of her eagerness and love. He stood amazed at the sight of  
his wife who, shining in the midst of maidservants with golden lockets around  
their necks, radiated like a goddess. Pleased, he together with her entered  
his home,that with its hundreds of gem-studded pillars resembled the palace of  
the great Indra. There were ivory beds ornamented with gold [with bedding]  
white as foam and couches with golden legs, yak tail fans, golden chairs with  
soft cushions and canopies hung with strings of pearls. Seeing the sparkling  
clear quartz walls inlaid with precious emeralds as also the shining jeweled  
lamps and the women decorated with jewels, the brahmin, now free from worries  
with all the excessive opulence, reasoned about the cause of his unexpected  
prosperity:  'This prosperity here, of me always so unlucky and poverty stricken, must be  
the consequence of the glance that He, the Best of the Yadus who is of the  
Greatest Opulence, has cast on me. It is no doubt my Friend, the most exalted  
among the Dasharhas and Enjoyer of Unlimited Wealth, who, without saying a  
word, like a cloud [pouring rain] has given me this opulence when He, with me  
in His presence, noticed that I came begging. After having accepted with  
pleasure a palmful of roasted rice that I brought, this very day He makes  
something insignificant of the great gift He gives and something great of the  
meager gift of a friend [like me]. May there life after life, repeatedly be  
my love, friendship, sympathy and servitude for Him, the Supremely  
Compassionate Reservoir of Transcendental Qualities, as also my adherence to  
the intimate association with His devotees. The Supreme and Never Born Lord  
does not bestow the wonderful opulences - a kingdom and material assets - upon  
His devotee when he fails in understanding. In His wisdom He sees how the  
false pride [the arrogance, the conceit with the wealth, ] leads to the  
downfall of the wealthy.'   
Sudama this way firmly being fixed in intelligence, was most devoted to  
Janardana and enjoyed free from intense desire [for wealth or profit] together  
with his wife. Therewith he always kept in mind that he,sooner or later,would  
have to abandon the objects of his senses. The brahmins are even the master of  
Him, the God of Gods, Hari, the Master and Lord of Sacrifice. There exists no  
higher worshipable deity than them. By thus recognizing the Unconquerable One  
as being conquered by His own servants he, the learned friend of the Supreme  
Lord, was released from his bondage to the material self. By the force of his  
meditation upon Him he soon attained His abode, the destination of the  
truthful ones.   
The human being who hears about this sympathy for the brahmins of the Lord of  
the Brahmins, will find love for the Supreme Lord and be freed from the  
bondage of karma.

**_Sati Quits her Body_**  
_Maitreya said:  'After saying this much about the [possible] end of his wife's physical  
existence,if they visit her relatives who insulted innocent Lord Shiva, He  
fell silent. Since Sati understood that she had the choice between being  
anxious to see her relatives and being afraid to meet her relatives, she was  
in doubt whether she should go or not. She felt very sorry because of that,and  
shed tears in her affliction. Trembling she angrily looked at her Bhava, the  
unequaled one, as if she wanted to burn him. Breathing heavily she walked away  
from him, the saintly one so dear to her,to whom she had given half of her  
body. Being upset because of her grief and anger and with her intelligence  
clouded by her female nature, she out of love for her father then headed for  
his house. Sati was quickly followed by the thousands of associates and  
Yaksha's of the three eyed one [Lord Shiva] who were headed by Maniman and  
Mada. Not afraid to leave her Lord Shiva alone they had put the bull Nandi in  
front. Having placed her on the decorated bull, her pet bird, ball, mirror,  
lotus flower, white umbrella, mosquito net, garlands and other stuff were  
taken along, accompanied by the music of drums, conch shells and flutes. She  
[thus] entered the sacrificial arena where with the help of sacrificial  
animals, pots, clay, wood, iron, gold and grass and skins to sit upon, the  
sacrifice, brightened by the sounds of Vedic hymns, was held that on all sides  
was attended by the great sages and authorities. But arriving there,out of  
fear for the performer of the sacrifice,Daksha,her father,she was not  
respected by anyone with a welcome, save of course for her own sisters and  
mother who embraced her with reverence, gladdened faces and throats choked by  
tears of affection. But Sati, not being welcomed by her father, did not  
respond to the reverence shown with the greetings of her sisters, mother and  
aunts who with due respect properly informed her and offered her gifts and a  
seat. Realizing that her father with no oblations for Shiva had not invited  
the mighty one for the assembly of the sacrifice, Sati got very angry and  
looked incensed as if she wanted to burn the fourteen worlds with her eyes.  
The goddess for everyone present to hear began to condemn with words filled  
with anger the opponents of Shiva who were so proud of their troublesome  
sacrifices, meanwhile ordering his Bhutas who stood prepared to attack, to  
hold back. The blessed one said: 'He [Shiva] has no one in this world as his rival, no one is his enemy nor is  
anyone embodied dear to him. Who in the world but you would be envious with  
him, the most beloved being in the universe free from all enmity? Unlike you,  
oh twice born one, he doesn't find fault in the qualities of the seekers of  
truth, he rather greatly magnifies any little good he finds in others. And now  
you are with him, the greatest of all persons, finding fault! It is not so  
surprising, this deriding of glorious persons by those who take the transient  
body for the true self. It is an ugly evil to be envious with great  
personalities, and in this way they are bringing themselves down and are  
diminished by the dust of the holy feet of great Ones. Persons who only once  
from their heart pronounce the two syllables of his name, see their sinful  
activities immediately defeated; that Shiva, whose order is never neglected  
and who is of an impeccable renown, you now strangely envy. Engaged at his  
lotus feet the higher personalities exercise their bee-like minds aspiring the  
nectar of transcendental bliss and for the common man he is the one sought who  
fulfills all desires. That you of all people now have to be against him, the  
friend of all living entities in all the three worlds! Do you think that  
greater, more respectable personalities than you, such as Lord Brahma, do not  
know this inauspicious person who goes under the name Lord Shiva? He  
associates with the demons in the crematorium, his locks of hair are scattered  
all over his body, and he is garlanded with human skulls and smeared with  
ashes from the crematorium, but in spite of all these inauspicious qualities,  
great personalities like Brahma honor him by accepting the flowers offered to  
his lotus feet and placing them with great respect on their heads. When one  
is confronted with people who irresponsibly blaspheme the controller of the  
religion, one should block one's ears and walk away, if nothing else can be  
done. But if one can do something, one should by force cut out the tongue of  
the vilifying blasphemer and next give up one's own life. That's the way to  
deal with such matters! Therefore I shall no longer bear this body I received  
from you who blasphemed God. To purify oneself from mistakenly having eaten  
poisonous food it is best to vomit, so one says. Realised Souls who enjoy  
their lives do not always follow the rules and regulations of the Vedas, the  
ways of the gods differ from those of man. Therefore a man should not  
criticize another man like Shiva by the standard of his own unique sense of  
duty. In truth the Vedas distinguish between activities performed in  
attachment and activities performed in detachment [pravritti and nivritti  
dharma], and thus one has on the basis of these two characteristics of dharma  
two choices. To be of both at the same time is contradictory and thus it can  
be so that none of these activities are to the satisfaction of the one of  
transcendence. My dear father, the opulence we possess is impossible for  
either you or your flatterers to imagine, for persons who engage in fruitive  
activities by performing great sacrifices are concerned with satisfying their  
bodily necessities by eating foodstuff offered as a sacrifice. We can exhibit  
our opulences simply by desiring to do so. This can be achieved only by great  
personalities who are renounced, self-realized souls. With your offenses  
against Shva and denial of this body that was produced from your body, I say  
enough is enough! I am ashamed to have taken this contemptible birth. Oh what  
a shame it is to be related by birth to a bad person, to someone who is an  
offender of great personalities. Because of the family tie I have with you,it  
makes me very sad when my great Lord Shiva calls me 'daughter of Daksha'. All  
my joy and smiles vanish immediately when he does so. Therefore I will give up  
this bag of bones that was produced from your body.'   
Maitreya said: 'Oh annihilator of the enemy, speaking thus to Daksha in the  
arena of sacrifice, she sat down in silence on the ground with her face to the  
north. After touching water she, dressed in saffron garments, then closed her  
eyes to find absorption in the process of yoga. Balancing the inward and  
outward going breath she, the blameless one, in the control of her yogic  
posture with intelligence directed her life air upward. She raised it  
gradually up from the navel cakra to the heart, from the heart to the windpipe  
and from the throat to the place between her eyebrows. In her desire to give  
it up because of her anger towards Daksha, she who time and again full of  
respect sat on the lap of the most worshipful one of all saints, thus by the  
exercise of her own will focussed on the air and fire within her body. When  
she right there within her mind saw nothing but the nectarean lotus feet of  
her husband, the supreme spiritual teacher of the universe and was freed from  
all impurities, soon the body of Sati was ablaze because of the fire that  
originated from her absorption.

**_The First Step in God Realization_**  
 **My obeisances unto the Supreme Lord Vasudeva.   
Shuka said: 'This inquiry of yours for the good of all is the best thing you  
can do, because this subject of study oh King, carries the approval of the  
transcendentalists and constitutes the supreme of all that is worth the  
attention. There are countless subject matters to hear about in human society,  
oh Emperor, that are the interest of those materially engrossed ones who are  
blind to the reality of the soul. They spend their lives oh King, with  
sleeping and having sex during the night and with making money and taking care  
of their family during the day. All too attached to the fallible allies of the  
body, the children, the wife and everything thereto, they despite their  
experience, do not see the finality of these matters. For this reason, oh  
descendant of Bharata, He must be discussed, glorified and remembered who as  
the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality, the controller and vanquishing Lord  
frees those from their anxieties who are of desire. All this analyzing of  
one's particular nature and how a person after being born should attain to the  
full awareness of the Supreme, in the end is only to remember Narayana(Lord).  
Generally,those sages who went beyond the sphere of prescriptions and  
restrictions oh King, are the ones who take pleasure in especially describing  
the glories of the Lord.   
This story called the Bhagavatam contains the essence of the Vedas and was by  
me, at the end of this Dvapara-yuga, studied under the guidance of my father  
Dvaipayana Vyasa. Fully realized as I was,in transcendence, my attention was  
drawn towards the enlightened verses about the Lord's pastimes oh saintly  
King, and thus I studied the narration. I will recite it to you, because you,  
oh goodness, are a most sincere devotee. They who respectfully dedicate their  
full attention to it very soon will realize an unflinching faith in Mukunda  
[Krishna as the Lord granting liberation]. (For those who are free from  
material desires as also for those who are desirous and for all who being free  
from fear and doubts are united within [the yogis] oh King, according to the  
tradition, repeated singing of the Lord's holy name is the approved method.  
What is the use of spending one's years as an ignoramus in this world without  
having [this] experience? The hour one deliberately spends in service of the  
higher cause is the better one. The saintly king known as Khathvanga set aside  
everything when he knew that he had but a moment to live longer in this world  
and thus experienced the full security of the Lord. Oh member of the Kuru  
family, therefore also your life's duration that is limited to seven days,  
should inspire you to perform everything needed for a next, higher life.  
Seeing the end of one's life one should be free from the fear of death by  
cutting, with the help of the weapon of non-attachment, with all desires as  
also with everything associated with them. Piously self controlled,having left  
one's home for a sacred place, one should in solitude sit down on a properly  
cleansed and purified place,and assume the proper posture. After sitting in  
the above manner, make the mind remember the three transcendental letters  
[a-u-m], and by regulating the breathing process, control the mind so not to  
forget the transcendental seed. Gradually, as the mind becomes progressively  
spiritualized, withdraw it from sense activities, and by intelligence the  
senses will be controlled. This way the mind should be fully focused on the  
Lord. Thereafter, you should meditate upon the limbs of the Lord, one after  
another, without being deviated from the conception of the complete body. Thus  
the mind becomes free from all sense objects. There should be no other thing  
to be thought upon. Because the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, is the Ultimate Truth,  
the mind becomes completely reconciled in Him only. One's mind is always  
agitated by the passionate mode of material nature and bewildered by the  
ignorant mode. But one can rectify such conceptions with relation with Lord  
and thus become pacified by cleansing the dirty things created by them. They  
who fixed in the habit of such remembrance seek unification and hold on to  
this devotion will soon be of success.'   
The fortunate King Pariksit, inquiring further, said: O brahmana, please  
describe in full detail how and where the mind has to be applied and how the  
conception can be fixed in order to directly escape from a polluted mind?'   
Shuka said: 'When one sits down in control, has subdued one's breath and has  
conquered one's attachment as also one's senses, one should focus one's  
attention upon the gross appearance,potencies of the Supreme Lord [the virath-  
rupa].**   
 **His individual body is this gross material world in which we experience all  
that belongs to the past, the present and the future of this universe in  
existence. This outer shell of the universe known as a body with seven  
coverings [fire, water, earth, sky, ego, noumenon and phenomenon, see also  
koshas], is the conception of the object of the Universal Form of the Purusha  
as the Supreme Lord. The lower worlds are recognized by the ones who studied  
it as the soles of His feet [called Patala] to which His heels and toes are  
called Rasatala, His ankles Mahatala while the shanks of the gigantic person  
are called the Talatala worlds. The two knees of the Universal Form are called  
Sutala, the thighs Vitala and Atala and the hips are named Mah?tala, o King,  
while outer space is taken to be the depression of His navel. The higher  
illumined worlds are his chest, with above it the neck called Mahar, His mouth  
planets called Janas,while Tapas is the name of the worlds which are the  
forehead,with Sathyaloka [the world of Truth] as the uppermost of the worlds  
of Him who has a thousand heads. The gods headed by Indra are His arms, the  
four directions are His ears and sound is His sense of hearing. The nostrils  
of the Supreme are the Ashvini-kumaras [demigods], while fragrance is His  
sense of smell and His mouth the blazing fire.The sphere of outer space  
constitutes His eyepits, and the eyeball is the sun as the power of seeing.  
His eyelids are both the day and night, and in the movements of His eyebrows,  
Brahma and similar supreme personalities reside. His palate is the director of  
water, Varu ṇa, and the juice or essence of everything is His tongue. They say  
that the vedic Hymns are the thoughtprocess of the Supreme, that his jaws make  
up Yamar?ja [the Lord of death], His teeth are His affection and that His  
smile is the most alluring unsurpassable material energy [maya]; the material  
creation is but the casting of His glance. Modesty is His upper lip, His chin  
for sure the hankering, religion is His breast, and the way of irreligion His  
back. Brahma is His genitals, His testicles are the Mitra-varunas, His waist  
the oceans and the stack of His bones are the mountains. His veins are the  
rivers and the plants and trees are the hairs on the body of the Universal  
Form, o King. The air is His omnipotent breathing, the passing ages are His  
movement and the reactions of the modes of material nature are His activities.  
Let me tell you that the hairs on the head of the Supreme Controller are the  
clouds, o best of the Kuru's, and that the intelligence of the Almighty is the  
prime cause of the material creation, so one says. His mind, the reservoir of  
all changes, is known as the moon. The singing of the birds is His artistic  
sense and Manu, the father of man forms the contents of His thought with  
humanity as His residence. The angelic and celestial beings [the Gandharva's,  
Vidyadharas and Caranas] constitute his musical rhythm while the remembrance  
of terrorizing soldiers represents His prowess. His face is the brahmaṇas, His  
arms are the kṣatriyas, His thighs are the vaisyas, and the sudras are under  
the protection of His feet. All the worshipable demigods are also overtaken by  
Him, and it is the duty of everyone to perform sacrifices with feasible goods  
to appease the Lord. I have thus explained to you the gross material gigantic  
conception of the Lord. One who seriously desires liberation concentrates his  
mind on this form, because there is nothing beyond Him. One should concentrate  
his mind upon the Supreme,who is the Soul of All, who alone distributes  
Himself in so many manifestations just as ordinary persons create thousands of  
manifestations in dreams. One must concentrate the mind on Him, the only all-  
blissful Absolute Truth. Otherwise one will be misled and will cause his own  
degradation.

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'   
Lord Krishna's Queens

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

## Re:[35]Love,always love and only love Excerpts from Srimad Bhagavatam  
Author: Jewell              Date: November 11, 2015, 12:31:54 AM

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'

**_The Hamsa-avatara Answers the Questions of the Sons of Brahma_**  
 **Uddhava said: 'When and in what form dear Kes'ava, have You instructed  
Sanaka and the others in this yoga? That is what I would like to know.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The sons headed by Sanaka who took their birth from  
the mind of him who originated from the golden egg [Hiranyagarbha or Brahma],  
inquired of their father about the so very subtle, supreme goal of the science  
of yoga. Sanaka and the others said to him: 'The mind is directed at the  
gunas, the qualities of nature, and the gunas impose themselves on the mind.  
Oh Master, what is for someone who desires liberation, for someone who wishes  
to cross over this material ocean, the process of breaking away from that  
mutual effect ?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The great self-born godhead, the creator of all  
beings, thus being questioned, seriously pondered over what was asked but  
could not find the words to describe the essential truth, for his mind was  
bewildered because of his creative labor. With the desire to find closure he  
remembered Me, the original godhead, and at that time I became visible in My  
Hamsa form [the Swan]. Seeing Me they, headed by Brahma, approached Me,  
offered their obeisances at My lotus feet and asked: 'Who are You?'   
Thus being questioned by the sages interested in the ultimate truth, I spoke  
to them. Please Uddhava, hear now what I said to them that moment.   
Oh brahmins, relating to the one true essence,in the concept of  
nonindividuality of the jiva soul,how is your question possible or  
appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of  
yourselves and of Me?   
If by asking me "Who are you?" you were referring to the material body, then I  
must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements,  
namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, "Who  
are you five?" If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one,  
being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is  
still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one  
body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking my identity, you are merely  
speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.   
Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other  
senses is me alone and nothing besides me. All of you please understand this  
by a straightforward analysis of the facts.   
Dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense  
objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this  
material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the  
spirit soul, who is part and parcel of me.   
A person who has thus achieved me by understanding that he is not different  
from me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects  
because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are  
existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood my  
transcendental nature, he gives up both the mind and its objects.   
Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence  
and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the  
body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three  
states and thus remains us a witness to them.   
The soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him  
constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage  
of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming  
situated in me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness.  
At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense  
objects and the mind.   
The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him  
exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent  
person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain  
situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.   
According to my instructions, one should fix the mind on me alone. If,  
however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather  
than seeing everything within me, then although apparently awake, one is  
actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one  
has wakened from a dream.   
Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Lord have  
no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the  
Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities  
and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the  
Lord's existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities,  
thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.   
While awake the soul enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting  
characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys  
similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such  
experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the  
succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can  
understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is  
transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.   
You should consider how, by the influence of my illusory energy, these three  
states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially  
imagined to exist in me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul,  
you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical  
reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to  
completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts.  
All of you should then worship me, who am situated within the heart.   
One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the  
mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are  
here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line  
created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the  
single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many  
different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's  
consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such  
varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a  
dream.   
Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus  
having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without  
material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give  
up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the  
material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and  
therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time  
of death, one will not again fall into illusion.   
Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt,  
similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved  
his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or  
standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he  
obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken  
man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.   
The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and  
therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as  
one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to  
the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of  
yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold  
manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.   
Dear Brahmins, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of  
Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of  
astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I  
am the Lord, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your  
actual religious duties.   
Best of the Brahmins, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga  
system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles,  
power, beauty, fame and self-control.   
All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of  
nature, detached, the well -wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally  
situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement - all such qualities,  
free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter in  
me.   
Dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were  
destroyed by my words. Fully worshiping me with transcendental love and  
devotion, they chanted my glories with excellent hymns.   
11/13;15-42**

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'

**_The Hamsa-avatara Answers the Questions of the Sons of Brahma_**  
 **Uddhava said: 'When and in what form dear Kes'ava, have You instructed  
Sanaka and the others in this yoga? That is what I would like to know.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The sons headed by Sanaka who took their birth from  
the mind of him who originated from the golden egg [Hiranyagarbha or Brahma],  
inquired of their father about the so very subtle, supreme goal of the science  
of yoga. Sanaka and the others said to him: 'The mind is directed at the  
gunas, the qualities of nature, and the gunas impose themselves on the mind.  
Oh Master, what is for someone who desires liberation, for someone who wishes  
to cross over this material ocean, the process of breaking away from that  
mutual effect ?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The great self-born godhead, the creator of all  
beings, thus being questioned, seriously pondered over what was asked but  
could not find the words to describe the essential truth, for his mind was  
bewildered because of his creative labor. With the desire to find closure he  
remembered Me, the original godhead, and at that time I became visible in My  
Hamsa form [the Swan]. Seeing Me they, headed by Brahma, approached Me,  
offered their obeisances at My lotus feet and asked: 'Who are You?'   
Thus being questioned by the sages interested in the ultimate truth, I spoke  
to them. Please Uddhava, hear now what I said to them that moment.   
Oh brahmins, relating to the one true essence,in the concept of  
nonindividuality of the jiva soul,how is your question possible or  
appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of  
yourselves and of Me?   
If by asking me "Who are you?" you were referring to the material body, then I  
must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements,  
namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, "Who  
are you five?" If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one,  
being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is  
still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one  
body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking my identity, you are merely  
speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.   
Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other  
senses is me alone and nothing besides me. All of you please understand this  
by a straightforward analysis of the facts.   
Dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense  
objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this  
material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the  
spirit soul, who is part and parcel of me.   
A person who has thus achieved me by understanding that he is not different  
from me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects  
because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are  
existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood my  
transcendental nature, he gives up both the mind and its objects.   
Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence  
and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the  
body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three  
states and thus remains us a witness to them.   
The soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him  
constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage  
of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming  
situated in me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness.  
At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense  
objects and the mind.   
The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him  
exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent  
person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain  
situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.   
According to my instructions, one should fix the mind on me alone. If,  
however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather  
than seeing everything within me, then although apparently awake, one is  
actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one  
has wakened from a dream.   
Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Lord have  
no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the  
Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities  
and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the  
Lord's existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities,  
thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.   
While awake the soul enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting  
characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys  
similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such  
experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the  
succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can  
understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is  
transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.   
You should consider how, by the influence of my illusory energy, these three  
states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially  
imagined to exist in me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul,  
you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical  
reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to  
completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts.  
All of you should then worship me, who am situated within the heart.   
One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the  
mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are  
here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line  
created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the  
single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many  
different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's  
consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such  
varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a  
dream.   
Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus  
having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without  
material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give  
up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the  
material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and  
therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time  
of death, one will not again fall into illusion.   
Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt,  
similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved  
his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or  
standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he  
obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken  
man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.   
The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and  
therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as  
one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to  
the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of  
yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold  
manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.   
Dear Brahmins, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of  
Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of  
astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I  
am the Lord, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your  
actual religious duties.   
Best of the Brahmins, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga  
system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles,  
power, beauty, fame and self-control.   
All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of  
nature, detached, the well -wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally  
situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement - all such qualities,  
free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter in  
me.   
Dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were  
destroyed by my words. Fully worshiping me with transcendental love and  
devotion, they chanted my glories with excellent hymns.   
11/13;15-42**

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'   
Lord Krishna's Queens

 **Uddhava said: 'When and in what form dear Kes'ava, have You instructed  
Sanaka and the others in this yoga? That is what I would like to know.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The sons headed by Sanaka who took their birth from  
the mind of him who originated from the golden egg [Hiranyagarbha or Brahma],  
inquired of their father about the so very subtle, supreme goal of the science  
of yoga. Sanaka and the others said to him: 'The mind is directed at the  
gunas, the qualities of nature, and the gunas impose themselves on the mind.  
Oh Master, what is for someone who desires liberation, for someone who wishes  
to cross over this material ocean, the process of breaking away from that  
mutual effect ?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The great self-born godhead, the creator of all  
beings, thus being questioned, seriously pondered over what was asked but  
could not find the words to describe the essential truth, for his mind was  
bewildered because of his creative labor. With the desire to find closure he  
remembered Me, the original godhead, and at that time I became visible in My  
Hamsa form [the Swan]. Seeing Me they, headed by Brahma, approached Me,  
offered their obeisances at My lotus feet and asked: 'Who are You?'   
Thus being questioned by the sages interested in the ultimate truth, I spoke  
to them. Please Uddhava, hear now what I said to them that moment.   
Oh brahmins, relating to the one true essence,in the concept of  
nonindividuality of the jiva soul,how is your question possible or  
appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of  
yourselves and of Me?   
If by asking me "Who are you?" you were referring to the material body, then I  
must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements,  
namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, "Who  
are you five?" If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one,  
being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is  
still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one  
body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking my identity, you are merely  
speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.   
Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other  
senses is me alone and nothing besides me. All of you please understand this  
by a straightforward analysis of the facts.   
Dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense  
objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this  
material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the  
spirit soul, who is part and parcel of me.   
A person who has thus achieved me by understanding that he is not different  
from me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects  
because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are  
existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood my  
transcendental nature, he gives up both the mind and its objects.   
Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence  
and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the  
body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three  
states and thus remains us a witness to them.   
The soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him  
constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage  
of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming  
situated in me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness.  
At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense  
objects and the mind.   
The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him  
exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent  
person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain  
situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.   
According to my instructions, one should fix the mind on me alone. If,  
however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather  
than seeing everything within me, then although apparently awake, one is  
actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one  
has wakened from a dream.   
Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Lord have  
no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the  
Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities  
and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the  
Lord's existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities,  
thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.   
While awake the soul enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting  
characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys  
similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such  
experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the  
succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can  
understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is  
transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.   
You should consider how, by the influence of my illusory energy, these three  
states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially  
imagined to exist in me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul,  
you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical  
reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to  
completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts.  
All of you should then worship me, who am situated within the heart.   
One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the  
mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are  
here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line  
created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the  
single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many  
different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's  
consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such  
varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a  
dream.   
Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus  
having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without  
material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give  
up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the  
material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and  
therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time  
of death, one will not again fall into illusion.   
Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt,  
similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved  
his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or  
standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he  
obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken  
man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.   
The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and  
therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as  
one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to  
the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of  
yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold  
manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.   
Dear Brahmins, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of  
Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of  
astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I  
am the Lord, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your  
actual religious duties.   
Best of the Brahmins, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga  
system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles,  
power, beauty, fame and self-control.   
All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of  
nature, detached, the well -wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally  
situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement - all such qualities,  
free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter in  
me.   
Dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were  
destroyed by my words. Fully worshiping me with transcendental love and  
devotion, they chanted my glories with excellent hymns.   
11/13;15-42**

**_The Hamsa-guhya Prayers Offered to the Lord by Prajapati Daksha_**  
 **Daksha said: 'My obeisances unto Him,from whom we learn the proper way to  
transcend the modes and the material energy to which all living beings are  
bound,   
unto Him, the self-born Controller beyond measure,Who in His abode cannot be  
perceived by intelligence immersed in materialism.   
My Great respect for the friend with whom one lives in this body and of whose  
friendship a person has no knowledge, just as the sense objects have no  
knowledge of the sense organ that perceives them.   
The living being has knowledge of this body with its types of breath, its  
internal and external senses, its elements and sense objects,and material as  
they are,they do not now themselves, each other or anything outside of them.  
But the living being knowing about the modes of nature and all these qualities  
[on its turn] has no knowledge of Him who knows each and all.   
I praise Him, this unlimited Lord.   
When the mind has come to a stop, in the absorption of yoga, and thus all  
names and projections of a material vision and remembrance have ceased, one  
will perceive Him in His unique completeness.   
To Him, that swanlike personality,who is realized in the purest state, I offer  
my respects.   
The same way as they who are experts in sacrificing extract the fire dormant  
in firewood with singing the fifteen hymns, the devotees discover Him who  
hides in their hearts that are covered by the three modes of nature and the  
nine aspects of matter [of material nature and her sixteen elements -  
prakriti, the individual soul - the purusha, the cosmic intelligence - the  
mahat-tattva, the false ego - ahankara, and the five sense objects - the  
tanmatras].   
Freeing oneself from the illusory diversity by the negation,He who is  
realized in the bliss, He of all names, He the gigantic form of the universe,  
may He, that inconceivable reservoir of all qualities be merciful unto me.   
Whatever one expresses in words, ascertains by contemplation, perceives with  
the senses or has in mind, everything that exists as an expression of the  
three modes, cannot be His essential nature. One knows Him in truth [only] as  
the cause of the creation and destruction of that what is characterized by the  
modes.   
_Everything is situated in Him, everything originated from Him and everything  
is moved by Him. Everything belongs to Him and everything is there for Him._   
Whether He acts or incites to act, He is the Supreme Cause of our material and  
spiritual existence known to all.   
_He is Brahman, the Cause of All Causes, the incomparable One beyond whom no  
other cause can be found._   
My obeisances unto that unlimited, all-pervading Lord of all transcendental  
attributes about whose many energies the speakers of the different  
philosophies, in dispute and agreement concerning causes, in their creativity  
are continuously off the track of the true self, the Supersoul.   
The subject matter discussed by the philosophies of sankhya [analysis,  
numbers] and yoga [unification, devotion] is concerned with a different,  
opposing nature. But when they speak if the absolute has a form,or the  
absolute is formless, they deal with one and the same beneficent,  
transcendental cause.   
 In order to bestow His mercy upon the devotees at His lotus feet He, the  
eternal, Supreme who is not bound to any name or form, manifests with the  
forms and holy names and engages in action.   
May He, the One of Transcendence, be merciful with me.   
He who by the lower grade paths of worship manifests from within the core of  
the heart according to the desires of each living being, gains in color and  
odor, just like the wind blowing over the earth.   
May He, my Lord, fulfill my wish to be allowed in His service.'   
Canto 6,chapter 4   
23/34**

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'   
10;26**

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'

**_The Hamsa-avatara Answers the Questions of the Sons of Brahma_**  
 **Uddhava said: 'When and in what form dear Kes'ava, have You instructed  
Sanaka and the others in this yoga? That is what I would like to know.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The sons headed by Sanaka who took their birth from  
the mind of him who originated from the golden egg [Hiranyagarbha or Brahma],  
inquired of their father about the so very subtle, supreme goal of the science  
of yoga. Sanaka and the others said to him: 'The mind is directed at the  
gunas, the qualities of nature, and the gunas impose themselves on the mind.  
Oh Master, what is for someone who desires liberation, for someone who wishes  
to cross over this material ocean, the process of breaking away from that  
mutual effect ?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The great self-born godhead, the creator of all  
beings, thus being questioned, seriously pondered over what was asked but  
could not find the words to describe the essential truth, for his mind was  
bewildered because of his creative labor. With the desire to find closure he  
remembered Me, the original godhead, and at that time I became visible in My  
Hamsa form [the Swan]. Seeing Me they, headed by Brahma, approached Me,  
offered their obeisances at My lotus feet and asked: 'Who are You?'   
Thus being questioned by the sages interested in the ultimate truth, I spoke  
to them. Please Uddhava, hear now what I said to them that moment.   
Oh brahmins, relating to the one true essence,in the concept of  
nonindividuality of the jiva soul,how is your question possible or  
appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of  
yourselves and of Me?   
If by asking me "Who are you?" you were referring to the material body, then I  
must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements,  
namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, "Who  
are you five?" If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one,  
being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is  
still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one  
body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking my identity, you are merely  
speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.   
Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other  
senses is me alone and nothing besides me. All of you please understand this  
by a straightforward analysis of the facts.   
Dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense  
objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this  
material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the  
spirit soul, who is part and parcel of me.   
A person who has thus achieved me by understanding that he is not different  
from me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects  
because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are  
existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood my  
transcendental nature, he gives up both the mind and its objects.   
Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence  
and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the  
body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three  
states and thus remains us a witness to them.   
The soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him  
constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage  
of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming  
situated in me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness.  
At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense  
objects and the mind.   
The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him  
exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent  
person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain  
situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.   
According to my instructions, one should fix the mind on me alone. If,  
however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather  
than seeing everything within me, then although apparently awake, one is  
actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one  
has wakened from a dream.   
Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Lord have  
no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the  
Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities  
and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the  
Lord's existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities,  
thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.   
While awake the soul enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting  
characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys  
similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such  
experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the  
succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can  
understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is  
transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.   
You should consider how, by the influence of my illusory energy, these three  
states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially  
imagined to exist in me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul,  
you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical  
reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to  
completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts.  
All of you should then worship me, who am situated within the heart.   
One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the  
mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are  
here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line  
created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the  
single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many  
different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's  
consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such  
varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a  
dream.   
Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus  
having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without  
material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give  
up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the  
material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and  
therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time  
of death, one will not again fall into illusion.   
Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt,  
similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved  
his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or  
standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he  
obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken  
man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.   
The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and  
therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as  
one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to  
the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of  
yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold  
manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.   
Dear Brahmins, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of  
Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of  
astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I  
am the Lord, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your  
actual religious duties.   
Best of the Brahmins, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga  
system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles,  
power, beauty, fame and self-control.   
All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of  
nature, detached, the well -wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally  
situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement - all such qualities,  
free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter in  
me.   
Dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were  
destroyed by my words. Fully worshiping me with transcendental love and  
devotion, they chanted my glories with excellent hymns.   
11/13;15-42**

**_The Hamsa-guhya Prayers Offered to the Lord by Prajapati Daksha_**  
 **Daksha said: 'My obeisances unto Him,from whom we learn the proper way to  
transcend the modes and the material energy to which all living beings are  
bound,   
unto Him, the self-born Controller beyond measure,Who in His abode cannot be  
perceived by intelligence immersed in materialism.   
My Great respect for the friend with whom one lives in this body and of whose  
friendship a person has no knowledge, just as the sense objects have no  
knowledge of the sense organ that perceives them.   
The living being has knowledge of this body with its types of breath, its  
internal and external senses, its elements and sense objects,and material as  
they are,they do not now themselves, each other or anything outside of them.  
But the living being knowing about the modes of nature and all these qualities  
[on its turn] has no knowledge of Him who knows each and all.   
I praise Him, this unlimited Lord.   
When the mind has come to a stop, in the absorption of yoga, and thus all  
names and projections of a material vision and remembrance have ceased, one  
will perceive Him in His unique completeness.   
To Him, that swanlike personality,who is realized in the purest state, I offer  
my respects.   
The same way as they who are experts in sacrificing extract the fire dormant  
in firewood with singing the fifteen hymns, the devotees discover Him who  
hides in their hearts that are covered by the three modes of nature and the  
nine aspects of matter [of material nature and her sixteen elements -  
prakriti, the individual soul - the purusha, the cosmic intelligence - the  
mahat-tattva, the false ego - ahankara, and the five sense objects - the  
tanmatras].   
Freeing oneself from the illusory diversity by the negation,He who is  
realized in the bliss, He of all names, He the gigantic form of the universe,  
may He, that inconceivable reservoir of all qualities be merciful unto me.   
Whatever one expresses in words, ascertains by contemplation, perceives with  
the senses or has in mind, everything that exists as an expression of the  
three modes, cannot be His essential nature. One knows Him in truth [only] as  
the cause of the creation and destruction of that what is characterized by the  
modes.   
_Everything is situated in Him, everything originated from Him and everything  
is moved by Him. Everything belongs to Him and everything is there for Him._   
Whether He acts or incites to act, He is the Supreme Cause of our material and  
spiritual existence known to all.   
_He is Brahman, the Cause of All Causes, the incomparable One beyond whom no  
other cause can be found._   
My obeisances unto that unlimited, all-pervading Lord of all transcendental  
attributes about whose many energies the speakers of the different  
philosophies, in dispute and agreement concerning causes, in their creativity  
are continuously off the track of the true self, the Supersoul.   
The subject matter discussed by the philosophies of sankhya [analysis,  
numbers] and yoga [unification, devotion] is concerned with a different,  
opposing nature. But when they speak if the absolute has a form,or the  
absolute is formless, they deal with one and the same beneficent,  
transcendental cause.   
 In order to bestow His mercy upon the devotees at His lotus feet He, the  
eternal, Supreme who is not bound to any name or form, manifests with the  
forms and holy names and engages in action.   
May He, the One of Transcendence, be merciful with me.   
He who by the lower grade paths of worship manifests from within the core of  
the heart according to the desires of each living being, gains in color and  
odor, just like the wind blowing over the earth.   
May He, my Lord, fulfill my wish to be allowed in His service.'   
Canto 6,chapter 4

**_The Sages Narada and Angira Instruct King Citraketu_**  
_Shuka said: 'The sages Narada and Angira, in order to give spiritual  
instruction spoke to the king, who like a dead man fallen at the side of the  
corpse of his son, was very much aggrieved.   
 'Oh best of kings, the person you are lamenting about, who is he actually oh  
lord? Who has he been in his previous birth, who is he now and who will he be  
hereafter?   
 Just like grains of sand wash ashore and drift apart by the force of the  
waves, the embodied souls are united and separated by time. Just as from seeds  
sometimes grains grow and sometimes not grow, the living entities, impelled by  
the material potency of the Supreme Lord, sometimes produce other living  
beings and sometimes not.   
 We, you and also the other creatures moving and not moving about here at the  
moment oh King, were not together before this birth, nor will we be together  
after we die, despite our sharing the same present.   
 The Ruler of All, as indifferent as a playing boy, creates, maintains and  
destroys living beings through other living beings; they who were created by  
Him do not exist independent of Him.   
 By the body of the embodied soul a body is created from another body, just as  
indeed from one seed another seed is generated. This way temporally embodied  
soul is eternal, just as the constituent elements of matter are.   
 To consider this body separate from its indweller is, just like separating  
the individual from the group, the product of an age-long form of ignorance  
Such a separation is just like the separation of souls, in essence, an  
imaginary one.'   
 'King Citraketu, consoled by what the twice-born ones thus told him, wiped  
his shriveled face with his hand and spoke. The honorable king said: 'The two of you who arrived here in the dress of renunciates, are accomplished  
in spiritual knowledge and the greatest of the greatest.   
You as brahmins dear to the Lord, dressed up like madmen wander the surface of  
the earth as you like in order to enlighten those who, like me, are of a  
worldly intelligence.   
Sanat-kumara, Narada, Ribhu, Angira, Devala, Asita, Apantaratama [an early  
name of Vyasadeva], Markandeya and Gautama; Vasishthha, Bhagavan Parashurama,  
Kapila, Shukadeva, Durvasa, Yajnavalkya and Jatukarna as also Aruni, Romasha,  
Cyavana, Dattatreya, Asuri, Patanjali, the sage Dhaumya head of the Vedas and  
the wise Pancashikha, Hiranyanabha, Kaus'alya, Shrutadeva and Ritadhvaja; all  
these and other masters of perfection are the wandering spiritual educators.   
 Therefore, let me be enlightened by your torchlight of spiritual knowledge oh  
masters, for I am but a foolish village dog bereft of vision in the darkness.'   
Sage Angira said: 'I am the same Angira who granted you the son you wanted oh King, and this son  
of Brahma here is the great sage Narada in person. This grief of  
yours,because your son being merged in darkness, does not befit you.   
You are supposed to remember the Supreme Personality.   
The two of us have arrived here visibly before your eyes in order to support  
you oh King. You, as someone anchored in Brahman and devoted to the Lord, we  
have to tell that you don't deserve it to come down like this.   
The first time I came to your home, I could have given you the spiritual  
knowledge of transcendence, but, since you were absorbed in other matters, I  
could only give you a son.   
 And now you undergo the tribulation of someone with children, a nice wife, a  
home, riches and various assets and luxuries. The objects of the senses of  
concern to you, like a kingdom, opulence, land and royalty, power and a  
treasury with servants, ministers and allies, all belong to the temporality.   
All of this oh Ruler of Shurasena, constitutes a lamentable illusion giving  
rise to fears and distress; these are figments concocted by the mind,  
preoccupations which are only castles in the air.   
That what you're so concerned about is without any substance, that what you  
meditate upon are fabrications born from profit-minded actions.   
All these sorts of karmic engagements originate from the mind.   
This body of the living entity consists of material elements and senses of  
action and perception. These are declared to be the cause of the various  
sufferings and pains of the living entity. Therefore be careful with the  
things of the mind and consider your real position, give up your belief in the  
duality as being something permanent; take to the peaceful condition.'   
Canto 6,Chapter 15_**

**_cont...   
The son of Vyasa said: 'The devarishi,oh King, then brought the deceased son of the king,who was  
called Harshas'oka, or 'jubilation and lamentation', before the mind's eye of  
the lamenting relatives and addressed him.   
Sri Narada said: 'Oh living soul, all good fortune to you, behold your mother, father, friends  
and relatives who, lamenting over you, are greatly distressed. To complete  
your life you may reenter your body and in the midst of your kin enjoy all  
pleasures of life in accepting the award of your father's royal throne.'   
The individual soul said: ' Because of my karma have been wandering among the gods, the animals and the  
human beings. In which of all those births were these people here my father  
and mother?   
 In the course of time eventually all people become each other's friends,  
family members, enemies, neutrals, well-wishers, indifferent or envious ones.  
Just as means of exchange like gold pass from one person to the other, the  
same way the individual soul passes through different species of life by  
different fathers. One always sees that the ties one has in human society are  
temporary; as long as one relates to it one claims ownership.   
So too the eternal, individual soul identifies himself in a certain birth with  
his body for as long as he is situated in it, even though he actually has no  
specific material identity.   
 This living entity is factually eternal, imperishable and most subtle, it  
constitutes the self-effulgence of all the different embodiments, the master  
who manifests himself as this material world by means of the gunas.   
For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable. He makes no  
distinction between that which is his own and that which belongs to anyone  
else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is not affected by  
friends and enemies. He is only an observer, a witness.   
The Soul is not affected by the happiness or harm resulting from actions.   
Perfectly neutral residing in the heart,he is the Lord overseeing cause and  
effect.

**_King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord_**  
_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.   
Canto 7;Chapter 10-1:21

_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.

_**The Dynasty of Bharata: the Story of Rantideva**_  
_The son of Vyasadeva said: 'From Manyu, the son of Vitatha [the name Bharadvaja carried because he was  
given to Bharata], there were the sons Brihatkshatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara  
and Garga. Nara had a son called Sankriti.   
From Sankriti there were Guru and Rantideva, oh scion of Pandu. The glories of  
Rantideva are sung in this world and the next.   
Subsisting on that what fate provided he [Rantideva] took pleasure in  
distributing to others whatever grain of food he had. Being very poor he with  
all his family members lived most soberly and had to suffer a lot. One morning  
when forty-eight days had passed and he even was deprived of drinking water,  
he happened to receive water and different foodstuffs prepared with ghee and  
milk. While the family was shaky because of the thirst and hunger they  
suffered, that very moment a brahmin guest arrived who also liked to eat.   
Rantideva conceived of the Lord as residing in each and everyone and thus he  
with great respect and faith gave him his share of the food. After the brahmin  
had eaten he departed.   
 When he had divided the food for the family and was just about to eat,  
someone else arrived, a sudra(lowborn, laborer), whom he, thinking of the  
Lord, gave the food that was reserved for him, the king.   
 After the sudra had left yet another guest arrived who was surrounded by  
dogs. He said: 'Oh King, please provide me and my hungry dogs with food!'   
He, the one in power, honored them with his obeisances and with great respect  
gave all the food that was left over to the dogs and their master.   
 Of the food only the drinking water remained and that too had to satisfy some  
outcaste who, arriving there when the king was about to drink, asked him: 'I  
am just lowborn, but please give me some water!'   
Hearing the pitiable words of the exhausted man he, being deeply moved,  
compassionately spoke the following nectarean words: 'I do not desire to attain the greatness of the eight perfections of the  
Supreme Lord,siddhis, or the cessation of repeated births. I accept all  
hardship in my staying among all the embodied living beings so that they are  
freed from their unhappiness.   
 Handing over my water to save this poor soul struggling for his life, I am  
freed from all the hunger, thirst, fatigue and shaking of my body, as also  
from all the poverty, distress, lamentation, depression and bewilderment!'   
Thus expressing himself that sober, kindhearted ruler gave the drinking water  
to the outcaste, even though he himself was on the verge of death because of  
his thirst. Then the controllers of the three worlds, the gods who grant  
those who desire the fruits all results, manifested themselves before him in  
their true identities,because they in their previous appearances in the form  
of the brahmin, the man with the dogs, the sudra and the outcaste, all had  
been creations of the illusory energy of Vishnu. Being true to them as someone  
without material aspirations for any benefit or possessions, he offered them  
his obeisances while he concentrated his mind upon Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord  
and the Supreme Self as the ultimate goal. Having nothing in his mind but  
purely being of service,focussing his consciousness on the Supreme Controller  
oh King, the illusory energy of the [three] material qualities meant nothing  
more to him than a dream.   
All the ones associated with his lead, all the followers of Rantideva, became  
first-class yogis fully devoted to Lord Narayana.

**_Narada worships Nara-Naraya ṇa   
You are the One overseeing this cosmic creation, the One who is not attached  
to being the master, nor do You, although You appear as a human being, suffer  
from hunger, thirst and fatigue. Nor is the vision of You, who are the seer of  
everything, ever polluted by the material qualities. I offer You, the  
unattached and pure, profound witness, my respects.   
Having forsaken one's identification with the body, one must, at the end of  
one's time [of living], with a devotional attitude concentrate one's mind upon  
You who are transcendental to the material qualities. This forsaking  
constitutes the perfection of the practice of yoga as explained by the  
almighty Lord Brahma. A person driven by desire thinks in fear about the  
present and future of his children, wife and wealth, but anyone who knows  
about the hopelessness of this vehicle of time, considers such endeavors only  
a waste of time because the body is lost in the end.   
 Therefore our master, oh Lord in the beyond, I pray that we by dint of the  
yoga unto You very soon may forsake this fixed notion of 'I' and 'mine' about  
the banality of this vehicle of time, this illusory reality of Yours which is  
so difficult to overcome, so that we may realize our original nature.'

**_The Supreme Lord Is Equal unto Everyone_**  
_Even though He is free from the modes, unborn and unmanifest, the Supreme  
Lord transcendental to the material world enters the material qualities of His  
illusory energy and accepts obligations and responsibilities,apparently  
acting like a conditioned soul. The qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas  
belong to material nature and not to the Supreme Soul oh King. For the Self  
there is no question of their combined prominence or decay. According to the  
time of their prevalence one with the mode of sattva [goodness] finds the  
devas and the rishis [the gods and sages], with the mode of rajas [passion]  
one encounters Asuras [the unenlightened ones] and with the mode of tamas  
[inertia] one is faced with Yakshas and R?kshasas [ghosts and demons]. The  
Supreme Lord is present in everyone?s heart, fostering the reactions of  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. The all-pervading Absolute exists within  
the heart of every living being, and a Wise man can perceive how He is present  
there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of  
fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, a thoughtful  
man can understand how much the Supreme Lord is present in someone's heart by  
seeing his actions. When the Supreme creates different types of bodies,  
offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character  
and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature -  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each  
body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation,  
using sattva-guṇa for maintenance, rajo-guṇa for creation and tamo-guṇa for  
annihilation.   
O great King, the Supreme Lord, the controller of the material and spiritual  
energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the Time  
to allow the material energy and the living being to act within the limits of  
time. Thus the Supreme is never under the time factor nor under the material  
energy.   
Although the Supreme Lord is beyond modes of nature, He seems to favors  
demigods,since they are influenced with sattva only. In this way, the asuras  
(demons), who are influenced by tamo-guṇa, are annihilated. But this all  
happens because of combination of gunas and the time factor. The Supreme Lord  
induces the time to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather,  
His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Urusrava.   
Sage Narada said: This body subject to insults, praise, honor and dishonor is the product of a  
lack of discrimination between the primal state of material nature [pradhana]  
and the supreme [position of the transcendental witness] oh King. Oh earthly  
ruler, because of this the living beings in this world suffer from the  
misconception of 'I' and 'mine', just as from the reproach and punishment  
associated with it. Living with this false conception one thinks that the  
destruction of bodies is the same as the destruction of living beings. The  
misconception [including reproaching Him and the fear for punishment] is there  
not because of Him [but because of being without Him] who is the beatitude of  
detachment and emancipation in person. How could there from His side, the side  
of the Soul of all, the Supreme One and Highest Control be any question of  
violence?   
Therefore, whether one is of a constant enmity, of devotion, of fear, of  
affection or of lusty desires, one should stay connected with the Lord and not  
care about anything else.   
A larva checked by a bee in a comb may be filled with anxiety and resentment,  
but because of that bee attain the same form. Just the same one may [like  
S'is'upala and Dantavakra] with Krishna, who as the Supreme Lord assumed a  
human form, [even] be freed from one's sins by constantly thinking of Him in  
enmity. Moved by lust, hatred, fear, affection and devotion many who united  
their mind in the Lord consequently gave up on sin and thus attained their  
destination. Oh King, the gop?s realized this by their lusty desires, Kamsa  
by his fear, S'is'upala and other kings by their hatred, Krishna's family  
members by their kinship, You [Pandavas] by your affection for Him and we  
through our bhakti. Not to be someone like Vena, who couldn't adopt any of  
these five forms of respect in regard of the Original Person, one must fix  
one's mind on Krishna in one of these ways.

Jewell/Friends,   
The Beauty and enchantment of the Lord's sport as baby Krishna are so  
attractive...We have these wonderful scenes from The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna: 1. **Incarnation of God**   
"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize  
Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who  
follow the path of devotion seek an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness  
of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when God is realized. In the  
Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama  
entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because  
the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus  
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled  
in the court burst into blossom."   
As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly  
fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No  
sooner did he say, "the lotus of the heart burst into blossom", than he went  
into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his countenance beaming and his lips  
parted in a smile.   
2. **ekangi prema**.   
GIRISH(to the Master): "Sir, what is ekangi prema?"   
MASTER: "It means one-sided love. For instance, the water does not seek the  
duck, but the duck loves water. There are other kinds of love: sadharani,  
samanjasa, and samartha. In the first, which is ordinary love, the lover seeks  
his own happiness; he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not.  
That was Chandravali's attitude toward Krishna. In the second, which is a  
compromise, both seek each other's happiness. This is a noble kind of love.  
But the third is the highest of all. Such a lover says to his beloved, 'Be  
happy yourself, whatever may happen to me.' Radha had this highest love. She  
was happy in Krishna's happiness. The gopis, too, had attained this exalted  
state.   
"Do you know who the gopis were? Ramachandra was wandering in the forest where  
sixty thousand rishis dwelt. They were very eager to see Him. He cast a tender  
glance at them. According to a certain Purana, theywere born later on as the  
gopis of Vrindavan."   
 A DEVOTEE: "Sir, who maybe called an antaranga?"   
MASTER: "Let me give an illustration. A natmandir has pillars inside and  
outside. An antaranga is like the inside pillars. Those who always live near  
the guru are the antarangas. (To Mahimacharan) "The jnani wants neither a form  
of God nor His Incarnation. While wandering in the forest, Ramachandra saw a  
number of rishis. They welcomed Him to their asrama with great love and said  
to Him: 'O Rama, today our life is blessed because we have seen You. But we  
know You as the son of Dasaratha. Bharadvaja and other sages call You a Divine  
Incarnation; but that is not our view. We meditate on the Indivisible  
Satchidananda.' Rama was pleased with them and smiled.   
Here are two wonderful presentations of songs on Lord Krishna: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRTkOpKumMs   
'Krishna Nee Begane Vaaro' (Krishna,do come swiftly)-Beautiful presentation of  
the song of Vyasa Raya on Udipi Baby Krishna set in the enchanting Raga Yamuna  
Kayani...The Singing is top notch,the Dance is wonderfully expressive and the  
paining depicts the Tri-banga(bent in three places) aspect -As Sri Ramakrishna  
beautifully said that this is the Love aspect that bends the rigid frame of  
the body and makes it so flexible...All the 3 Artists do a marvellous job and  
the Triveni (confluence of 3 Rivers)is wonderful.   
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9qMm3Zp2g8   
'Alai Paayuthey'(My mind is tossed like a wave)-This is a beautiful  
composition of the great devotee /composer ootthukkaadu Venkatasubhia  
Kavi...with English subtitles to follow the song....The Raga is Kaanada...all  
presented in fusion form but well done...No gimmickry.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Indeed,how pure and deep was the Love of Gopis toward Sri Krishna! And for how  
long is this Love inspiration for all of us!   
His life is full with such wonders and mysteries!   
And so true,it is not important how we approach Him,our own Heart and Soul.  
Either through personal aspect or through impersonal one,so long we are going  
toward the Truth.   
_Radha and Krishna   
Was it not he once in Brindavan? Woods divine to our yearning,   
Memorable always! flowers, delight on the tree-tops burning,   
Grasses his herds have grazed and crushed by his feet in the dancing,   
Yamuna flowing with song, through the greenness always advancing,   
Unforgotten remind; for his flute with its sweetness ensnaring   
Sounds in our ears in the night and our souls of their teguments baring   
Hales us out naked and absolute, out to his woodlands eternal,   
Out to his moonlit dances, his dalliance sweet and supernal.. . .   
Even an hour of the soul can unveil the Unborn, the Everlasting,   
Gaze on its mighty Companion; the load of mortality casting,   
Mind hushes stilled in eternity; waves of the Infinite wander   
Thrilling body and soul and its endless felicity squander;   
All world-sorrow is finished, the cry of the parting is over;   
Ecstasy laughs in our veins, in our heart is the heart of the Lover.   
Sri Aurobindo_**

**_King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord_**  
_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.

whose words cut off the excessive attachment of one's mind.   
My devotees fix their minds on Me and do not depend upon anything material.   
They are always peaceful, endowed with equal vision,   
and free from possessiveness, false ego, duality and greed.   
Oh most fortunate one,   
these greatly fortunate souls are constantly discussing My stories and My  
glories,   
that have the power to completely eradicate all the sins.   
They who, faithfully dedicated to Me, hear, chant and respectfully take them  
to heart,   
will attain devotion and love.

the Supreme Absolute Truth,

_**The Dynasty of Bharata: the Story of Rantideva**_  
_The son of Vyasadeva said: 'From Manyu, the son of Vitatha [the name Bharadvaja carried because he was  
given to Bharata], there were the sons Brihatkshatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara  
and Garga. Nara had a son called Sankriti.   
From Sankriti there were Guru and Rantideva, oh scion of Pandu. The glories of  
Rantideva are sung in this world and the next.   
Subsisting on that what fate provided he [Rantideva] took pleasure in  
distributing to others whatever grain of food he had. Being very poor he with  
all his family members lived most soberly and had to suffer a lot. One morning  
when forty-eight days had passed and he even was deprived of drinking water,  
he happened to receive water and different foodstuffs prepared with ghee and  
milk. While the family was shaky because of the thirst and hunger they  
suffered, that very moment a brahmin guest arrived who also liked to eat.   
Rantideva conceived of the Lord as residing in each and everyone and thus he  
with great respect and faith gave him his share of the food. After the brahmin  
had eaten he departed.   
 When he had divided the food for the family and was just about to eat,  
someone else arrived, a sudra(lowborn, laborer), whom he, thinking of the  
Lord, gave the food that was reserved for him, the king.   
 After the sudra had left yet another guest arrived who was surrounded by  
dogs. He said: 'Oh King, please provide me and my hungry dogs with food!'   
He, the one in power, honored them with his obeisances and with great respect  
gave all the food that was left over to the dogs and their master.   
 Of the food only the drinking water remained and that too had to satisfy some  
outcaste who, arriving there when the king was about to drink, asked him: 'I  
am just lowborn, but please give me some water!'   
Hearing the pitiable words of the exhausted man he, being deeply moved,  
compassionately spoke the following nectarean words: 'I do not desire to attain the greatness of the eight perfections of the  
Supreme Lord,siddhis, or the cessation of repeated births. I accept all  
hardship in my staying among all the embodied living beings so that they are  
freed from their unhappiness.   
 Handing over my water to save this poor soul struggling for his life, I am  
freed from all the hunger, thirst, fatigue and shaking of my body, as also  
from all the poverty, distress, lamentation, depression and bewilderment!'   
Thus expressing himself that sober, kindhearted ruler gave the drinking water  
to the outcaste, even though he himself was on the verge of death because of  
his thirst. Then the controllers of the three worlds, the gods who grant  
those who desire the fruits all results, manifested themselves before him in  
their true identities,because they in their previous appearances in the form  
of the brahmin, the man with the dogs, the sudra and the outcaste, all had  
been creations of the illusory energy of Vishnu. Being true to them as someone  
without material aspirations for any benefit or possessions, he offered them  
his obeisances while he concentrated his mind upon Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord  
and the Supreme Self as the ultimate goal. Having nothing in his mind but  
purely being of service,focussing his consciousness on the Supreme Controller  
oh King, the illusory energy of the [three] material qualities meant nothing  
more to him than a dream.   
All the ones associated with his lead, all the followers of Rantideva, became  
first-class yogis fully devoted to Lord Narayana.   
canto 9,chapter 21;1-18_**

**_Narada worships Nara-Naraya ṇa   
You are the One overseeing this cosmic creation, the One who is not attached  
to being the master, nor do You, although You appear as a human being, suffer  
from hunger, thirst and fatigue. Nor is the vision of You, who are the seer of  
everything, ever polluted by the material qualities. I offer You, the  
unattached and pure, profound witness, my respects.   
Having forsaken one's identification with the body, one must, at the end of  
one's time [of living], with a devotional attitude concentrate one's mind upon  
You who are transcendental to the material qualities. This forsaking  
constitutes the perfection of the practice of yoga as explained by the  
almighty Lord Brahma. A person driven by desire thinks in fear about the  
present and future of his children, wife and wealth, but anyone who knows  
about the hopelessness of this vehicle of time, considers such endeavors only  
a waste of time because the body is lost in the end.   
 Therefore our master, oh Lord in the beyond, I pray that we by dint of the  
yoga unto You very soon may forsake this fixed notion of 'I' and 'mine' about  
the banality of this vehicle of time, this illusory reality of Yours which is  
so difficult to overcome, so that we may realize our original nature.'

**_The Supreme Lord Is Equal unto Everyone_**  
_Even though He is free from the modes, unborn and unmanifest, the Supreme  
Lord transcendental to the material world enters the material qualities of His  
illusory energy and accepts obligations and responsibilities,apparently  
acting like a conditioned soul. The qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas  
belong to material nature and not to the Supreme Soul oh King. For the Self  
there is no question of their combined prominence or decay. According to the  
time of their prevalence one with the mode of sattva [goodness] finds the  
devas and the rishis [the gods and sages], with the mode of rajas [passion]  
one encounters Asuras [the unenlightened ones] and with the mode of tamas  
[inertia] one is faced with Yakshas and R?kshasas [ghosts and demons]. The  
Supreme Lord is present in everyone?s heart, fostering the reactions of  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. The all-pervading Absolute exists within  
the heart of every living being, and a Wise man can perceive how He is present  
there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of  
fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, a thoughtful  
man can understand how much the Supreme Lord is present in someone's heart by  
seeing his actions. When the Supreme creates different types of bodies,  
offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character  
and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature -  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each  
body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation,  
using sattva-guṇa for maintenance, rajo-guṇa for creation and tamo-guṇa for  
annihilation.   
O great King, the Supreme Lord, the controller of the material and spiritual  
energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the Time  
to allow the material energy and the living being to act within the limits of  
time. Thus the Supreme is never under the time factor nor under the material  
energy.   
Although the Supreme Lord is beyond modes of nature, He seems to favors  
demigods,since they are influenced with sattva only. In this way, the asuras  
(demons), who are influenced by tamo-guṇa, are annihilated. But this all  
happens because of combination of gunas and the time factor. The Supreme Lord  
induces the time to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather,  
His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Urusrava.   
Sage Narada said: This body subject to insults, praise, honor and dishonor is the product of a  
lack of discrimination between the primal state of material nature [pradhana]  
and the supreme [position of the transcendental witness] oh King. Oh earthly  
ruler, because of this the living beings in this world suffer from the  
misconception of 'I' and 'mine', just as from the reproach and punishment  
associated with it. Living with this false conception one thinks that the  
destruction of bodies is the same as the destruction of living beings. The  
misconception [including reproaching Him and the fear for punishment] is there  
not because of Him [but because of being without Him] who is the beatitude of  
detachment and emancipation in person. How could there from His side, the side  
of the Soul of all, the Supreme One and Highest Control be any question of  
violence?   
Therefore, whether one is of a constant enmity, of devotion, of fear, of  
affection or of lusty desires, one should stay connected with the Lord and not  
care about anything else.   
A larva checked by a bee in a comb may be filled with anxiety and resentment,  
but because of that bee attain the same form. Just the same one may [like  
S'is'upala and Dantavakra] with Krishna, who as the Supreme Lord assumed a  
human form, [even] be freed from one's sins by constantly thinking of Him in  
enmity. Moved by lust, hatred, fear, affection and devotion many who united  
their mind in the Lord consequently gave up on sin and thus attained their  
destination. Oh King, the gop?s realized this by their lusty desires, Kamsa  
by his fear, S'is'upala and other kings by their hatred, Krishna's family  
members by their kinship, You [Pandavas] by your affection for Him and we  
through our bhakti. Not to be someone like Vena, who couldn't adopt any of  
these five forms of respect in regard of the Original Person, one must fix  
one's mind on Krishna in one of these ways.

Jewell/Friends,   
The Beauty and enchantment of the Lord's sport as baby Krishna are so  
attractive...We have these wonderful scenes from The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna: 1. **Incarnation of God**   
"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize  
Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who  
follow the path of devotion seek an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness  
of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when God is realized. In the  
Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama  
entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because  
the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus  
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled  
in the court burst into blossom."   
As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly  
fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No  
sooner did he say, "the lotus of the heart burst into blossom", than he went  
into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his countenance beaming and his lips  
parted in a smile.   
2. **ekangi prema**.   
GIRISH(to the Master): "Sir, what is ekangi prema?"   
MASTER: "It means one-sided love. For instance, the water does not seek the  
duck, but the duck loves water. There are other kinds of love: sadharani,  
samanjasa, and samartha. In the first, which is ordinary love, the lover seeks  
his own happiness; he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not.  
That was Chandravali's attitude toward Krishna. In the second, which is a  
compromise, both seek each other's happiness. This is a noble kind of love.  
But the third is the highest of all. Such a lover says to his beloved, 'Be  
happy yourself, whatever may happen to me.' Radha had this highest love. She  
was happy in Krishna's happiness. The gopis, too, had attained this exalted  
state.   
"Do you know who the gopis were? Ramachandra was wandering in the forest where  
sixty thousand rishis dwelt. They were very eager to see Him. He cast a tender  
glance at them. According to a certain Purana, theywere born later on as the  
gopis of Vrindavan."   
 A DEVOTEE: "Sir, who maybe called an antaranga?"   
MASTER: "Let me give an illustration. A natmandir has pillars inside and  
outside. An antaranga is like the inside pillars. Those who always live near  
the guru are the antarangas. (To Mahimacharan) "The jnani wants neither a form  
of God nor His Incarnation. While wandering in the forest, Ramachandra saw a  
number of rishis. They welcomed Him to their asrama with great love and said  
to Him: 'O Rama, today our life is blessed because we have seen You. But we  
know You as the son of Dasaratha. Bharadvaja and other sages call You a Divine  
Incarnation; but that is not our view. We meditate on the Indivisible  
Satchidananda.' Rama was pleased with them and smiled.   
Here are two wonderful presentations of songs on Lord Krishna: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRTkOpKumMs   
'Krishna Nee Begane Vaaro' (Krishna,do come swiftly)-Beautiful presentation of  
the song of Vyasa Raya on Udipi Baby Krishna set in the enchanting Raga Yamuna  
Kayani...The Singing is top notch,the Dance is wonderfully expressive and the  
paining depicts the Tri-banga(bent in three places) aspect -As Sri Ramakrishna  
beautifully said that this is the Love aspect that bends the rigid frame of  
the body and makes it so flexible...All the 3 Artists do a marvellous job and  
the Triveni (confluence of 3 Rivers)is wonderful.   
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9qMm3Zp2g8   
'Alai Paayuthey'(My mind is tossed like a wave)-This is a beautiful  
composition of the great devotee /composer ootthukkaadu Venkatasubhia  
Kavi...with English subtitles to follow the song....The Raga is Kaanada...all  
presented in fusion form but well done...No gimmickry.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Indeed,how pure and deep was the Love of Gopis toward Sri Krishna! And for how  
long is this Love inspiration for all of us!   
His life is full with such wonders and mysteries!   
And so true,it is not important how we approach Him,our own Heart and Soul.  
Either through personal aspect or through impersonal one,so long we are going  
toward the Truth.   
_Radha and Krishna   
Was it not he once in Brindavan? Woods divine to our yearning,   
Memorable always! flowers, delight on the tree-tops burning,   
Grasses his herds have grazed and crushed by his feet in the dancing,   
Yamuna flowing with song, through the greenness always advancing,   
Unforgotten remind; for his flute with its sweetness ensnaring   
Sounds in our ears in the night and our souls of their teguments baring   
Hales us out naked and absolute, out to his woodlands eternal,   
Out to his moonlit dances, his dalliance sweet and supernal.. . .   
Even an hour of the soul can unveil the Unborn, the Everlasting,   
Gaze on its mighty Companion; the load of mortality casting,   
Mind hushes stilled in eternity; waves of the Infinite wander   
Thrilling body and soul and its endless felicity squander;   
All world-sorrow is finished, the cry of the parting is over;   
Ecstasy laughs in our veins, in our heart is the heart of the Lover.   
Sri Aurobindo_**

**_King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord_**  
_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.   
Canto 7;Chapter 10-1:21

_**The Dynasty of Bharata: the Story of Rantideva**_  
_The son of Vyasadeva said: 'From Manyu, the son of Vitatha [the name Bharadvaja carried because he was  
given to Bharata], there were the sons Brihatkshatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara  
and Garga. Nara had a son called Sankriti.   
From Sankriti there were Guru and Rantideva, oh scion of Pandu. The glories of  
Rantideva are sung in this world and the next.   
Subsisting on that what fate provided he [Rantideva] took pleasure in  
distributing to others whatever grain of food he had. Being very poor he with  
all his family members lived most soberly and had to suffer a lot. One morning  
when forty-eight days had passed and he even was deprived of drinking water,  
he happened to receive water and different foodstuffs prepared with ghee and  
milk. While the family was shaky because of the thirst and hunger they  
suffered, that very moment a brahmin guest arrived who also liked to eat.   
Rantideva conceived of the Lord as residing in each and everyone and thus he  
with great respect and faith gave him his share of the food. After the brahmin  
had eaten he departed.   
 When he had divided the food for the family and was just about to eat,  
someone else arrived, a sudra(lowborn, laborer), whom he, thinking of the  
Lord, gave the food that was reserved for him, the king.   
 After the sudra had left yet another guest arrived who was surrounded by  
dogs. He said: 'Oh King, please provide me and my hungry dogs with food!'   
He, the one in power, honored them with his obeisances and with great respect  
gave all the food that was left over to the dogs and their master.   
 Of the food only the drinking water remained and that too had to satisfy some  
outcaste who, arriving there when the king was about to drink, asked him: 'I  
am just lowborn, but please give me some water!'   
Hearing the pitiable words of the exhausted man he, being deeply moved,  
compassionately spoke the following nectarean words: 'I do not desire to attain the greatness of the eight perfections of the  
Supreme Lord,siddhis, or the cessation of repeated births. I accept all  
hardship in my staying among all the embodied living beings so that they are  
freed from their unhappiness.   
 Handing over my water to save this poor soul struggling for his life, I am  
freed from all the hunger, thirst, fatigue and shaking of my body, as also  
from all the poverty, distress, lamentation, depression and bewilderment!'   
Thus expressing himself that sober, kindhearted ruler gave the drinking water  
to the outcaste, even though he himself was on the verge of death because of  
his thirst. Then the controllers of the three worlds, the gods who grant  
those who desire the fruits all results, manifested themselves before him in  
their true identities,because they in their previous appearances in the form  
of the brahmin, the man with the dogs, the sudra and the outcaste, all had  
been creations of the illusory energy of Vishnu. Being true to them as someone  
without material aspirations for any benefit or possessions, he offered them  
his obeisances while he concentrated his mind upon Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord  
and the Supreme Self as the ultimate goal. Having nothing in his mind but  
purely being of service,focussing his consciousness on the Supreme Controller  
oh King, the illusory energy of the [three] material qualities meant nothing  
more to him than a dream.   
All the ones associated with his lead, all the followers of Rantideva, became  
first-class yogis fully devoted to Lord Narayana.

**_Narada worships Nara-Naraya ṇa   
You are the One overseeing this cosmic creation, the One who is not attached  
to being the master, nor do You, although You appear as a human being, suffer  
from hunger, thirst and fatigue. Nor is the vision of You, who are the seer of  
everything, ever polluted by the material qualities. I offer You, the  
unattached and pure, profound witness, my respects.   
Having forsaken one's identification with the body, one must, at the end of  
one's time [of living], with a devotional attitude concentrate one's mind upon  
You who are transcendental to the material qualities. This forsaking  
constitutes the perfection of the practice of yoga as explained by the  
almighty Lord Brahma. A person driven by desire thinks in fear about the  
present and future of his children, wife and wealth, but anyone who knows  
about the hopelessness of this vehicle of time, considers such endeavors only  
a waste of time because the body is lost in the end.   
 Therefore our master, oh Lord in the beyond, I pray that we by dint of the  
yoga unto You very soon may forsake this fixed notion of 'I' and 'mine' about  
the banality of this vehicle of time, this illusory reality of Yours which is  
so difficult to overcome, so that we may realize our original nature.'

**_The Supreme Lord Is Equal unto Everyone_**  
_Even though He is free from the modes, unborn and unmanifest, the Supreme  
Lord transcendental to the material world enters the material qualities of His  
illusory energy and accepts obligations and responsibilities,apparently  
acting like a conditioned soul. The qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas  
belong to material nature and not to the Supreme Soul oh King. For the Self  
there is no question of their combined prominence or decay. According to the  
time of their prevalence one with the mode of sattva [goodness] finds the  
devas and the rishis [the gods and sages], with the mode of rajas [passion]  
one encounters Asuras [the unenlightened ones] and with the mode of tamas  
[inertia] one is faced with Yakshas and R?kshasas [ghosts and demons]. The  
Supreme Lord is present in everyone?s heart, fostering the reactions of  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. The all-pervading Absolute exists within  
the heart of every living being, and a Wise man can perceive how He is present  
there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of  
fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, a thoughtful  
man can understand how much the Supreme Lord is present in someone's heart by  
seeing his actions. When the Supreme creates different types of bodies,  
offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character  
and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature -  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each  
body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation,  
using sattva-guṇa for maintenance, rajo-guṇa for creation and tamo-guṇa for  
annihilation.   
O great King, the Supreme Lord, the controller of the material and spiritual  
energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the Time  
to allow the material energy and the living being to act within the limits of  
time. Thus the Supreme is never under the time factor nor under the material  
energy.   
Although the Supreme Lord is beyond modes of nature, He seems to favors  
demigods,since they are influenced with sattva only. In this way, the asuras  
(demons), who are influenced by tamo-guṇa, are annihilated. But this all  
happens because of combination of gunas and the time factor. The Supreme Lord  
induces the time to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather,  
His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Urusrava.   
Sage Narada said: This body subject to insults, praise, honor and dishonor is the product of a  
lack of discrimination between the primal state of material nature [pradhana]  
and the supreme [position of the transcendental witness] oh King. Oh earthly  
ruler, because of this the living beings in this world suffer from the  
misconception of 'I' and 'mine', just as from the reproach and punishment  
associated with it. Living with this false conception one thinks that the  
destruction of bodies is the same as the destruction of living beings. The  
misconception [including reproaching Him and the fear for punishment] is there  
not because of Him [but because of being without Him] who is the beatitude of  
detachment and emancipation in person. How could there from His side, the side  
of the Soul of all, the Supreme One and Highest Control be any question of  
violence?   
Therefore, whether one is of a constant enmity, of devotion, of fear, of  
affection or of lusty desires, one should stay connected with the Lord and not  
care about anything else.   
A larva checked by a bee in a comb may be filled with anxiety and resentment,  
but because of that bee attain the same form. Just the same one may [like  
S'is'upala and Dantavakra] with Krishna, who as the Supreme Lord assumed a  
human form, [even] be freed from one's sins by constantly thinking of Him in  
enmity. Moved by lust, hatred, fear, affection and devotion many who united  
their mind in the Lord consequently gave up on sin and thus attained their  
destination. Oh King, the gop?s realized this by their lusty desires, Kamsa  
by his fear, S'is'upala and other kings by their hatred, Krishna's family  
members by their kinship, You [Pandavas] by your affection for Him and we  
through our bhakti. Not to be someone like Vena, who couldn't adopt any of  
these five forms of respect in regard of the Original Person, one must fix  
one's mind on Krishna in one of these ways.

Jewell/Friends,   
The Beauty and enchantment of the Lord's sport as baby Krishna are so  
attractive...We have these wonderful scenes from The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna: 1. **Incarnation of God**   
"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize  
Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who  
follow the path of devotion seek an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness  
of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when God is realized. In the  
Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama  
entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because  
the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus  
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled  
in the court burst into blossom."   
As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly  
fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No  
sooner did he say, "the lotus of the heart burst into blossom", than he went  
into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his countenance beaming and his lips  
parted in a smile.   
2. **ekangi prema**.   
GIRISH(to the Master): "Sir, what is ekangi prema?"   
MASTER: "It means one-sided love. For instance, the water does not seek the  
duck, but the duck loves water. There are other kinds of love: sadharani,  
samanjasa, and samartha. In the first, which is ordinary love, the lover seeks  
his own happiness; he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not.  
That was Chandravali's attitude toward Krishna. In the second, which is a  
compromise, both seek each other's happiness. This is a noble kind of love.  
But the third is the highest of all. Such a lover says to his beloved, 'Be  
happy yourself, whatever may happen to me.' Radha had this highest love. She  
was happy in Krishna's happiness. The gopis, too, had attained this exalted  
state.   
"Do you know who the gopis were? Ramachandra was wandering in the forest where  
sixty thousand rishis dwelt. They were very eager to see Him. He cast a tender  
glance at them. According to a certain Purana, theywere born later on as the  
gopis of Vrindavan."   
 A DEVOTEE: "Sir, who maybe called an antaranga?"   
MASTER: "Let me give an illustration. A natmandir has pillars inside and  
outside. An antaranga is like the inside pillars. Those who always live near  
the guru are the antarangas. (To Mahimacharan) "The jnani wants neither a form  
of God nor His Incarnation. While wandering in the forest, Ramachandra saw a  
number of rishis. They welcomed Him to their asrama with great love and said  
to Him: 'O Rama, today our life is blessed because we have seen You. But we  
know You as the son of Dasaratha. Bharadvaja and other sages call You a Divine  
Incarnation; but that is not our view. We meditate on the Indivisible  
Satchidananda.' Rama was pleased with them and smiled.   
Here are two wonderful presentations of songs on Lord Krishna: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRTkOpKumMs   
'Krishna Nee Begane Vaaro' (Krishna,do come swiftly)-Beautiful presentation of  
the song of Vyasa Raya on Udipi Baby Krishna set in the enchanting Raga Yamuna  
Kayani...The Singing is top notch,the Dance is wonderfully expressive and the  
paining depicts the Tri-banga(bent in three places) aspect -As Sri Ramakrishna  
beautifully said that this is the Love aspect that bends the rigid frame of  
the body and makes it so flexible...All the 3 Artists do a marvellous job and  
the Triveni (confluence of 3 Rivers)is wonderful.   
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9qMm3Zp2g8   
'Alai Paayuthey'(My mind is tossed like a wave)-This is a beautiful  
composition of the great devotee /composer ootthukkaadu Venkatasubhia  
Kavi...with English subtitles to follow the song....The Raga is Kaanada...all  
presented in fusion form but well done...No gimmickry.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Indeed,how pure and deep was the Love of Gopis toward Sri Krishna! And for how  
long is this Love inspiration for all of us!   
His life is full with such wonders and mysteries!   
And so true,it is not important how we approach Him,our own Heart and Soul.  
Either through personal aspect or through impersonal one,so long we are going  
toward the Truth.   
_Radha and Krishna   
Was it not he once in Brindavan? Woods divine to our yearning,   
Memorable always! flowers, delight on the tree-tops burning,   
Grasses his herds have grazed and crushed by his feet in the dancing,   
Yamuna flowing with song, through the greenness always advancing,   
Unforgotten remind; for his flute with its sweetness ensnaring   
Sounds in our ears in the night and our souls of their teguments baring   
Hales us out naked and absolute, out to his woodlands eternal,   
Out to his moonlit dances, his dalliance sweet and supernal.. . .   
Even an hour of the soul can unveil the Unborn, the Everlasting,   
Gaze on its mighty Companion; the load of mortality casting,   
Mind hushes stilled in eternity; waves of the Infinite wander   
Thrilling body and soul and its endless felicity squander;   
All world-sorrow is finished, the cry of the parting is over;   
Ecstasy laughs in our veins, in our heart is the heart of the Lover.   
Sri Aurobindo_**

**_King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord_**  
_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.   
Canto 7;Chapter 10-1:21

_**The Dynasty of Bharata: the Story of Rantideva**_  
_The son of Vyasadeva said: 'From Manyu, the son of Vitatha [the name Bharadvaja carried because he was  
given to Bharata], there were the sons Brihatkshatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara  
and Garga. Nara had a son called Sankriti.   
From Sankriti there were Guru and Rantideva, oh scion of Pandu. The glories of  
Rantideva are sung in this world and the next.   
Subsisting on that what fate provided he [Rantideva] took pleasure in  
distributing to others whatever grain of food he had. Being very poor he with  
all his family members lived most soberly and had to suffer a lot. One morning  
when forty-eight days had passed and he even was deprived of drinking water,  
he happened to receive water and different foodstuffs prepared with ghee and  
milk. While the family was shaky because of the thirst and hunger they  
suffered, that very moment a brahmin guest arrived who also liked to eat.   
Rantideva conceived of the Lord as residing in each and everyone and thus he  
with great respect and faith gave him his share of the food. After the brahmin  
had eaten he departed.   
 When he had divided the food for the family and was just about to eat,  
someone else arrived, a sudra(lowborn, laborer), whom he, thinking of the  
Lord, gave the food that was reserved for him, the king.   
 After the sudra had left yet another guest arrived who was surrounded by  
dogs. He said: 'Oh King, please provide me and my hungry dogs with food!'   
He, the one in power, honored them with his obeisances and with great respect  
gave all the food that was left over to the dogs and their master.   
 Of the food only the drinking water remained and that too had to satisfy some  
outcaste who, arriving there when the king was about to drink, asked him: 'I  
am just lowborn, but please give me some water!'   
Hearing the pitiable words of the exhausted man he, being deeply moved,  
compassionately spoke the following nectarean words: 'I do not desire to attain the greatness of the eight perfections of the  
Supreme Lord,siddhis, or the cessation of repeated births. I accept all  
hardship in my staying among all the embodied living beings so that they are  
freed from their unhappiness.   
 Handing over my water to save this poor soul struggling for his life, I am  
freed from all the hunger, thirst, fatigue and shaking of my body, as also  
from all the poverty, distress, lamentation, depression and bewilderment!'   
Thus expressing himself that sober, kindhearted ruler gave the drinking water  
to the outcaste, even though he himself was on the verge of death because of  
his thirst. Then the controllers of the three worlds, the gods who grant  
those who desire the fruits all results, manifested themselves before him in  
their true identities,because they in their previous appearances in the form  
of the brahmin, the man with the dogs, the sudra and the outcaste, all had  
been creations of the illusory energy of Vishnu. Being true to them as someone  
without material aspirations for any benefit or possessions, he offered them  
his obeisances while he concentrated his mind upon Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord  
and the Supreme Self as the ultimate goal. Having nothing in his mind but  
purely being of service,focussing his consciousness on the Supreme Controller  
oh King, the illusory energy of the [three] material qualities meant nothing  
more to him than a dream.   
All the ones associated with his lead, all the followers of Rantideva, became  
first-class yogis fully devoted to Lord Narayana.

**_Narada worships Nara-Naraya ṇa   
You are the One overseeing this cosmic creation, the One who is not attached  
to being the master, nor do You, although You appear as a human being, suffer  
from hunger, thirst and fatigue. Nor is the vision of You, who are the seer of  
everything, ever polluted by the material qualities. I offer You, the  
unattached and pure, profound witness, my respects.   
Having forsaken one's identification with the body, one must, at the end of  
one's time [of living], with a devotional attitude concentrate one's mind upon  
You who are transcendental to the material qualities. This forsaking  
constitutes the perfection of the practice of yoga as explained by the  
almighty Lord Brahma. A person driven by desire thinks in fear about the  
present and future of his children, wife and wealth, but anyone who knows  
about the hopelessness of this vehicle of time, considers such endeavors only  
a waste of time because the body is lost in the end.   
 Therefore our master, oh Lord in the beyond, I pray that we by dint of the  
yoga unto You very soon may forsake this fixed notion of 'I' and 'mine' about  
the banality of this vehicle of time, this illusory reality of Yours which is  
so difficult to overcome, so that we may realize our original nature.'

**_The Supreme Lord Is Equal unto Everyone_**  
_Even though He is free from the modes, unborn and unmanifest, the Supreme  
Lord transcendental to the material world enters the material qualities of His  
illusory energy and accepts obligations and responsibilities,apparently  
acting like a conditioned soul. The qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas  
belong to material nature and not to the Supreme Soul oh King. For the Self  
there is no question of their combined prominence or decay. According to the  
time of their prevalence one with the mode of sattva [goodness] finds the  
devas and the rishis [the gods and sages], with the mode of rajas [passion]  
one encounters Asuras [the unenlightened ones] and with the mode of tamas  
[inertia] one is faced with Yakshas and R?kshasas [ghosts and demons]. The  
Supreme Lord is present in everyone?s heart, fostering the reactions of  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. The all-pervading Absolute exists within  
the heart of every living being, and a Wise man can perceive how He is present  
there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of  
fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, a thoughtful  
man can understand how much the Supreme Lord is present in someone's heart by  
seeing his actions. When the Supreme creates different types of bodies,  
offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character  
and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature -  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each  
body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation,  
using sattva-guṇa for maintenance, rajo-guṇa for creation and tamo-guṇa for  
annihilation.   
O great King, the Supreme Lord, the controller of the material and spiritual  
energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the Time  
to allow the material energy and the living being to act within the limits of  
time. Thus the Supreme is never under the time factor nor under the material  
energy.   
Although the Supreme Lord is beyond modes of nature, He seems to favors  
demigods,since they are influenced with sattva only. In this way, the asuras  
(demons), who are influenced by tamo-guṇa, are annihilated. But this all  
happens because of combination of gunas and the time factor. The Supreme Lord  
induces the time to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather,  
His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Urusrava.   
Sage Narada said: This body subject to insults, praise, honor and dishonor is the product of a  
lack of discrimination between the primal state of material nature [pradhana]  
and the supreme [position of the transcendental witness] oh King. Oh earthly  
ruler, because of this the living beings in this world suffer from the  
misconception of 'I' and 'mine', just as from the reproach and punishment  
associated with it. Living with this false conception one thinks that the  
destruction of bodies is the same as the destruction of living beings. The  
misconception [including reproaching Him and the fear for punishment] is there  
not because of Him [but because of being without Him] who is the beatitude of  
detachment and emancipation in person. How could there from His side, the side  
of the Soul of all, the Supreme One and Highest Control be any question of  
violence?   
Therefore, whether one is of a constant enmity, of devotion, of fear, of  
affection or of lusty desires, one should stay connected with the Lord and not  
care about anything else.   
A larva checked by a bee in a comb may be filled with anxiety and resentment,  
but because of that bee attain the same form. Just the same one may [like  
S'is'upala and Dantavakra] with Krishna, who as the Supreme Lord assumed a  
human form, [even] be freed from one's sins by constantly thinking of Him in  
enmity. Moved by lust, hatred, fear, affection and devotion many who united  
their mind in the Lord consequently gave up on sin and thus attained their  
destination. Oh King, the gop?s realized this by their lusty desires, Kamsa  
by his fear, S'is'upala and other kings by their hatred, Krishna's family  
members by their kinship, You [Pandavas] by your affection for Him and we  
through our bhakti. Not to be someone like Vena, who couldn't adopt any of  
these five forms of respect in regard of the Original Person, one must fix  
one's mind on Krishna in one of these ways.

Jewell/Friends,   
The Beauty and enchantment of the Lord's sport as baby Krishna are so  
attractive...We have these wonderful scenes from The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna: 1. **Incarnation of God**   
"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize  
Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who  
follow the path of devotion seek an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness  
of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when God is realized. In the  
Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama  
entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because  
the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus  
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled  
in the court burst into blossom."   
As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly  
fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No  
sooner did he say, "the lotus of the heart burst into blossom", than he went  
into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his countenance beaming and his lips  
parted in a smile.   
2. **ekangi prema**.   
GIRISH(to the Master): "Sir, what is ekangi prema?"   
MASTER: "It means one-sided love. For instance, the water does not seek the  
duck, but the duck loves water. There are other kinds of love: sadharani,  
samanjasa, and samartha. In the first, which is ordinary love, the lover seeks  
his own happiness; he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not.  
That was Chandravali's attitude toward Krishna. In the second, which is a  
compromise, both seek each other's happiness. This is a noble kind of love.  
But the third is the highest of all. Such a lover says to his beloved, 'Be  
happy yourself, whatever may happen to me.' Radha had this highest love. She  
was happy in Krishna's happiness. The gopis, too, had attained this exalted  
state.   
"Do you know who the gopis were? Ramachandra was wandering in the forest where  
sixty thousand rishis dwelt. They were very eager to see Him. He cast a tender  
glance at them. According to a certain Purana, theywere born later on as the  
gopis of Vrindavan."   
 A DEVOTEE: "Sir, who maybe called an antaranga?"   
MASTER: "Let me give an illustration. A natmandir has pillars inside and  
outside. An antaranga is like the inside pillars. Those who always live near  
the guru are the antarangas. (To Mahimacharan) "The jnani wants neither a form  
of God nor His Incarnation. While wandering in the forest, Ramachandra saw a  
number of rishis. They welcomed Him to their asrama with great love and said  
to Him: 'O Rama, today our life is blessed because we have seen You. But we  
know You as the son of Dasaratha. Bharadvaja and other sages call You a Divine  
Incarnation; but that is not our view. We meditate on the Indivisible  
Satchidananda.' Rama was pleased with them and smiled.   
Here are two wonderful presentations of songs on Lord Krishna: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRTkOpKumMs   
'Krishna Nee Begane Vaaro' (Krishna,do come swiftly)-Beautiful presentation of  
the song of Vyasa Raya on Udipi Baby Krishna set in the enchanting Raga Yamuna  
Kayani...The Singing is top notch,the Dance is wonderfully expressive and the  
paining depicts the Tri-banga(bent in three places) aspect -As Sri Ramakrishna  
beautifully said that this is the Love aspect that bends the rigid frame of  
the body and makes it so flexible...All the 3 Artists do a marvellous job and  
the Triveni (confluence of 3 Rivers)is wonderful.   
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9qMm3Zp2g8   
'Alai Paayuthey'(My mind is tossed like a wave)-This is a beautiful  
composition of the great devotee /composer ootthukkaadu Venkatasubhia  
Kavi...with English subtitles to follow the song....The Raga is Kaanada...all  
presented in fusion form but well done...No gimmickry.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Indeed,how pure and deep was the Love of Gopis toward Sri Krishna! And for how  
long is this Love inspiration for all of us!   
His life is full with such wonders and mysteries!   
And so true,it is not important how we approach Him,our own Heart and Soul.  
Either through personal aspect or through impersonal one,so long we are going  
toward the Truth.   
_Radha and Krishna   
Was it not he once in Brindavan? Woods divine to our yearning,   
Memorable always! flowers, delight on the tree-tops burning,   
Grasses his herds have grazed and crushed by his feet in the dancing,   
Yamuna flowing with song, through the greenness always advancing,   
Unforgotten remind; for his flute with its sweetness ensnaring   
Sounds in our ears in the night and our souls of their teguments baring   
Hales us out naked and absolute, out to his woodlands eternal,   
Out to his moonlit dances, his dalliance sweet and supernal.. . .   
Even an hour of the soul can unveil the Unborn, the Everlasting,   
Gaze on its mighty Companion; the load of mortality casting,   
Mind hushes stilled in eternity; waves of the Infinite wander   
Thrilling body and soul and its endless felicity squander;   
All world-sorrow is finished, the cry of the parting is over;   
Ecstasy laughs in our veins, in our heart is the heart of the Lover.   
Sri Aurobindo_**

**_Jada Bharata Instructs King Rahugana_**  
 **The brahmin Jada Bharata said:  'My dear King,lacking in experience using the terms of the experienced ones,  
does not make you more experienced! Considering the Absolute Truth these  
matters of mundane and social behavior are not discussed by the intelligent  
ones.   
Talks of the relationship between the master and the servant, the king and the  
subject and so forth are simply talks about mundane activities. People  
interested in these activities which are expounded in the Vedas are intent on  
performing material sacrifices for their own benefit,or for the benefit of  
their household. For such people, spiritual advancement is definitely not  
manifest.   
A dream becomes automatically known to a person when he wakes up as false and  
immaterial, and similarly one eventually realizes that material happiness in  
this life or the next, on this planet or a higher planet, is insignificant.  
When one realizes this, the Vedas, although an excellent source, are  
insufficient to bring about direct knowledge of the truth.   
As long as someone's mind is under the control of the mode of passion,  
goodness or ignorance, actions - auspicious or otherwise - are by the  
[impelling] power of the senses of action and perception automatically the  
result. His mind is exactly like an independent, uncontrolled elephant. The  
result is that the one remains in the material world to enjoy and suffer  
pleasures and pains due to material activity.   
Because the mind is absorbed in desires for pious and impious activities, it  
is naturally subjected to the transformations of lust and anger. In this way,  
it becomes attracted to sense enjoyment. There are eleven senses and five  
material elements, and out of these sixteen items, the mind is the chief.  
Therefore the mind cut loose wanders around with many names manifesting  
itself in different physical appearances of a higher or lower quality.   
Brought forth by the illusory of matter which envelops the original living  
being, the mind creates for itself the vicious circle, the false order, of  
material actions and reactions [karma] impelled by happiness or distress,and  
in that way deceives him into the wheel of conditioning.   
The mind makes the one within this material world wander through different  
species of life, and thus he experiences mundane affairs in different forms as  
a human being, demigod, fat person, skinny person and so forth. Learned Ones  
say that bodily appearance, bondage and liberation are caused by the mind.   
When the mind becomes absorbed in the senses, it brings about his conditioned  
life and suffering. However, when the mind becomes unattached to material  
enjoyment, it becomes the cause of liberation. When the flame in a lamp burns  
the wick improperly, the lamp is blackened, but when the lamp is filled with  
ghee and is burning properly, there is bright illumination. Similarly, when  
the mind is absorbed in sense gratification, it causes suffering, and when  
detached from sense gratification it brings about the original brightness of  
the Self.   
There are five working senses and five knowledge-acquiring senses. There is  
also the false ego. In this way, there are eleven items for the mind's  
functions. O hero, the objects of the senses [such as sound and touch], the  
organic activities [such as evacuation] and the different types of bodies,  
society, friendship and personality are considered by learned scholars the  
fields of activity for the functions of the mind.   
Smell, form, touch, taste and hearing [the knowing senses]; evacuation, sexual  
intercourse, movement, speech and manual control [the senses of action] with  
the eleventh element of accepting the idea of 'mine', thus gives the 'I' [or  
ego-awareness] to this body of which some have said that it is the twelfth  
element.   
These eleven engagements of the mind are by the material elements, by nature  
itself, by culture, by the karma and by time modified into the many hundreds,  
thousands and millions. But all these transformations do not take place  
automatically by mutual combination. Rather, they are under the direction of  
the Knower of the field.   
The individual soul has many ideas and activities created in the mind by the  
external energy. They have been existing from time immemorial. Sometimes they  
are manifest in the wakening state and in the dream state, but during deep  
sleep or trance, they disappear. A person who is liberated in this life can  
see all these things vividly.   
 _The Witness and the Knower is the All-pervading cause of creation. He is  
full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and  
direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death,  
old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with  
Lord Brahma. He is called Naraya ṇa, and He is the shelter of living entities  
after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences,  
and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as  
Vasudeva, the Supreme. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of  
all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of  
all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. _   
My dear King Rahugaṇa, as long as the one accepts the material body and is not  
freed from the material enjoyment, and as long as he does not conquer his six  
enemies and come to the awakening of his spiritual knowledge, he has to wander  
among different places and different species of life in this material world.   
The mind is the cause of all tribulations in the material world. As long as  
this fact is unknown to the one, he has to accept the miserable condition of  
the material body and wander within this universe. Because the mind is  
affected by disease, lamentation, illusion, attachment, greed and enmity, it  
creates bondage and a false sense of intimacy within this material world.   
This uncontrolled mind is the greatest enemy of the living entity. If one  
neglects it or gives it a chance, it will grow more and more powerful and will  
become victorious. Although it is not factual, it is very strong. He who free  
from illusion applies the weapon of worshiping the lotus feet of the spiritual  
teacher and the Lord, conquers the falsehood of the personal interest that has  
covered the soul.   
Canto 5;Chapter 11**

**_King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord_**  
_Sri Shukadeva said: 'Oh best of the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Ananta Deva very pleased with the  
worship of Citraketu the king of the Vidyadharas, then replied. The Supreme  
Lord said:  'From directly seeing Me and with the prayer that Narada and Angira have  
disclosed to you, you now have attained perfection oh King.   
 I as the Supreme Soul of all, as the cause of the manifestation, have  
expanded in different forms and exist in both the eternal forms of the  
spiritual sound vibrations and the Supreme Brahman.   
 The living entity expanded into the world and the world expanded within the  
living entity. These two,the world and the living entity, are pervaded by Me  
as also made by Me. A person sleeping sees in his dream the entire world  
within himself, but upon awaking he finds himself lying down somewhere.  
Likewise one must consider the different states of consciousness and  
conditions of life of the living entities as manifestations of the illusory  
potency of the Self, knowing which one should always remember their Supreme  
Creator,the Source and Witness.   
Know Me as that all-pervading Soul, as the Supreme Spirit free from the modes  
of matter by whom the sleeping bewildered person at that time is able to  
recognize what belongs to the dream and what to his happiness.   
 I am the Knower of all the states of consciousness,and beyond all of them.   
The living entity, having forgotten about this spiritual nature of My  
position, thinking he has separated existence gets immersed in a materially  
conditioned life and wanders from one body to the next, from one death to  
another.   
 Achieving in this world a human birth offers one the chance to arrive at  
self-realization with the support of this spiritual knowledge and wisdom, but  
they who fail to pick up that knowledge will never find peace and happiness.   
 Thinking of the trouble of toiling in this world and then achieving the  
opposite of what was intended - and then remembering how one is freed from  
fear by ridding oneself of one's desire for material things, one should, thus  
knowing better, desist from that karmic desire.   
 Husband and wife being materially motivated perform activities for the sake  
of their happiness and to be free from misery, but these actions have no  
effect because they do not put an end to the transitory happiness and distress  
,that follow one another.   
 Those who consider themselves very smart but in the end get the opposite of  
what they wanted, find it extremely difficult to understand and hard to grasp  
what it means to be of progress with the soul and to exist apart from the  
three states of unconsciousness, sleep and waking.   
 Someone who personally experienced this Truth or has understood it from  
listening to others, should free himself from materialism, and by dint of his  
own power of judgment in spiritual knowledge and wisdom,fully satisfied,  
become My devotee.   
 The realization of the of the oneness of the individual soul and the  
transcendence of the Lord, constitutes - all things considered - the ultimate  
goal of life for capable and intelligent human beings who unite in yoga.   
 If you with faith, not concluding differently, accept these words of Mine oh  
King, you will soon find your perfection in the full awareness of spiritual  
knowledge and its wisdom.'   
Canto 6, Chapter 16;49-64

**_On Distinguishing between Good and Bad_**  
_Sometimes, a virtue turns out to be a vice and a vice - by providence,or  
Vedic instruction - turns out to be a virtue. Respecting the regulative  
principles one is thus faced with the fact that the distinction between what  
is good and bad is factually effaced by them.   
The same activities that would degrade an elevated person do not cause  
falldown for those who are already fallen. Indeed, one who is lying on the  
ground cannot possibly fall further. The material association that is dictated  
by one's own nature is considered good.   
Whatever one desists from one is freed from - this is for human beings the  
foundation of natural pious living that takes away the suffering, fear and  
delusion.   
When one presumes the objects stimulating the senses to be good, a person will  
develop attachment as a consequence, from that attachment lust originates and  
because of that lust,to enjoy at will,there is quarrel among people.   
Because of quarreling there is the anger that is difficult to handle and  
because of anger there is ignorance; and thus someone's broad consciousness is  
quickly narrowed and overtaken by darkness.   
Oh saintly Uddhava, a living being bereft that way of clear understanding  
becomes empty-headed so that, as a consequence having fallen away from his  
goals in life, he - just like dull matter - is as good as dead.   
Going after the senses in this way, one, vainly living the life of a tree,  
fails in knowing oneself and others, so that one's breathing is nothing more  
than pumping air.   
The awards promised in the [karma-kanda part of the] scriptures are for man  
not the highest good; they are merely enticements to create a taste for the  
ultimate good [upasana-kanda],it is simply like medicine.   
From the moment they are born, mortals develop a mind of attachment to their  
family, their vital functions and the objects of their desire, because of  
which they loose sight of the interest of their Soul.   
Why would the intelligent ones [the Vedic authority] encourage those, who on  
the path of danger blind to their real interest in submission to karmic  
actions land in darkness, to further engage in such attachments.   
Persons with perverted intelligence do not understand this actual purpose of  
Vedic knowledge and instead propagate as the highest Vedic truth the flowery  
statements of the Vedas that promise material rewards. Those in actual  
knowledge of the Vedas never speak in that way.   
Those who are lusty, miserly and greedy take the flowers of karmic sacrifices  
for the fruit of realization; bewildered by the fire they suffocate from the  
smoke and do not realize their true identity.   
Armed with their expressions My dear, they do not know Me who is seated within  
their heart and from whom this universe generated that is also Me. In their  
self-indulgence they are like people staring into fog.   
Those who are sworn to sense gratification cannot understand the confidential  
conclusion of Vedic knowledge as explained by Me. Taking pleasure in violence,  
they cruelly slaughter innocent animals in sacrifice for their own sense  
gratification and thus worship demigods, forefathers and leaders among ghostly  
creatures. Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the  
process of Vedic sacrifice.   
In their hearts they all - like business men investing their wealth - imagine  
to achieve in a world as pleasing as it sounds, but which is as unreal as a  
dream.   
Established in the mode of passion, goodness or ignorance they worship the  
gods and others headed by Indra who likewise delight in passion, goodness and  
ignorance, but Me they do not worship properly.   
They think:  'When we worship the demigods with sacrifices here, we will enjoy heaven, and  
when that has ended, turn back to earth in wealth in a fine family.' With  
their minds thus bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas they  
nevertheless, as proud and most greedy men, are not attracted to My topics and  
the Truth.   
The Vedas, divided into three divisions, ultimately reveal the true  
understanding of the soul,the true Self. The Vedic seers and mantras, however,  
deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential  
descriptions.   
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to comprehend and  
manifests on different levels within the praṇa, senses and mind. This Vedic  
sound is unlimited, very deep and unfathomable, just like the ocean.   
The groundless, changeless Absolute of endless potencies that is My nature, is  
represented within the living beings in the form of sound vibrations, the way  
a lotus stalk is represented by a single strand of fiber.   
Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its  
mouth, the Supreme manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air,  
comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus  
the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless  
Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds  
such as the sparśas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions,  
adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the  
consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by  
many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more  
syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His  
manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.   
The Vedic meters are Gayatri, Uṣṇik, Anuṣṭup, Bṛhati, Pankti, Triṣṭup, Jagati,  
Aticchanda, Atyaṣṭi, Atijagati and Ativiraṭ.   
In the entire world no one but Me actually understands the confidential  
purpose of Vedic knowledge. Thus people do not know what the Vedas are  
actually prescribing in the ritualistic injunctions of karma-kaṇḍa, or what  
object is actually being indicated in the formulas of worship found in the  
upasana-kaṇḍa, or that which is elaborately discussed through various  
hypotheses in the jnana-kaṇḍa section of the Vedas.   
I am the One enjoined, I am the object of worship.   
It is I who am presented as various philosophical hypotheses, and it is I  
alone who am then refuted by philosophical analysis. The transcendental sound  
vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge.  
The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My  
illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their  
own satisfaction.

**_About Prahlada, the Best Among the Exalted Devotees_**  
_Narada Muni said: 'Prahlada, even though he was but a small boy, considered every blessing that  
came with his bhakti yoga an impediment on the path and this he with a smile  
told the Lord of the Senses.   
Prahlada said: 'Please do not allure me. Because of my Asura birth I have a propensity for  
lusting over all those material blessings. It was out of fear for such  
material association that I, desiring liberation, for the sake of complete  
detachment have taken to Your shelter.   
 Oh Lord, You send Your devoted servant into this world of desire in order to  
put his character to a test, for this lust being the root cause of one's  
wandering around here, is found in the heart of everyone oh Master.   
 It does not work differently with You oh Guru of the universe so kind to  
everyone, for is someone who desires any material benefits, not more a  
merchant than a servitor?   
Someone who for himself expects material benefits from his spiritual master is  
not really a servant, nor is the master really of service who - for his own  
prestige - wants to bestow material benefits upon his servant.   
 There is, as far as I am concerned in my full devotion for You, no question  
whatsoever of any desire, nor do You as a real master foster any further  
motive for our sake like a king might have with his subject.   
And if You want to fulfill one of my desires, then I pray for Your  
benediction, oh Lord of All Blessings, that no desire for any form of material  
happiness will grow in my heart.   
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one?s birth,  
the functions of one?s senses, mind, life, body, religion, patience,  
intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are  
vanquished.   
 Only when one gives up all the desires that one in one's human association  
finds in one's mind, one is fit for an opulence equal to Yours, oh Lotus-eyed  
Lord.   
Oh Master of all Opulences, oh Original Person, oh Lord in the form of  
Nrisimha, oh Supreme One, oh Absolute Truth, oh Great Soul and Soul of all  
souls, let me offer You my respectful obeisances.'   
The Supreme Lord said:  'Those persons who like you are exclusively devoted to Me do not desire any  
benedictions from Me in this world or in the next. Nevertheless you may until  
the end of Manu's reign enjoy all the opulences of the Daitya rule out here.   
 Devote yourself to My pleasing stories, be absorbed in Me who resides in your  
heart as the One present within all living beings, worship in [yoga] uniting  
your consciousness the Lord who is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and give up  
your fruitive activities.   
By the means of pious actions forsaking your impiety, by forsaking the body  
attachment,after spreading your reputation throughout even the worlds of the  
gods, you will, freed from all attachment,rapidly, turn back to Me.   
Anyone who chants these prayers you offered to Me, any human being who  
remembers both Me and you, will in due course of time become free from the  
bondage of his karma.   
Prahlada said: 'I pray for the following benediction of You, oh Lord of Benedictions, oh  
Supreme Controller. My father, not knowing Your strength and supremacy, had  
because of a heart polluted by anger a false notion of You oh master and guru  
of all worlds.   
He considered You the murderer of his brother and condemned You. Thus he was  
towards me, Your devotee, of the greatest sin.   
 May my father be purified from that greatest and most difficult to overcome  
sin, even though he was immediately purified when You cast Your glance upon  
him, oh Father full of mercy.'   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'With the purification of your father, twenty-one of your forefathers in total  
have been purified oh sinless one. Because you, oh saintly boy, took your  
birth from him in this dynasty, you are indeed the purifier of the dynasty.   
Wherever and whenever there are My devotees who full of peace and equipoise,  
with the best qualities are equally graceful towards all, everyone will be  
purified, even when it concerns the worst of societies.   
 They will never, in whatever way, act violently towards all the higher or  
lower living beings oh King of the Daityas, because they, in their love for  
Me, have forsaken all material aspirations.   
 Persons in this world following in your footsteps become My pure devotees.  
You are of My devotees truly the best example.   
Canto 7;Chapter 10-1:21

_**The Dynasty of Bharata: the Story of Rantideva**_  
_The son of Vyasadeva said: 'From Manyu, the son of Vitatha [the name Bharadvaja carried because he was  
given to Bharata], there were the sons Brihatkshatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara  
and Garga. Nara had a son called Sankriti.   
From Sankriti there were Guru and Rantideva, oh scion of Pandu. The glories of  
Rantideva are sung in this world and the next.   
Subsisting on that what fate provided he [Rantideva] took pleasure in  
distributing to others whatever grain of food he had. Being very poor he with  
all his family members lived most soberly and had to suffer a lot. One morning  
when forty-eight days had passed and he even was deprived of drinking water,  
he happened to receive water and different foodstuffs prepared with ghee and  
milk. While the family was shaky because of the thirst and hunger they  
suffered, that very moment a brahmin guest arrived who also liked to eat.   
Rantideva conceived of the Lord as residing in each and everyone and thus he  
with great respect and faith gave him his share of the food. After the brahmin  
had eaten he departed.   
 When he had divided the food for the family and was just about to eat,  
someone else arrived, a sudra(lowborn, laborer), whom he, thinking of the  
Lord, gave the food that was reserved for him, the king.   
 After the sudra had left yet another guest arrived who was surrounded by  
dogs. He said: 'Oh King, please provide me and my hungry dogs with food!'   
He, the one in power, honored them with his obeisances and with great respect  
gave all the food that was left over to the dogs and their master.   
 Of the food only the drinking water remained and that too had to satisfy some  
outcaste who, arriving there when the king was about to drink, asked him: 'I  
am just lowborn, but please give me some water!'   
Hearing the pitiable words of the exhausted man he, being deeply moved,  
compassionately spoke the following nectarean words: 'I do not desire to attain the greatness of the eight perfections of the  
Supreme Lord,siddhis, or the cessation of repeated births. I accept all  
hardship in my staying among all the embodied living beings so that they are  
freed from their unhappiness.   
 Handing over my water to save this poor soul struggling for his life, I am  
freed from all the hunger, thirst, fatigue and shaking of my body, as also  
from all the poverty, distress, lamentation, depression and bewilderment!'   
Thus expressing himself that sober, kindhearted ruler gave the drinking water  
to the outcaste, even though he himself was on the verge of death because of  
his thirst. Then the controllers of the three worlds, the gods who grant  
those who desire the fruits all results, manifested themselves before him in  
their true identities,because they in their previous appearances in the form  
of the brahmin, the man with the dogs, the sudra and the outcaste, all had  
been creations of the illusory energy of Vishnu. Being true to them as someone  
without material aspirations for any benefit or possessions, he offered them  
his obeisances while he concentrated his mind upon Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord  
and the Supreme Self as the ultimate goal. Having nothing in his mind but  
purely being of service,focussing his consciousness on the Supreme Controller  
oh King, the illusory energy of the [three] material qualities meant nothing  
more to him than a dream.   
All the ones associated with his lead, all the followers of Rantideva, became  
first-class yogis fully devoted to Lord Narayana.   
canto 9,chapter 21;1-18_**

**_Narada worships Nara-Naraya ṇa   
You are the One overseeing this cosmic creation, the One who is not attached  
to being the master, nor do You, although You appear as a human being, suffer  
from hunger, thirst and fatigue. Nor is the vision of You, who are the seer of  
everything, ever polluted by the material qualities. I offer You, the  
unattached and pure, profound witness, my respects.   
Having forsaken one's identification with the body, one must, at the end of  
one's time [of living], with a devotional attitude concentrate one's mind upon  
You who are transcendental to the material qualities. This forsaking  
constitutes the perfection of the practice of yoga as explained by the  
almighty Lord Brahma. A person driven by desire thinks in fear about the  
present and future of his children, wife and wealth, but anyone who knows  
about the hopelessness of this vehicle of time, considers such endeavors only  
a waste of time because the body is lost in the end.   
 Therefore our master, oh Lord in the beyond, I pray that we by dint of the  
yoga unto You very soon may forsake this fixed notion of 'I' and 'mine' about  
the banality of this vehicle of time, this illusory reality of Yours which is  
so difficult to overcome, so that we may realize our original nature.'

**_The Supreme Lord Is Equal unto Everyone_**  
_Even though He is free from the modes, unborn and unmanifest, the Supreme  
Lord transcendental to the material world enters the material qualities of His  
illusory energy and accepts obligations and responsibilities,apparently  
acting like a conditioned soul. The qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas  
belong to material nature and not to the Supreme Soul oh King. For the Self  
there is no question of their combined prominence or decay. According to the  
time of their prevalence one with the mode of sattva [goodness] finds the  
devas and the rishis [the gods and sages], with the mode of rajas [passion]  
one encounters Asuras [the unenlightened ones] and with the mode of tamas  
[inertia] one is faced with Yakshas and R?kshasas [ghosts and demons]. The  
Supreme Lord is present in everyone?s heart, fostering the reactions of  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. The all-pervading Absolute exists within  
the heart of every living being, and a Wise man can perceive how He is present  
there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the supply of  
fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, a thoughtful  
man can understand how much the Supreme Lord is present in someone's heart by  
seeing his actions. When the Supreme creates different types of bodies,  
offering a particular body to each living entity according to his character  
and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of material nature -  
sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each  
body and influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation,  
using sattva-guṇa for maintenance, rajo-guṇa for creation and tamo-guṇa for  
annihilation.   
O great King, the Supreme Lord, the controller of the material and spiritual  
energies, who is certainly the creator of the entire cosmos, creates the Time  
to allow the material energy and the living being to act within the limits of  
time. Thus the Supreme is never under the time factor nor under the material  
energy.   
Although the Supreme Lord is beyond modes of nature, He seems to favors  
demigods,since they are influenced with sattva only. In this way, the asuras  
(demons), who are influenced by tamo-guṇa, are annihilated. But this all  
happens because of combination of gunas and the time factor. The Supreme Lord  
induces the time to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather,  
His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Urusrava.   
Sage Narada said: This body subject to insults, praise, honor and dishonor is the product of a  
lack of discrimination between the primal state of material nature [pradhana]  
and the supreme [position of the transcendental witness] oh King. Oh earthly  
ruler, because of this the living beings in this world suffer from the  
misconception of 'I' and 'mine', just as from the reproach and punishment  
associated with it. Living with this false conception one thinks that the  
destruction of bodies is the same as the destruction of living beings. The  
misconception [including reproaching Him and the fear for punishment] is there  
not because of Him [but because of being without Him] who is the beatitude of  
detachment and emancipation in person. How could there from His side, the side  
of the Soul of all, the Supreme One and Highest Control be any question of  
violence?   
Therefore, whether one is of a constant enmity, of devotion, of fear, of  
affection or of lusty desires, one should stay connected with the Lord and not  
care about anything else.   
A larva checked by a bee in a comb may be filled with anxiety and resentment,  
but because of that bee attain the same form. Just the same one may [like  
S'is'upala and Dantavakra] with Krishna, who as the Supreme Lord assumed a  
human form, [even] be freed from one's sins by constantly thinking of Him in  
enmity. Moved by lust, hatred, fear, affection and devotion many who united  
their mind in the Lord consequently gave up on sin and thus attained their  
destination. Oh King, the gop?s realized this by their lusty desires, Kamsa  
by his fear, S'is'upala and other kings by their hatred, Krishna's family  
members by their kinship, You [Pandavas] by your affection for Him and we  
through our bhakti. Not to be someone like Vena, who couldn't adopt any of  
these five forms of respect in regard of the Original Person, one must fix  
one's mind on Krishna in one of these ways.

Jewell/Friends,   
The Beauty and enchantment of the Lord's sport as baby Krishna are so  
attractive...We have these wonderful scenes from The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna: 1. **Incarnation of God**   
"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize  
Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who  
follow the path of devotion seek an Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness  
of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when God is realized. In the  
Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama  
entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because  
the brilliance of Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus  
blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of the heart of the people assembled  
in the court burst into blossom."   
As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly  
fell into an ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No  
sooner did he say, "the lotus of the heart burst into blossom", than he went  
into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his countenance beaming and his lips  
parted in a smile.   
2. **ekangi prema**.   
GIRISH(to the Master): "Sir, what is ekangi prema?"   
MASTER: "It means one-sided love. For instance, the water does not seek the  
duck, but the duck loves water. There are other kinds of love: sadharani,  
samanjasa, and samartha. In the first, which is ordinary love, the lover seeks  
his own happiness; he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not.  
That was Chandravali's attitude toward Krishna. In the second, which is a  
compromise, both seek each other's happiness. This is a noble kind of love.  
But the third is the highest of all. Such a lover says to his beloved, 'Be  
happy yourself, whatever may happen to me.' Radha had this highest love. She  
was happy in Krishna's happiness. The gopis, too, had attained this exalted  
state.   
"Do you know who the gopis were? Ramachandra was wandering in the forest where  
sixty thousand rishis dwelt. They were very eager to see Him. He cast a tender  
glance at them. According to a certain Purana, theywere born later on as the  
gopis of Vrindavan."   
 A DEVOTEE: "Sir, who maybe called an antaranga?"   
MASTER: "Let me give an illustration. A natmandir has pillars inside and  
outside. An antaranga is like the inside pillars. Those who always live near  
the guru are the antarangas. (To Mahimacharan) "The jnani wants neither a form  
of God nor His Incarnation. While wandering in the forest, Ramachandra saw a  
number of rishis. They welcomed Him to their asrama with great love and said  
to Him: 'O Rama, today our life is blessed because we have seen You. But we  
know You as the son of Dasaratha. Bharadvaja and other sages call You a Divine  
Incarnation; but that is not our view. We meditate on the Indivisible  
Satchidananda.' Rama was pleased with them and smiled.   
Here are two wonderful presentations of songs on Lord Krishna: 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRTkOpKumMs   
'Krishna Nee Begane Vaaro' (Krishna,do come swiftly)-Beautiful presentation of  
the song of Vyasa Raya on Udipi Baby Krishna set in the enchanting Raga Yamuna  
Kayani...The Singing is top notch,the Dance is wonderfully expressive and the  
paining depicts the Tri-banga(bent in three places) aspect -As Sri Ramakrishna  
beautifully said that this is the Love aspect that bends the rigid frame of  
the body and makes it so flexible...All the 3 Artists do a marvellous job and  
the Triveni (confluence of 3 Rivers)is wonderful.   
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9qMm3Zp2g8   
'Alai Paayuthey'(My mind is tossed like a wave)-This is a beautiful  
composition of the great devotee /composer ootthukkaadu Venkatasubhia  
Kavi...with English subtitles to follow the song....The Raga is Kaanada...all  
presented in fusion form but well done...No gimmickry.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Indeed,how pure and deep was the Love of Gopis toward Sri Krishna! And for how  
long is this Love inspiration for all of us!   
His life is full with such wonders and mysteries!   
And so true,it is not important how we approach Him,our own Heart and Soul.  
Either through personal aspect or through impersonal one,so long we are going  
toward the Truth.   
_Radha and Krishna   
Was it not he once in Brindavan? Woods divine to our yearning,   
Memorable always! flowers, delight on the tree-tops burning,   
Grasses his herds have grazed and crushed by his feet in the dancing,   
Yamuna flowing with song, through the greenness always advancing,   
Unforgotten remind; for his flute with its sweetness ensnaring   
Sounds in our ears in the night and our souls of their teguments baring   
Hales us out naked and absolute, out to his woodlands eternal,   
Out to his moonlit dances, his dalliance sweet and supernal.. . .   
Even an hour of the soul can unveil the Unborn, the Everlasting,   
Gaze on its mighty Companion; the load of mortality casting,   
Mind hushes stilled in eternity; waves of the Infinite wander   
Thrilling body and soul and its endless felicity squander;   
All world-sorrow is finished, the cry of the parting is over;   
Ecstasy laughs in our veins, in our heart is the heart of the Lover.   
Sri Aurobindo_**

**_Jada Bharata Instructs King Rahugana_**  
 **The brahmin Jada Bharata said:  'My dear King,lacking in experience using the terms of the experienced ones,  
does not make you more experienced! Considering the Absolute Truth these  
matters of mundane and social behavior are not discussed by the intelligent  
ones.   
Talks of the relationship between the master and the servant, the king and the  
subject and so forth are simply talks about mundane activities. People  
interested in these activities which are expounded in the Vedas are intent on  
performing material sacrifices for their own benefit,or for the benefit of  
their household. For such people, spiritual advancement is definitely not  
manifest.   
A dream becomes automatically known to a person when he wakes up as false and  
immaterial, and similarly one eventually realizes that material happiness in  
this life or the next, on this planet or a higher planet, is insignificant.  
When one realizes this, the Vedas, although an excellent source, are  
insufficient to bring about direct knowledge of the truth.   
As long as someone's mind is under the control of the mode of passion,  
goodness or ignorance, actions - auspicious or otherwise - are by the  
[impelling] power of the senses of action and perception automatically the  
result. His mind is exactly like an independent, uncontrolled elephant. The  
result is that the one remains in the material world to enjoy and suffer  
pleasures and pains due to material activity.   
Because the mind is absorbed in desires for pious and impious activities, it  
is naturally subjected to the transformations of lust and anger. In this way,  
it becomes attracted to sense enjoyment. There are eleven senses and five  
material elements, and out of these sixteen items, the mind is the chief.  
Therefore the mind cut loose wanders around with many names manifesting  
itself in different physical appearances of a higher or lower quality.   
Brought forth by the illusory of matter which envelops the original living  
being, the mind creates for itself the vicious circle, the false order, of  
material actions and reactions [karma] impelled by happiness or distress,and  
in that way deceives him into the wheel of conditioning.   
The mind makes the one within this material world wander through different  
species of life, and thus he experiences mundane affairs in different forms as  
a human being, demigod, fat person, skinny person and so forth. Learned Ones  
say that bodily appearance, bondage and liberation are caused by the mind.   
When the mind becomes absorbed in the senses, it brings about his conditioned  
life and suffering. However, when the mind becomes unattached to material  
enjoyment, it becomes the cause of liberation. When the flame in a lamp burns  
the wick improperly, the lamp is blackened, but when the lamp is filled with  
ghee and is burning properly, there is bright illumination. Similarly, when  
the mind is absorbed in sense gratification, it causes suffering, and when  
detached from sense gratification it brings about the original brightness of  
the Self.   
There are five working senses and five knowledge-acquiring senses. There is  
also the false ego. In this way, there are eleven items for the mind's  
functions. O hero, the objects of the senses [such as sound and touch], the  
organic activities [such as evacuation] and the different types of bodies,  
society, friendship and personality are considered by learned scholars the  
fields of activity for the functions of the mind.   
Smell, form, touch, taste and hearing [the knowing senses]; evacuation, sexual  
intercourse, movement, speech and manual control [the senses of action] with  
the eleventh element of accepting the idea of 'mine', thus gives the 'I' [or  
ego-awareness] to this body of which some have said that it is the twelfth  
element.   
These eleven engagements of the mind are by the material elements, by nature  
itself, by culture, by the karma and by time modified into the many hundreds,  
thousands and millions. But all these transformations do not take place  
automatically by mutual combination. Rather, they are under the direction of  
the Knower of the field.   
The individual soul has many ideas and activities created in the mind by the  
external energy. They have been existing from time immemorial. Sometimes they  
are manifest in the wakening state and in the dream state, but during deep  
sleep or trance, they disappear. A person who is liberated in this life can  
see all these things vividly.   
 _The Witness and the Knower is the All-pervading cause of creation. He is  
full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and  
direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death,  
old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with  
Lord Brahma. He is called Naraya ṇa, and He is the shelter of living entities  
after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences,  
and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as  
Vasudeva, the Supreme. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of  
all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of  
all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. _   
My dear King Rahugaṇa, as long as the one accepts the material body and is not  
freed from the material enjoyment, and as long as he does not conquer his six  
enemies and come to the awakening of his spiritual knowledge, he has to wander  
among different places and different species of life in this material world.   
The mind is the cause of all tribulations in the material world. As long as  
this fact is unknown to the one, he has to accept the miserable condition of  
the material body and wander within this universe. Because the mind is  
affected by disease, lamentation, illusion, attachment, greed and enmity, it  
creates bondage and a false sense of intimacy within this material world.   
This uncontrolled mind is the greatest enemy of the living entity. If one  
neglects it or gives it a chance, it will grow more and more powerful and will  
become victorious. Although it is not factual, it is very strong. He who free  
from illusion applies the weapon of worshiping the lotus feet of the spiritual  
teacher and the Lord, conquers the falsehood of the personal interest that has  
covered the soul.

**_His Pranks and Again the Universe Within His Mouth_**  
_Gargamuni said: This child, the son of Rohinī, will give all happiness to His relatives and  
friends by His qualities. Therefore He will be known as Rama. And because He  
will manifest extraordinary bodily strength, He will also be known as Bala.  
Moreover, because of not being separated from you He will be known as  
Sankarshana,the Unifier.   
Your son Krishna appears as an incarnation in every millennium. He has  
according to the yuga accepted forms with a white, a red or a yellow color.  
Now He is Krishna,of a dark complexion. This child previously was born  
somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and therefore the ones who know this  
will speak about this child of yours as the glorious Vasudeva.   
There are many names and forms according to the qualities and activities of  
His appearances. These are known to me, but the common people do not know  
them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always act to what is most  
beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily overcome all  
dangers._**   
_Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty regime, He has  
protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that they, with those  
bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones faithful to Vishnu  
have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as fortunate to associate  
with this child in love and affection, will not be overcome by enemies.   
Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this child. As for His  
qualities, oppulences, name and fame this son of yours is Narayana  
Himself!Suka said: 'After Garga thus fully had informed them about the Supreme  
Soul, the way He had manifested in the form of the two boys, and had left for  
his place, Nanda, being blessed with all good fortune, considered himself most  
happy.   
Shortly thereafter Rama and Kesava were crawling around in Gokula on their  
hands and knees enjoying their childhood. When Krishna and Balarama, with the  
strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places in Vraja, Their crawling  
resembled the crawling of serpents, and the sound of Their ankle bells was  
very charming. Very much pleased by the sound of other people's ankle bells,  
They used to follow these people as if going to Their mothers, but when They  
saw that these were other people, They became afraid and returned to Their  
real mothers, Yasoda and Rohini._**   
_From within their houses watching the children play outside in Vraja,  
they laughed and forgot their household being amused to see how the two boys  
caught the ends of the calves ' tails and were dragged around by them._**   
_When mother Ya śodā and Rohinī were unable to protect the babies from  
calamities threatened by horned cows, by fire, by animals with claws and teeth  
such as monkeys, dogs and cats, and by thorns, swords and other weapons on the  
ground, they were always in anxiety, and their household engagements were  
disturbed. At that time, they were fully equipoised in the transcendental  
ecstasy known as the distress of material affection, for this was aroused  
within their minds. O King Parikshit, within a very short time both Rāma and  
Krishna began to walk very easily in Gokula on Their legs, by Their own  
strength, without the need to crawl.   
The Supreme Lord together with Balarama playing with the other kids in Vraja  
then awakened a heavenly bliss in the ladies of Vraja.   
The gopis who with their eyes on Krishna were eager just to hear time and  
again about His childish pranks, assembled in the presence of His mother and  
said: "Our dear friend Yasoda, your son sometimes comes to our houses before the  
milking of the cows and releases the calves, and when the master of the house  
becomes angry, your son merely smiles. Sometimes He devises some process by  
which He steals palatable curd, butter and milk, which He then eats and  
drinks. When the monkeys assemble, He divides it with them, and when the  
monkeys have their bellies so full that they won't take more, He breaks the  
pots. Sometimes, if He gets no opportunity to steal butter or milk from a  
house, He will be angry at the householders, and for His revenge He will  
agitate the small children by pinching them. Then, when the children begin  
crying, Krishna will go away.   
"When the milk and curd are kept high on a swing hanging from the ceiling and  
Krishna and Balarama cannot reach it, They arrange to reach it by piling up  
various planks and turning upside down the mortar for grinding spices. Being  
quite aware of the contents of a pot, They pick holes in it. While the elderly  
gopis go about their household affairs, Krishna and Balarama sometimes go into  
a dark room, brightening the place with the valuable jewels and ornaments on  
Their bodies and taking advantage of this light by stealing._**   
_" When Krishna is caught in His naughty activities, the master of the  
house will say to Him, 'Oh, You are a thief,' and artificially express anger  
at Krishna. Krishna will then reply, 'I am not a thief. You are a thief.' But  
now, our dear friend Yasoda, this expert thief is sitting before you like a  
very good boy." Sometimes all the gopis would look at Krishna sitting there,  
His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and when they saw  
Krishna's beautiful face, instead of chastising Him they would simply look  
upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yasoda would mildly smile  
at all this fun, and she would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental  
child.   
One day while Krishna was playing with His small playmates, including Balarāma  
and other sons of the gopas, all His friends came together and lodged a  
complaint to mother Yasoda. "Mother," they submitted, "Krishna has eaten  
earth."   
Upon hearing this from Krishna's playmates, mother Yasoda, who was always full  
of anxiety over Krishna's welfare, picked Krishna up with her hands to look  
into His mouth and chastise Him. Her eyes fearful, she spoke to her son as  
follows.   
Dear Krishna, why are You so restless that You have eaten dirt in a solitary  
place? This complaint has been lodged against You by all Your playmates,  
including Your elder brother, Balarama. How is this?   
'Not true at all mommy, I did not eat any dirt. If you think it is true, then  
look right here into My mouth!'   
'Is that so? Then open wide!' she told Him and He, the Supreme Personality,  
the Lord whose oppulences are unlimited, in His pastime of acting like a human  
child opened His mouth.   
Within His mouth she saw the entire universe with all beings moving and not  
moving, the sky in all directions, the mountains, the continents, the oceans,  
the surface of the earth, the blowing wind, the fire, the moon and the stars.  
She saw the planetary systems, the waters, the light, the firmament with all  
of outer space and all divinities bound to change, the senses, the mind and  
the three modes. Seeing that diversity along with the time of living of each  
soul, the natural instincts, the karma, all that is desired, the different  
subtle bodies as also Vraja and herself within in the wide open mouth of her  
son's body, she was struck with disbelief:_**   
_' Is this all a dream, a divine phantasmagoria or maybe a delusion of my  
own intelligence, or would that what I so see differently be some yogic  
phenomenon natural to my child? Let me therefore surrender at the feet of Him  
beyond my range of vision,who is beyond the conception of human speculation,  
the mind, activities, words and arguments, who is the original cause of this  
cosmic manifestation, by whom the entire cosmos is maintained, and by whom we  
can conceive of its existence. and under whose control I live and may return  
home.   
 It is by the influence of the Supreme Lord's maya that I am wrongly thinking  
that Nanda Maharaja is my husband, that Krishna is my son, and that because I  
am the queen of Nanda Maharaja, all the wealth of cows and calves are my  
possessions and all the cowherd men and their wives are my subjects. Actually,  
I also am eternally subordinate to the Supreme Lord. He is my ultimate  
shelter.   
Mother Yasoda, by the grace of the Lord, could understand the real truth. But  
then again, the supreme master, by the influence of the internal potency,  
yogamaya, inspired her to become absorbed in intense maternal affection for  
her son.   
Immediately forgetting yogamaya's illusion that Krishna had shown the  
universal form within His mouth, mother Yasoda took her son on her lap as  
before, feeling increased affection in her heart for her transcendental child.   
The Lord is glorified in all His greatness with the help of the three Vedas,  
with philosophical exercises,the Upanishads, with yogic analysis [sankhya-  
yoga] and with other devoted literatures, but she simply thought about Him as  
being her son.'_**   
_The honorable king said: 'Oh brahmin, what were the pious activities  
performed by Nanda and Yasoda from whose breast the Lord drank His milk? How  
did they achieve the highest perfection of such a blessing?   
Not even His own father and mother could enjoy the magnanimous activities of  
the young Krishna who eradicates the impurities of the world, actions that  
even today are glorified by the transcendentalists!'   
S'r? S'uka said: 'Drona, the best of the demigods,the Vasus, determined to  
carry out the orders of Lord Brahma, together with his wife Dhara said the  
following to him: 'May we being born on this earth be devoted to the Supreme Godhead, the Master  
of the Entire Universe, the Lord who is the ultimate goal under whose care  
one can easily avoid a miserable life.'   
'So be it' was the answer given by Brahma. Drona thereupon took his birth in  
Vraja and became the Great One,the Bhagavan, the highly distinguished and  
celebrated Nanda and she, Dhara, appeared as Yasoda._**   
_Thereafter, O Maharaja Parikshit, best of the Bharatas, when the Supreme  
Lord became the son of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, they maintained continuous,  
unswerving devotional love in parental affection. And in their association,  
all the other inhabitants of Vrindavana, the gopas and gopis, developed the  
love for Krishna. Thus the Supreme One, Krishna, along with Balarama, lived in  
Vrajabhumi, Vrindavana, just to substantiate the benediction of Brahma. By  
exhibiting different pastimes in His childhood, He increased the pleasure of  
Nanda and the other inhabitants of Vrindavana.

_**Knowledge is True Perfection**_  
_The Supreme Lord said: The learned seeker whose intuition has led him to the realisation of the Self,  
does not indulge in theoretical dialectics about this world of diversity,  
knowing it to be a mere appearance in Me, a knowledge which he has also  
eventually to renounce exclusively to Me, his highest bliss and redemption,  
his goal and the way to it. He whose mind has been thoroughly purified by  
knowledge and realisation alone can comprehend My Supreme State. Penance,  
pilgrimage, japa, charitable acts, are mere means of self-purification, and  
not of perfection, as knowledge is. Therefore work your self-knowledge up to  
the stage of realisation, O Uddhava, and reject everything else but your  
devotion to Me. The threefold manifestation of prakriti, namely, body, mind  
and senses in you, is an illusion, having neither beginning nor end, but  
appears in the middle (like the snake which appears in the dark, but which has  
at no time been, nor will at any time be, other than a rope).   
Jnana consists in perceiving the nine principles, the eleven organs, the five  
elements, and the three gunas in all creatures, and the One Supreme Soul  
(Purusha or Paramatman) permeating them all. Vijnana (discursive knowledge)  
perceives neither plurality nor the pervading One, but investigates into the  
creation, preservation and dissolution of all things which are made of the  
gunas (to repudiate them all). That alone is real which abides in the  
beginning and end and which appears to evolve in the middle. Plurality has,  
therefore, no existence whatever (since the Reality alone exists but appears  
as the evolving diversity, having a beginning and an end): it is repudiated by  
the four principal pramanas (evidences or means of firm knowledge), namely,  
the authority of the Vedas, direct perception, the authority of the wise  
(tradition), and inference. Ritualistic acts, likewise, being transient, are  
unreal. The wise look upon the pleasures of the invisible world (which are the  
result of action) as misery-laden and as perishable as those of this visible  
world.   
Formerly I talked to you about bhakti-yoga oh sinless one. Let Me now also  
expound on the supreme method of this devotion unto Me. Faith in the nectar of  
the narrations about Me, always singing My glories, to relate to Me with hymns  
and prayers; to think of Me as being present in all living beings, to dedicate  
all one's activities to Me, to conteplate and talk about My qualities, to  
offer one's mind to Me,to be of sacrifice with charity and offerings, to do  
japa and to worship Me,to reject desires,and, finally, through total surrender  
of the whole being to Me.   
Dharma is that which leads one to devotion unto Me and knowledge(jnana),which  
is awareness of the presence of the Self. Detachment [vairagya] results in  
disinterestedness in the sense objects and opulence [aisvarya] culminates in  
the mystical perfections of anima and so on.   
 'Nonviolence, truthfulness, not coveting or stealing the property of others,  
detachment, modesty, non-possessiveness, trustfulness, celibacy, silence,  
steadiness, forgiveness and fearlessness are the twelve types of restrictions  
[of yama]. Inner and outer cleanliness, doing japa, penance, sacrifice, faith,  
hospitality, worship of Me, visiting holy places, care for the welfare of  
others in this world, contentment and serving the spiritual master are the  
twelve regular duties [of niyama]. Mental equilibrium means the absorption of  
one's intelligence in Me and self-control entails the disciplining of the  
senses. The greatest charity is to give up all aggression toward others, and  
renunciation of lust is understood to be real austerity. Real heroism is to  
conquer one's natural tendency to enjoy material life, and reality is seeing  
the Supreme Self everywhere. Truthfulness means to speak the truth in a  
pleasing way, as declared by great sages. Cleanliness is detachment from the  
fruits of action, whereas renunciation is the purity,or sannyasa. The true  
desirable wealth for human beings is Dharma, and I, the Supreme, am  
sacrifice.Opulence is My divine nature, gain is My bhakti, education is the  
nullifying of the division of the self, and modesty [sense of shame] is the  
disgust against unjust action. Beauty means to be of good qualities.   
The desire to get over happiness and misery is happiness; the desire to enjoy  
worldly happiness is misery. He is learned who knows the distinction between  
bondage and freedom, and ignorant who looks upon his body as himself. The  
means by which I am attained is known as the right path, and the wrong path is  
that by which mundane activity is undertaken. Activity of the Sattva guna is  
heaven, that of tamas is hell.   
"I have thus answered all your questions, O Uddhava, but what avails you to go  
through all the characteristics of good and evil, which are always safe to  
avoid?"   
Canto 11,Chapter 19_**

**_Beyond Renunciation and Knowledge   
The Power of Satsanga _**  
**_The Supreme Lord said: One does not win Me by mysticism or analysis, common piety or the study of the  
scriptures, by penances, renunciation, pious works or charity, by respecting  
vows, ceremonies, Vedic hymns, pilgrimage, by general discipline or the basic  
rules. One rather wins Me by the sat-sanga with the Saints and My devotees.  
That association drives away all attachment to objects of the senses. By  
associating with the Wise many living beings in every age achieved Me like the  
sons of Diti, the malicious ones, the animals, the birds, the singers and  
dancers of heaven, the ones of excellence and of perfection, the venerable  
souls and the treasure keepers, the scientific ones among the humans and the  
merchants, laborers and women, the uncivilized ones and the ones of passion  
and slowness. So also did Vritrasura, the son of Kayadhu [Maharaja Prahlada]  
and others like them, Vrishaparva, Bali, Bana, Maya as also Vibhishana  
[brother of Ravana], Sugriva [leader of the Vanaras] and great Devotee  
Hanuman, Jambavan, Gajendra, Jathayu, Tuladhara, Dharma-vyadha, Kubja and the  
gopis in Vraja, the wives of the brahmins and others. Not having studied the  
sacred scriptures, without vows and not having undergone austerities, attained  
Me by association with My devotees. Only by unalloyed love indeed the gopis  
easily attained Me. In Vraja,even the cows, the immobile creatures, the snakes  
and trees in hundreds of thousands became accomplished and attained to Me, the  
Supreme Brahman. When Akrura took Me and Balarama to Mathura they, the  
inhabitants of Vrindavana, whose hearts were attached to Me with the deepest  
love, suffered greatly because of the separation as they did not saw happiness  
anywhere. All the nights they in Vrindavana spent with Me, their most dearly  
Beloved, oh Uddhava, seemed to take but a moment to them, but again bereft of  
Me they became as long as a kalpa. Just as sages fully absorbed lose the  
awareness of names and forms - like they are rivers entering the water of the  
ocean - also they whose consciousness was intimately bound to Me had no  
awareness anymore of their bodies, their present or their future. The  
hundreds and thousands of women who desired Me as their friend and lover, had  
no knowledge of My actual position and attained Me by associating with Me, the  
Absolute Supreme Truth.   
Therefore, O Uddhava, turn your back on all actions, whether prescribed or  
not, as well as on all learning, past or future, and seek shelter with all  
your heart in Me,the Truth,and the Self of all, and you will be free from all  
fear. It is by this Self that the body is permeated, and in it that the  
universe is woven like the warp and woof of a cloth.

**_Liberation from Maya_**  
_The honorable king Nimi said:  'My lords, please tell us about the illusory potency of Maya of the Supreme  
Lord Vishnu We would like to understand what bewilders even the great  
mystics. We enjoy the nectar of your talks about Lord Hari, but we are not yet  
satisfied by that antidote against the pain a mortal experiences being  
tormented by the misery of samsara.'   
Antariksha answers: ?In order to enjoy the senses as well as the bliss of Liberation, the Prime  
Purusha created out of Himself the great elements from which He made all  
things, high and low. Then He became one mind and ten organs and entered the  
great elements as the many jivas with bodies, through which He enjoys the  
sense-objects and to which He grew attached by identifying Himself with them.  
This identification with the gross body rather than with His own eternal Self  
is Maya, which causes Him much suffering as jiva, and from which He, however,  
escapes by seeking the realisation of His true nature, and after many many  
births attains it. This realisation is very blissful and is called Liberation.   
Nimi said: 'Oh great sage, please tell how materialistic people with ease may  
overcome this material energy of the Lord that is so unsurpassable for those  
lacking in self-control.'   
The sage Prabuddha replies: "It is common knowledge that human couples who expect to derive happiness from  
their union reap only misery. What happiness can be gained from wealth which  
is gathered with so much hardship, or from children and relatives, who are but  
temporary acquisitions, when even heavenly felicities do not last to eternity?  
Lasting happiness, O King, can be found nowhere but in the realisation of the  
absolute Truth through the guidance of a guru, who has mastered the meaning of  
the Vedas and has himself experienced it, and through the practice of the  
well-known virtues namely, friendship, humility, benevolence, purity,  
performance of duty, endurance, study of the Scriptures, sincerity, non-  
violence, evenness of mind, control of speech, etc. Hearing, chanting and  
meditating on the Avatars, pastimes and qualities of the Lord whose activities  
are all wonderful, one must do everything for His sake. Whatever worship,  
charity, penance, japa or piety one performs, everything held dear, one's  
wife, sons, home and very life air, one should dedicate to the Supreme. In  
rendering service to both [the moving and nonmoving living beings] one must be  
of friendship with the common man as also with the devotees, the great souls  
who accepted Krishna as the Lord of their heart. Company of the Saints,mutual  
discussions with fellow devotees, remembering Him and reminding one another.  
The bhakti unto the Lord puts an end to the chain of sins. Sometimes one cries  
by the thought of Acyuta, sometimes one laughs or takes great pleasure or  
speaks, acts wondrously, dances and sings and sometimes one, following the  
example of the Unborn One, is freed from distress and becomes silent while  
attaining the Supreme Self. All this eventually never fails to carry one  
safely across the bottomless ocean of Maya."   
Book 11;Chapter 3/1-33_**

**_The Goats of Lust_**  
 _Suka said: 'Yayati who being moved by lust thus was ruled by women, and  
acted against his well-being. In resignation he narrated the following story  
to his wife Devayani.   
'Oh daughter of S'ukra,in this world there was someone exactly like me. Please  
listen as I narrate the history of his life. By hearing about the life of such  
a householder, those who have retired from householder life always lament.   
There was a goat in the forest searching for some food for his cherished self.  
He happened to meet a she-goat that as a consequence of her own actions had  
fallen into a well.Motivated by lust the he-goat thought of a way to free her.  
With the tip of his horns he then engaged in digging into the earth around the  
well, and thus he freed her. The he-goat thought she is very pretty and  
looking very nice, and she from her side fancied him as a sexual partner too,  
just as all the other she-goats did that were looking on. Stout, with a nice  
beard being a first class seed donor and master lover, that he-goat, the  
number one goat of them all, forgot himself completely like someone haunted.  
As the only male enjoying the great number of them, he was always overwhelmed  
by his lusts. When the she-goat he had freed from the well saw him, her  
beloved, engaged in delighting with another one, she could not tolerate that.  
She considered him a lusty, cruel-hearted pretender, a friend to the occasion  
who is only interested in sensual matters. Therefore, because her husband was  
lusty, she left him and returned to her former maintainer. Controlled by her  
the he-goat in pain followed her miserably and tried to pacify her on the road  
with utterances that goats are used to practice, but he could not satisfy her.  
The she-goat went to the residence of a brahmaṇa who was the maintainer of  
another she-goat, and that brahmaṇa angrily cut off the he-goat's testicles.  
But at the he-goat's pleading, the brahmaṇa later rejoined them by the power  
of mystic yoga.   
Oh dearest wife, the he-goat with his health restored, for many, many years  
enjoyed the she-goat he had saved from the well, but up to the present day his  
lusty desires are not satisfied.   
I am a poor miser just like that. In the company of you with your beautiful  
eyebrows I am tied in love and I could as yet, bewildered as I am by your  
outer appearance, not be of self-realization. The mind of someone who is a  
victim of lust cannot find satisfaction in all the food grains, barley, gold,  
animals and women of this world. The lust of the lusty will never ever be  
pacified by enjoyment, it will just like a fire that again and again is fed  
with butter only increase. When someone is nonenvious and does not desire ill  
fortune for anyone, nor goes at the detriment of any living being, for such a  
person who is of an equal vision towards all, all directions will appear  
equally happy. The desire that is so difficult to forsake for ignorant people,  
that root cause of all tribulation that is not so quickly overcome, should be  
given up by the one who seeks happiness. The power of lust is so great, that  
one should not [even] be seated indiscriminately with one's mother, with one's  
sister or one's daughter, because the senses in combination are so very strong  
that they even will agitate the most learned one. Even though I for a thousand  
years without interruption enjoyed the gratification of my senses, that desire  
still develops constantly. I will therefore give up on these desires and fix  
my mind upon the Absolute Truth. Free from duality and without falsely  
identifying myself, I will wander free of this animal nature. One should not  
blindly follow one's lesser desires and listen to them,but should be made  
aware how they are of a temporary nature,and just seem to be irresistible.  
This is just an illusion. One should not give it any further thought or strive  
for it. He who is mindful of the fact that they lead to the prolongation of a  
worldly existence and to forgetfulness about the real self, is a self-realized  
soul.'   
'After the son of Nahusha had said this to his wife, he being freed from  
desires accepted his old age and gave Puru his youth back(he took the youth of  
his son so he can enjoy lust even longer). He made of his other, faithful  
sons Druhyu king over the southeastern direction, Yadu over the southern side,  
Turvasu over the western part and Anu over the north. The entire planet's  
riches and wealth he placed under the control of Puru as the most admirable  
one of all the citizens. He crowned him emperor over his elder brothers and  
thus having arranged his affairs he left for the forest. All those years he  
with his senses and mind without interruption had enjoyed life. Seeing  
futility of it,that all he gave up in a single moment, just like a bird that  
leaves its nest when its wings have grown. Doing this he was instantly freed  
from all his attachments and was, now that he derived from his original self,  
free from the influence of the three modes. He surrendered to Vasudeva,and  
pure in his transcendence, achieved the Absolute Truth, that was his  
destination as a confident associate of the Supreme Lord.   
When Devayani heard the story that like a joke was presented in the exchange  
of love between husband and wife, she understood that it was meant for her  
self-realization. She understood that living with husband,friends and  
relatives who are all subjected to the control of the rigid laws of nature,   
is alike associating with travelers at some place, that according to one's  
karma was created by the Lord's illusory potency. The daughter of Sucracarya  
gave up all her attachments in this dreamlike world, fixed her mind fully on  
Lord Krishna, and achieved liberation from both,gross and subtle bodies.   
I bow to Supreme Lord Vasudeva, Creator of All who reside in all beings and  
abodes. My respects for You who in perfect peace is the Greatest of All!'

**_Paras 'urama, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation_**  
 _Jamadagni married Renuka, the daughter of Renu. She with the seer of Bhrigu  
gave birth to many sons of whom Vasuman was the eldest. The renown Paras  
'urama [also known as Rama] was the youngest son. He who twenty-one times  
acted as the annihilator of the Haihaya dynasty and thus freed the earth from  
all her kshatriyas, is called an incarnation of Vasudeva. (The earth's burden  
of the arrogant governing class that, covered by passion and ignorance, lacked  
in respect for the brahminical rule, was removed by him. He killed them  
despite the fact that they had committed no great offense. '   
The honorable king said: 'What was, of those degraded nobles out of control,  
the offense committed unto the Supreme Lord because of which time and again  
the dynasty was annihilated?   
The son of Vyasa said: 'The king of the Haihayas, Kartaviryarjuna, the best of the kshatriyas, had  
developed a thousand arms in upholding the worship of Dattatreya who is an  
incarnation of Narayana. He who was the fear of his enemies could not be  
defeated, was sharp-witted, most attractive, influential, powerful, renown and  
physically very strong. Because of his yogic control he had acquired qualities  
like the perfections of the anima-siddhi and such and he tirelessly traveled  
all over the world like a whirlwind. When he one day surrounded by beautiful  
women enjoyed the water of the Reva, he, overly proud of his of victory, with  
his arms stopped the flow of the river. The conceited hero called Ten-head  
[Ravana] could not bear that, since the water that moved upstream because of  
Kartaviryarjuna's actions had inundated his camp. Ravana who insulted him in  
the presence of the women was without much difficulty arrested by him, held in  
custody in their capital Mahishmati and then released again as if it concerned  
a monkey.   
Once during a hunt alone in the forest wandering aimlessly,Kartaviryarjuna  
entered the as'rama of Jamadagni muni. The sage on the basis of his austerity  
had the cow of plenty,kamadhenu,and could offer to that god of man together  
with his soldiers, ministers and the rest of his retinue, everything that was  
needed. When the king saw what this wealth that exceeded his personal opulence  
all meant, he became very envious. He and his Haihayas then decided to steal  
that cow of sacrifice. In his conceit he encouraged his men to take away the  
sage's cow of plenty and bring her together with her calf to Mahishmati, while  
the calf was crying because of the violence. After the king was gone  
Paras'urama, upon returning to the as'rama of his father, heard about that  
nefarious act and got as angry as a snake that is trampled upon. Unable to  
tolerate what had happened he took up a ghastly chopper, a quiver, a bow and a  
shield and went after them like a lion attacking an elephant. As the king  
entered the capital he saw the best of the Bhrigus coming after him in fury  
carrying a bow, arrows and a chopper as his weapons. His skin was covered by a  
black deerskin, he had matted locks and radiated like sunshine. He sent  
seventeen akshauhinis with elephants, chariots, horses and infantry, with  
swords, arrows, lances, slings and weapons of fire, but Paras'urama, the Lord  
and Master, most fiercely killed them all by himself.He as the greatest expert  
in handling the chopper, killed as fast as the wind and as speedy as the mind  
the enemy troops from whom here and there the arms, legs and shoulders fell to  
the ground together with the drivers of the elephants and the horses that had  
been slain. Seeing his soldiers fallen by the axe and the arrows of Rama lying  
scattered with their shields, flags, bows and dead bodies in the mud and the  
blood on the field, Kartairryarjuna rushed over there in fury. Kartaviryarjuna  
then fixed with five hundred of his arms simultaneously as many arrows on as  
many bows in order to kill Rama, but he as the best fighter of all the ones  
armed, cut them all to pieces with his arrows using one bow only. The king  
attacked again with trees and rocks that he had uprooted with his hands, but,  
as he was rushing forwards on the battlefield, all his arms were by  
Paras'urama's razor-sharp axe with great force cut off like they were the  
hoods of snakes. After his arms had been cut off, the mountain peak that was  
his head was severed. As soon as their father was killed his ten thousand sons  
fled away in fear. Fetching the sacrificial cow and calf that had suffered  
badly, the Killer of All False Heroism returned to his father's hermitage and  
handed them over to him. Rama described to his father and brothers everything  
that he had done. After hearing that Jamadagni spoke as follows: Rama, oh Rama, mighty hero, you have committed a sin by unnecessarily killing  
that god of man who embodies all the demigods. We are brahmins my dear one,  
people who because of their forgiveness have achieved a position of respect.  
It is by this quality that Lord Brahma who is the spiritual master of the  
universe has achieved his position as the supreme authority.By forgiveness the  
splendor, happiness and success of the religious practice shines as brilliant  
as the sun. The Supreme Lord Hari, our Controller, becomes quickly pleased  
with those who are forgiving. To kill a king who is famous as an emperor is  
worse than killing a brahmin. Therefore wash away that sin my best one, by  
worship and devotion, with the consciousness full of the Infallible One.'

**_How Lord Paras 'urama Came to Destroy the Ruling Class Twenty-one Times_**  
 _S 'uka said: 'Oh son of the Kuru dynasty, Paras'urama thus by his father  
being advised said: 'So be it!', whereupon he for a year traveled to all the  
holy places. Then he returned to the as'rama.   
When Renuka,his mother, one day went to the bank of the Ganges, she saw the  
king of the Gandharvas. He was garlanded with lotus flowers and sported with  
the girls of heaven, the Apsaras. She observed his affairs as she went to the  
river to fetch some water. Drawn to Citraratha, she forgot the time of the  
fire sacrifice. Upon returning to ashrama,realizing that she had neglected the  
time, she was afraid to be cursed by the sage and stood with folded hands  
before him, having put the waterpot in front of him. The sage understood she  
had deviated from the rule and became angry with his wife. He said: 'Remove  
her my sons, she's full of sin', but the sons did not carry out his order.  
Rama, who through his meditation and austerity was fully aware of the prowess  
of the sage, in response to the encouragement of his father immediately killed  
immediately his mother and all his brothers. When Jamadagni thus being pleased  
asked him what benediction he would like, he said: 'Give those whom we have lost their life back without them remembering their  
punishment!'   
Soon they all rose happily and alive like they had awakened from deep sleep,  
since Rama had executed the punishing of his kin in the full awareness of the  
power of his father's austerity.   
The sons of Kartaviryarjuna, oh King, meanwhile could not have peace with the  
remembrance of their father being defeated by the superior power of  
Paras'urama. So one day,when Rama with his brothers was away from the as'rama  
in the forest, they, seeking revenge, took the opportunity to approach their  
residence. Finding the muni sitting at the fireplace fully absorbed in  
contemplating the Supreme One Praised in the Verses, they, determined to do  
evil, killed him. Being most cruel towards the poor and unprotected mother of  
Rama,who begged for the life of her husband, they, those 'kshatriya' brothers,  
violently cut his head off and took it away. Renuka, the chaste wife down in  
tears grieving, stroke her body with her hands and cried loudly: 'Oh Rama, oh  
Rama, my dear son!' Hearing the sound of that cry 'Oh Rama', Rama and his  
brothers,despite being far away, hastened back to the as'rama where they saw  
that their father had been murdered. Bewildered by the schock, they all  
lamented and angrily, depressed, sad and indignified cried: 'Oh father, oh  
saint, you who are such an example of dharma have now departed for heaven and  
left us behind!'   
Thus bewailing their father, Paras'urama entrusted the body to his brothers  
and personally took up the ax, determined to put an end to the kshatriyas. He  
went to Mahishmati, [the capital] that was doomed because a brahmin had been  
killed. There,he in the middle of the town, made a great pile of the heads he  
severed from their bodies. Their blood formed a terrible river that brought  
fear to all the rulers who defied the brahminical culture. Because the  
kshatriyas, the royal class, had killed his father, he acted to their  
detriment and twenty-one times over wiped them off the earth. He as a master  
of war thus at Samanta-pancaka created nine lakes filled with blood instead of  
water.   
Joining his father's head with his body he kept him on kus'a grass and  
worshiped with sacrifices the Godhead, the True Self and inspiration of all  
the demigods. The hota priest he gave the eastern direction, the brahma priest  
he gave the southern direction, the adhvaryu he gave the western side and the  
udgata received the north. The others and Kas'yapa Muni he assigned the  
different corners and the middle Aryavarta portion [The land in India between  
the Himalaya Mountains and the Vindhya Hills] he gave to the upadrashtha  
priest who supervises the mantras. The assisting sadasya priests received  
whatever remained. After sacrifice,he took a bath, he, on the bank of the  
major stream of Sarasvati, so cleansed of all impurities radiated like a  
cloudless sun. Because of Paras'urama's worship, Jamadagni regained his body  
with all the symptoms of consciousness and later became the seventh seer in  
the constellation of the seven sages.   
Paras'urama, the son of Jamadagni who is also the Supreme Lord with the lotus  
petal eyes, will be a propounder of Vedic knowledge in the next period of  
Manu, oh King.   
He who in peace with the intelligence has given up the clout, still today can  
be found in the hills of Mahendra and is worshiped and revered for his  
character and activities by all the Siddhas, the singers of heaven and the  
venerable ones.   
This is how the Soul of the Universe, the Supreme Lord Hari,who appeared as an  
incarnation in the Bhrigu dynasty and killed the rulers of man many times,  
relieved the earth of its great burden.

**_Lord Shiva,the Great Helper,Glorifies Markandeya Rishi_**  
 _Suta said: "The great Lord Rudra, who, accompanied by Uma and surrounded by his  
entourage, traveled through the sky on his bull, saw how Rishi Markandeya was  
absorbed in deep meditation. Uma observing the seer then said to Giris'a: 'Look at this man of learning, who with his body, senses and mind motionless  
is as calm as the waters of the ocean when the wind has ceased and the fish  
remain still. Please, oh you who are the bestower of it, award him the  
perfection of his penances.'   
The mighty Lord said: 'I am sure that the brahmin seer does not desire any  
benedictions in any field, not even liberation, for he has achieved the  
devotion unto the Supreme Lord, the Inexhaustible Primal One. Nevertheless  
Bhavani, let us talk to this pure devotee. It is indeed man's highest  
achievement to gain the association of saintly souls.' "   
Suta said: "Thus having spoken He, the master of all knowledge, the controller  
of all embodied souls and the shelter of the righteous ones, approached him.  
Having arrested the functions of his mind, the sage had neither knowledge of  
himself or the outer world, nor was he aware of the arrival of the two powers  
of control over the universe in person. Mighty Shiva, the great Lord,  
understanding that, entered Markandeya's hidden sky of the heart by means of  
his mystic potency, just like the wind passing through an opening. Shiva  
appeared inside of him with hair locks blond like lightening, having three  
eyes and ten arms and rising as high as the sun. Together with a tiger skin He  
used for his garment, He exhibited his bow and trident, arrows and sword,  
shield, prayer beads, damaru (a small drum), ax and skull. When he saw him in  
his heart manifesting suddenly, the sage desisted from his trance and wondered  
in surprise: 'Who is this and where did he come from?'   
Opening his eyes and seeing that Lord Rudra had arrived with his associates  
and Goddess Uma, the sage bowed his head in deep respect and humility to the  
Great One,the Guru of the three worlds. He honored him, together with his  
company and Uma, with words of welcome, sitting places, water for their feet,  
water to drink, perfumed oil, garlands, incense and lamps. He said:  'Oh mighty one, what can I do for you, oh Lord who pacifies the universe by  
the full satisfaction of your ecstatic experience? I offer you my deepest  
respect,You,wo as the Lord of goodness gives pleasure,You,who in contact with  
the mode of passion,appear most fearful,and You,who also come as the mode of  
ignorance.' "   
Suta said: "Praised by these words he, the mighty Lord, the foremost of all  
and shelter of the truthful soul, perfectly satisfied and happy-minded  
addressed him with a smile.The great Lord said: 'Please, choose a boon to your liking, for of all givers of benedictions the  
three of us, Lord Brahma,Lord Hari,and Myself,are the Lords by whose  
infallible audience a mortal being finds immortality. We glorify, worship and  
assist those who are saintly, peaceful and free from material attachment, who  
care for all living beings and free from enmity and equal towards all, are of  
a single-minded devotion unto us. These devotees do not even acknowledge the  
slightest difference between me, the Infallible One and the One Unborn, nor  
between themselves or other people and that is why we praise you. Mere bodies  
of water as holy places and deities on themselves purify the soul only after  
a long time, but you,and all Great Souls and Devotees, do so by simply being  
seen. We offer the brahmins our respects! For they are dedicated to Us in the  
form of the three Vedas, and they by penances, study and concentration are  
absorbed in the True Self. Even the greatest sinners and outcasts find  
purification by seeing you and hearing about you, and what would yet mean when  
one directly speaks to you?!' "   
Suta said: "Thus listening the nectar of words full of the secret of dharma, of the One  
decorated with the moon, the sage desired to hear more. He, who because of  
Vishnu's maya was terribly exhausted from having wandered for such a long  
time, had been freed from a great load of trouble by the grace of Lord Shiva's  
nectarine words and spoke to him. Sri Markandeya said: 'Ah, how inconceivable for embodied souls this pastime is of the great  
controllers: for such Lords bow down to and offer praise to the very living  
beings they rule. In general the teachers act by precept and example for the  
embodied souls to accept the dharma and encourage and praise those who do so.  
Such an act of humility of the Fortunate One does not compromise the power of  
His activities formed by His Maya, any more than the tricks of a magician  
compromise his ability. He who as the Supersoul from His mind, by Himself in  
the form of Time, created this universe and subsequently entered it, manifests  
Himself like being the doer through the operating modes of nature, just like a  
person witnessing a dream.   
Let me bow to Him, the Supreme One, who, endowed with the three gunas, is the  
true Self on top of them. He is the pure, unequaled spiritual master who is  
the original form of the Absolute Truth. From seeing You a person can achieve  
whatever he desires, irrespective what. But what other benediction should I  
desire from you, oh All-pervading Lord whose presence itself is the highest?  
Nevertheless I would like to ask from you who, the Complete One, that entails  
the fulfillment of all wishes, one benediction: the unfailing devotion and  
love for You,the Supreme and Your Devotees.' "   
Suta said: "Thus being worshiped and glorified by the well-spoken words of the  
sage, the great Lord S'arva, thereto encouraged by his consort, said:  'Oh great sage full of devotion for Adhokshaja, may all your wishes be  
fulfilled. And may you also till the end of the kalpa enjoy fame, piety and  
freedom from old age and death. May you have knowledge of the threefold nature  
of time, oh brahmin,as also wisdom in combination with a free heart. May  
there for you,being blessed with brahminical potency, be the status of teacher  
of the Purana.' "   
Suta said: "After having granted the sage these blessings he, the Lord with  
the three eyes, went away, on his way telling the Goddess what Markandeya in  
the past had accomplished and experienced. He,that best soul of Bhrigu, who  
had achieved the greatest of the great in yoga, even today demonstrably  
travels about, on his path of serving the Lord with single-minded devotion.

**_The Remedy for Kali-yuga_**  
 _The honorable king Parikchit said: 'By what means my Lord, do the people  
living in Kali-yuga eradicate the faults accumulating because of that age? O  
great sage, please explain this to me.'   
S'uka said: "Kali-yuga is known as the age of ignorance, where there is  
deceit, false testimony, sloth and lethargy, violence, depression,  
lamentation, delusion, fear and poverty. As a consequence the mortals will be  
shortsighted, unfortunate, eating too much, lusty and poverty-stricken while  
the women will act of their own accord and be unchaste. In the populated areas  
uncivilized people will take high positions and act like thieves, the Vedic  
scriptures will be slighted by false doctrines [heretics], the political  
leaders will devour the people and the twice-born souls will be dedicated to  
their bellies and genitals. The brahmacaris will fail to execute their vows  
and become unclean, impure in their engagements, the householders will be  
beggars, the withdrawn souls those who have gone to the forest for austerities  
will be city-dwellers and the sannyasis will be excessively greedy for wealth.  
Smaller in size, voracious and having many children, the women will have lost  
their timidity and constantly speak harshly and with great audacity be as  
deceitful as thieves. The merchants will indulge in cheating so that their  
business dealings will be wicked while the people unnecessarily will consider  
any contemptible occupation,or anything that brings money a good job.Servants  
will abandon a master who lost his wealth - even if he is the best one around,  
masters will abandon a handicapped servant - even when he belonged to the  
family for generations, and cows will be abandoned and killed as soon as they  
stopped giving milk. They will reject their fathers, brothers, other  
relatives and friends and will instead associate with the sisters and brothers  
of their wives. Thus their conception of friendship will be based exclusively  
on sexual ties. Laborers being dressed up as mendicants of austerity, will  
accept religious charity to earn their living and mount a high seat to speak  
about religious matters without any knowledge of dharmic principles. With  
their minds constantly full of stress, emaciated by famine and taxes in times  
of scarcity with droughts on the surface of the earth, oh King, the people of  
Kali-yuga will be troubled by countless worries and live in fear. Lacking in  
clothing, food, drink, rest, love, bathing and personal ornaments they will  
appear like ghostly creatures. In the age of Kali one will even over a single  
coin develop enmity, reject friendly relations, kill oneself and even kill  
one's relatives. Only interested in the petty service of the stomach and the  
genitals one, even being born in a respectable family, will not protect the  
elderly parents, the wife and the children. Oh King, with their minds  
diverted by atheism the mortals in Kali-yuga in general will not worship the  
Infallible One, the Bhagavan who is the Supreme Spiritual Master of the three  
worlds at whose feet the various masters bow down. In Kali-yuga the people do  
not worship Him, even though He is the One by whom a person, who dying in  
distress collapsing with a faltering voice helplessly chants His name, is  
freed from the chains of karma and achieves the freedom from birth and death.  
The objects,food, places and the individual nature of man are as a result of  
Kali-yuga all polluted. But when one installs Bhagavan, the Supreme Self in  
one's heart, He takes all this contamination away.   
Of those human beings who but even heard, glorified, meditated, worshiped or  
venerated the Supreme Lord, the inauspiciousness is cleansed away that from a  
thousand births accumulated in their hearts. All the impurities of the mind of  
yoga practitioners are removed when Lord Vishnu has entered their heart.  
Education, penance, breath control, friendship, bathing in holy waters, vows,  
charity and praying with prayer beads do not realize as full the purification  
of the mind as the presence of Him, the Unlimited Lord, in the heart.  
Therefore oh King, do your utmost best to establish Lord Kes'ava in your  
heart; the moment you die you will with your attention focussed on Him attain  
the highest destination. The Supreme Lord meditated upon by those who are  
dying is the Supreme Controller, the Soul and Shelter of All, who leads them  
to their true identity my dearest. In the ocean of faults of Kali-yuga, oh  
King, there is luckily one great good quality: just by singing about and  
meditating on Krishna's name, one can be liberated from material bondage and  
achieve beatitude. The same result one achieves in Satya-yuga by meditating on  
Vishnu, one achieves in Treta-yuga by worshiping with sacrifices and one  
achieves in Dvapara-yuga by serving the lotus feet, is in Kali-yuga achieved  
by chanting the names of Lord Hari."

**_The Great Sage Markandeya Witnessing the Play of the Lord 's Bewildering  
Maya_**  
 _Sage Suta said: "The Supreme Lord Narayana, Nara's Friend,properly respected  
by the great Sage Markandeya,, satisfied spoke to the eminent follower of  
Bhrigu. The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh dear man perfectly absorbed in the soul, you are the best of all brahmin  
seers for by your austerities, by fixed meditation upon the Self,by undivided  
devotion,and dedicated study of the Vedas,you never deviated from the service  
unto Me. We are perfectly satisfied about your steady adherence to the great  
vow. We wish you all the best. Please choose a benediction to your liking. I  
am the Giver of All Benedictions you desire.'   
The great Rishi said: 'You, oh Lord of Lords, oh Infallible One, are  
victorious as the Remover of the Distress of the Surrendered Soul. I am  
perfectly satisfied just having seen Your good Self. Brahma and others with a  
mind matured in yoga all acquired the sight of Your omnipotent lotus feet and  
now You in person are visible before my eyes.Nonetheless oh Lotus-eyed Crest  
Jewel of Fame, I would like to witness your Maya,your great illusory potency.'   
Sage Suta said: 'Oh sage S'aunaka, the Supreme Lord, being glorified and  
worshiped by the rishi to His satisfaction with these words,said with a smile  
to him 'So be it'. Thereupon the Lord departed for Badarikas'rama.   
The rishi remained behind in his hermitage thinking only of that purpose and  
venerated and meditated under all circumstances on the Lord to the best of his  
ability, in the fire, the sun, the moon, the water, the earth, the wind, the  
lightning as also in his heart.   
Thus immersed in the stream of pure love [prema] he sometimes forgot to prove  
his respects. Oh best of Bhrigu, when the sage one day was performing his  
evening worship on the bank of the Pushpabhadra, a great wind arose oh  
brahmin. It created a terrible sound followed by the appearance of threatening  
clouds as solid as wagon wheels that resounded loudly with lightning and havy  
rain everywhere. Then from all sides the four oceans appeared that engulfed  
the surface of the earth with wind-tossed waves,in which there were terrible  
sea monsters and fearful whirlpools accompanied by ominous sounds.Perplexed  
the sage became afraid seeing how the earth flooded and all the inhabitants of  
the universe [as born from moist, seed, embryos and eggs] including himself,  
inside and outside were plagued by the fierce winds, the bolts of lightning  
and the great waves of water rising higher than the sky. Before his eyes the  
water of the great ocean was swirled around by hurricanes in frightening waves  
as it swelled with the rain from the clouds and covered the entire earth with  
its continents, islands and mountains.   
With the three worlds, the earth, outer space, the celestial bodies and  
heavenly places flooded in all directions the great sage, as the only soul  
remaining, wandered about like a dumb and blind person, with his matted locks  
scattered.   
Suffering hunger and thirst, attacked by monstrous crocodiles and whale-eaters  
and plagued by the winds he, tormented by the waves, moved about in the  
infinite darkness he had fallen into, overcome by fatigue and not knowing  
which direction of the sky or the earth he went. Sometimes drowning in a  
great whirlpool and then beaten by the waves he was threatened by monsters  
that tried to eat him the one moment and the other moment were attacking each  
other. In distress he sometimes felt sick and suffered pains with occasional  
depressions, bewilderment, misery, unhappiness and happiness, while fearing  
for his life at other times.   
Countless and countless, hundreds and thousands of years passed with him in  
bewilderment wandering around in that Maya, that deluding material energy of  
Vishnu.   
 One day, as he was roaming about there, the twice-born soul spotted upon a  
raised mound of earth a beautiful young banyan tree with fruits and blossoms.  
Upon a branch of it toward the northeast he saw an infant boy lying within the  
fold of a leaf swallowing the darkness with His effulgence. Amazed,the king  
among the scholars, stared at His complexion,that was as blue as a great  
emerald, His beautiful lotus face, His conch shell-striped throat, His broad  
chest, fine nose and beautiful eyebrows. His splendid hairs trembled to His  
breath, His beautiful shell-shaped ears resembled pomegranate flowers, His  
coral lips by their effulgence slightly reddened the nectarean charming smile  
on his face and the corners of His eyes were reddish like the whorl of a  
lotus. His breathing moved the lines of His abdomen contorted by His deep leaf  
like navel and he saw how the infant with the graceful fingers of His two  
hands grabbed one of His lotus feet and placed it in His mouth. When he saw  
the baby his weariness was dispelled instantly and out of pleasure the lotus  
of his heart and his lotus eyes spread wide open. With his hair standing on  
end he asked himself who that wonderful appearance could be and went straight  
for the child to find an answer.   
That very moment the man of Bhrigu with a breath of the infant was drawn into  
His body like a mosquito whereupon he utterly surprised stood perplexed to see  
from that position the entire universe the way it was before. He saw the  
entire expanse of all the stars, the mountains and oceans, the directions of  
the great islands and continents, the enlightened and unenlightened souls, the  
forests, countries, rivers, cities and mines, the peasant villages, the cow  
pastures and the various engagements of the varnas'rama society. Of this  
universe being manifested as real he saw the basic elements of nature and all  
their gross manifestations as also the Time itself in the form of the  
different yugas and kalpas and whatever other object of use in material life.  
In front of the universe seeing the Himalayas, the Pushpabhadra river and his  
hermitage,where he had met the rishis Nara and Narayana, he was by the breath  
of the infant thrown outside again and fell back into the ocean of  
dissolution. And there, on the raised stretch of land in the water where the  
banyan grew, was the child again lying in the fold of its leaf, glancing at  
him with a nectarean smile of love from the corner of His eyes. Placing the  
vision of the infant within his heart he greatly excited ran to embrace the  
Lord of the Beyond.   
 That very instant He, the Supreme Lord, the master of yoga in person who is  
hidden in the heart of all living beings, suddenly became invisible to the  
rishi,just as the achievements of an incompetent person can suddenly vanish.  
Oh brahmin, following Him immediately also the banyan disappeared and the  
waters of the annihilation of the world,and he found himself in front of his  
as'rama as before."   
Book 12,Chapter 9_

**_The Song of Pururava_**  
 _The Supreme Lord said: 'Having acquired this human body in which I can be realized, one achieves,  
following and living My dharma, Me, the Supreme Soul of Spiritual  
Happiness,The Self situated in the heart. Someone who fixed in jnana has  
become free from the cause of material life that is based upon the products of  
the modes, does not get deceived by these qualities, despite of being  
surrounded by them; although present before his eyes they are insubstantial  
and nothing but illusion to him. One should never at any time seek the  
company of the people grossly entangled in material life,who are only devoted  
to the gratification of their genitals and bellies, because they who follow  
such people will fall into the darkest pit, like a blind man following another  
blind man. The descendant of Ila, the well-known great emperor, sang the  
following mighty song when he, bewildered by separatation from Urvas'i, in  
resignation managed to restrain his grief. The moment she abandoned him and  
left, he naked, crying like a madman, ran after her calling out: 'Oh my wife,  
oh you terrible woman, please stop!' His mind was in such measure possessed by  
Urvas'i,for he many years gratified his lusts, and never completely satisfied,  
did not notice the nights coming and going.'   
Purrava said: 'Just see how bewildered I got! With my consciousness possesed  
by lust I, in the embrace of this goddess, did not notice my life time  
passing. I had no idea whether the sun was rising or setting and was, thus  
spending my days, alas robbed by lust of countless years. Oh what a pity this  
total bewilderment of mine is,because of which the body of this mighty  
emperor, this crown jewel of kings, became a toy for women driven only by  
animal insticts! When she abandoned me, the mighty controller, together with  
all of my kingdom as if I were a blade of grass, I ran crying naked like a  
madman after her. Where is now my the influence, strength and sovereignty? I  
ran after this woman leaving me, just like an ass with the hoof being kicked  
for punishment! What is the use of knowledge, austerities, renunciation, the  
scriptures or of solitude and silence for the one whose mind is stolen by  
women? To hell with me,the fool I am, not knowing what his best interest  
would be; I who thought to be a scholar in achieving the position of a lord  
and controller but who, just like a bullock or ass, was conquered by a bad  
woman! For so many years serving Urvas'i's lips I, with the lust born from my  
mind, never got enough of the nectar, just like a fire one can never satisfy  
with oblations. Who else but the Innerly Satisfied Lord of the Sages, the  
Supreme Lord Beyond the Senses, can free someone else who lost his mind with a  
promiscuous woman? Out of control with myself being dull-minded, I saw no end  
to my confusion, even though the goddess Urvas'i herself eloquently gave me  
advice. What would she have done wrong to a 'seer' like me who if i had  
notion of my real nature,but i took a rope for a snake? I am the one out of  
control with his senses is it not? What does this filthy body, unclean, full  
of bad odors, have to offer; what are those 'pleasing qualities' and so on  
anyway? They constitute an influence originating from ignorance! One can  
never tell whether this body belongs to one's parents, wife or employer, to  
fire, the dogs and jackals or to the soul or one's friends. One gets attached  
to this unholy matter and praises it, in shape of a woman, for having such a  
cute nose, beautiful smile and face, but one heads with it for the lowest  
destination. In what sense would one differ from worms when one enjoys that  
what is composed of skin, flesh, blood, muscle, fat, marrow and bone, urine,  
stool and pus? A man understanding what's best for him, should never run after  
such women or associate with men thus engaged, for the sole reason that the  
mind united with the senses reaches for sense objects and thus gets agitated.  
Because a thing not heard or seen,not being in ones nearest presence, gives no  
rise to mental agitation, the mind of someone not engaging his senses becomes  
fixed and pacified. When not even wise men can rely on the six enemies [lust,  
anger, greed, bewilderment, intoxication and envy], then what about persons  
like me? One therefore should not get sensorily attached to women or to men  
attached to lust.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'He, the worshipable lord of gods and men, who thus sang his song of  
complaint, then gave up the realm of Urvas'i (being on the same level).  
Realizing Me, the Supersoul in his heart, he with the jnana found peace within  
himself and ended his illusion. An intelligent person having abandoned bad  
association therefore should be fixed on Saints,Wise Ones, for only by their  
words he can cut off the deep attachment of his mind. Saintly Ones with their  
minds fixed on Me do not depend on lusts, and are, with an equal minded  
vision, completely peaceful and free from possessiveness, false ego, the  
dualities and greed.   
Oh most fortunate one, these greatly fortunate Souls are constantly discussing  
My stories that have the power to completely eradicate the sins of anyone who  
chooses for them. They who, faithfully dedicated to Me, hear, chant and  
respectfully take My stories to heart, will attain My bhakti. What else would  
there remain to be accomplished for a Sadhu,once his heart is dedicated to  
Me,once the love grows in his heart,for Me, the One of Countless Qualities who  
is the Absolute Truth,which is only true and lasting happiness?   
Just as cold, fear and darkness will dissipate for the one who resorts to the  
supreme grace of fire, similarly dullness, apprehension and ignorance will  
dissolve for someone who serves the Saints. For those who submerge and again  
rise in the fearful ocean of material life, the Saintly Ones, peaceful in  
understanding the Absolute, constitute a supreme shelter as good as a life  
boat for people drowning in the water.   
They constitute the refuge of those afraid to fall down, as good as food is  
there to grant the living beings their life,and I exist as the shelter for the  
distressed.   
The Sages grant you the divine eyes,while the sun only shows the external  
world after having risen; they are the worshipable ones, one's true relatives,  
they are, like Me as well one's own Self actually.   
 Pururava, who for that reason no longer desired to be in the same realm as  
Urvas'i anymore, then liberated from all attachment, innerly satisfied  
wandered this earth.'

_To our good fortune the two of You have killed the sinful Kamsa as also his  
brothers and followers. Thus delivering Your dynasty from endless troubles You  
have made it prosperous.   
You two are the Origin and the Source. You are the causes of the universe,that  
are one with the universe and there is not a thing,here or beyond, which  
exists apart from You.   
This universe You created from Your energies, You have subsequently entered.  
Thus You can be perceived in the many forms, oh Absolute Truth, that we know  
about from listening to the scriptures and by direct experience.   
Just as the earth element and the other elements differently manifest  
themselves in various species of living mobile and immobile beings, You, the  
Single One Self-reliant Self, the Supreme, manifest in a multitude within  
those different life forms.   
 You create, maintain and then again destroy the universe with the qualities  
of Your potencies: the passion, the goodness and the ignorance [the gunas],  
but You are not bound to those actions or their modes.   
For what could be a cause of bondage for You, who are the Soul of All  
Knowledge?   
All these apparent material coverings,as our bodies,and similar,do not exists  
for the Supreme Soul,so there could not be any actual birth or death,and with  
it no duality,nor bondage or liberation. All this happen by Your sweet will  
only,because of our erroneous discrimination.   
 For the benefit of this universe You proclaim the classical path of the Veda  
and assume forms in the mode of goodness, the very moment the path is  
obstructed by wicked persons adhering to godlessness.   
 You as that very same person, oh Master, have now descended in the home of  
Vasudeva,together with Balarama. This You have done in order to spread the  
fame of the Yadu dynasty and to relieve the earth's burden by killing hundreds  
of armies led by kings who are expansions of the demigods' enemies.   
Today oh Lord, our residence has been most blessed by the arrival of You,  
Adhokshaja, the Spiritual Master of the Universe who are the embodiment of all  
the gods, forefathers, living beings and humans. The water that has washed  
Your feet purifies the three worlds.   
What other scholar would there be for us? To whom else should we turn for  
shelter but to You, the well-wisher whose loving words for His devotees are  
always faithful? For,grateful to the supporters who worship You, You give all  
that they desire, even Yourself with whom there is never any diminution or  
increase.   
 How great is our fortune, having You,O Janardana before our eyes,who even for  
the masters of yoga and the most prominent among the enlightened ones,are a  
goal hard to attain.   
Please swiftly cut through the ties of our delusional existence,our attachment  
to our children, wife, wealth, honorable friends, our home, body and so on.   
All such attachment is simply the effect of Your Maya only.'   
Book 10,Chapter 48;17-27_

**_Vamana Avatara, the Dwarf Incarnation_**  
 _S 'uka said: 'He,The Eternal Being, with the conch, the club, the lotus and  
the disc in His four hands, the yellow dress and the lotus petal eyes, He  
whose heroic acts are praised by Brahma, consequently manifested Himself from  
Aditi. He with a pure, blackish complexion, the luster of two earrings in the  
form of sharks and a dazzling lotus face, was the Supreme One marked by the  
S'rivatsa mark on His chest and wearing bracelets and armlets, a shining  
helmet, a belt, a sacred thread and charming ankle bells. With a swarm of  
sweetness seeking humming bees around Him and carrying an extraordinarily  
beautiful flower garland and the Kaustubha gem around His neck, the Lord  
vanquished the darkness of Kas'yapa's house with His effulgence. At that  
moment everything was filled with happiness, all living beings in the waters,  
in the mountains, in the higher worlds, in outer space and on earth. The  
demigods, the cows, the brahmaṇas and the hills and mountains were all filled  
with joy. When the Lord took His birth it was a most auspicious moment: all  
the planets and stars, the sun and moon stood in a favorable position. It  
happened on Dvadas'i [the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadra] at  
noon [Abhijit] when the moon was in the house of S'ravana.   
 Oh King, this exact moment of the appearance of the Lord with the sun over  
the meridian, is the day the scholars call Vijaya. The loud sounds of the  
different conches, drums, kettledrums, panavas, anakas [other drums] and other  
instruments that were vibrated, became a great tumult.   
The heavenly dancing girls danced blissfully, the leading celestial singers  
sang and the sages, the demigods, the fathers of mankind, the ancestors and  
the fire gods all pleased the Lord with prayers. The perfected ones, the ones  
of knowledge, the apelike ones [the warriors of Rama], the ones of superpower,  
the venerable ones, the treasure keepers, the benevolent ones, the reciters  
[the 'brothers of Garuda'], the greatest experts [the 'snakes'] and all the  
followers of the demigods, glorifying, dancing and praising covered the  
residence of Aditi with flowers. When Aditi saw Him, the Supreme One who had  
been conceived in happiness and had taken birth from her womb, she was struck  
with wonder about the fact that He from His own spiritual potency had assumed  
a body. Also Kas'yapa greatly amazed about it exclaimed: 'All glory! [jaya!]'   
The Lord's body complete with ornaments and weapons cannot be seen,but for the  
divine purpose it was manifested by Him,acting like an actor in a theater and  
could be seen in the form of a dwarf boy Vamana. Seeing the Lord as a  
brahmacari dwarf made the great rishis very happy and thus they performed,  
with the founding father Kas'yapa as their lead, all the ceremonies. At the  
sacred thread ceremony of Vamanadeva, the Sun-god personally uttered the  
Gayatri mantra, Brihaspati gave the sacred thread and Kas'yapa offered Him a  
belt [of straw, signifying the twice-born status]. Mother earth offered Him a  
deerskin, the Moon gave Him a staff, Aditi gave Him underwear to cover His  
body and from the ruler of heaven [Indra] the master of the universe received  
a parasol. The Lord Brahma gave a waterpot, the seven sages donated kus'a  
grass and the goddess Sarasvati gave the Imperishable Soul a string of  
rudraksha beads, oh King. Thus having received His sacred thread, the Ruler  
of the Yakshas Kuvera, the treasurer of heaven, delivered a pot for begging  
alms and Uma, the chaste mother of the universe, the wife of S'iva, personally  
provided the alms.   
He as a brahmacari thus being welcomed by everyone, outshone with his brahmin  
effulgence as the best of them the entire assembly that enjoyed the grace of  
all the great brahmin sages. After kindling a fire as should, He like the best  
of the brahmins strew the kus'a grass around it and fed the fire of worship  
with wood.   
 As soon as He heard about the glory of Bali,as someone who under the guidance  
of Bhrigu brahmins performs horse sacrifices, He headed for the location where  
they took place and with each step that He as the Complete and Fully Endowed  
Essence made on His way, He therewith imprinted the earth with His footsteps.  
iAt the northern bank of the Narmada river in the field of Bhrigukaccha where  
all the priests of Bhrigu were performing their rituals for the sake of the  
ultimate ceremony, they saw Him in their presence radiating like the risen  
sun. The priests as also Bali, the instigator of the yajna and all who had  
assembled there, were overshadowed by Lord Vamana's splendor, oh King and  
wondered whether they saw the sun rising, the god of fire or Sanat-kumara who  
wanted to attend their ceremony. While the Bhrigus were thus with their  
disciples disputing in various ways, the Supreme Lord Vamana with in His hands  
His umbrella, rod and kamandalu filled with water, entered the arena of the  
As'vamedha sacrifice.   
The moment Vamana, the learned, seemingly human child that was the Lord, with  
His munja belt of straw and the sacred thread around His waist, His deerskin  
upper garment and His matted locks of hair, arrived there and was seen by the  
priests of Bhrigu with their disciples, they all stood up from their  
engagement in the fire sacrifice and appropriately welcomed the One who with  
His brilliance outshone them all. The instigator of the sacrifice, delighted  
to see Him so beautiful in each of His lustrous limbs, offered Him a seat.   
The Beauty of the Liberated Souls was thereupon with words of welcome  
worshiped by Bali Maharaja who honored Him by washing His feet. The water  
washing from His feet washes away the sins of all people. Bali knew the dharma  
and placed on his head the all-auspicious water that also the god of gods,  
Lord S'iva who is marked with the emblem of the moon, in his supreme devotion  
had accepted on His head.'   
Sri Bali said: 'We welcome You. My obeisances unto You, oh brahmin. What can  
we do for You? Oh noble soul, in my opinion You are the austerity of the  
brahmin seers in person. The arrival of Your lordship today at our residence,  
satisfies all our forefathers, it purifies the entire family and completes the  
sacrifice we are performing now! Today oh brahmin son, my fires of sacrifice  
are properly served according to the injunctions. Oh, by the water that washed  
from Your lotus feet all my sins are destroyed and by Your small feet the  
earth is purified. Whatever it is that You desire oh brahmacari, You may take  
from me, be it a cow, gold, a furnished residence, palatable food and drink or  
else a brahmin's daughter, prospering villages, horses, elephants or chariots,  
oh best of the worshipable ones. As far as I am concerned You may have  
whatever You wish.'   
Greatly pleased, the dwarf answered that Bali's speech was worthy of him and  
his race, wherein no one was known to have lacked generosity or broken a  
promise. He remembered the host's grandfather Prahlada, who was a perfect  
model in the practice of dharma, and his great-grandfather Hiranyakasipu,  
whose renowned valour made even Lord Vishnu run away from Vaikuntha and, it  
was said, finding no place where He could hide, entered the nostril of the  
pursuer himself, where alone He felt Himself safe, and concluded with: 'Like your celebrated forefather, you have, O King, been foremost in the  
observance of the rules of dharma and lavish charity. Of you, the great giver,  
I ask a small bit of land which measures not more than three of my own  
(dwarfish) paces: for to take more than he needs the wise man transgresses.'   
The ridiculous pettiness of the demand greatly amused Bali, who could not  
resist reminding his guest that he was too young to be alive to his interest  
in asking for such a tiny bit when he could have a whole continent, and added  
that now that he was disposed to be generous, Vamana could take as much land  
as would secure him a decent living.

Lord Vamana answered: 'The possession of all the three worlds cannot satisfy a man of unrestrained  
ambition. He who cannot be satisfied with three paces will not be satisfied  
with a whole continent. Prithu, Gaya and other kings who ruled over all the  
seven continents could never have enough, so great was their greed. The  
contented person can easily live on what chance places at his disposal. The  
hunger for wealth and sense-enjoyment is responsible for rebirth, whereas  
contentment inherits the great treasures of Liberation. I ask, therefore, O  
Protector of men, for only three paces of land which will cover my bare  
necessity.'   
Bali laughed and, pouring water in the palm of one hand, he pronounced his  
solemn promise to grant the gift demanded. Sukracharya warned Bali against  
this grant, the pettiness of which appeared to him to be very ominous. It  
might conceal a serious design on the part of Vishnu Himself to dispossess the  
asuras in favour of the celestials. He foresaw what was actually to take place  
and advised Bali to retract, which, he said, was legitimate to do when one's  
life and the lives of one?s dependants were exposed to grave danger. But Bali  
was not prepared to go back on his pledged word and, with great respect to his  
preceptor, magnanimously answered: 'It is true, O worshipful Brahmin, that a householder must not part with his  
means of livelihood; but, having promised, I cannot be guilty of breach of  
promise to a holy Brahmin, like a base swindler, out of greed. I do not fear  
hell, poverty, loss of throne or even death as much as I fear playing false to  
a Brahmin. In any case all the wealth in the world has to be abandoned at  
death. Time has taken away all the enjoyments of the daityas (my forefathers),  
who owned the whole universe, but could not extinguish their fame as heroes,  
who had never known what retreating in battle was. The fame of the magnanimous  
man who gives away all his fortune to needy supplicants, more so to knowers of  
Brahman, like your good self and this dwarf, and turns poor is far greater  
than even that of warriors, who lay down their lives on the battlefield. I  
will give to the Brahmin the land promised, be He Lord Vishnu Himself Whom we  
daily worship, or an enemy.'   
Sukracharya got very enraged at Bali's disobedience and, impelled by destiny,  
cursed him in the words, 'Because you have shown arrogance to me your guru,  
you shall, O fool, soon fall from your royal splendour,' which did not in the  
least deflect Bali's resolve to grant the promised gift. He washed the feet of  
Vamana from a golden vessel of water, which his queen herself had carried for  
the purpose. All the celestials applauded the magnanimity of Bali and showered  
celestial flowers on him. They beat their drums and sang hymns in his praise.  
But lo! the dwarf started expanding at such a rate that in a little time he  
filled all the spheres. Bali and his priests were staggered to see the whole  
creation in his body and, when he started measuring the three paces, he  
covered the whole earth and the cardinal points with one. His second covered  
swarga and stretched to the highest satyaloka, leaving no room for his third  
pace. There rose a great outcry among the daityas and the danavas at the  
deceit of Vamana, who proved a traitor to their cause, and rushed with weapons  
to attack him, but Vamana's attendants gave them a good beating and Bali,  
remembering the curse of his guru, knew that his fall was inevitable. He  
ordered his followers to retreat, saying that Vishnu, who had brought him to  
power by the Viswajit sacrifice was now standing against him, because time was  
now favourable to the celestials and advised them to wait patiently when time  
will turn in their favour and they will have the upper hand. The righteous  
Bali was bound by ropes and taken prisoner, to the sorrow of both the gods and  
the asuras.   
Lord Vamana charged Bali with perjury for having promised three paces of  
ground but gave only two, and sentenced him to imprisonment in the nether  
regions. Bali bore the sentence with equanimity and calmly answered: 'I did not intend, O Illustrious Lord, to deceive You. You have taken  
everything I possess, yet if You think that I owe You some more space for Your  
third step, You may be pleased to place it on my head. Fallen that I am, I am  
not afraid of the infernal regions nor of the loss of my kingdom, nor of any  
punishment, which the Great may deem fit to inflict on me. You now pose as our  
enemy, but I know You to be our greatest benefactor - You Who have blessed us  
with a vision of Yourself on the pretence of causing our downfall, having had  
which vision many an asura attained Liberation. In his profound wisdom my  
illustrious grandfather Prahlada, of universal fame, suffered all the variety  
of torture to preserve his firm devotion to You, although You exterminated his  
kinsmen the asuras, knowing full well that no lasting benefit can be gained  
from relatives who are disposed to rob one of one's wealth, or from wife who  
is the cause of transmigration, or even from one's own body which abandons one  
at death. How good is my destiny to bring me in direct contact with You,  
disguised as enemy though You may be!'   
Suddenly Prahlada appeared and prostrated himself before the Lord and with  
tears of joy addressed Him: 'O Lord, it was by You that the exalted office of Indra was conferred on Bali  
and by you that it has now been taken away. Whatever You do is always for  
one's good. Especially the taking away of one's possessions which usually  
corrupt the mind, must be deemed to be a great favour: for no man of wealth  
can make any attempt to seek his true nature. Even men of learning fall  
victims to delusion if they are wealthy. Hail to You, Lord of the universe and  
Witness of all things!'   
Brahma, who also arrived, interceded on Bali's behalf. The glorious Lord  
replied: 'Whomever I want to favour with My Grace I divest him of his fortune - the  
fortune which hardens the heart against living beings and against Me. If pride  
of lineage, wealth, physical graces, learning and power do not appear in the  
man who owns them, it must be considered as a favour from Me. My devotee who  
deserves these advantages is not corrupted by them as the foolish man is.   
'This leader of the daityas and danavas (Bali) has already conquered My  
invincible Maya, which is the reason why he is unperturbed by the calamity  
which has befallen him and stood firm by his promise even at the great cost of  
disobeying his guru and suffering his curse. He deserves to dwell in My own  
Vaikuntha, but he will have first to occupy the seat of Indra under My  
guardianship in the next Manvantara (the eighth) of Savarni Manu, ruling in  
the meantime Sutalaloka, whose natural beauty has been enhanced by the art of  
Viswakarma, the celestial architect, where no anxiety, disease, fatigue,  
disappointment and other afflictions exist.   
'O great Indrasena (Bali, Indra elect), may you flourish! Go now with your  
kinsmen to Sutala, which is envied even by the celestials, where none can harm  
you. My discus will destroy the daityas who will disobey your command and will  
protect you, your followers, and all your possessions. You will shed your  
demoniacal dispositions at the sight of My glory, which will be ever present  
there.'

**_Brahma Satisfies Lord Shiva_**  
 _Maitreya said: 'After all the demigods by the soldiers of Rudra were  
defeated they, wounded all over their bodies, together with all the priests  
and other members of the assembly in great fear offered Lord Brahma their  
obeisances and reported the events to him in detail. Knowing beforehand of  
the certainty of these events, the Lord born from the lotus flower and  
Narayana, the Supersoul of the entire universe, had not attended Daksha's  
sacrifice. Hearing what had happened Lord Brahma said: 'A great personality  
has been offended and that is, given the wish to live in peace, generally not  
conducive for well-being. Despite having committed these offenses in denying  
Lord S'iva his share of the offerings, you will all quickly find his mercy  
when you, without any reservations, satisfy him by taking shelter of his lotus  
feet. Do not think you can continue with the sacrifice without forthwith  
begging for the pardon of the god of all worlds and their controllers you have  
angered; being deprived of his wife, his heart was most upset by the unkind  
words spoken to him. Neither I, nor Indra, nor all of you and others who have  
a material body, nor even the sages who know the real extent of his strength  
and power, have an inkling of what it means to dare to offend Him who relies  
on the soul only.'(see 'Sati quits Her body'-http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=8322.msg77848#msg77848 )   
After thus having instructed the godly souls Lord Brahma went away,and took  
all the demigods, the Pitas and the lords of the living entities with him and  
left to the abode of Lord S'iva, Kailasa, the best of all mountains that is so  
dear to the master.The place, enjoyed by Kinnaras, Gandharvas, and Apsaras  
,the residents and singers of heaven and their wives,is populated by the  
Siddhas who differ from other people because they are gifted by birth, by  
austerity, by their use of herbs or by practicing mantras in yoga. The  
mountain rangeis replete with all kinds of precious stones and minerals and is  
grown by trees, creepers and a diversity of other plants. The mountain peaks  
with their crystal clear waterfalls have various caves pleasing to the wives  
of the mystics who sport there with their husbands. Resounding with the cries  
of peacocks and the humming of bees mad about the nectar, there is the  
continuous song of cuckoos and chirping of other birds. By the elephants  
moving around the mountain itself seems to be moving, by the sounds of the  
waterfalls the mountain itself seems to resound and by the trees that yield to  
all desires the mountain seems to be stretching its arms calling for the  
birds. It is further beautified by mandara, parijata, sarala (pine) and tamala  
trees, s'ala and tala, kovidara, ?sana and arjuna trees, cutas (mango),  
kadambas, dhuli-kadambas and nagas, punnagas and campakas and one also sees  
there trees like pathalas, as'okas, bakulas, kundas and kurabakas. It is also  
adorned with golden colored lotuses, the cinnamon tree, kubja, mallika and  
madhavi. With kata, jackfruit, julara and banyan trees, plakshas, nyagrodhas  
and trees producing asafoetida, there are also betelnut trees, pugas,  
rajapugas and jambus [black berries and alike],bamboos and many other.   
 All sorts of colorful lotuses cover the lakes of the forests that, filled  
with the sweet whispers of flocks of birds, harbor deer, monkeys, boars, cats,  
bears, s'alyakas, forest cows and asses, tigers, smaller deer and buffaloes  
and such. It is enjoyed by different types of deer and has groups of banana  
trees near the sandy banks of the beautiful hillside lakes filled with  
lotuses.   
The devoted souls saw the waters of lake Alakananda still carrying the flavor  
of Sati who bathed there and they were struck with wonder seeing that  
beautiful mountain of the Lord of Ghosts. There at Alaka ['uncommonly  
beautiful'] they saw the region with the forest full of fragrance, that  
carried that name because of the species of lotus flowers one finds there. The  
two rivers the Nanda and Alakananda flowing close to the abode of the Master,  
were supremely sanctified because of the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord.   
 Dear ruler, in these two rivers the celestial damsels descended from their  
dwellings to play there after making love to their husbands and splatter each  
other with the water. The two streams having turned yellow because of the  
kunkum powder make the elephants and their females who take a bath there to  
drink from the water, despite not being thirsty. The heavenly homes enjoyed by  
the wives of the virtuous souls were bedecked with countless valuable jewels,  
pearls and gold, that made them look like clouds in the sky brightened by  
flashes of lightening.   
Passing through the Saugandhika forest that was so attractive with its variety  
of trees yielding to all desires with its flowers, fruits and leaves, they  
reached the abode of the Lord of the Yakshas. There they saw the beauty of  
many birds with red necks whose sounds mixed with the humming of bees as also  
lakes filled with lotus flowers attractive to groups of swans. The breeze of  
the sandalwood trees made the wild elephants flock together and continuously  
stimulated the minds of the wives of the virtuous souls. The staircases  
leading to the bathing places full of lotuses that were used by the ones  
faithful to the divine personality [the Kimpurushas], were made of vaidurya  
stone. Having seen them they nearby spotted a banyan tree. At a height of  
thousands of feet it spread out its branches over a quarter of the foot of the  
mountain, casting a fine cooling shadow. It had no birds nesting in it.   
Underneath the tree the godly souls saw Lord S'iva,a Great S,age the shelter  
of many desiring liberation, who, in having given up his wrath, sat there as  
grave as eternal time. Saintly liberated souls like the Kumaras headed by  
Sanandana and Kuvera, the master of the Guhyakas and Rakshasas, sat there  
worshipful around the solemn and serene Lord. They saw him there as the Master  
of the senses, the knowledge of austerity and the Greatest Yogi; as the friend  
of the entire world who with his Love and Devotion is a blessing to everyone.  
One could recognize him as the one desired by the ascetics: with ashes, a  
staff, matted hair, seated on an antelope skin, the reddish hue of his body  
and the crescent moon on his head. With a mattress of darbha straw below him  
he, before an audience of all sages, conversed with N?aada about eternality  
and the Absolute Truth. He had placed his left foot over his right thigh and,  
with his right hand resting on his knee, holding his prayer beads, he  
gesticulated in argument. Thus leaning with his knee fixed and absorbed in the  
trance of spiritual bliss He, as the first thinker among the wise, received  
there the respects of the other sages and rulers of the different worlds who  
had folded their hands. But when Lord S'iva saw that the self born one, Lord  
Brahma, had arrived accompanied by the best of the enlightened and  
unenlightened, he whose feet were worshiped,stood up and bowed his head just  
like Vishnu did when He as Vamanadeva welcomed Kas'yapa. And so did the other  
perfected souls and great rishis who from all sides followed the example of  
their Lord and offered their obeisances. After that tribute to Lord S'iva,  
Lord Brahma addressed Him with a smile.   
Brahma said: 'I know you as the Controller of the entire manifestation of the  
cosmic creation, as the potency of both the seed [of the father] and the womb  
[of the mother] and as the one auspicious and Supreme who is immaterial and  
free from change.   
The way a spider manages its web, oh Fortunate One, you create, maintain and  
destroy this universe with the embodiment of your auspicious energy. In order  
to protect the benefits of dharma and artha [religion and economy] you  
empowered Daksha to realize the system of sacrifices and settle the respect  
for that what binds the people and to which the brahmins are vowed with the  
highest regard. Oh auspicious one, the deeds of him who strives to do good  
lead to the higher worlds, the heavens and the transcendental realm, while  
someone of inauspicious deeds awaits a ghastly hell. How can it be that for  
some these results turn out exactly opposite [with the good ones suffering and  
the bad ones prospering]? Among devotees, who in full surrender at your feet  
perfectly recognize you as present in all kinds of living beings and who -  
from the Supreme position - make no difference between living beings, one  
practically never finds the anger that one does find among animalistic types  
of people. Persons who observe everything with differentiation, who are simply  
attached to fruitive activities, who are mean-minded,who cannot tolerate it  
when others are faring well and thus are always angry with others and thus  
give distress to them by uttering harsh and piercing words have already been  
killed by providence. They do not need to be killed by you. When materialists  
at some places, being bewildered by the insurmountable, illusory energy of the  
Great Blue One [the Lord as Pushkaranabha] see matters of right and wrong  
differently, saintly persons out of their compassion will never use their  
prowess against them but be merciful instead, for everything is arranged by  
fate.   
 Oh Lordship, since the intelligence of you, the seer and knower of all, is  
never affected by that great potency of the material energy of the Supreme One  
[Maya], you in this case should strive to have mercy with those who are  
bewildered at heart because of that same illusory energy that attracts them to  
karmic activities. My dear Lord Siva, you are a shareholder of a portion of  
the sacrifice, and you are the giver of the result. The bad priests did not  
deliver your share, and therefore you destroyed everything, and the sacrifice  
remains unfinished. Now you can do the needful and take your rightful share.  
Let the performer Daksha get his life back, let Bhagadeva get his eyes back,  
let Bhrigu grow his mustache back and let Pusa have his row of teeth as  
before. Let the God-conscious souls whose limbs were broken and the priests  
who suffered from the weapons and stones, this very moment by your grace, oh  
angered one, recover from their injuries. Oh Rudra, let the portion of  
whatever is left of this sacrifice be yours, my dear Lord, so that the  
sacrificial ceremony today can be completed, oh destroyer of the yajna.'

**_The Song Sung by Lord Shiva_**  
 _Vidura asked: 'Oh brahmin, please clarify what happened when the Pracetas met Lord S'iva on  
their path, as also what the Lordship,who was so pleased with them,has said.  
Oh best among the scholars, in this world being caught in a physical body it  
rarely happens that one finds association with Lord S'iva. Even sages who,  
with Him as their object of desire, fully detached are engaged in meditation  
fail in this. Although he is satisfied within himself, the great Lord S'iva,  
when he manifests in this world for the matter of helping its existence,  
everywhere and is accompanied by his dangerous Shaktis[like those of Kali,  
Durga. ..].'   
Maitreya said: 'The sons of father Pracinabarhi,all in full surrender,serious  
in their hearts about doing penances, accepting the words of their father  
piously on their heads had left in the western direction. They reached a very  
large expanse of water as vast as the nearby ocean with water that, as clear  
as the mind of a great soul, constituted a pleasure to its inhabitants. In  
that water a multitude of red and blue, kahlara and indivara lotuses was found  
and swans, cranes, ducks and other birds sung beautifully. Mad bumblebees  
joyfully hummed loudly with their little hairy bodies. It was a festival of  
creepers, trees and lotuses the pollen of which by the wind was spread in all  
directions. All the princes were amazed about the beautiful heavenly music  
accompanied by drums and kettle drums that could be heard there continually.   
That very moment they witnessed how the chief of the demigods [Lord Shiva],  
came out of the water accompanied by an association of great souls who  
glorified Him. Seeing His golden hue, His bodily features, His blue throat,  
three eyes and merciful beautiful face, they all aroused, filled with  
admiration, offered their obeisances. He who dispels all dangers, the Great  
Lord and caretaker of the religion, then talked to them, pleased as He was  
with their observance of the principles in the past, their gentle behavior and  
their good manners.   
Lord Rudra said: 'Oh all of you sons of King Pracinabarhi, knowing your  
actions and desires, I wish you all the best and in order to prove you my  
mercy, I therefore grant you my presence. Any living being, any individual  
soul so one says, who surrenders directly to Vasudeva, the Bhagavan and  
transcendental controller of the three modes, is very dear to me. When someone  
for the time of a hundred lives is fixed on his duty, he acquires the position  
of Brahma and when he also does not fail to serve the Supreme Lord, he  
thereafter will attain Me. Devotees of Lord Vishnu at the end of time attain a  
position like the one of Me or the demigods.You devotees are for that reason  
as dear to me as the Supreme Lord Himself, just as apart from Him there is no  
one else as dear to the devotees as I am. In particular this what I am going  
to tell you now, is what you always should attend to and repeat for  
yourselves, for it is very pure, auspicious, transcendental and beneficial.'   
Maitreya said: 'With a heart full of compassion Lord S'iva,Bhagavan and the  
greatest devotee of Narayana, spoke the following words to the princes who  
with folded hands stood before him.   
Lord Rudra said: 'All glories unto You, the best of all self-realized souls  
who brings happiness for the welfare of all. Let there be my obeisances unto  
You, for You are the all-perfect and worshipable soul of all, the Supersoul.  
All my respects unto You Vasudeva, from whose navel the lotus sprouted. You  
are the source of the senses and the sense objects and the immutable self-  
illumined state that is of an eternal peace. I offer my obeisances also to You  
in the form of Sankarshana [the Lord of ego and integration] who as the origin  
of the subtle non-manifest matter is the unsurpassable master of  
disintegration at the end of time, and to the master of all development,in the  
form of the soul in the beyond Pradyumna [the master of intelligence]. All  
glories to You, I offer my respects again unto You as Aniruddha [Lord of the  
mind], the Master of the senses. My obeisances unto the Supreme One of perfect  
purity and completeness who stands apart from this material creation. Unto You  
as the heavenly abode, the path of liberation, the gateway of the eternal and  
the purest of the pure, my obeisances. All my respects I offer unto You, the  
golden semen, who are the continuity of the Vedic sacrifices. Be praised, oh  
You who invigorate the ancestors and the gods, oh master of the three Vedas  
and the sacrifices. You are the leading deity of the moon who pleases  
everyone. All my respects unto You, the Supersoul pervading all living beings.  
The strength and power of all that exists, the body and Transcendental Self of  
the diversity of the material world [the virath rupa] and the maintainer of  
the three worlds, I offer my obeisances.   
All glories to You who, as the ether, You, the within and without, the Supreme  
effulgence. My obeisances unto You as the One beyond death and the purpose of  
all pious activities. Unto You, the God of the forefathers, unto You as the  
final outcome of all fruitive action and as death itself, You, the cause of  
all sorts of misery resulting from irreligion, I offer my respects. Because  
You are the topmost bestower of benedictions, the mastermind of all mantras,  
the causal self, I offer You my respects. All glory to You as the greatest of  
all religiosity, unto You, Krishna, who are the perfection of intelligence.  
You are the oldest of the old, the Original Personality and master of yogic  
analysis. The reservoir of the three energies, the reason of the material  
identification of the soul [the egotism] and the embodiment of knowledge,  
intention and the voice of all powers, I offer my obeisances.   
 Please show us who desire Your presence, the form that to the satisfaction of  
all the senses of the devotees is worshiped by them as the dear most. As  
glistening as the rain from the dense clouds during the rainy season, You are  
the summit of all beauty. Beautiful are the features of Your four-handed form,  
of the greatest is Your pleasant face, Your eyes are as beautiful as the  
petals in the whorl of a lotus flower, beautiful are Your eyebrows, straight  
nose, shining teeth, high forehead and the full decoration of Your face and  
equally beautiful perfect ears.The beauty of Your merciful smile and sidelong  
glances, Your curly hair and clothing in the saffron color of the lotus, is  
supported by the glittering earrings and shiny helmet, the bangles, necklace,  
ankle bells, belt, conch shell, disc, club, and lotus flower, garland and the  
best of pearls, that make You look still more beautiful. The shoulders under  
Your coils of hair that are like those of a lion and Your neck, fortunate of  
bearing the jewel glittering on Your chest [named Kaustubha], give You a never  
decreasing beauty that exceeds the beauty of the streaks of gold on every norm  
or touchstone. Your inhaling and exhaling stirs beautifully the folds in Your  
belly that looks like a banana leaf, and Your navel is like the spiraling of  
the galaxy. The dark color of the skin below Your waist is extra attractive  
with the beauty of Your dress and golden belt as also with, lower situated,  
the great symmetrical beauty of Your lotus feet, calves and thighs. By the so  
very pleasing lotus feet, that are like the petals of a lotus flower in  
autumn,You drive away all the trouble agitating us. Show us the path of Your  
lotus feet that reduce the fear of material existence, oh teacher, oh  
spiritual master of all who suffer the darkness. They who, performing their  
duties, wish to purify themselves and live without fear, must meditate on this  
form of Yours in bhakti-yoga. Your grace is easily obtained by the devotees,  
but for all other embodied souls You are difficult to reach, even for those  
belonging to the king of heaven Indra or for the self-realized souls whose  
ultimate goal it is to attain oneness with You. What else would one desire but  
Your lotus feet, once one has been of the worship that even for the most  
virtuous is difficult to attain! The invincible time, by which You in Your  
prowess and majesty with simply raising Your eyebrows vanquish the entire  
universe, constitutes no threat to a soul of complete surrender. Even but for  
a moment enjoying the association of a company of devotees cannot compare with  
heaven or with merging, not to mention worldly blessings. Let there for us  
who, in order to wash away the ruminations of sin, dip in and step out of the  
Ganges, be the mercy and virtue of this association. For this association with  
the glorification of Your feet defeats all misfortune and blesses the normal  
living beings with the fullest goodness. He whose heart was purified by the  
blessing derived from entering that bhakti-yoga, will be very happy to find  
therein the wisdom of Your way and will never end up bewildered in the dark  
pit of worldly influences. You are the Absolute Spirit,the Self and the  
transcendental light spread everywhere like the ether, in whom this universe  
of the cosmic manifestation has appeared. _   
_You are the one who by His energy has created, maintains and again  
annihilates this variegated manifestation. Although You are never disturbed by  
such changes and alterations, the living beings are disturbed by them, and  
therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to be different or separated from  
You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.  
Experts in the field of the Vedas and their corollaries are those  
transcendentalists who, for their perfection, with faith and conviction duly,  
by a wide range of organized actions, glorify You who are identified by that  
what is created, by the senses and by the heart. You are the One Original  
Person from whose dormant energy the diversity of the totality of the material  
energy has originated that is ruled by the natural modes of passion, goodness  
and ignorance. It is a diversity we know as the ego, the sky, the air, the  
fire, the water and the earth, the virtuous souls, the sages and all the  
living beings.That what You created from Your own potency, You afterwards  
enter in the form of the four kinds of bodies. By these bodies, Your own parts  
and parcels, You know him, an enjoyer of the senses, who like a bee that  
relishes the sweet honey. All we see is how You, just like the wind  
scattering the clouds, with Your so very great force of Time in the long run  
destroy all the planetary systems and how all living beings equally find their  
end because of external causes. The madmen of this world most greedily delight  
in material enjoyment, but all of a sudden You, vigilantly as the Destroyer,  
seize them just like a mouse is seized by the restless tongue of a hungry  
snake. Which educated person who knows that one, by not respecting You, only  
sees the useless decay of one's body, would reject Your lotus feet, the feet  
that by our spiritual teacher Brahma and the fourteen Manus were worshiped  
without hesitation or further arguing? You therefore are for us, men of  
wisdom, the Supreme Brahman, the Soul of the soul, the Self, the destination  
were there is no fear at all for the Destroyer Rudra who is feared by the  
entire universe.'   
'If you pray like this and faithfully perform your duty, there will be  
happiness for all of you, oh purified sons of the king who have turned your  
minds to the Supreme Lord. Be of worship and always sing and meditate full of  
praise on Him, who as the Supreme Soul is situated in both your hearts and the  
hearts of all other living beings. All of you, time and again read this  
instruction of yoga and close it in your heart. Take to the vow of the sages  
of always with intelligence being silently absorbed within and practice this  
with the greatest respect. This was first taught by the great Lord Brahma, the  
master of the creators of the universe, of the great Sages headed by Bhrigu  
who, as his sons in charge of the world, were eager to create. We who as the  
controllers of the people were enjoined by him to procreate were by this  
instruction freed from all ignorance and thus could bring about the different  
kinds of people. The person who thus regularly repeats this to himself with  
great attention, will being absorbed in this without delay achieve the  
devotion to Vasudeva [Lord of Consciousness].   
Spiritual knowledge is, of all benedictions in this world, the supreme  
transcendental benefit of happiness for every person, because one with the  
boat of higher knowledge crosses over the insurmountable ocean of danger.  
Anyone who devotedly and with faith regularly studies this song of mine, this  
prayer offered to Him, the Supreme Lord, will be able to please the Lord who  
is so difficult to praise. The person who is fixed on the song as sung by me  
can, by dint of Him, the dear most of all benedictions, by the Lord of the  
Beyond who is pleased by it, attain whatever he desires. The devotee who,  
rising early in the morning, with faith and devotion folding his hands, is  
absorbed in this prayer and thus personally listens, will be liberated from  
all karmic bondage. Oh sons of the king, by the intelligence of perfectly  
attentive praying and chanting this song I sang of the Supreme Person who is  
the Supersoul within every one, you will ultimately achieve the results you  
desired, for that practice equals the greatest austerities.'

**__Liberation from ignorance**  
 _The Lord Kapila said: 'Even though abides in a material body, the Soul is not affected by the basic  
qualities of matter because he does not claim doership and thus is not subject  
to change, just like the sun is not affected by being reflected in water. But  
when this very Soul is affected with the modes of material nature it becomes  
bewildered by the ego sense and thinks: 'I am the doer'. Dealing with material  
nature in such a way,the wrong actions are the result,and he in discontent,  
helplessly undergoes the repeated birth and death,in births from different  
wombs or species depending on the good or bad life he led or a combination of  
these. Like having landed in a nightmare wherein the things happening do not  
really exist, there is for the Soul, who only thinks and sees what occurs to  
his senses, no end to his materially conditioned existence and illusion.  
Therefore the mind of attachment to material pleasure must, free from  
attachment, gradually be brought under control with the bhakti. Beginning with  
yama [meaning the great vow of yoga of nonviolence, truth, non-stealing,  
celibacy and non-possessiveness in the discipline of detachment], one should  
practice the different forms of yoga and develop, endowed with faith,  
unalloyed devotion unto Me by listening my stories,reading and reflecting on  
the teachings of the Truth. Therein one must be without enmity and regard all  
living beings as equal, not entertain intimate relations and be celibate, be  
free from chatter and offer the results of one's labor. One should be  
satisfied with whatever comes of its own, eat little and live thoughtfully in  
a secluded place and be peaceful, kind, compassionate and self-realized. In  
relating to others and to one's body one should not follow the physical  
concept of life but rather, from the spiritual perspective attend to the  
factual truth of both the material and the personal aspect. One should  
transcend the stages of consciousness [of waking, dreaming and deep sleep] and  
stay away from other conceptions of life. Thus, with a purified intellect, the  
true Self, the Soul within, should be seen as clear as the sun before one's  
eyes. A liberated soul realizes the Truth, which is beyond and which is  
manifest as a reflection in the false ego. He is the support of the material  
cause and He enters into everything. He is Absolute, one without a second, and  
He is the eye of the illusory energy. It is like with the sun that can be seen  
as a reflection on water or on a wall, but factually is situated in the sky.  
The Truth is reflected in the threefold nature of the materially identified  
ego that consists of body, senses and mind. Someone who in this material world  
wrongly identifies with the material elements, the objects of enjoyment, the  
material senses, the mind, intelligence and so on, is actually in deep sleep,  
but once he is awakened he is freed from false ego and illusion. Even though  
not being lost, still the Soul unjustly considers himself lost. But through  
the path of yoga,established in Jnana,he sees himself as a witness,not  
affected with material nature,and with it, he sees also unreality of the ego.  
Coming to understand this,he realizes his true Self,Atma, his original  
individuality [svarupa].'   
Devahuti said: 'Dear brahmin, is it not so that material nature never releases  
the soul because the two are eternally attracted to each other, oh Best One?  
Just as aroma and earth have no separate existence and taste does not exist  
apart from water, intelligence cannot exist independent of consciousness.  
Then how can a soul be free from material nature? Is the soul, being a passive  
observer, not forced to act because of the basic qualities of matter? The  
great fear, one may avoid by contemplating the fundamental principles, will  
not cease because every time its cause appears again.'   
The Bhagavan said: 'One will realize the freedom, when one, with a pure mind serious unto Me and  
faithfully contemplates on the Truth with devotion, manages to perform one's  
duties without desiring the fruits thereof. By means of Jnana, with the vision  
of the Absolute Truth, by penance,with renunciation, detached and firmly fixed  
in that same Truth, one becomes absorbed in the Self. Bound to material nature  
he is day after day consumed, like firewood by fire, disappearing gradually.  
But experiencing his dependency, understanding the futility of the desire to  
always enjoy, he, thus forsaking sensual pleasures, firmly stands in his own  
glory. The many inauspicious matters a person may dream of in his sleep, will  
not in the least daunt him when he has awakened. Someone, who has fixed his  
mind upon Me, the knower of the Absolute Truth within, thus has nothing to  
fear from material nature. When someone wise thus for many years and many  
births is engaged in self-realization, he will develop a distaste for enjoying  
whatever, even the heaven of the creator. Someone devoted to Me who under My  
protection for the sake of awakening his intelligence, by My unlimited mercy  
goes for the ultimate goal of his existence that is called kaivalya  
[enlightenment, emancipation, beatitude], will in this life soon attain a  
steady self-awareness and be free from doubt. The yogi who departed for that  
heavenly abode will, after leaving behind both the subtle and the gross body,  
never return. When the attention of the perfected yogi is not drawn towards  
yogic powers to control the material illusion, my dear mother, then, having no  
other purpose in his life, his progress towards Me will be unbounded, because  
the power of death is lost therein.'   
Book 3,Chapter 27_

**_Explanation of Bhakti Yoga by Lord Kapila   
_**  
 _Devah?ti said: "Please elaborate now at length on the path of bhakti yoga  
that one calls the ultimate purpose."   
Maitreya said: 'Appreciating the words of His mother, oh best of the Kurus,  
the great and gentle sage, contented and being moved by compassion, said the  
following. The Bhagavan said: 'O noble lady, there are many paths and ways of bhakti yoga,depending on  
natural disposition and temperaments of seekers. What one does out of love for  
Me in a spirit of violence, pride and envy or out of anger with a fractional  
view,is considered to be in the mode of darkness(tamas). He who worships Me  
with idols and aims at material things, fame and opulence, is in the mode of  
passion (rajas). Someone who worships Me with offering the results of his  
actions or when he for the sake of transcendence desires to be free from karma  
[profit-minded action],that bhakti is said to be in the mode of goodness  
(sattva). In case of an uninterrupted thinking of Me who is present in  
everyone's heart - just like the water of the Ganges that continuously flows  
towards the ocean - and when one wishes to hear about My qualities only,  
having no ulterior motives, one may speak of pure devotion, of bhakti unto the  
Supreme One. Pure devotees will not accept it - not even when being offered  
these - to be equal with Me, to have the same opulence, to be a personal  
associate, to have the same bodily features or to be joined in oneness,but  
only to be in My service. When one by means of this bhakti yoga - which one  
calls the highest aim - succeeds in dealing with the three modes of nature the  
way I explained it, one attains My transcendental nature. When one performs  
one's duties without attachment to the results one is stronger, and when one  
without unnecessary violence regularly and with dedication practice this yoga,  
one will find happiness. The same as someone worships My statue,by seeing it,  
offering respect to it,by offering obeisances, praise and worship,he should  
,in the spirit of detachment and in the mode of goodness, think of Me and see  
Me being present in all living beings. By means of sense control and proper  
regulation [yama and niyama], being of the greatest respect for the great  
souls, being compassionate with the poor and by being friendly in association  
with like-minded souls; by hearing about spiritual matters, chanting My holy  
names, being straightforward, by association with civilized people and not  
entertaining false ego, the consciousness of a person who with these qualities  
is dutiful towards Me is completely purified. No doubt he by simply hearing  
about My excellence will directly reach Me. The way the sense of smell catches  
the aroma that is carried from its source by means of the air, similarly  
consciousness by means of yoga catches the Supreme Soul who is free from  
change.   
When one who worships the deity but has no respect for Me who, in the form of  
the All pervading Soul, is always situated in every living being,this is  
nothing but a hypocrisy. Someone who in worship of the deity has no regard for  
Me as the Supreme Ruler present in all beings, is in his ignorance only  
offering oblations into the ashes. He who offers Me his respects but is  
envious, lives in his campaigning against others and in enmity, will never  
find peace of mind. Oh sinless one, I am certainly not pleased when they who  
manage to worship Me in My deity form, are not of respect for other living  
beings. Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the  
Ishvara until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of  
other living beings as well. For those who discriminate with regard to the  
body of themselves and that of others, for those who make distinction between  
them and others,as the blazing fire of death, I will cause great fear. One  
should therefore, with charity, respect and in friendship regarding everyone  
as an equal, propitiate Me, the One True Self abiding in all.   
Living entities are better developed than inanimate objects, better than  
entities with life symptoms, oh blessed one, are entities with a developed  
consciousness and better than those are they who developed sense perception.  
Among them, those who developed taste are better than those who only developed  
a sense of touch and better than they are those who developed a sense of  
smell. Even better are those creatures who developed the faculty to hear.  
Better than those are the ones distinguishing differences of form and those  
who have teeth in both their jaws are better than these. Those who have many  
legs are superior to them. Of them the four-legged creatures are the ones  
better developed,while the two-legged ones are even better. Among human  
beings a society with four classes is the better one and of those classes the  
brahmins are the best. Among the brahmins the better one is who knows the  
Vedas, but best of those are the Brahmins who know its purpose.   
The one who puts an end to all doubts is better than he who knows what the  
purpose of the Vedas is and the brahmin among them who performs his duty is  
better than him. He who is free from worldly attachment is still better and  
the one who performs his righteous duty not for himself alone is the best  
developed of them all.   
Therefore I know of no greater being than a person who with a dedicated mind  
has offered all of his actions, wealth and life without any reservation to Me  
and with persistence is of service without any other interest or motive,but  
only from the deep love. Such a one who regards the Supreme Lord, the  
Controller of the individual soul, as having entered all the living beings in  
the form of the Paramatma, is therefore mindfully of respect for his fellow  
creatures. Oh daughter of Manu, someone can attain the Original Person by  
following either of these two paths of bhakti and mystic yoga separately that  
I have described. This Bhagavan is the eternal form of the Brahman. He is  
Purusha,ethereal personality of the primal reality,He is transcendental,and  
all His activities are spiritual.   
Time, known as the divine cause of the different manifestations of the living  
entities, constitutes the reason why all living beings who consider themselves  
as existing in separation, from the greatest on, live in fear. He who from  
within first enters all the living entities, is the support of everyone and  
annihilates them again by means of other living beings, is named Vishnu, the  
enjoyer of all sacrifices. He is that time factor, the Master of all masters.  
There is no one specially favored by Him, nobody is his friend or enemy. He  
approaches those who are attentive and of those who are inattentive He is the  
destroyer.   
 He for whom the wind out of fear blows and this sun is shining, for whom out  
of fear Indra sends his rains and the heavenly bodies are shining; He because  
of whom out of fear the trees, creepers and herbs each in their own time bear  
flowers and produce their fruits; He afraid of whom the rivers flow and the  
oceans do not overflow, because of whom fire burns and the earth with her  
mountains does not submerge; He because of whom the sky provides air to those  
who breathe and under the control of whom the universe expands its body of the  
complete reality [mahat-tattva] with its seven layers, He for whom out of fear  
the gods of creation and more, in charge of the basic qualities of nature,  
within this world carry out their functions according to the yugas, He of whom  
afraid all the animate and inanimate beings find their control; that Infinite,  
final operator of beginningless Time is the Unchangeable Creator who creates  
people out of people and by means of death destroys even the Lord of death  
himself.'

**_Lord Kapila Describes the Adverse Consequences of Karma_**  
 _Lord Kapila said: 'Just like a mass of clouds has no knowledge of the power of the wind,in the  
same way a person has no knowledge of the great power of the Time, even though  
he is being conditioned by it. Whatever the goods one with difficulty acquired  
for one's happiness, they are destroyed by the Bhagavan, and for this reason  
he laments. In his ignorance he foolishly thinks that having a home, land and  
wealth for the sake of his body, would be something permanent. The living  
being will irrespective of the birth he acquired,in any species he finds  
himself,find satisfaction in this worldly existence. Even being in hell a  
person, who in fact is deluded by the divine Maya, does not wish to give up  
his hellish pleasures. With his body, spouse, children, home, animals, wealth  
and friendships deeply rooted in his heart, he considers himself a great  
success. Burning with anxiety about maintaining all the members of his dear  
family, he is always uncomfortable and sinful,acting like a fool. With his  
heart and senses charmed by the woman and by the display of the sweet words of  
his children, he is in the grip of the illusion,considering that which is non-  
permanent to be eternal. Engaged in the supposed duties of his family life -  
which cause him all kinds of trouble, he is busy countering these miseries  
while thinking that that will make him happy as a householder. Only enjoying  
little of it, he maintains his family by unjust means and the wealth that he  
with violence secured, but following that course he ultimately goes against  
himself. When he, despite his repeated efforts, fails in securing what he  
wished, he will, ruled by greed,desire the wealth enjoyed by others and thus  
get into trouble. No longer capable of maintaining his family the unfortunate  
wretch,being old and bereft of wealth and beauty, then with a bewildered  
intelligence full of grief laments over everything he tried in vain.   
Thus finding himself incapable of supporting his wife and children, he is not  
respected as he was before, the way an old ox is not respected by its farmer.  
Despite getting deformed of old age,and being maintained by the ones he once  
maintained, no aversion against a family life rises in him while he, at home  
awaits his death. Remaining there he, like a pet dog, eats what indifferently  
is placed before him, falls sick with indigestion and eats and does only  
little. In that diseased condition, one?s eyes bulge due to the pressure of  
air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty  
breathing, and upon exhaling and inhaling he produces strange sound, a  
rattling within the throat. Lying down surrounded by his lamenting friends and  
relatives he, with the noose of time around his neck, cannot respond to the  
things said to him. He, who was engrossed in maintaining his family and had no  
control over his senses, thus passes away in great pain, with his relatives in  
tears. Witnessing the arrival of the servants of death with their terrible  
eyes full of wrath, he, because of the fear in his heart, passes stool and  
urine. Like the king's soldiers they immobilize his body by binding him in  
ropes for his punishment, whereupon they drag him like a criminal forcefully  
by the neck over a long distance. Innerly broken by their threatening  
presence he, overtaken, trembles on the road and is bitten by dogs in the  
distress of remembering his sins. Afflicted by hunger, thirst and the heat of  
scorching forest fires and winds on hot and sandy roads, he feels how he  
painfully is beaten on his back with a whip, while he, unable to move, can  
find no refuge or water. Now and then he falls, gets tired and loses  
consciousness, and then again he reawakens on the road of his misery where he  
quickly is led before the eternal ruler of death Yamaraja. He sees his entire  
life passing by in a few moments and then receives the punishment he deserves.  
With his limbs covered by firewood he is cremated or sometimes he sees himself  
eating his own flesh. Vividly he then witnesses how dogs pull out his entrails  
at his last resting place where serpents, scorpions, gnats and so on pester  
him to his abhorrence. One by one his limbs are separated from his body by big  
and small animals who tear him apart, throw him from heights or drag him under  
water or into caves. Because of the unregulated sexual association one  
has,one must, whether one is a man or a woman,undergo the reaction in hellish  
states of anger,self-destruction and bewilderment.   
Actually, heaven and hell exist also in this world, oh mother, so they  
sometimes become visible and experienced here. He who thus in greed,  
attachment and infidelity maintained his family or lived for his stomach only,  
will upon leaving this world in his afterlife have to face the consequences  
for himself and his family. After quitting his body he will enter the darkness  
all alone and pay the price for the harm that he out of self-interest did to  
others in his envy of their fortune. By divine arrangement a man who sustained  
his family has to undergo the hellish reaction of his foul play and suffer  
like someone who lost all his wealth. When a person in his eagerness to care  
for his family is simply godless and unscrupulous in his actions, he heads for  
the darkest region of self-destruction. After he, beginning from the lowest  
position of an animal existence prior to a human birth, in due order has  
undergone all the reactions and so on, he, thus being purified, may again  
return here.'

**_Lord Nrisimha Slays the King of the Demons_**  
 _Narada Muni said to Yudhishthhira: 'Having heard explanations of the Truth  
from the Great Prahlada,all the attending Daitya sons (Prahlada's schoolmates)  
accepted his words because of their profundity and rejected what their  
teachers had taught them. When the two sons of the guru [S'ukracarya's sons  
Shanda and Amarka] realized how the intelligence of the boys had gotten fixed  
on this one subject matter, they fearfully contacted the king to submit to him  
what was going on.   
(- the king was Prahlada's father,the great Asura Hiranyakas'ipu. )   
All over his body trembling with anger and with a mind determined to kill his  
son he rebuked Prahlada. With the harshest words he furiously with an angry  
face and crooked, wicked eyes approached him who did not deserve such a  
treatment at all. He from his side gentle and restrained, with his hands  
folded just stood there before his father who was hissing like a vicious snake  
trampled upon.   
Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'Oh you impudent fool, you intriguer of the family, you  
outcaste, you obstinate one going against my rule, I will today send you to  
the abode of Yamaraja! When I am angry all inhabitants of the three worlds and  
their leaders tremble for me. By what power do you so fearlessly overstep my  
rule, you rascal?'.   
Prahlada said: 'He is not only my strength but also yours, oh King and the  
strength of all other exalted and lower living beings. All who move around and  
do not move around, beginning with Lord Brahma, fall under His control. He,  
the supreme controller, the time factor, is Urukrama, the Lord of the Wide  
Steps [Vamana] who is that one strength of one's mind and life, the steadiness  
of one's physical power and senses. He, the True Self, is the Supreme Master  
of the three modes who by His different natural forces creates, maintains and  
withdraws again the entire universe. Please give up the Asura way. Be peaceful  
and create no enemies. Destroy only the true enemy that is an uncontrolled  
mind. That approach is the best method to worship the unlimited Lord. In the  
past there were plunderers who not in control with the six enemies [the mind  
and the five senses] stole away everything. Others saw themselves as  
conquerors of the ten directions. But where are with a saint who managed to  
defeat his senses and is of an equal regard for all living beings, those  
enemies to be found who are a product of one's own imagination?'   
Sri Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'You apparently, with your unlimited pretenses, seek  
your own demise. You prove that people about to die talk gibberish, you  
pityful idiot. You unlucky soul, you talk of someone other than me who would  
be the controller of the universe, but where is He to be found? If He is  
omnipresent, then why do I not see Him in this pillar right in front of me?  
Let that Lord you wished yourself as your protector protect you, now that I am  
going to sever your head from your trunk, now that I am going to put an end to  
someone talking such nonsense like you.'   
Thus with a stream of abuses enraged chastising his son, that great devotee,  
Hiranyakas'ipu, rising from his throne and taking up his sword, with his fist  
struck hard against a column. At that very time from within the column a most  
fearful sound could be heard as if the covering of the universe cracked open.  
That sound dear King, reached as far as the place of the godly ones of Lord  
Brahma and made them believe that the destruction of their abodes was at hand.  
He who in his display of power wanted to kill his son, also heard the  
tumultuous sound one had never heard before and stood together with the  
assembly present amazed about the fact that one could not determine its  
origin. Thus all these men of power were caught in fear. To be true to the  
words that were spoken in defense of His omnipresence, of His pervading each  
and everything, one could see a most wonderful form of Him taking shape in a  
pillar in the middle of the assembly hall. It was neither an animal nor a man.  
The king, studying the phenomenon from all sides, saw how a living being  
emerged from the middle of the pillar. But not being able to ascertain whether  
it was an animal or a human being he said amazed: 'What kind of form is this?  
It is half man and half lion!'   
As he was contemplating the miracle that took place in front of him, the  
extraordinary, most frightening form of Nrisimhadeva appeared. He had eyes  
glowing like molten gold and deadly teeth in a face extending into manes.  
Looking around with a dreadful frown He waved His tongue like a razor sharp  
sword. His ears stood motionless straight up and His nostrils and mouth were  
opened wide like mountain caves. His huge body was short and fat with a broad  
neck and a broad chest over a small waist. His body was covered with whitish  
hairs resembling the rays of the moon and hundreds of arms stretched in all  
directions were equipped with hard to challenge fatal nails who served as  
weapons next to His other personal weapons. Faced with that excellence the  
Daityas and Danavas fled away. 'I guess this is what the Lord so full of  
mystical potency is trying to do in order to get me killed, but what's the  
use?' so Hiranyakas'ipu murmured to himself and taking up his mace the Daitya  
threw himself forward like an elephant to attack the loudly roaring Lord  
Nrisimha. As invisible as an insect that has fallen into a fire, the Asura  
disappeared into the effulgence of Nrisimha. That was something not that  
astonishing at all that moment considering the fact that He with the  
effulgence of His goodness formerly had swallowed the darkness of the entire  
creation. The greatest of the demons reaching Lord Nrisimha thereupon  
furiously with great force exercising his prowess struck Him with his club,  
but the Lord, the Wielder of the Club, seized him just like the son of Garuda  
would capture a great snake.Oh son of Bharata, when He in order to play a game  
allowed the Asura to slip from His hands exactly the way Garuda sometimes  
deals with a snake, the godly ones of the different worlds who were driven  
from their positions, from behind the clouds considered that to be a bad turn  
of events. The demon thinking that He had let him go out of fear for his  
masculine display, after regaining his strength took up his sword and shield  
and with great force attacked Nrisimhadeva for the second time. When he with  
his moon spotted shield and sword fast as a hawk was maneuvering up and down  
so as not to offer any opportunity, the Lord made a very shrill, loud sound of  
laughter that was so frightening that he, with his eyes shortly closed, was  
captured by the Greatest of all Speed. In protest he wrestling with his limbs  
tried to escape, but the Lord placed him whose skin could not even be cut by  
Indra's thunderbolt, at the entrance of the palace on His lap like he was a  
snake or mouse and pierced him with His nails as easy as Garuda pierces a  
poisonous viper. He with His most fearful eyes full of anger was difficult to  
behold. With His mouth wide open licking the edges with His tongue and with  
His mane and face smeared red with traces of blood, He wore the intestines  
like a garland around His neck and looked like a lion that just has killed an  
elephant. The heart He with His pointed nails had ripped out completely and  
thrown aside and the thousands of followers who with their raised weapons  
attended to their leader He all killed using His nails and the other weapons  
in His countless hands. Shaking His manes He scattered the clouds and with His  
glaring glance He outshone the luminaries. The waters and oceans struck by His  
breathing swirled in perturbation and afraid of His roar the elephants  
guarding the quarters of the universe cried. With Him tossing His hair the  
celestial chariots crowding in the sky slipped from their places, the earth  
shook under the heavy weight of His feet, His intolerable force moved the  
mountains and hills and His effulgence outshone everything else in all  
directions of the sky.   
*Hiranyakas'ipu and his brother Hiranyaksha (killed by the Boar Avatar),were actually two doorkeepers of Vaikunta. They were cursed by the great brahmin Sages four Kumaras to become demons,because they would not let them enter the Vaikunta. Hiranyakas'ipu by the power of great dedication and severe penances got the boon from the Lord not die because of any of the living being created by Lord,Neither at home nor outside, neither during the day nor at night, neither from any known weapon nor by any other thing, neither on the ground or in the sky nor by any human being or animal,Neither lifeless things nor living entities, neither demigod or demon nor the great serpents,to have the supremacy in battle and the rule over all embodied souls including the deities of all planets). In the past,Hiranyakas'ipu many times tried to kill his son Prahlada,because of his great devotion,but did not succeed.   
-When two door-keepers and great Devotees Jaya and Vijaya,who later became two great Asuras,were cursed by the Sages,the Lord said:  **' These two will soon elsewhere take birth from a godless womb. With their  
focus of mind intensified by anger, they will remain firmly united with Me and  
before long return to My presence. Know that your curse was ordained by Me  
alone, oh learned ones.'**)

_cont...   
Thereafter sitting in the assembly hall on the highest seat of man with a most  
fearsome, terrible countenance, there was no one to challenge Him nor anyone  
to worship Him. But upon hearing how he, the Daitya who was the headache of  
the three worlds, in the battle had been killed by the Lord, there were  
exclamations of joy, blossoming faces and endless showers of flowers from the  
wives of the demigods. At that time there was an overcast formed by all the  
celestial chariots of the demigods desirous to attend. Drums and kettle drums  
were sounded and the greatest singers and angels of heaven sang and danced.  
All the godly ones, Brahma, Indra and Shiva, the sages, the ancestors, the  
perfected ones, the scientific experts and the great serpents assembled there.  
The founding fathers, the leaders of mankind, the residents of heaven and the  
best of the angels arrived there too, as did the venerable ones, the keepers  
of the wealth and the monkey-like, oh my best one. Also the goblins came, the  
ones of superpower and they who were Vishnu's personal associates like Sunanda  
and Kumuda. With their hands folded before their heads to offer their  
obeisance each of them approached Him who had appeared as half a man, half a  
lion and now sat there on the throne displaying His effulgence.   
Lord Brahma said: 'I bow down before You, oh Inscrutable One of unlimited  
powers. You with all Your might and prowess and the purity of Your actions  
stand for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. While You  
in Your divine game play with the modes, You never change Yourself,and stand  
above this creation.'   
Lord Shiva said: 'The end of the yuga is the time suitable for You to kill in  
anger this insignificant demon; just protect his son, this bhakta of surrender  
next to You, oh caretaker of the devotees.'   
Sri Indra said: 'Our share of the sacrifices was secured by Your Lordship  
protecting us, oh Supreme One. We have no words to describe how afflicted our  
lotus-like hearts were by the Daitya, our hearts that are really Your  
residence. Alas, oh Lord, how insignificant is our world in the grip of Time,  
but for the sake of the devoted ones in Your service You have shed Your light  
so that they may find liberation from their bondage. What else but considering  
the visible world as unimportant would constitute their way oh Nrisimha?'   
The Rishis said: 'You are the shining example who taught us our austerity. By  
this power of Yours this world, oh Original Lord, is created, maintained and  
reabsorbed. That penance was stolen by this unwise soul but is now, oh Shelter  
of the Needy, restored by the protection of Your embodiment.'   
The ancestors [the Pitris] said: 'The demon who engaging with force enjoyed  
our s'raddha sacrifices that were offered by our sons and grandsons, he who  
even at the holy bathing places drank from our offerings of sesame water, by  
piercing the intestines of his belly with the nails of Your hand these  
offerings have reached their proper destination. He, the maintainer of the  
universal principles of religion who appeared as a man-lion, Him we offer our  
obeisances.   
The ones of perfection [the Siddhas] said: 'This most uncivilized and  
dishonest person who stole away the joy of our perfection in yoga and with the  
power of his mysticism and penance was so proud of his wealth, has been torn  
apart by Your nails. We bow down before You, oh Nrisimha.'   
The scientific experts [the Vidyadharas] said: 'Our forms of knowledge that  
each are attained by a different way of concentrating, were pushed aside by  
this fool puffed up about his strength and prowess. He who in battle killed  
him like he was an animal, to Him who appeared as Nrisimha, we surrendered  
souls are ever obliged.'   
The snake people [the Nagas] said: 'By piercing the chest of that greatest of  
all sinners who seized our jewels and beautiful women, You have done our wives  
a great favor. Let us offer You our obeisances.'   
The original fathers [the Manus] said: 'We, the Manus are Your authorities but  
were disrespected by this son of Diti who broke with the moral ties for the  
establishment, oh Lord. With You having killed this villain, oh Master, please  
tell us what we, Your eternal servants, can do for You.'   
The founding fathers [the Prajapatis] said: 'We, the creators of the  
generations owe our lives to You, oh Supreme Controller and not to him who  
denied the living beings that we have put on this world a life. And now, by  
assuming the form of an incarnation of Your pure goodness, You for the well-  
being of the world have split open the chest of him who lies slain.'   
The musicians of heaven [the Gandharvas] said: 'We, oh Lord are Your dancers  
and singers, Your performers, who were brought under the control of the power  
and strength of the one here who You reduced to this condition. Can anyone on  
the path of evil find happiness?'   
The venerable souls [the Caranas] said: 'Oh Lord, Your lotus feet liberate  
from the need to start a new life. We duly seek shelter there because You have  
put an end to this Asura, this snake in the heart of all virtuous people.'   
The keepers of the wealth [the Yakshas] said: 'We, serving You to Your  
pleasure belong to Your best followers. This son of Diti forced us to carry  
his palanquin but caused the sorrow of each and everyone. Thus we acknowledge  
You oh Lord Nrisimha, for You are the one who put him to death, oh twenty-  
fifth principle.'   
The monkey-like beings [the Kimpurushas] said: 'We are questionable humans,  
Kimpurushas but You are the Supreme Lord. And this bad person has been slain  
by You after having been condemned by the saintly ones.'   
The king's bards [the Vaitalikas] said: 'We in great gatherings and arenas of  
sacrifice singing the glories of Your spotless reputation have achieved the  
greatest position of respect. This crooked character who subdued us oh Supreme  
Lord, has to our great fortune been killed by You, like he was a disease.'   
The lower gods [the Kinnaras, those with a human head and an animal body,  
singers of heaven] said: 'Oh Lord, we the Kinnaras are Your faithful servants.  
Because of that son of Diti we had to perform in forced labor, but the sinner  
was by You destroyed, oh Nrisimhadeva, oh Master. Please be there as our  
happiness and welfare.'   
The associates of Lord Vishnu said: 'Today we have seen You in a wondrous  
human-like form. You are our shelter and the happiness of all the worlds. This  
servant of the state, oh Lord, was cursed by the scholars and has therefore  
been killed. We consider that to be Your special grace.'   
Narada Muni said [to Yudhishthhira]: 'None could step forward, not even Lord  
Brahma or Lord Shiva, because He, boiling with anger, was most difficult to  
approach. The Goddess of Fortune personally by the demigods being urged to do  
so could, after seeing Him so huge and wonderful as no one had ever seen or  
heard before, not move in His direction because she was very afraid. Then Lord  
Brahma prompted Prahlada who stood close by: 'My dear son, can you please  
approach the Lord and propitiate Him? He is very angry because of what your  
father did.'   
'Surely' he said and even though he was only a small boy oh King, the great  
devotee slowly, step by step, approached Him and prostrated himself with  
folded hands offering prayers. The godhead was by him, such a little boy  
fallen at His lotus feet, greatly moved and filled with mercy He raised His  
lotus hand, placed it on his head and dispelled the fear for the snake of time  
from all minds present there. Because of that touch he was cleansed from all  
evil. And immediately in this association with the Supreme Soul, with His  
lotus feet, his heart melted being captured in bliss. With Him in his heart  
tears welled in his eyes and symptoms of ecstasy manifested all over his  
body.'

**_The purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam and many Avatars of the Lord Krishna_**  
 _Suta said: "In the beginning the Supreme Lord assumed, for the creation of  
the worlds, the form of the Original Person[Purusha],the cosmic intelligence  
and such,and created the sixteen primary principles [of the ten knowing and  
working senses, the mind and the five elements]. Resting in His meditative  
slumber in that water, out of the lotus that spread from the lake of His  
navel, Brahma was manifested, the master of the progenitors in the universe.  
One supposes the different worlds to be an expansions and the part of the form  
of the Fortunate One that constitutes the excellence of the purest existence.  
In a perfect spiritual vision His form is seen as having numerous legs,  
thighs, arms and faces, with wonderful heads, ears, eyes and noses, all  
glowing with countless garlands, earrings and dresses. This source of the  
numerous incarnations is the imperishable seed from which the plenary portions  
originate as also the portions thereof, such as the gods, the human beings and  
the animals."   
"The first Divinity created were the sons of Brahma,the Kumaras, who performed  
the most difficult discipline of continuous celibacy so they could realize the  
Absolute (Brahman). The Supreme Enjoyer secondly assumed the form of a Boar  
for the welfare of the earth that had sunken to the lowest regions and lifted  
her up from the ocean. Thirdly He accepted His presence among the seers in the  
form of Narada Muni for the sake of evolving the Vedic knowledge of Bhakti  
Yoga free from material motives. Fourth born as the twin sons of Murti, the  
wife of king Dharma, in the form of Nara-Narayaṇa subjected Himself to severe  
penances to attain control over the senses. Fifth He, carrying the name of  
Kapila, gave an exposition to the brahmin Asuri on the nature of metaphysics  
and the elements of creation, because in the course of time that knowledge had  
been lost. Sixth as the son of Atri,named Dattatreya, being born from Anasusa  
who prayed for Him, He lectured to Alarka, Prahlada and others about  
transcendence. Seventh being born from Akuti as Yajna, the son of Prajapati  
Ruci, He together with His son Yama and other demigods, ruled during the  
period of Svayambhuva Manu. Eighth, from the wife of King Nabhi, Merudev?, the  
Almighty Lord took birth as King Rishabha and showed the path of perfection  
respected by people of all stages of life. His ninth incarnation He accepted  
in response to the prayers of the sages, whereupon He as Prithu ruled the  
earth for the sake of collecting her produces, which made her most attractive.  
Assuming the form of a fish Matsya, He after the period of Cakshusha Manu  
protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him in a boat afloat the waters when the  
world was deeply inundated. Eleventh the mighty Lord in the form of a tortoise  
Kurma sustained the Mandaracala Hill of the theists and atheists that served  
as a pivot in the ocean. Twelfth He appeared as Dhanvantari,Lord of medicine,  
and thirteenth He appeared before the atheists as an alluring beautiful woman  
Mohini and gave nectar to the demigods. In His fourteenth incarnation He, half  
as a lion, appeared as Nrisimha, who with His nails on His lap tore apart the  
king of the atheists like a carpenter splitting cane. Fifteenth He assumed the  
form of Vamana who went to the arena of sacrifice of Maharaja Bali to beg for  
only three steps of land, concealing His wish to regain the three worlds. In  
His sixteenth incarnation He as Bhrigupati or Paras'urama saw that the ruling  
class was hostile towards the brahmins and acted twenty-one times against  
them. Seeing that the common people were less intelligent He, seventeenth,  
incarnated as Vyasa taking birth from Satyavati with Paras'ara Muni as His  
father, for the purpose of dividing the Vedas into several branches. Next He  
performed in a superhuman way having assumed the form of a divine human being  
Rama, by controlling the Indian Ocean and such, so that He could act for the  
sake of the godly souls. Nineteenth as also twentieth Bhagavan took birth in  
the Vrishni family as Balarama and Krishna and thus removed the burden from  
the world. Thereafter at the beginning of the Age of Kali He shall appear as  
the son of mother Anjana with the name Buddha for the purpose of deluding the  
ones envious of the theists. Next, at the conjunction of two yugas, when there  
is hardly a ruler to be found who is not a plunderer, the Lord of the Creation  
carrying the name of Kalki will take birth from the ones(or place) famous  
by(with) Vishnu "   
"Dear brahmins, the incarnations of the Lord who appeared from the ocean of  
goodness are as innumerable as the thousands of streams we have from  
inexhaustible sources of water. All the powerful sages, the godly souls, the  
Manus and their progeny as also the Prajapatis [the founding fathers] are  
aspects of the Lord. They are all part of Krishna, the Bhagavan in person who  
offers protection during all ages and in all worlds against disturbances  
because of the enemies of the king of heaven.   
Anyone who in the morning and the evening carefully recites these mysterious  
births of the Lord, will find relief from all miseries of life. All these  
forms of the Lord that by the qualities of the material energy were created  
with the cosmic intelligence and other elements, originated from His Self-  
awareness that is without a form. The less intelligent observer perceives them  
the way one sees clouds in the sky or dust in the air. This unmanifested Self  
is the beyond,cannot be seen or heard and has no form,but the jiva(individual  
soul) affected by the modes of nature takes birth repeatedly. As soon as one  
by self-knowledge arrives at the rejection of all these gross and subtle forms  
that impose themselves on the soul because of ignorance, one arrives at the  
realization of the Absolute Truth. With the illusory energy subsided and  
mindfulness one is endowed with the full knowledge of enlightenment and  
becomes situated in one's own glory. This is how the learned describe  
activities and the births of the actually Unborn and non-engaged Lord of the  
Heart; this is the hidden meaning of the Vedas. Residing within every living  
being He is the omnipotent master and witness of the six qualities and  
opulences, whose play is spotless, who is independent and not affected by  
creation, destruction and maintenance. Because of His expert manipulations His  
activities, names and forms cannot be understood by the speculations and  
speeches of those with a poor fund of knowledge, just like fools cannot  
understand an actor's performance. Only he who renders unconditional,  
uninterrupted, favorable service to His fragrant lotus feet may know the  
transcendental glories of the all-powerful Creator with the wheel of the  
chariot in His hand. When one in this world becomes aware of the Vasudeva who  
embraces all His universes as their Lord and goes into ecstasy because of it,  
one will never again have to experience there the dreadful repetition of  
births."   
"This book called the Bhagavatam about the activities of the One Hailed in the  
Verses,that as a supplement to the Vedas [a Purana] was compiled by the seer  
of God Vyasadeva, is there for the ultimate good of bringing success,  
happiness and perfection to all people. This story, that as the cream from all  
the Vedic literatures and histories was extracted by Vyasa, he delivered to  
his son who is the most respectable one among the self-realized souls. He  
[S'uka] in his turn told it to emperor Parikchit* who, surrounded by the  
greatest sages, sat down at the Ganges to fast until his death. Now that  
Krishna has left for His abode and with Him also proper conduct and spiritual  
insight have vanished, this Purana bright as the sun has appeared at the  
horizon for the sake of everyone who in the Age of Quarrel has lost his  
vision. Oh brahmins, when the story was recited there by that powerful great  
sage, I, being perfectly attentive by his mercy, also managed to understand  
it, so that I will now relate it to you also, exactly as I learned it free  
from deviations by my own mind."   
*Parikchit was the grandson of Arjuna. Son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The emperor who as a child in the womb was protected by Krishna for the continuation of the Yadu dynasty. The first vedic sovereign who laid out the norms for Kali yuga and was cursed by the son of a brahmana to die in seven days. Because of curse,and so He can be able to attain perfection in seven days,was recited the Srimad Bhagavata by Suka, the son of Vyasa, the original author of the book about the Lord and His devotees.

**_The Birth of Emperor Parikchit_**  
 _S 'aunaka said: "The embryo in the womb of Uttara, that was tormented by the  
enormous heat of the invincible weapon released by As'vatthama, was by the  
Lord again awarded a life. How did the birth take place of Emperor Parikchit  
who was so highly intelligent and what where the activities of this great  
soul? How exactly did his demise take place and what destination did he  
achieve? If you think you can tell us this that we, so very faithful, all want  
to hear, please speak to us then about the transcendental knowledge that was  
delivered by S'uka."   
Suta said: "King Yudhishthhira brought prosperity to everyone during his  
reign, the way his father did, by continuous service of Krishna's feet without  
any ulterior motive for material gain or sensual pleasure. The fame of his  
wealth, sacrifices, what he stood for, his queens, his brothers and his  
sovereignty over the planet earth where we are living, even spread to the  
heavenly worlds. But, just as only food may satisfy a hungry man and nothing  
else, he, in his hunger as someone aware of the Redeemer, Mukunda, oh  
brahmins, was not moved by all those earthly desirables that are aspired by  
even the God-fearing souls.   
At the time Parikchit,the great fighter, as a child in his mother's womb, was  
suffering from the heat of the brahmastra weapon, oh son of Bhrigu, he could  
observe the Purusha in a shining appearance. In the blaze he saw at the size  
of not more than a thumb the transcendental, infallible Lord beautiful with a  
dark skin, a golden helmet and lightening clothes. With the riches of His four  
arms, earrings of the purest gold, bloodshot eyes and a club in His hands, He  
was moving about, constantly whirling the club around like it was a torch. As  
He was vanquishing the radiation of the brahmastra like the sun evaporating  
dew drops, He was observed by the child who wondered who He was. He saw how  
the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Lord and protector of righteousness,  
took away the glare. Next the Lord who stretches in all directions all of a  
sudden disappeared from his sight. Thereupon, when the good signs of a  
favorable position of the stars gradually evolved, he took birth, who would  
prove himself to be of a prowess equal to that of Pandu. King Yudhishthhira  
being fully satisfied had priests like Dhaumya and Kripa perform the birth  
ritual with the recitation of auspicious hymns. Knowing where, when and how,  
he in charity rewarded to the occasion of that birth the brahmins with good  
food and gifts of gold, cows, land, housing, elephants and horses. The  
brahmins happily addressed the king, the chief of the Purus, communicating  
that they felt most obliged to the line of the descendants of their ancestor  
King Puru.   
They said: 'This son has been given to you by the all-pervasive and all-  
powerful Lord to show you His mercy in countering his destruction by the  
irresistible, supernatural weapon. Therefore he shall be known all over the  
world as Vishnu-rata, 'Given by Vishnu'. He will no doubt be a most fortunate,  
supreme devotee endowed with all good qualities.'   
The good king said: 'Oh best of the truthful, will he follow in the footsteps  
of all the great souls of this family of saintly kings? Will he be just as  
meritorious and glorious in his achievements?'   
The brahmins answered: 'Oh son of Pritha [Kunti], he will be the maintainer of  
all living entities, exactly like King Ikshvaku, the son of Manu, and he will  
be faithful to his promises and be of respect for the brahmins, just like  
Rama, the son of Das'aratha. He will be as charitable as King S'ibi of  
Us'inara and protect the ones of surrender, and will, just like Bharata, the  
son of Dushyanta who performed many sacrifices, spread the name and fame of  
his family. Among the archers he will be as good as the two Arjunas [his  
grandfather and the king of Haihaya], he will be as irresistible as fire and  
as unsurpassable as the ocean. As powerful as a lion and as worthy for taking  
shelter as the Himalayas, he will be as forbearing as the earth and as  
tolerant as his parents. With a spirit as good as that of the original father  
Brahma, he will be as generous and equanimous as Lord Shiva and be the refuge  
of all living beings as good as the Supreme Lord who is the refuge of the  
Goddess of fortune. Following in the footsteps of Krishna he will be the  
majesty of all divine virtues, he will have the greatness of King Rantideva  
and be as pious as Yayati. Being as patient as Bali Maharaja this child will  
be as devoted as Prahlada was unto Krishna, he will perform many As'vamedha  
sacrifices and be faithful to the elderly and experienced souls. He will  
father a line of saintly kings, will chastise the upstarts and, as a source of  
righteousness in the world, crush the quarrelsome. After being informed about  
his personal death, as caused by a snakebird that was sent by the son of a  
brahmin, he will free himself from his attachments and take to the shelter in  
the Lord. Having inquired about the proper self-knowledge from the son of  
sage Vyasa, oh King, he will abandon his material life on the bank of the  
river Ganges and attain the state of fearlessness. Constantly keeping Lord in  
mind whom he had seen before his birth, He would acquire fame in this world by  
constant investigation. Just like the waxing moon day by day soon becomes  
full, the royal prince under the care of his protective parents day by day  
grew to become soon the one he would be.'   
The brahmins learned in matters of astrology and birth ceremonies, thus having  
informed the king, were generously rewarded and then all returned to their  
homes.   
King Yudhishthhira, desiring to perform a horse sacrifice to be freed from the  
burden of having fought his kinsmen, thought about acquiring funds because all  
he received stemmed from collecting taxes and fines. In respect of his mindful  
wishes, his brothers on the advise of the Lord Krishna went north to collect  
sufficient riches. With the result of those collected riches Yudhishthhira,  
the anxious, pious king, managed to conduct three sacrifices, by means of  
which he worshiped Lord Hari perfectly. The Supreme Lord being invited by the  
king, had the brahmins perform the sacrifices for him and then stayed a few  
months longer to satisfy the desires of His friends. Then, dear brahmins,Lord  
Krishna, with the permission of the king, Draupadi and His relatives,went back  
to Dvaraka, accompanied by Arjuna and other members of the Yadu dynasty."

_**Prithu Maharaja 's Meeting with the Four Kumaras**_  
 _Maitreya said: 'While the citizens were thus praying to the high and mighty King Prithu, four  
sages arrived there as bright as the sun. The king and his associates could  
recognize the masters of yogic perfection,the four Kumaras,by the glaring  
effulgence of their all-embracing sinlessness, who descended from the ethereal  
realm. Seeing the so very desired life of peace before them, King Prithu and  
his followers jumped to their feet as if they were souls whose senses are  
ruled by the modes of nature. After they had accepted that reverence and had  
taken their seats, he humbly,being aware of their full glory, bowed before  
them and was of worship the way it is prescribed, with everything belonging  
to it. The water of washing their feet he sprinkled on the tuft of his hair  
and thus he behaved like men of respect are supposed to behave. Seated on the  
golden throne the older brothers of Bhava looked like the fire on an altar.  
Pleased with them, the king respectfully and with restraint addressed them.  
Prithu said: 'To what do we owe the grace of your audience, of you who are  
fortune personified? It is an encounter difficult to achieve for even the  
greatest yogis. He with whom the learned are pleased, can achieve whatever is  
difficult to achieve in this world or in the hereafter, including the favor of  
the all-auspicious Lord S'iva and Lord Vishnu. Even though you travel around  
in all the worlds, the people cannot see you, just as they cannot see the  
All-knowing witness present within everyone. A person who is not very rich and  
is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly persons are  
present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the  
exalted visitors water, a sitting place and great reception are glorified, and  
that very home itself is also glorified. But, those houses that, abundant with  
all wealth, are not blessed with the water that washed the feet of the great  
saints, are no doubt like a tree with venomous serpents. I welcome you, oh  
best of the twice-born souls, you who move around like children and,  
controlled by vows, with great faith are motivated for liberation. Oh masters,  
can persons who, having fallen into this material existence, are stricken with  
the illness of living to the command of their senses, all by themselves find  
any good fortune? There is no need to ask you about your well-being, for you,  
supreme souls, are not at all concerned with matters of good or bad fortune.  
I am therefore certain that you for us, who suffer the pains of a material  
existence, are the friends to ask how one in this world soon may find  
salvation. Manifesting as the supreme goal in life of the seekers after  
Truth, the Supreme Lord, the Unborn One, in the form of perfected souls like  
you, moves about on this earth in order to show His devotees His mercy.'   
Maitreya said: 'Hearing that most substantial, appropriate and sweet  
conclusion of Prithu, the Kumara satisfied with a smile replied as follows.  
Sanat-kumara said: 'What a good question for you to ask, my dear King, oh you who desires the  
good of all living beings. Learned as you are, you nevertheless pose this  
question. This speaks for you as someone of wisdom of the saint. An  
association of devotees in which there is discussion, questioning and  
answering, is appreciated by both the parties [of speakers and listeners], and  
real happiness for all will expand from it. Oh King, you are evidently  
attached to the praises of the Lord's lotus feet. Difficult as it is, that,  
given a steady practice, will free the indwelling soul from the dirt of lusty  
feelings. In the scriptures is defended that only the absence of attachment to  
other matters than the soul, in combination with an intense attachment to the  
True Self transcendental to the modes of nature, constitutes the perfect  
conviction for the salvation of man. That is realized when one as a dutiful  
devotee with faith and devotion, by means of discussion, inquiry,and  
determination,with respect for the Lord of Yoga regularly attends and listens  
to the stories of the God-fearing souls. Reluctant to associate with the  
company of those who hanker after money, sense gratification and the acquiring  
of goods,one should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace  
without drinking the nectar of the glorification of Hari. With nonviolence,  
following the footsteps of the Guru, by remembering the Lord of Liberation, by  
testifying of His activities, by the following yoga principles without a  
material motive and by practicing in line with the precepts one, thus being  
without offenses, should live a simple life tolerating worldly dualities. When  
someone always listens about transcendental qualities of the Lord, it may be  
so that one's devotion and Truth consciousness grows,and he easily becomes  
attached to the Brahman. When the person in respect of the Guru, by the force  
of detachment and jnana,completely surrenders to the Supreme, the covering  
within the heart that consists of the five elements will be burned like fuel  
being burned by fire. After one is freed from inner weakness and dominance of  
the material qualities, there is no longer a difference, as there was in the  
past, between the inner and the outer,and this difference being a dream is  
finished. For such a soul that difference has ended, just like a dream ends  
when one wakes up. The one becomes aware how desire bounds the Soul, but there  
is no more division and separation,and he sees himself beyond,as the Witness.  
Because the ruminating mind is agitated by the senses that are drawn towards  
the sense objects, the pure consciousness is easily lost, just like a lake  
easily can be overgrown by plants. Wise ones state that when remembrance is  
lost, all knowledge acquired is based on a false foundation. The constant  
mindfulness of one's consciousness is destroyed and real knowledge is lost.  
There is no stronger obstruction to one's self-interest than thinking other  
matters to be more pleasing than one's self-realization. When one constantly  
thinks of riches and sensual pleasures, all the virtues of human society are  
destroyed. For that reason bereft of knowledge and devotion, one then lapses  
into the inertia [the ignorance]. They who want to cross over that ocean of  
ignorance quickly, should never cling to the slowness of matter(tamas), for  
that is the great stumbling block,as even the virtues of religiousness,  
economic development and sense gratification [dharma, artha, kama]. In this  
respect liberation is likely to be the most important virtue, because being  
engaged in the interest of the other three paths, one regularly finds oneself  
caught in the grip of death and in fear. Following these three notions of a  
higher or lower form of life, one will never find any security, since they,  
depending on the interaction of the material modes, are all destroyed by the  
ordinance of the Lord [in the form of Time]. Oh best of kings, be therefore,  
just as I am, convinced of Him, the Supreme Lord who from within the heart  
everywhere manifests as the Master of the Field. Therein radiating into every  
hair follicle, He is there for the self-realization, for all the moving and  
not moving living beings covered by a body endowed with senses and a life-  
breath. Surrender to Him, the root cause manifesting as the truth within the  
untruth. By this deliberate consideration one is freed from the illusions and  
from the mistake taking the rope as a snake. One is then situated in the pure  
truth, the truth of the original nature transcendental to all the impurities  
of one's karmic activities. Be devoted to Vasudeva. For the devotees who find  
Him by devotion, the One whose lotus toes bring joy, the hard knot of karmic  
desire is uprooted, but that is never so with people missing that respect,  
however hard they try to stop the waves of sense enjoyment. Great is the  
hardship of the ones immersed in material life,which is like an ocean filled  
with the sharks of the six senses. Being unhappy it is very difficult to cross  
that ocean full of misfortune, that danger of separate existence, and  
therefore you should make the worshipable lotus feet of the Supreme Lord your  
boat.'

**__Liberation from ignorance**  
 _The Lord Kapila said: 'Even though abides in a material body, the Soul is not affected by the basic  
qualities of matter because he does not claim doership and thus is not subject  
to change, just like the sun is not affected by being reflected in water. But  
when this very Soul is affected with the modes of material nature it becomes  
bewildered by the ego sense and thinks: 'I am the doer'. Dealing with material  
nature in such a way,the wrong actions are the result,and he in discontent,  
helplessly undergoes the repeated birth and death,in births from different  
wombs or species depending on the good or bad life he led or a combination of  
these. Like having landed in a nightmare wherein the things happening do not  
really exist, there is for the Soul, who only thinks and sees what occurs to  
his senses, no end to his materially conditioned existence and illusion.  
Therefore the mind of attachment to material pleasure must, free from  
attachment, gradually be brought under control with the bhakti. Beginning with  
yama [meaning the great vow of yoga of nonviolence, truth, non-stealing,  
celibacy and non-possessiveness in the discipline of detachment], one should  
practice the different forms of yoga and develop, endowed with faith,  
unalloyed devotion unto Me by listening my stories,reading and reflecting on  
the teachings of the Truth. Therein one must be without enmity and regard all  
living beings as equal, not entertain intimate relations and be celibate, be  
free from chatter and offer the results of one's labor. One should be  
satisfied with whatever comes of its own, eat little and live thoughtfully in  
a secluded place and be peaceful, kind, compassionate and self-realized. In  
relating to others and to one's body one should not follow the physical  
concept of life but rather, from the spiritual perspective attend to the  
factual truth of both the material and the personal aspect. One should  
transcend the stages of consciousness [of waking, dreaming and deep sleep] and  
stay away from other conceptions of life. Thus, with a purified intellect, the  
true Self, the Soul within, should be seen as clear as the sun before one's  
eyes. A liberated soul realizes the Truth, which is beyond and which is  
manifest as a reflection in the false ego. He is the support of the material  
cause and He enters into everything. He is Absolute, one without a second, and  
He is the eye of the illusory energy. It is like with the sun that can be seen  
as a reflection on water or on a wall, but factually is situated in the sky.  
The Truth is reflected in the threefold nature of the materially identified  
ego that consists of body, senses and mind. Someone who in this material world  
wrongly identifies with the material elements, the objects of enjoyment, the  
material senses, the mind, intelligence and so on, is actually in deep sleep,  
but once he is awakened he is freed from false ego and illusion. Even though  
not being lost, still the Soul unjustly considers himself lost. But through  
the path of yoga,established in Jnana,he sees himself as a witness,not  
affected with material nature,and with it, he sees also unreality of the ego.  
Coming to understand this,he realizes his true Self,Atma, his original  
individuality [svarupa].'   
Devahuti said: 'Dear brahmin, is it not so that material nature never releases  
the soul because the two are eternally attracted to each other, oh Best One?  
Just as aroma and earth have no separate existence and taste does not exist  
apart from water, intelligence cannot exist independent of consciousness.  
Then how can a soul be free from material nature? Is the soul, being a passive  
observer, not forced to act because of the basic qualities of matter? The  
great fear, one may avoid by contemplating the fundamental principles, will  
not cease because every time its cause appears again.'   
The Bhagavan said: 'One will realize the freedom, when one, with a pure mind serious unto Me and  
faithfully contemplates on the Truth with devotion, manages to perform one's  
duties without desiring the fruits thereof. By means of Jnana, with the vision  
of the Absolute Truth, by penance,with renunciation, detached and firmly fixed  
in that same Truth, one becomes absorbed in the Self. Bound to material nature  
he is day after day consumed, like firewood by fire, disappearing gradually.  
But experiencing his dependency, understanding the futility of the desire to  
always enjoy, he, thus forsaking sensual pleasures, firmly stands in his own  
glory. The many inauspicious matters a person may dream of in his sleep, will  
not in the least daunt him when he has awakened. Someone, who has fixed his  
mind upon Me, the knower of the Absolute Truth within, thus has nothing to  
fear from material nature. When someone wise thus for many years and many  
births is engaged in self-realization, he will develop a distaste for enjoying  
whatever, even the heaven of the creator. Someone devoted to Me who under My  
protection for the sake of awakening his intelligence, by My unlimited mercy  
goes for the ultimate goal of his existence that is called kaivalya  
[enlightenment, emancipation, beatitude], will in this life soon attain a  
steady self-awareness and be free from doubt. The yogi who departed for that  
heavenly abode will, after leaving behind both the subtle and the gross body,  
never return. When the attention of the perfected yogi is not drawn towards  
yogic powers to control the material illusion, my dear mother, then, having no  
other purpose in his life, his progress towards Me will be unbounded, because  
the power of death is lost therein.'

**_Explanation of Bhakti Yoga by Lord Kapila   
_**  
 _Devah?ti said: "Please elaborate now at length on the path of bhakti yoga  
that one calls the ultimate purpose."   
Maitreya said: 'Appreciating the words of His mother, oh best of the Kurus,  
the great and gentle sage, contented and being moved by compassion, said the  
following. The Bhagavan said: 'O noble lady, there are many paths and ways of bhakti yoga,depending on  
natural disposition and temperaments of seekers. What one does out of love for  
Me in a spirit of violence, pride and envy or out of anger with a fractional  
view,is considered to be in the mode of darkness(tamas). He who worships Me  
with idols and aims at material things, fame and opulence, is in the mode of  
passion (rajas). Someone who worships Me with offering the results of his  
actions or when he for the sake of transcendence desires to be free from karma  
[profit-minded action],that bhakti is said to be in the mode of goodness  
(sattva). In case of an uninterrupted thinking of Me who is present in  
everyone's heart - just like the water of the Ganges that continuously flows  
towards the ocean - and when one wishes to hear about My qualities only,  
having no ulterior motives, one may speak of pure devotion, of bhakti unto the  
Supreme One. Pure devotees will not accept it - not even when being offered  
these - to be equal with Me, to have the same opulence, to be a personal  
associate, to have the same bodily features or to be joined in oneness,but  
only to be in My service. When one by means of this bhakti yoga - which one  
calls the highest aim - succeeds in dealing with the three modes of nature the  
way I explained it, one attains My transcendental nature. When one performs  
one's duties without attachment to the results one is stronger, and when one  
without unnecessary violence regularly and with dedication practice this yoga,  
one will find happiness. The same as someone worships My statue,by seeing it,  
offering respect to it,by offering obeisances, praise and worship,he should  
,in the spirit of detachment and in the mode of goodness, think of Me and see  
Me being present in all living beings. By means of sense control and proper  
regulation [yama and niyama], being of the greatest respect for the great  
souls, being compassionate with the poor and by being friendly in association  
with like-minded souls; by hearing about spiritual matters, chanting My holy  
names, being straightforward, by association with civilized people and not  
entertaining false ego, the consciousness of a person who with these qualities  
is dutiful towards Me is completely purified. No doubt he by simply hearing  
about My excellence will directly reach Me. The way the sense of smell catches  
the aroma that is carried from its source by means of the air, similarly  
consciousness by means of yoga catches the Supreme Soul who is free from  
change.   
When one who worships the deity but has no respect for Me who, in the form of  
the All pervading Soul, is always situated in every living being,this is  
nothing but a hypocrisy. Someone who in worship of the deity has no regard for  
Me as the Supreme Ruler present in all beings, is in his ignorance only  
offering oblations into the ashes. He who offers Me his respects but is  
envious, lives in his campaigning against others and in enmity, will never  
find peace of mind. Oh sinless one, I am certainly not pleased when they who  
manage to worship Me in My deity form, are not of respect for other living  
beings. Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the  
Ishvara until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of  
other living beings as well. For those who discriminate with regard to the  
body of themselves and that of others, for those who make distinction between  
them and others,as the blazing fire of death, I will cause great fear. One  
should therefore, with charity, respect and in friendship regarding everyone  
as an equal, propitiate Me, the One True Self abiding in all.   
Living entities are better developed than inanimate objects, better than  
entities with life symptoms, oh blessed one, are entities with a developed  
consciousness and better than those are they who developed sense perception.  
Among them, those who developed taste are better than those who only developed  
a sense of touch and better than they are those who developed a sense of  
smell. Even better are those creatures who developed the faculty to hear.  
Better than those are the ones distinguishing differences of form and those  
who have teeth in both their jaws are better than these. Those who have many  
legs are superior to them. Of them the four-legged creatures are the ones  
better developed,while the two-legged ones are even better. Among human  
beings a society with four classes is the better one and of those classes the  
brahmins are the best. Among the brahmins the better one is who knows the  
Vedas, but best of those are the Brahmins who know its purpose.   
The one who puts an end to all doubts is better than he who knows what the  
purpose of the Vedas is and the brahmin among them who performs his duty is  
better than him. He who is free from worldly attachment is still better and  
the one who performs his righteous duty not for himself alone is the best  
developed of them all.   
Therefore I know of no greater being than a person who with a dedicated mind  
has offered all of his actions, wealth and life without any reservation to Me  
and with persistence is of service without any other interest or motive,but  
only from the deep love. Such a one who regards the Supreme Lord, the  
Controller of the individual soul, as having entered all the living beings in  
the form of the Paramatma, is therefore mindfully of respect for his fellow  
creatures. Oh daughter of Manu, someone can attain the Original Person by  
following either of these two paths of bhakti and mystic yoga separately that  
I have described. This Bhagavan is the eternal form of the Brahman. He is  
Purusha,ethereal personality of the primal reality,He is transcendental,and  
all His activities are spiritual.   
Time, known as the divine cause of the different manifestations of the living  
entities, constitutes the reason why all living beings who consider themselves  
as existing in separation, from the greatest on, live in fear. He who from  
within first enters all the living entities, is the support of everyone and  
annihilates them again by means of other living beings, is named Vishnu, the  
enjoyer of all sacrifices. He is that time factor, the Master of all masters.  
There is no one specially favored by Him, nobody is his friend or enemy. He  
approaches those who are attentive and of those who are inattentive He is the  
destroyer.   
 He for whom the wind out of fear blows and this sun is shining, for whom out  
of fear Indra sends his rains and the heavenly bodies are shining; He because  
of whom out of fear the trees, creepers and herbs each in their own time bear  
flowers and produce their fruits; He afraid of whom the rivers flow and the  
oceans do not overflow, because of whom fire burns and the earth with her  
mountains does not submerge; He because of whom the sky provides air to those  
who breathe and under the control of whom the universe expands its body of the  
complete reality [mahat-tattva] with its seven layers, He for whom out of fear  
the gods of creation and more, in charge of the basic qualities of nature,  
within this world carry out their functions according to the yugas, He of whom  
afraid all the animate and inanimate beings find their control; that Infinite,  
final operator of beginningless Time is the Unchangeable Creator who creates  
people out of people and by means of death destroys even the Lord of death  
himself.'

**_Lord Kapila Describes the Adverse Consequences of Karma_**  
 _Lord Kapila said: 'Just like a mass of clouds has no knowledge of the power of the wind,in the  
same way a person has no knowledge of the great power of the Time, even though  
he is being conditioned by it. Whatever the goods one with difficulty acquired  
for one's happiness, they are destroyed by the Bhagavan, and for this reason  
he laments. In his ignorance he foolishly thinks that having a home, land and  
wealth for the sake of his body, would be something permanent. The living  
being will irrespective of the birth he acquired,in any species he finds  
himself,find satisfaction in this worldly existence. Even being in hell a  
person, who in fact is deluded by the divine Maya, does not wish to give up  
his hellish pleasures. With his body, spouse, children, home, animals, wealth  
and friendships deeply rooted in his heart, he considers himself a great  
success. Burning with anxiety about maintaining all the members of his dear  
family, he is always uncomfortable and sinful,acting like a fool. With his  
heart and senses charmed by the woman and by the display of the sweet words of  
his children, he is in the grip of the illusion,considering that which is non-  
permanent to be eternal. Engaged in the supposed duties of his family life -  
which cause him all kinds of trouble, he is busy countering these miseries  
while thinking that that will make him happy as a householder. Only enjoying  
little of it, he maintains his family by unjust means and the wealth that he  
with violence secured, but following that course he ultimately goes against  
himself. When he, despite his repeated efforts, fails in securing what he  
wished, he will, ruled by greed,desire the wealth enjoyed by others and thus  
get into trouble. No longer capable of maintaining his family the unfortunate  
wretch,being old and bereft of wealth and beauty, then with a bewildered  
intelligence full of grief laments over everything he tried in vain.   
Thus finding himself incapable of supporting his wife and children, he is not  
respected as he was before, the way an old ox is not respected by its farmer.  
Despite getting deformed of old age,and being maintained by the ones he once  
maintained, no aversion against a family life rises in him while he, at home  
awaits his death. Remaining there he, like a pet dog, eats what indifferently  
is placed before him, falls sick with indigestion and eats and does only  
little. In that diseased condition, one?s eyes bulge due to the pressure of  
air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty  
breathing, and upon exhaling and inhaling he produces strange sound, a  
rattling within the throat. Lying down surrounded by his lamenting friends and  
relatives he, with the noose of time around his neck, cannot respond to the  
things said to him. He, who was engrossed in maintaining his family and had no  
control over his senses, thus passes away in great pain, with his relatives in  
tears. Witnessing the arrival of the servants of death with their terrible  
eyes full of wrath, he, because of the fear in his heart, passes stool and  
urine. Like the king's soldiers they immobilize his body by binding him in  
ropes for his punishment, whereupon they drag him like a criminal forcefully  
by the neck over a long distance. Innerly broken by their threatening  
presence he, overtaken, trembles on the road and is bitten by dogs in the  
distress of remembering his sins. Afflicted by hunger, thirst and the heat of  
scorching forest fires and winds on hot and sandy roads, he feels how he  
painfully is beaten on his back with a whip, while he, unable to move, can  
find no refuge or water. Now and then he falls, gets tired and loses  
consciousness, and then again he reawakens on the road of his misery where he  
quickly is led before the eternal ruler of death Yamaraja. He sees his entire  
life passing by in a few moments and then receives the punishment he deserves.  
With his limbs covered by firewood he is cremated or sometimes he sees himself  
eating his own flesh. Vividly he then witnesses how dogs pull out his entrails  
at his last resting place where serpents, scorpions, gnats and so on pester  
him to his abhorrence. One by one his limbs are separated from his body by big  
and small animals who tear him apart, throw him from heights or drag him under  
water or into caves. Because of the unregulated sexual association one  
has,one must, whether one is a man or a woman,undergo the reaction in hellish  
states of anger,self-destruction and bewilderment.   
Actually, heaven and hell exist also in this world, oh mother, so they  
sometimes become visible and experienced here. He who thus in greed,  
attachment and infidelity maintained his family or lived for his stomach only,  
will upon leaving this world in his afterlife have to face the consequences  
for himself and his family. After quitting his body he will enter the darkness  
all alone and pay the price for the harm that he out of self-interest did to  
others in his envy of their fortune. By divine arrangement a man who sustained  
his family has to undergo the hellish reaction of his foul play and suffer  
like someone who lost all his wealth. When a person in his eagerness to care  
for his family is simply godless and unscrupulous in his actions, he heads for  
the darkest region of self-destruction. After he, beginning from the lowest  
position of an animal existence prior to a human birth, in due order has  
undergone all the reactions and so on, he, thus being purified, may again  
return here.'

**_Lord Nrisimha Slays the King of the Demons_**  
 _Narada Muni said to Yudhishthhira: 'Having heard explanations of the Truth  
from the Great Prahlada,all the attending Daitya sons (Prahlada's schoolmates)  
accepted his words because of their profundity and rejected what their  
teachers had taught them. When the two sons of the guru [S'ukracarya's sons  
Shanda and Amarka] realized how the intelligence of the boys had gotten fixed  
on this one subject matter, they fearfully contacted the king to submit to him  
what was going on.   
(- the king was Prahlada's father,the great Asura Hiranyakas'ipu. )   
All over his body trembling with anger and with a mind determined to kill his  
son he rebuked Prahlada. With the harshest words he furiously with an angry  
face and crooked, wicked eyes approached him who did not deserve such a  
treatment at all. He from his side gentle and restrained, with his hands  
folded just stood there before his father who was hissing like a vicious snake  
trampled upon.   
Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'Oh you impudent fool, you intriguer of the family, you  
outcaste, you obstinate one going against my rule, I will today send you to  
the abode of Yamaraja! When I am angry all inhabitants of the three worlds and  
their leaders tremble for me. By what power do you so fearlessly overstep my  
rule, you rascal?'.   
Prahlada said: 'He is not only my strength but also yours, oh King and the  
strength of all other exalted and lower living beings. All who move around and  
do not move around, beginning with Lord Brahma, fall under His control. He,  
the supreme controller, the time factor, is Urukrama, the Lord of the Wide  
Steps [Vamana] who is that one strength of one's mind and life, the steadiness  
of one's physical power and senses. He, the True Self, is the Supreme Master  
of the three modes who by His different natural forces creates, maintains and  
withdraws again the entire universe. Please give up the Asura way. Be peaceful  
and create no enemies. Destroy only the true enemy that is an uncontrolled  
mind. That approach is the best method to worship the unlimited Lord. In the  
past there were plunderers who not in control with the six enemies [the mind  
and the five senses] stole away everything. Others saw themselves as  
conquerors of the ten directions. But where are with a saint who managed to  
defeat his senses and is of an equal regard for all living beings, those  
enemies to be found who are a product of one's own imagination?'   
Sri Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'You apparently, with your unlimited pretenses, seek  
your own demise. You prove that people about to die talk gibberish, you  
pityful idiot. You unlucky soul, you talk of someone other than me who would  
be the controller of the universe, but where is He to be found? If He is  
omnipresent, then why do I not see Him in this pillar right in front of me?  
Let that Lord you wished yourself as your protector protect you, now that I am  
going to sever your head from your trunk, now that I am going to put an end to  
someone talking such nonsense like you.'   
Thus with a stream of abuses enraged chastising his son, that great devotee,  
Hiranyakas'ipu, rising from his throne and taking up his sword, with his fist  
struck hard against a column. At that very time from within the column a most  
fearful sound could be heard as if the covering of the universe cracked open.  
That sound dear King, reached as far as the place of the godly ones of Lord  
Brahma and made them believe that the destruction of their abodes was at hand.  
He who in his display of power wanted to kill his son, also heard the  
tumultuous sound one had never heard before and stood together with the  
assembly present amazed about the fact that one could not determine its  
origin. Thus all these men of power were caught in fear. To be true to the  
words that were spoken in defense of His omnipresence, of His pervading each  
and everything, one could see a most wonderful form of Him taking shape in a  
pillar in the middle of the assembly hall. It was neither an animal nor a man.  
The king, studying the phenomenon from all sides, saw how a living being  
emerged from the middle of the pillar. But not being able to ascertain whether  
it was an animal or a human being he said amazed: 'What kind of form is this?  
It is half man and half lion!'   
As he was contemplating the miracle that took place in front of him, the  
extraordinary, most frightening form of Nrisimhadeva appeared. He had eyes  
glowing like molten gold and deadly teeth in a face extending into manes.  
Looking around with a dreadful frown He waved His tongue like a razor sharp  
sword. His ears stood motionless straight up and His nostrils and mouth were  
opened wide like mountain caves. His huge body was short and fat with a broad  
neck and a broad chest over a small waist. His body was covered with whitish  
hairs resembling the rays of the moon and hundreds of arms stretched in all  
directions were equipped with hard to challenge fatal nails who served as  
weapons next to His other personal weapons. Faced with that excellence the  
Daityas and Danavas fled away. 'I guess this is what the Lord so full of  
mystical potency is trying to do in order to get me killed, but what's the  
use?' so Hiranyakas'ipu murmured to himself and taking up his mace the Daitya  
threw himself forward like an elephant to attack the loudly roaring Lord  
Nrisimha. As invisible as an insect that has fallen into a fire, the Asura  
disappeared into the effulgence of Nrisimha. That was something not that  
astonishing at all that moment considering the fact that He with the  
effulgence of His goodness formerly had swallowed the darkness of the entire  
creation. The greatest of the demons reaching Lord Nrisimha thereupon  
furiously with great force exercising his prowess struck Him with his club,  
but the Lord, the Wielder of the Club, seized him just like the son of Garuda  
would capture a great snake.Oh son of Bharata, when He in order to play a game  
allowed the Asura to slip from His hands exactly the way Garuda sometimes  
deals with a snake, the godly ones of the different worlds who were driven  
from their positions, from behind the clouds considered that to be a bad turn  
of events. The demon thinking that He had let him go out of fear for his  
masculine display, after regaining his strength took up his sword and shield  
and with great force attacked Nrisimhadeva for the second time. When he with  
his moon spotted shield and sword fast as a hawk was maneuvering up and down  
so as not to offer any opportunity, the Lord made a very shrill, loud sound of  
laughter that was so frightening that he, with his eyes shortly closed, was  
captured by the Greatest of all Speed. In protest he wrestling with his limbs  
tried to escape, but the Lord placed him whose skin could not even be cut by  
Indra's thunderbolt, at the entrance of the palace on His lap like he was a  
snake or mouse and pierced him with His nails as easy as Garuda pierces a  
poisonous viper. He with His most fearful eyes full of anger was difficult to  
behold. With His mouth wide open licking the edges with His tongue and with  
His mane and face smeared red with traces of blood, He wore the intestines  
like a garland around His neck and looked like a lion that just has killed an  
elephant. The heart He with His pointed nails had ripped out completely and  
thrown aside and the thousands of followers who with their raised weapons  
attended to their leader He all killed using His nails and the other weapons  
in His countless hands. Shaking His manes He scattered the clouds and with His  
glaring glance He outshone the luminaries. The waters and oceans struck by His  
breathing swirled in perturbation and afraid of His roar the elephants  
guarding the quarters of the universe cried. With Him tossing His hair the  
celestial chariots crowding in the sky slipped from their places, the earth  
shook under the heavy weight of His feet, His intolerable force moved the  
mountains and hills and His effulgence outshone everything else in all  
directions of the sky.   
*Hiranyakas'ipu and his brother Hiranyaksha (killed by the Boar Avatar),were actually two doorkeepers of Vaikunta. They were cursed by the great brahmin Sages four Kumaras to become demons,because they would not let them enter the Vaikunta. Hiranyakas'ipu by the power of great dedication and severe penances got the boon from the Lord not die because of any of the living being created by Lord,Neither at home nor outside, neither during the day nor at night, neither from any known weapon nor by any other thing, neither on the ground or in the sky nor by any human being or animal,Neither lifeless things nor living entities, neither demigod or demon nor the great serpents,to have the supremacy in battle and the rule over all embodied souls including the deities of all planets). In the past,Hiranyakas'ipu many times tried to kill his son Prahlada,because of his great devotion,but did not succeed.   
-When two door-keepers and great Devotees Jaya and Vijaya,who later became two great Asuras,were cursed by the Sages,the Lord said:  **' These two will soon elsewhere take birth from a godless womb. With their  
focus of mind intensified by anger, they will remain firmly united with Me and  
before long return to My presence. Know that your curse was ordained by Me  
alone, oh learned ones.'**)

_cont...   
Thereafter sitting in the assembly hall on the highest seat of man with a most  
fearsome, terrible countenance, there was no one to challenge Him nor anyone  
to worship Him. But upon hearing how he, the Daitya who was the headache of  
the three worlds, in the battle had been killed by the Lord, there were  
exclamations of joy, blossoming faces and endless showers of flowers from the  
wives of the demigods. At that time there was an overcast formed by all the  
celestial chariots of the demigods desirous to attend. Drums and kettle drums  
were sounded and the greatest singers and angels of heaven sang and danced.  
All the godly ones, Brahma, Indra and Shiva, the sages, the ancestors, the  
perfected ones, the scientific experts and the great serpents assembled there.  
The founding fathers, the leaders of mankind, the residents of heaven and the  
best of the angels arrived there too, as did the venerable ones, the keepers  
of the wealth and the monkey-like, oh my best one. Also the goblins came, the  
ones of superpower and they who were Vishnu's personal associates like Sunanda  
and Kumuda. With their hands folded before their heads to offer their  
obeisance each of them approached Him who had appeared as half a man, half a  
lion and now sat there on the throne displaying His effulgence.   
Lord Brahma said: 'I bow down before You, oh Inscrutable One of unlimited  
powers. You with all Your might and prowess and the purity of Your actions  
stand for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. While You  
in Your divine game play with the modes, You never change Yourself,and stand  
above this creation.'   
Lord Shiva said: 'The end of the yuga is the time suitable for You to kill in  
anger this insignificant demon; just protect his son, this bhakta of surrender  
next to You, oh caretaker of the devotees.'   
Sri Indra said: 'Our share of the sacrifices was secured by Your Lordship  
protecting us, oh Supreme One. We have no words to describe how afflicted our  
lotus-like hearts were by the Daitya, our hearts that are really Your  
residence. Alas, oh Lord, how insignificant is our world in the grip of Time,  
but for the sake of the devoted ones in Your service You have shed Your light  
so that they may find liberation from their bondage. What else but considering  
the visible world as unimportant would constitute their way oh Nrisimha?'   
The Rishis said: 'You are the shining example who taught us our austerity. By  
this power of Yours this world, oh Original Lord, is created, maintained and  
reabsorbed. That penance was stolen by this unwise soul but is now, oh Shelter  
of the Needy, restored by the protection of Your embodiment.'   
The ancestors [the Pitris] said: 'The demon who engaging with force enjoyed  
our s'raddha sacrifices that were offered by our sons and grandsons, he who  
even at the holy bathing places drank from our offerings of sesame water, by  
piercing the intestines of his belly with the nails of Your hand these  
offerings have reached their proper destination. He, the maintainer of the  
universal principles of religion who appeared as a man-lion, Him we offer our  
obeisances.   
The ones of perfection [the Siddhas] said: 'This most uncivilized and  
dishonest person who stole away the joy of our perfection in yoga and with the  
power of his mysticism and penance was so proud of his wealth, has been torn  
apart by Your nails. We bow down before You, oh Nrisimha.'   
The scientific experts [the Vidyadharas] said: 'Our forms of knowledge that  
each are attained by a different way of concentrating, were pushed aside by  
this fool puffed up about his strength and prowess. He who in battle killed  
him like he was an animal, to Him who appeared as Nrisimha, we surrendered  
souls are ever obliged.'   
The snake people [the Nagas] said: 'By piercing the chest of that greatest of  
all sinners who seized our jewels and beautiful women, You have done our wives  
a great favor. Let us offer You our obeisances.'   
The original fathers [the Manus] said: 'We, the Manus are Your authorities but  
were disrespected by this son of Diti who broke with the moral ties for the  
establishment, oh Lord. With You having killed this villain, oh Master, please  
tell us what we, Your eternal servants, can do for You.'   
The founding fathers [the Prajapatis] said: 'We, the creators of the  
generations owe our lives to You, oh Supreme Controller and not to him who  
denied the living beings that we have put on this world a life. And now, by  
assuming the form of an incarnation of Your pure goodness, You for the well-  
being of the world have split open the chest of him who lies slain.'   
The musicians of heaven [the Gandharvas] said: 'We, oh Lord are Your dancers  
and singers, Your performers, who were brought under the control of the power  
and strength of the one here who You reduced to this condition. Can anyone on  
the path of evil find happiness?'   
The venerable souls [the Caranas] said: 'Oh Lord, Your lotus feet liberate  
from the need to start a new life. We duly seek shelter there because You have  
put an end to this Asura, this snake in the heart of all virtuous people.'   
The keepers of the wealth [the Yakshas] said: 'We, serving You to Your  
pleasure belong to Your best followers. This son of Diti forced us to carry  
his palanquin but caused the sorrow of each and everyone. Thus we acknowledge  
You oh Lord Nrisimha, for You are the one who put him to death, oh twenty-  
fifth principle.'   
The monkey-like beings [the Kimpurushas] said: 'We are questionable humans,  
Kimpurushas but You are the Supreme Lord. And this bad person has been slain  
by You after having been condemned by the saintly ones.'   
The king's bards [the Vaitalikas] said: 'We in great gatherings and arenas of  
sacrifice singing the glories of Your spotless reputation have achieved the  
greatest position of respect. This crooked character who subdued us oh Supreme  
Lord, has to our great fortune been killed by You, like he was a disease.'   
The lower gods [the Kinnaras, those with a human head and an animal body,  
singers of heaven] said: 'Oh Lord, we the Kinnaras are Your faithful servants.  
Because of that son of Diti we had to perform in forced labor, but the sinner  
was by You destroyed, oh Nrisimhadeva, oh Master. Please be there as our  
happiness and welfare.'   
The associates of Lord Vishnu said: 'Today we have seen You in a wondrous  
human-like form. You are our shelter and the happiness of all the worlds. This  
servant of the state, oh Lord, was cursed by the scholars and has therefore  
been killed. We consider that to be Your special grace.'   
Narada Muni said [to Yudhishthhira]: 'None could step forward, not even Lord  
Brahma or Lord Shiva, because He, boiling with anger, was most difficult to  
approach. The Goddess of Fortune personally by the demigods being urged to do  
so could, after seeing Him so huge and wonderful as no one had ever seen or  
heard before, not move in His direction because she was very afraid. Then Lord  
Brahma prompted Prahlada who stood close by: 'My dear son, can you please  
approach the Lord and propitiate Him? He is very angry because of what your  
father did.'   
'Surely' he said and even though he was only a small boy oh King, the great  
devotee slowly, step by step, approached Him and prostrated himself with  
folded hands offering prayers. The godhead was by him, such a little boy  
fallen at His lotus feet, greatly moved and filled with mercy He raised His  
lotus hand, placed it on his head and dispelled the fear for the snake of time  
from all minds present there. Because of that touch he was cleansed from all  
evil. And immediately in this association with the Supreme Soul, with His  
lotus feet, his heart melted being captured in bliss. With Him in his heart  
tears welled in his eyes and symptoms of ecstasy manifested all over his  
body.'

## Re:[80]Love,always love and only love Excerpts from Srimad Bhagavatam

**_The purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam and many Avatars of the Lord Krishna_**  
 _Suta said: "In the beginning the Supreme Lord assumed, for the creation of  
the worlds, the form of the Original Person[Purusha],the cosmic intelligence  
and such,and created the sixteen primary principles [of the ten knowing and  
working senses, the mind and the five elements]. Resting in His meditative  
slumber in that water, out of the lotus that spread from the lake of His  
navel, Brahma was manifested, the master of the progenitors in the universe.  
One supposes the different worlds to be an expansions and the part of the form  
of the Fortunate One that constitutes the excellence of the purest existence.  
In a perfect spiritual vision His form is seen as having numerous legs,  
thighs, arms and faces, with wonderful heads, ears, eyes and noses, all  
glowing with countless garlands, earrings and dresses. This source of the  
numerous incarnations is the imperishable seed from which the plenary portions  
originate as also the portions thereof, such as the gods, the human beings and  
the animals."   
"The first Divinity created were the sons of Brahma,the Kumaras, who performed  
the most difficult discipline of continuous celibacy so they could realize the  
Absolute (Brahman). The Supreme Enjoyer secondly assumed the form of a Boar  
for the welfare of the earth that had sunken to the lowest regions and lifted  
her up from the ocean. Thirdly He accepted His presence among the seers in the  
form of Narada Muni for the sake of evolving the Vedic knowledge of Bhakti  
Yoga free from material motives. Fourth born as the twin sons of Murti, the  
wife of king Dharma, in the form of Nara-Narayaṇa subjected Himself to severe  
penances to attain control over the senses. Fifth He, carrying the name of  
Kapila, gave an exposition to the brahmin Asuri on the nature of metaphysics  
and the elements of creation, because in the course of time that knowledge had  
been lost. Sixth as the son of Atri,named Dattatreya, being born from Anasusa  
who prayed for Him, He lectured to Alarka, Prahlada and others about  
transcendence. Seventh being born from Akuti as Yajna, the son of Prajapati  
Ruci, He together with His son Yama and other demigods, ruled during the  
period of Svayambhuva Manu. Eighth, from the wife of King Nabhi, Merudev?, the  
Almighty Lord took birth as King Rishabha and showed the path of perfection  
respected by people of all stages of life. His ninth incarnation He accepted  
in response to the prayers of the sages, whereupon He as Prithu ruled the  
earth for the sake of collecting her produces, which made her most attractive.  
Assuming the form of a fish Matsya, He after the period of Cakshusha Manu  
protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him in a boat afloat the waters when the  
world was deeply inundated. Eleventh the mighty Lord in the form of a tortoise  
Kurma sustained the Mandaracala Hill of the theists and atheists that served  
as a pivot in the ocean. Twelfth He appeared as Dhanvantari,Lord of medicine,  
and thirteenth He appeared before the atheists as an alluring beautiful woman  
Mohini and gave nectar to the demigods. In His fourteenth incarnation He, half  
as a lion, appeared as Nrisimha, who with His nails on His lap tore apart the  
king of the atheists like a carpenter splitting cane. Fifteenth He assumed the  
form of Vamana who went to the arena of sacrifice of Maharaja Bali to beg for  
only three steps of land, concealing His wish to regain the three worlds. In  
His sixteenth incarnation He as Bhrigupati or Paras'urama saw that the ruling  
class was hostile towards the brahmins and acted twenty-one times against  
them. Seeing that the common people were less intelligent He, seventeenth,  
incarnated as Vyasa taking birth from Satyavati with Paras'ara Muni as His  
father, for the purpose of dividing the Vedas into several branches. Next He  
performed in a superhuman way having assumed the form of a divine human being  
Rama, by controlling the Indian Ocean and such, so that He could act for the  
sake of the godly souls. Nineteenth as also twentieth Bhagavan took birth in  
the Vrishni family as Balarama and Krishna and thus removed the burden from  
the world. Thereafter at the beginning of the Age of Kali He shall appear as  
the son of mother Anjana with the name Buddha for the purpose of deluding the  
ones envious of the theists. Next, at the conjunction of two yugas, when there  
is hardly a ruler to be found who is not a plunderer, the Lord of the Creation  
carrying the name of Kalki will take birth from the ones(or place) famous  
by(with) Vishnu "   
"Dear brahmins, the incarnations of the Lord who appeared from the ocean of  
goodness are as innumerable as the thousands of streams we have from  
inexhaustible sources of water. All the powerful sages, the godly souls, the  
Manus and their progeny as also the Prajapatis [the founding fathers] are  
aspects of the Lord. They are all part of Krishna, the Bhagavan in person who  
offers protection during all ages and in all worlds against disturbances  
because of the enemies of the king of heaven.   
Anyone who in the morning and the evening carefully recites these mysterious  
births of the Lord, will find relief from all miseries of life. All these  
forms of the Lord that by the qualities of the material energy were created  
with the cosmic intelligence and other elements, originated from His Self-  
awareness that is without a form. The less intelligent observer perceives them  
the way one sees clouds in the sky or dust in the air. This unmanifested Self  
is the beyond,cannot be seen or heard and has no form,but the jiva(individual  
soul) affected by the modes of nature takes birth repeatedly. As soon as one  
by self-knowledge arrives at the rejection of all these gross and subtle forms  
that impose themselves on the soul because of ignorance, one arrives at the  
realization of the Absolute Truth. With the illusory energy subsided and  
mindfulness one is endowed with the full knowledge of enlightenment and  
becomes situated in one's own glory. This is how the learned describe  
activities and the births of the actually Unborn and non-engaged Lord of the  
Heart; this is the hidden meaning of the Vedas. Residing within every living  
being He is the omnipotent master and witness of the six qualities and  
opulences, whose play is spotless, who is independent and not affected by  
creation, destruction and maintenance. Because of His expert manipulations His  
activities, names and forms cannot be understood by the speculations and  
speeches of those with a poor fund of knowledge, just like fools cannot  
understand an actor's performance. Only he who renders unconditional,  
uninterrupted, favorable service to His fragrant lotus feet may know the  
transcendental glories of the all-powerful Creator with the wheel of the  
chariot in His hand. When one in this world becomes aware of the Vasudeva who  
embraces all His universes as their Lord and goes into ecstasy because of it,  
one will never again have to experience there the dreadful repetition of  
births."   
"This book called the Bhagavatam about the activities of the One Hailed in the  
Verses,that as a supplement to the Vedas [a Purana] was compiled by the seer  
of God Vyasadeva, is there for the ultimate good of bringing success,  
happiness and perfection to all people. This story, that as the cream from all  
the Vedic literatures and histories was extracted by Vyasa, he delivered to  
his son who is the most respectable one among the self-realized souls. He  
[S'uka] in his turn told it to emperor Parikchit* who, surrounded by the  
greatest sages, sat down at the Ganges to fast until his death. Now that  
Krishna has left for His abode and with Him also proper conduct and spiritual  
insight have vanished, this Purana bright as the sun has appeared at the  
horizon for the sake of everyone who in the Age of Quarrel has lost his  
vision. Oh brahmins, when the story was recited there by that powerful great  
sage, I, being perfectly attentive by his mercy, also managed to understand  
it, so that I will now relate it to you also, exactly as I learned it free  
from deviations by my own mind."   
*Parikchit was the grandson of Arjuna. Son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The emperor who as a child in the womb was protected by Krishna for the continuation of the Yadu dynasty. The first vedic sovereign who laid out the norms for Kali yuga and was cursed by the son of a brahmana to die in seven days. Because of curse,and so He can be able to attain perfection in seven days,was recited the Srimad Bhagavata by Suka, the son of Vyasa, the original author of the book about the Lord and His devotees.

**_The Birth of Emperor Parikchit_**  
 _S 'aunaka said: "The embryo in the womb of Uttara, that was tormented by the  
enormous heat of the invincible weapon released by As'vatthama, was by the  
Lord again awarded a life. How did the birth take place of Emperor Parikchit  
who was so highly intelligent and what where the activities of this great  
soul? How exactly did his demise take place and what destination did he  
achieve? If you think you can tell us this that we, so very faithful, all want  
to hear, please speak to us then about the transcendental knowledge that was  
delivered by S'uka."   
Suta said: "King Yudhishthhira brought prosperity to everyone during his  
reign, the way his father did, by continuous service of Krishna's feet without  
any ulterior motive for material gain or sensual pleasure. The fame of his  
wealth, sacrifices, what he stood for, his queens, his brothers and his  
sovereignty over the planet earth where we are living, even spread to the  
heavenly worlds. But, just as only food may satisfy a hungry man and nothing  
else, he, in his hunger as someone aware of the Redeemer, Mukunda, oh  
brahmins, was not moved by all those earthly desirables that are aspired by  
even the God-fearing souls.   
At the time Parikchit,the great fighter, as a child in his mother's womb, was  
suffering from the heat of the brahmastra weapon, oh son of Bhrigu, he could  
observe the Purusha in a shining appearance. In the blaze he saw at the size  
of not more than a thumb the transcendental, infallible Lord beautiful with a  
dark skin, a golden helmet and lightening clothes. With the riches of His four  
arms, earrings of the purest gold, bloodshot eyes and a club in His hands, He  
was moving about, constantly whirling the club around like it was a torch. As  
He was vanquishing the radiation of the brahmastra like the sun evaporating  
dew drops, He was observed by the child who wondered who He was. He saw how  
the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Lord and protector of righteousness,  
took away the glare. Next the Lord who stretches in all directions all of a  
sudden disappeared from his sight. Thereupon, when the good signs of a  
favorable position of the stars gradually evolved, he took birth, who would  
prove himself to be of a prowess equal to that of Pandu. King Yudhishthhira  
being fully satisfied had priests like Dhaumya and Kripa perform the birth  
ritual with the recitation of auspicious hymns. Knowing where, when and how,  
he in charity rewarded to the occasion of that birth the brahmins with good  
food and gifts of gold, cows, land, housing, elephants and horses. The  
brahmins happily addressed the king, the chief of the Purus, communicating  
that they felt most obliged to the line of the descendants of their ancestor  
King Puru.   
They said: 'This son has been given to you by the all-pervasive and all-  
powerful Lord to show you His mercy in countering his destruction by the  
irresistible, supernatural weapon. Therefore he shall be known all over the  
world as Vishnu-rata, 'Given by Vishnu'. He will no doubt be a most fortunate,  
supreme devotee endowed with all good qualities.'   
The good king said: 'Oh best of the truthful, will he follow in the footsteps  
of all the great souls of this family of saintly kings? Will he be just as  
meritorious and glorious in his achievements?'   
The brahmins answered: 'Oh son of Pritha [Kunti], he will be the maintainer of  
all living entities, exactly like King Ikshvaku, the son of Manu, and he will  
be faithful to his promises and be of respect for the brahmins, just like  
Rama, the son of Das'aratha. He will be as charitable as King S'ibi of  
Us'inara and protect the ones of surrender, and will, just like Bharata, the  
son of Dushyanta who performed many sacrifices, spread the name and fame of  
his family. Among the archers he will be as good as the two Arjunas [his  
grandfather and the king of Haihaya], he will be as irresistible as fire and  
as unsurpassable as the ocean. As powerful as a lion and as worthy for taking  
shelter as the Himalayas, he will be as forbearing as the earth and as  
tolerant as his parents. With a spirit as good as that of the original father  
Brahma, he will be as generous and equanimous as Lord Shiva and be the refuge  
of all living beings as good as the Supreme Lord who is the refuge of the  
Goddess of fortune. Following in the footsteps of Krishna he will be the  
majesty of all divine virtues, he will have the greatness of King Rantideva  
and be as pious as Yayati. Being as patient as Bali Maharaja this child will  
be as devoted as Prahlada was unto Krishna, he will perform many As'vamedha  
sacrifices and be faithful to the elderly and experienced souls. He will  
father a line of saintly kings, will chastise the upstarts and, as a source of  
righteousness in the world, crush the quarrelsome. After being informed about  
his personal death, as caused by a snakebird that was sent by the son of a  
brahmin, he will free himself from his attachments and take to the shelter in  
the Lord. Having inquired about the proper self-knowledge from the son of  
sage Vyasa, oh King, he will abandon his material life on the bank of the  
river Ganges and attain the state of fearlessness. Constantly keeping Lord in  
mind whom he had seen before his birth, He would acquire fame in this world by  
constant investigation. Just like the waxing moon day by day soon becomes  
full, the royal prince under the care of his protective parents day by day  
grew to become soon the one he would be.'   
The brahmins learned in matters of astrology and birth ceremonies, thus having  
informed the king, were generously rewarded and then all returned to their  
homes.   
King Yudhishthhira, desiring to perform a horse sacrifice to be freed from the  
burden of having fought his kinsmen, thought about acquiring funds because all  
he received stemmed from collecting taxes and fines. In respect of his mindful  
wishes, his brothers on the advise of the Lord Krishna went north to collect  
sufficient riches. With the result of those collected riches Yudhishthhira,  
the anxious, pious king, managed to conduct three sacrifices, by means of  
which he worshiped Lord Hari perfectly. The Supreme Lord being invited by the  
king, had the brahmins perform the sacrifices for him and then stayed a few  
months longer to satisfy the desires of His friends. Then, dear brahmins,Lord  
Krishna, with the permission of the king, Draupadi and His relatives,went back  
to Dvaraka, accompanied by Arjuna and other members of the Yadu dynasty."

_**Prithu Maharaja 's Meeting with the Four Kumaras**_  
 _Maitreya said: 'While the citizens were thus praying to the high and mighty King Prithu, four  
sages arrived there as bright as the sun. The king and his associates could  
recognize the masters of yogic perfection,the four Kumaras,by the glaring  
effulgence of their all-embracing sinlessness, who descended from the ethereal  
realm. Seeing the so very desired life of peace before them, King Prithu and  
his followers jumped to their feet as if they were souls whose senses are  
ruled by the modes of nature. After they had accepted that reverence and had  
taken their seats, he humbly,being aware of their full glory, bowed before  
them and was of worship the way it is prescribed, with everything belonging  
to it. The water of washing their feet he sprinkled on the tuft of his hair  
and thus he behaved like men of respect are supposed to behave. Seated on the  
golden throne the older brothers of Bhava looked like the fire on an altar.  
Pleased with them, the king respectfully and with restraint addressed them.  
Prithu said: 'To what do we owe the grace of your audience, of you who are  
fortune personified? It is an encounter difficult to achieve for even the  
greatest yogis. He with whom the learned are pleased, can achieve whatever is  
difficult to achieve in this world or in the hereafter, including the favor of  
the all-auspicious Lord S'iva and Lord Vishnu. Even though you travel around  
in all the worlds, the people cannot see you, just as they cannot see the  
All-knowing witness present within everyone. A person who is not very rich and  
is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly persons are  
present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the  
exalted visitors water, a sitting place and great reception are glorified, and  
that very home itself is also glorified. But, those houses that, abundant with  
all wealth, are not blessed with the water that washed the feet of the great  
saints, are no doubt like a tree with venomous serpents. I welcome you, oh  
best of the twice-born souls, you who move around like children and,  
controlled by vows, with great faith are motivated for liberation. Oh masters,  
can persons who, having fallen into this material existence, are stricken with  
the illness of living to the command of their senses, all by themselves find  
any good fortune? There is no need to ask you about your well-being, for you,  
supreme souls, are not at all concerned with matters of good or bad fortune.  
I am therefore certain that you for us, who suffer the pains of a material  
existence, are the friends to ask how one in this world soon may find  
salvation. Manifesting as the supreme goal in life of the seekers after  
Truth, the Supreme Lord, the Unborn One, in the form of perfected souls like  
you, moves about on this earth in order to show His devotees His mercy.'   
Maitreya said: 'Hearing that most substantial, appropriate and sweet  
conclusion of Prithu, the Kumara satisfied with a smile replied as follows.  
Sanat-kumara said: 'What a good question for you to ask, my dear King, oh you who desires the  
good of all living beings. Learned as you are, you nevertheless pose this  
question. This speaks for you as someone of wisdom of the saint. An  
association of devotees in which there is discussion, questioning and  
answering, is appreciated by both the parties [of speakers and listeners], and  
real happiness for all will expand from it. Oh King, you are evidently  
attached to the praises of the Lord's lotus feet. Difficult as it is, that,  
given a steady practice, will free the indwelling soul from the dirt of lusty  
feelings. In the scriptures is defended that only the absence of attachment to  
other matters than the soul, in combination with an intense attachment to the  
True Self transcendental to the modes of nature, constitutes the perfect  
conviction for the salvation of man. That is realized when one as a dutiful  
devotee with faith and devotion, by means of discussion, inquiry,and  
determination,with respect for the Lord of Yoga regularly attends and listens  
to the stories of the God-fearing souls. Reluctant to associate with the  
company of those who hanker after money, sense gratification and the acquiring  
of goods,one should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace  
without drinking the nectar of the glorification of Hari. With nonviolence,  
following the footsteps of the Guru, by remembering the Lord of Liberation, by  
testifying of His activities, by the following yoga principles without a  
material motive and by practicing in line with the precepts one, thus being  
without offenses, should live a simple life tolerating worldly dualities. When  
someone always listens about transcendental qualities of the Lord, it may be  
so that one's devotion and Truth consciousness grows,and he easily becomes  
attached to the Brahman. When the person in respect of the Guru, by the force  
of detachment and jnana,completely surrenders to the Supreme, the covering  
within the heart that consists of the five elements will be burned like fuel  
being burned by fire. After one is freed from inner weakness and dominance of  
the material qualities, there is no longer a difference, as there was in the  
past, between the inner and the outer,and this difference being a dream is  
finished. For such a soul that difference has ended, just like a dream ends  
when one wakes up. The one becomes aware how desire bounds the Soul, but there  
is no more division and separation,and he sees himself beyond,as the Witness.  
Because the ruminating mind is agitated by the senses that are drawn towards  
the sense objects, the pure consciousness is easily lost, just like a lake  
easily can be overgrown by plants. Wise ones state that when remembrance is  
lost, all knowledge acquired is based on a false foundation. The constant  
mindfulness of one's consciousness is destroyed and real knowledge is lost.  
There is no stronger obstruction to one's self-interest than thinking other  
matters to be more pleasing than one's self-realization. When one constantly  
thinks of riches and sensual pleasures, all the virtues of human society are  
destroyed. For that reason bereft of knowledge and devotion, one then lapses  
into the inertia [the ignorance]. They who want to cross over that ocean of  
ignorance quickly, should never cling to the slowness of matter(tamas), for  
that is the great stumbling block,as even the virtues of religiousness,  
economic development and sense gratification [dharma, artha, kama]. In this  
respect liberation is likely to be the most important virtue, because being  
engaged in the interest of the other three paths, one regularly finds oneself  
caught in the grip of death and in fear. Following these three notions of a  
higher or lower form of life, one will never find any security, since they,  
depending on the interaction of the material modes, are all destroyed by the  
ordinance of the Lord [in the form of Time]. Oh best of kings, be therefore,  
just as I am, convinced of Him, the Supreme Lord who from within the heart  
everywhere manifests as the Master of the Field. Therein radiating into every  
hair follicle, He is there for the self-realization, for all the moving and  
not moving living beings covered by a body endowed with senses and a life-  
breath. Surrender to Him, the root cause manifesting as the truth within the  
untruth. By this deliberate consideration one is freed from the illusions and  
from the mistake taking the rope as a snake. One is then situated in the pure  
truth, the truth of the original nature transcendental to all the impurities  
of one's karmic activities. Be devoted to Vasudeva. For the devotees who find  
Him by devotion, the One whose lotus toes bring joy, the hard knot of karmic  
desire is uprooted, but that is never so with people missing that respect,  
however hard they try to stop the waves of sense enjoyment. Great is the  
hardship of the ones immersed in material life,which is like an ocean filled  
with the sharks of the six senses. Being unhappy it is very difficult to cross  
that ocean full of misfortune, that danger of separate existence, and  
therefore you should make the worshipable lotus feet of the Supreme Lord your  
boat.'

_cont...   
Maitreya said: 'Thus in full being informed about the ins and outs of  
spiritual advancement by the son of Brahma - the Kumara who was so well versed  
in spiritual knowledge - the king praised him and then spoke. The king said: 'You all, oh brahmins, oh powerful souls, have arrived here in order to  
confirm what was promised by Him, the Lord who from His causeless mercy is so  
compassionate with the distressed. It is my duty, therefore, to offer you  
something, but all I have now are but remnants of food taken by great saintly  
persons. What shall I give except my heart and soul? My life, wife and  
children, oh brahmins, my home with everything belonging to it, my kingdom,  
power, land and treasury, I therefore offer all to you. The post of the  
commander in chief and ruler of the state, the first to chastise or the  
proprietor of the whole planet, are no doubt only reserved for those who know  
the Vedic scriptures. A brahmin enjoys his own food, wears his own clothes  
and gives what he has in charity. It is by his mercy that the kshatriyas [the  
rulers] and the other parts of society eat their food. How can such persons,  
who have done unlimited mercy by explaining the path of self-realization, and  
whose explanations are given for our enlightenment with complete conviction  
and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded palms containing water for  
their satisfaction?'   
Maitreya said: 'After the masters of self-realization had been worshiped by  
the original king, they praised his character and then, for all people to see,  
disappeared in the sky. The son of Vena, the first among the great  
personalities, who according to the teachings had arrived at self-  
realization, considered himself as someone fully satisfied. For the sake of  
the Absolute Truth he performed as good as possible,and as far as his means  
would allow, according to the time, the circumstances and his capacity all his  
actions. Fully dedicated to the Supreme Spirit he, free from attachments  
being of renunciation, always thought of the Lord, the Supersoul beyond this  
material nature. Even though he lived at home, he never felt attracted to all  
the opulence of his mighty kingdom, nor did he indulge in sensual pleasures,  
just like the sun never responds to what it illuminates. Always engaging  
spiritually, he thus begot five sons in his wife Arci who fully met his  
expectations. Their names were Vijitas'va, Dhumrakes'a, Haryaksha, Dravina and  
Vrika. In his personal surrender to the Infallible One he, for the protection  
of the created universe, pleased the citizens during his time with his kind-  
hearted words and actions. The king thus was known as the King of the Moon,  
while he, on the other hand, was like the Sun god in his distributing,  
exacting and ruling over the wealth of the world. In his exercise of power he  
was as unconquerable as fire, he was as insuperable as the King of Heaven, as  
tolerant as the earth itself and alike heaven in fulfilling all desires of  
human society. Just as rainfall satisfies everyone's desires, Maharaja Pṛthu  
used to satisfy everyone. He was like the sea in that no one could understand  
his depths, and he was like Meru, the king of hills, in the fixity of his  
purpose. He was like the King of Righteousness [Yamaraja] in his education, he  
was alike the Himalayas in his opulence, he was like Kuvera in keeping the  
wealth and alike Varuna [the ruler of the waters] in his secrecy. He was as  
all-pervading as the air [the wind] concerning his physical strength, courage  
and power, and he was as inexorable as the most powerful Rudra. He was as  
beautiful as Cupid, he was as attentive as the lion, the king of the animals,  
in his affection he was alike Svayambhuva Manu and in matters of controlling  
the people he resembled the Unborn Lord, Brahma. He understood spiritual  
matters alike Brihaspati, in his personal self-control he was alike the  
Supreme Lord, in his devotion to the cows, the spiritual master and the  
brahmins he was as great devotees, in his shyness he was the most gentle one  
and in matters of philanthropy he was [as good] as he was for himself. All  
over the three worlds the general public loudly declared - and surely all the  
lovers of truth and the women from everywhere came to hear about it - that his  
name and fame was as great as the glory of Rama.'

**__Liberation from ignorance**  
 _The Lord Kapila said: 'Even though abides in a material body, the Soul is not affected by the basic  
qualities of matter because he does not claim doership and thus is not subject  
to change, just like the sun is not affected by being reflected in water. But  
when this very Soul is affected with the modes of material nature it becomes  
bewildered by the ego sense and thinks: 'I am the doer'. Dealing with material  
nature in such a way,the wrong actions are the result,and he in discontent,  
helplessly undergoes the repeated birth and death,in births from different  
wombs or species depending on the good or bad life he led or a combination of  
these. Like having landed in a nightmare wherein the things happening do not  
really exist, there is for the Soul, who only thinks and sees what occurs to  
his senses, no end to his materially conditioned existence and illusion.  
Therefore the mind of attachment to material pleasure must, free from  
attachment, gradually be brought under control with the bhakti. Beginning with  
yama [meaning the great vow of yoga of nonviolence, truth, non-stealing,  
celibacy and non-possessiveness in the discipline of detachment], one should  
practice the different forms of yoga and develop, endowed with faith,  
unalloyed devotion unto Me by listening my stories,reading and reflecting on  
the teachings of the Truth. Therein one must be without enmity and regard all  
living beings as equal, not entertain intimate relations and be celibate, be  
free from chatter and offer the results of one's labor. One should be  
satisfied with whatever comes of its own, eat little and live thoughtfully in  
a secluded place and be peaceful, kind, compassionate and self-realized. In  
relating to others and to one's body one should not follow the physical  
concept of life but rather, from the spiritual perspective attend to the  
factual truth of both the material and the personal aspect. One should  
transcend the stages of consciousness [of waking, dreaming and deep sleep] and  
stay away from other conceptions of life. Thus, with a purified intellect, the  
true Self, the Soul within, should be seen as clear as the sun before one's  
eyes. A liberated soul realizes the Truth, which is beyond and which is  
manifest as a reflection in the false ego. He is the support of the material  
cause and He enters into everything. He is Absolute, one without a second, and  
He is the eye of the illusory energy. It is like with the sun that can be seen  
as a reflection on water or on a wall, but factually is situated in the sky.  
The Truth is reflected in the threefold nature of the materially identified  
ego that consists of body, senses and mind. Someone who in this material world  
wrongly identifies with the material elements, the objects of enjoyment, the  
material senses, the mind, intelligence and so on, is actually in deep sleep,  
but once he is awakened he is freed from false ego and illusion. Even though  
not being lost, still the Soul unjustly considers himself lost. But through  
the path of yoga,established in Jnana,he sees himself as a witness,not  
affected with material nature,and with it, he sees also unreality of the ego.  
Coming to understand this,he realizes his true Self,Atma, his original  
individuality [svarupa].'   
Devahuti said: 'Dear brahmin, is it not so that material nature never releases  
the soul because the two are eternally attracted to each other, oh Best One?  
Just as aroma and earth have no separate existence and taste does not exist  
apart from water, intelligence cannot exist independent of consciousness.  
Then how can a soul be free from material nature? Is the soul, being a passive  
observer, not forced to act because of the basic qualities of matter? The  
great fear, one may avoid by contemplating the fundamental principles, will  
not cease because every time its cause appears again.'   
The Bhagavan said: 'One will realize the freedom, when one, with a pure mind serious unto Me and  
faithfully contemplates on the Truth with devotion, manages to perform one's  
duties without desiring the fruits thereof. By means of Jnana, with the vision  
of the Absolute Truth, by penance,with renunciation, detached and firmly fixed  
in that same Truth, one becomes absorbed in the Self. Bound to material nature  
he is day after day consumed, like firewood by fire, disappearing gradually.  
But experiencing his dependency, understanding the futility of the desire to  
always enjoy, he, thus forsaking sensual pleasures, firmly stands in his own  
glory. The many inauspicious matters a person may dream of in his sleep, will  
not in the least daunt him when he has awakened. Someone, who has fixed his  
mind upon Me, the knower of the Absolute Truth within, thus has nothing to  
fear from material nature. When someone wise thus for many years and many  
births is engaged in self-realization, he will develop a distaste for enjoying  
whatever, even the heaven of the creator. Someone devoted to Me who under My  
protection for the sake of awakening his intelligence, by My unlimited mercy  
goes for the ultimate goal of his existence that is called kaivalya  
[enlightenment, emancipation, beatitude], will in this life soon attain a  
steady self-awareness and be free from doubt. The yogi who departed for that  
heavenly abode will, after leaving behind both the subtle and the gross body,  
never return. When the attention of the perfected yogi is not drawn towards  
yogic powers to control the material illusion, my dear mother, then, having no  
other purpose in his life, his progress towards Me will be unbounded, because  
the power of death is lost therein.'   
Book 3,Chapter 27_

**_Explanation of Bhakti Yoga by Lord Kapila   
_**  
 _Devah?ti said: "Please elaborate now at length on the path of bhakti yoga  
that one calls the ultimate purpose."   
Maitreya said: 'Appreciating the words of His mother, oh best of the Kurus,  
the great and gentle sage, contented and being moved by compassion, said the  
following. The Bhagavan said: 'O noble lady, there are many paths and ways of bhakti yoga,depending on  
natural disposition and temperaments of seekers. What one does out of love for  
Me in a spirit of violence, pride and envy or out of anger with a fractional  
view,is considered to be in the mode of darkness(tamas). He who worships Me  
with idols and aims at material things, fame and opulence, is in the mode of  
passion (rajas). Someone who worships Me with offering the results of his  
actions or when he for the sake of transcendence desires to be free from karma  
[profit-minded action],that bhakti is said to be in the mode of goodness  
(sattva). In case of an uninterrupted thinking of Me who is present in  
everyone's heart - just like the water of the Ganges that continuously flows  
towards the ocean - and when one wishes to hear about My qualities only,  
having no ulterior motives, one may speak of pure devotion, of bhakti unto the  
Supreme One. Pure devotees will not accept it - not even when being offered  
these - to be equal with Me, to have the same opulence, to be a personal  
associate, to have the same bodily features or to be joined in oneness,but  
only to be in My service. When one by means of this bhakti yoga - which one  
calls the highest aim - succeeds in dealing with the three modes of nature the  
way I explained it, one attains My transcendental nature. When one performs  
one's duties without attachment to the results one is stronger, and when one  
without unnecessary violence regularly and with dedication practice this yoga,  
one will find happiness. The same as someone worships My statue,by seeing it,  
offering respect to it,by offering obeisances, praise and worship,he should  
,in the spirit of detachment and in the mode of goodness, think of Me and see  
Me being present in all living beings. By means of sense control and proper  
regulation [yama and niyama], being of the greatest respect for the great  
souls, being compassionate with the poor and by being friendly in association  
with like-minded souls; by hearing about spiritual matters, chanting My holy  
names, being straightforward, by association with civilized people and not  
entertaining false ego, the consciousness of a person who with these qualities  
is dutiful towards Me is completely purified. No doubt he by simply hearing  
about My excellence will directly reach Me. The way the sense of smell catches  
the aroma that is carried from its source by means of the air, similarly  
consciousness by means of yoga catches the Supreme Soul who is free from  
change.   
When one who worships the deity but has no respect for Me who, in the form of  
the All pervading Soul, is always situated in every living being,this is  
nothing but a hypocrisy. Someone who in worship of the deity has no regard for  
Me as the Supreme Ruler present in all beings, is in his ignorance only  
offering oblations into the ashes. He who offers Me his respects but is  
envious, lives in his campaigning against others and in enmity, will never  
find peace of mind. Oh sinless one, I am certainly not pleased when they who  
manage to worship Me in My deity form, are not of respect for other living  
beings. Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the  
Ishvara until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of  
other living beings as well. For those who discriminate with regard to the  
body of themselves and that of others, for those who make distinction between  
them and others,as the blazing fire of death, I will cause great fear. One  
should therefore, with charity, respect and in friendship regarding everyone  
as an equal, propitiate Me, the One True Self abiding in all.   
Living entities are better developed than inanimate objects, better than  
entities with life symptoms, oh blessed one, are entities with a developed  
consciousness and better than those are they who developed sense perception.  
Among them, those who developed taste are better than those who only developed  
a sense of touch and better than they are those who developed a sense of  
smell. Even better are those creatures who developed the faculty to hear.  
Better than those are the ones distinguishing differences of form and those  
who have teeth in both their jaws are better than these. Those who have many  
legs are superior to them. Of them the four-legged creatures are the ones  
better developed,while the two-legged ones are even better. Among human  
beings a society with four classes is the better one and of those classes the  
brahmins are the best. Among the brahmins the better one is who knows the  
Vedas, but best of those are the Brahmins who know its purpose.   
The one who puts an end to all doubts is better than he who knows what the  
purpose of the Vedas is and the brahmin among them who performs his duty is  
better than him. He who is free from worldly attachment is still better and  
the one who performs his righteous duty not for himself alone is the best  
developed of them all.   
Therefore I know of no greater being than a person who with a dedicated mind  
has offered all of his actions, wealth and life without any reservation to Me  
and with persistence is of service without any other interest or motive,but  
only from the deep love. Such a one who regards the Supreme Lord, the  
Controller of the individual soul, as having entered all the living beings in  
the form of the Paramatma, is therefore mindfully of respect for his fellow  
creatures. Oh daughter of Manu, someone can attain the Original Person by  
following either of these two paths of bhakti and mystic yoga separately that  
I have described. This Bhagavan is the eternal form of the Brahman. He is  
Purusha,ethereal personality of the primal reality,He is transcendental,and  
all His activities are spiritual.   
Time, known as the divine cause of the different manifestations of the living  
entities, constitutes the reason why all living beings who consider themselves  
as existing in separation, from the greatest on, live in fear. He who from  
within first enters all the living entities, is the support of everyone and  
annihilates them again by means of other living beings, is named Vishnu, the  
enjoyer of all sacrifices. He is that time factor, the Master of all masters.  
There is no one specially favored by Him, nobody is his friend or enemy. He  
approaches those who are attentive and of those who are inattentive He is the  
destroyer.   
 He for whom the wind out of fear blows and this sun is shining, for whom out  
of fear Indra sends his rains and the heavenly bodies are shining; He because  
of whom out of fear the trees, creepers and herbs each in their own time bear  
flowers and produce their fruits; He afraid of whom the rivers flow and the  
oceans do not overflow, because of whom fire burns and the earth with her  
mountains does not submerge; He because of whom the sky provides air to those  
who breathe and under the control of whom the universe expands its body of the  
complete reality [mahat-tattva] with its seven layers, He for whom out of fear  
the gods of creation and more, in charge of the basic qualities of nature,  
within this world carry out their functions according to the yugas, He of whom  
afraid all the animate and inanimate beings find their control; that Infinite,  
final operator of beginningless Time is the Unchangeable Creator who creates  
people out of people and by means of death destroys even the Lord of death  
himself.'   
Book 3,Chapter 29_

**_Lord Kapila Describes the Adverse Consequences of Karma_**  
 _Lord Kapila said: 'Just like a mass of clouds has no knowledge of the power of the wind,in the  
same way a person has no knowledge of the great power of the Time, even though  
he is being conditioned by it. Whatever the goods one with difficulty acquired  
for one's happiness, they are destroyed by the Bhagavan, and for this reason  
he laments. In his ignorance he foolishly thinks that having a home, land and  
wealth for the sake of his body, would be something permanent. The living  
being will irrespective of the birth he acquired,in any species he finds  
himself,find satisfaction in this worldly existence. Even being in hell a  
person, who in fact is deluded by the divine Maya, does not wish to give up  
his hellish pleasures. With his body, spouse, children, home, animals, wealth  
and friendships deeply rooted in his heart, he considers himself a great  
success. Burning with anxiety about maintaining all the members of his dear  
family, he is always uncomfortable and sinful,acting like a fool. With his  
heart and senses charmed by the woman and by the display of the sweet words of  
his children, he is in the grip of the illusion,considering that which is non-  
permanent to be eternal. Engaged in the supposed duties of his family life -  
which cause him all kinds of trouble, he is busy countering these miseries  
while thinking that that will make him happy as a householder. Only enjoying  
little of it, he maintains his family by unjust means and the wealth that he  
with violence secured, but following that course he ultimately goes against  
himself. When he, despite his repeated efforts, fails in securing what he  
wished, he will, ruled by greed,desire the wealth enjoyed by others and thus  
get into trouble. No longer capable of maintaining his family the unfortunate  
wretch,being old and bereft of wealth and beauty, then with a bewildered  
intelligence full of grief laments over everything he tried in vain.   
Thus finding himself incapable of supporting his wife and children, he is not  
respected as he was before, the way an old ox is not respected by its farmer.  
Despite getting deformed of old age,and being maintained by the ones he once  
maintained, no aversion against a family life rises in him while he, at home  
awaits his death. Remaining there he, like a pet dog, eats what indifferently  
is placed before him, falls sick with indigestion and eats and does only  
little. In that diseased condition, one?s eyes bulge due to the pressure of  
air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty  
breathing, and upon exhaling and inhaling he produces strange sound, a  
rattling within the throat. Lying down surrounded by his lamenting friends and  
relatives he, with the noose of time around his neck, cannot respond to the  
things said to him. He, who was engrossed in maintaining his family and had no  
control over his senses, thus passes away in great pain, with his relatives in  
tears. Witnessing the arrival of the servants of death with their terrible  
eyes full of wrath, he, because of the fear in his heart, passes stool and  
urine. Like the king's soldiers they immobilize his body by binding him in  
ropes for his punishment, whereupon they drag him like a criminal forcefully  
by the neck over a long distance. Innerly broken by their threatening  
presence he, overtaken, trembles on the road and is bitten by dogs in the  
distress of remembering his sins. Afflicted by hunger, thirst and the heat of  
scorching forest fires and winds on hot and sandy roads, he feels how he  
painfully is beaten on his back with a whip, while he, unable to move, can  
find no refuge or water. Now and then he falls, gets tired and loses  
consciousness, and then again he reawakens on the road of his misery where he  
quickly is led before the eternal ruler of death Yamaraja. He sees his entire  
life passing by in a few moments and then receives the punishment he deserves.  
With his limbs covered by firewood he is cremated or sometimes he sees himself  
eating his own flesh. Vividly he then witnesses how dogs pull out his entrails  
at his last resting place where serpents, scorpions, gnats and so on pester  
him to his abhorrence. One by one his limbs are separated from his body by big  
and small animals who tear him apart, throw him from heights or drag him under  
water or into caves. Because of the unregulated sexual association one  
has,one must, whether one is a man or a woman,undergo the reaction in hellish  
states of anger,self-destruction and bewilderment.   
Actually, heaven and hell exist also in this world, oh mother, so they  
sometimes become visible and experienced here. He who thus in greed,  
attachment and infidelity maintained his family or lived for his stomach only,  
will upon leaving this world in his afterlife have to face the consequences  
for himself and his family. After quitting his body he will enter the darkness  
all alone and pay the price for the harm that he out of self-interest did to  
others in his envy of their fortune. By divine arrangement a man who sustained  
his family has to undergo the hellish reaction of his foul play and suffer  
like someone who lost all his wealth. When a person in his eagerness to care  
for his family is simply godless and unscrupulous in his actions, he heads for  
the darkest region of self-destruction. After he, beginning from the lowest  
position of an animal existence prior to a human birth, in due order has  
undergone all the reactions and so on, he, thus being purified, may again  
return here.'   
Book 3,Chapter 30_

**_Lord Nrisimha Slays the King of the Demons_**  
 _Narada Muni said to Yudhishthhira: 'Having heard explanations of the Truth  
from the Great Prahlada,all the attending Daitya sons (Prahlada's schoolmates)  
accepted his words because of their profundity and rejected what their  
teachers had taught them. When the two sons of the guru [S'ukracarya's sons  
Shanda and Amarka] realized how the intelligence of the boys had gotten fixed  
on this one subject matter, they fearfully contacted the king to submit to him  
what was going on.   
(- the king was Prahlada's father,the great Asura Hiranyakas'ipu. )   
All over his body trembling with anger and with a mind determined to kill his  
son he rebuked Prahlada. With the harshest words he furiously with an angry  
face and crooked, wicked eyes approached him who did not deserve such a  
treatment at all. He from his side gentle and restrained, with his hands  
folded just stood there before his father who was hissing like a vicious snake  
trampled upon.   
Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'Oh you impudent fool, you intriguer of the family, you  
outcaste, you obstinate one going against my rule, I will today send you to  
the abode of Yamaraja! When I am angry all inhabitants of the three worlds and  
their leaders tremble for me. By what power do you so fearlessly overstep my  
rule, you rascal?'.   
Prahlada said: 'He is not only my strength but also yours, oh King and the  
strength of all other exalted and lower living beings. All who move around and  
do not move around, beginning with Lord Brahma, fall under His control. He,  
the supreme controller, the time factor, is Urukrama, the Lord of the Wide  
Steps [Vamana] who is that one strength of one's mind and life, the steadiness  
of one's physical power and senses. He, the True Self, is the Supreme Master  
of the three modes who by His different natural forces creates, maintains and  
withdraws again the entire universe. Please give up the Asura way. Be peaceful  
and create no enemies. Destroy only the true enemy that is an uncontrolled  
mind. That approach is the best method to worship the unlimited Lord. In the  
past there were plunderers who not in control with the six enemies [the mind  
and the five senses] stole away everything. Others saw themselves as  
conquerors of the ten directions. But where are with a saint who managed to  
defeat his senses and is of an equal regard for all living beings, those  
enemies to be found who are a product of one's own imagination?'   
Sri Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'You apparently, with your unlimited pretenses, seek  
your own demise. You prove that people about to die talk gibberish, you  
pityful idiot. You unlucky soul, you talk of someone other than me who would  
be the controller of the universe, but where is He to be found? If He is  
omnipresent, then why do I not see Him in this pillar right in front of me?  
Let that Lord you wished yourself as your protector protect you, now that I am  
going to sever your head from your trunk, now that I am going to put an end to  
someone talking such nonsense like you.'   
Thus with a stream of abuses enraged chastising his son, that great devotee,  
Hiranyakas'ipu, rising from his throne and taking up his sword, with his fist  
struck hard against a column. At that very time from within the column a most  
fearful sound could be heard as if the covering of the universe cracked open.  
That sound dear King, reached as far as the place of the godly ones of Lord  
Brahma and made them believe that the destruction of their abodes was at hand.  
He who in his display of power wanted to kill his son, also heard the  
tumultuous sound one had never heard before and stood together with the  
assembly present amazed about the fact that one could not determine its  
origin. Thus all these men of power were caught in fear. To be true to the  
words that were spoken in defense of His omnipresence, of His pervading each  
and everything, one could see a most wonderful form of Him taking shape in a  
pillar in the middle of the assembly hall. It was neither an animal nor a man.  
The king, studying the phenomenon from all sides, saw how a living being  
emerged from the middle of the pillar. But not being able to ascertain whether  
it was an animal or a human being he said amazed: 'What kind of form is this?  
It is half man and half lion!'   
As he was contemplating the miracle that took place in front of him, the  
extraordinary, most frightening form of Nrisimhadeva appeared. He had eyes  
glowing like molten gold and deadly teeth in a face extending into manes.  
Looking around with a dreadful frown He waved His tongue like a razor sharp  
sword. His ears stood motionless straight up and His nostrils and mouth were  
opened wide like mountain caves. His huge body was short and fat with a broad  
neck and a broad chest over a small waist. His body was covered with whitish  
hairs resembling the rays of the moon and hundreds of arms stretched in all  
directions were equipped with hard to challenge fatal nails who served as  
weapons next to His other personal weapons. Faced with that excellence the  
Daityas and Danavas fled away. 'I guess this is what the Lord so full of  
mystical potency is trying to do in order to get me killed, but what's the  
use?' so Hiranyakas'ipu murmured to himself and taking up his mace the Daitya  
threw himself forward like an elephant to attack the loudly roaring Lord  
Nrisimha. As invisible as an insect that has fallen into a fire, the Asura  
disappeared into the effulgence of Nrisimha. That was something not that  
astonishing at all that moment considering the fact that He with the  
effulgence of His goodness formerly had swallowed the darkness of the entire  
creation. The greatest of the demons reaching Lord Nrisimha thereupon  
furiously with great force exercising his prowess struck Him with his club,  
but the Lord, the Wielder of the Club, seized him just like the son of Garuda  
would capture a great snake.Oh son of Bharata, when He in order to play a game  
allowed the Asura to slip from His hands exactly the way Garuda sometimes  
deals with a snake, the godly ones of the different worlds who were driven  
from their positions, from behind the clouds considered that to be a bad turn  
of events. The demon thinking that He had let him go out of fear for his  
masculine display, after regaining his strength took up his sword and shield  
and with great force attacked Nrisimhadeva for the second time. When he with  
his moon spotted shield and sword fast as a hawk was maneuvering up and down  
so as not to offer any opportunity, the Lord made a very shrill, loud sound of  
laughter that was so frightening that he, with his eyes shortly closed, was  
captured by the Greatest of all Speed. In protest he wrestling with his limbs  
tried to escape, but the Lord placed him whose skin could not even be cut by  
Indra's thunderbolt, at the entrance of the palace on His lap like he was a  
snake or mouse and pierced him with His nails as easy as Garuda pierces a  
poisonous viper. He with His most fearful eyes full of anger was difficult to  
behold. With His mouth wide open licking the edges with His tongue and with  
His mane and face smeared red with traces of blood, He wore the intestines  
like a garland around His neck and looked like a lion that just has killed an  
elephant. The heart He with His pointed nails had ripped out completely and  
thrown aside and the thousands of followers who with their raised weapons  
attended to their leader He all killed using His nails and the other weapons  
in His countless hands. Shaking His manes He scattered the clouds and with His  
glaring glance He outshone the luminaries. The waters and oceans struck by His  
breathing swirled in perturbation and afraid of His roar the elephants  
guarding the quarters of the universe cried. With Him tossing His hair the  
celestial chariots crowding in the sky slipped from their places, the earth  
shook under the heavy weight of His feet, His intolerable force moved the  
mountains and hills and His effulgence outshone everything else in all  
directions of the sky.   
*Hiranyakas'ipu and his brother Hiranyaksha (killed by the Boar Avatar),were actually two doorkeepers of Vaikunta. They were cursed by the great brahmin Sages four Kumaras to become demons,because they would not let them enter the Vaikunta. Hiranyakas'ipu by the power of great dedication and severe penances got the boon from the Lord not die because of any of the living being created by Lord,Neither at home nor outside, neither during the day nor at night, neither from any known weapon nor by any other thing, neither on the ground or in the sky nor by any human being or animal,Neither lifeless things nor living entities, neither demigod or demon nor the great serpents,to have the supremacy in battle and the rule over all embodied souls including the deities of all planets). In the past,Hiranyakas'ipu many times tried to kill his son Prahlada,because of his great devotion,but did not succeed.   
-When two door-keepers and great Devotees Jaya and Vijaya,who later became two great Asuras,were cursed by the Sages,the Lord said:  **' These two will soon elsewhere take birth from a godless womb. With their  
focus of mind intensified by anger, they will remain firmly united with Me and  
before long return to My presence. Know that your curse was ordained by Me  
alone, oh learned ones.'**)

_cont...   
Thereafter sitting in the assembly hall on the highest seat of man with a most  
fearsome, terrible countenance, there was no one to challenge Him nor anyone  
to worship Him. But upon hearing how he, the Daitya who was the headache of  
the three worlds, in the battle had been killed by the Lord, there were  
exclamations of joy, blossoming faces and endless showers of flowers from the  
wives of the demigods. At that time there was an overcast formed by all the  
celestial chariots of the demigods desirous to attend. Drums and kettle drums  
were sounded and the greatest singers and angels of heaven sang and danced.  
All the godly ones, Brahma, Indra and Shiva, the sages, the ancestors, the  
perfected ones, the scientific experts and the great serpents assembled there.  
The founding fathers, the leaders of mankind, the residents of heaven and the  
best of the angels arrived there too, as did the venerable ones, the keepers  
of the wealth and the monkey-like, oh my best one. Also the goblins came, the  
ones of superpower and they who were Vishnu's personal associates like Sunanda  
and Kumuda. With their hands folded before their heads to offer their  
obeisance each of them approached Him who had appeared as half a man, half a  
lion and now sat there on the throne displaying His effulgence.   
Lord Brahma said: 'I bow down before You, oh Inscrutable One of unlimited  
powers. You with all Your might and prowess and the purity of Your actions  
stand for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. While You  
in Your divine game play with the modes, You never change Yourself,and stand  
above this creation.'   
Lord Shiva said: 'The end of the yuga is the time suitable for You to kill in  
anger this insignificant demon; just protect his son, this bhakta of surrender  
next to You, oh caretaker of the devotees.'   
Sri Indra said: 'Our share of the sacrifices was secured by Your Lordship  
protecting us, oh Supreme One. We have no words to describe how afflicted our  
lotus-like hearts were by the Daitya, our hearts that are really Your  
residence. Alas, oh Lord, how insignificant is our world in the grip of Time,  
but for the sake of the devoted ones in Your service You have shed Your light  
so that they may find liberation from their bondage. What else but considering  
the visible world as unimportant would constitute their way oh Nrisimha?'   
The Rishis said: 'You are the shining example who taught us our austerity. By  
this power of Yours this world, oh Original Lord, is created, maintained and  
reabsorbed. That penance was stolen by this unwise soul but is now, oh Shelter  
of the Needy, restored by the protection of Your embodiment.'   
The ancestors [the Pitris] said: 'The demon who engaging with force enjoyed  
our s'raddha sacrifices that were offered by our sons and grandsons, he who  
even at the holy bathing places drank from our offerings of sesame water, by  
piercing the intestines of his belly with the nails of Your hand these  
offerings have reached their proper destination. He, the maintainer of the  
universal principles of religion who appeared as a man-lion, Him we offer our  
obeisances.   
The ones of perfection [the Siddhas] said: 'This most uncivilized and  
dishonest person who stole away the joy of our perfection in yoga and with the  
power of his mysticism and penance was so proud of his wealth, has been torn  
apart by Your nails. We bow down before You, oh Nrisimha.'   
The scientific experts [the Vidyadharas] said: 'Our forms of knowledge that  
each are attained by a different way of concentrating, were pushed aside by  
this fool puffed up about his strength and prowess. He who in battle killed  
him like he was an animal, to Him who appeared as Nrisimha, we surrendered  
souls are ever obliged.'   
The snake people [the Nagas] said: 'By piercing the chest of that greatest of  
all sinners who seized our jewels and beautiful women, You have done our wives  
a great favor. Let us offer You our obeisances.'   
The original fathers [the Manus] said: 'We, the Manus are Your authorities but  
were disrespected by this son of Diti who broke with the moral ties for the  
establishment, oh Lord. With You having killed this villain, oh Master, please  
tell us what we, Your eternal servants, can do for You.'   
The founding fathers [the Prajapatis] said: 'We, the creators of the  
generations owe our lives to You, oh Supreme Controller and not to him who  
denied the living beings that we have put on this world a life. And now, by  
assuming the form of an incarnation of Your pure goodness, You for the well-  
being of the world have split open the chest of him who lies slain.'   
The musicians of heaven [the Gandharvas] said: 'We, oh Lord are Your dancers  
and singers, Your performers, who were brought under the control of the power  
and strength of the one here who You reduced to this condition. Can anyone on  
the path of evil find happiness?'   
The venerable souls [the Caranas] said: 'Oh Lord, Your lotus feet liberate  
from the need to start a new life. We duly seek shelter there because You have  
put an end to this Asura, this snake in the heart of all virtuous people.'   
The keepers of the wealth [the Yakshas] said: 'We, serving You to Your  
pleasure belong to Your best followers. This son of Diti forced us to carry  
his palanquin but caused the sorrow of each and everyone. Thus we acknowledge  
You oh Lord Nrisimha, for You are the one who put him to death, oh twenty-  
fifth principle.'   
The monkey-like beings [the Kimpurushas] said: 'We are questionable humans,  
Kimpurushas but You are the Supreme Lord. And this bad person has been slain  
by You after having been condemned by the saintly ones.'   
The king's bards [the Vaitalikas] said: 'We in great gatherings and arenas of  
sacrifice singing the glories of Your spotless reputation have achieved the  
greatest position of respect. This crooked character who subdued us oh Supreme  
Lord, has to our great fortune been killed by You, like he was a disease.'   
The lower gods [the Kinnaras, those with a human head and an animal body,  
singers of heaven] said: 'Oh Lord, we the Kinnaras are Your faithful servants.  
Because of that son of Diti we had to perform in forced labor, but the sinner  
was by You destroyed, oh Nrisimhadeva, oh Master. Please be there as our  
happiness and welfare.'   
The associates of Lord Vishnu said: 'Today we have seen You in a wondrous  
human-like form. You are our shelter and the happiness of all the worlds. This  
servant of the state, oh Lord, was cursed by the scholars and has therefore  
been killed. We consider that to be Your special grace.'   
Narada Muni said [to Yudhishthhira]: 'None could step forward, not even Lord  
Brahma or Lord Shiva, because He, boiling with anger, was most difficult to  
approach. The Goddess of Fortune personally by the demigods being urged to do  
so could, after seeing Him so huge and wonderful as no one had ever seen or  
heard before, not move in His direction because she was very afraid. Then Lord  
Brahma prompted Prahlada who stood close by: 'My dear son, can you please  
approach the Lord and propitiate Him? He is very angry because of what your  
father did.'   
'Surely' he said and even though he was only a small boy oh King, the great  
devotee slowly, step by step, approached Him and prostrated himself with  
folded hands offering prayers. The godhead was by him, such a little boy  
fallen at His lotus feet, greatly moved and filled with mercy He raised His  
lotus hand, placed it on his head and dispelled the fear for the snake of time  
from all minds present there. Because of that touch he was cleansed from all  
evil. And immediately in this association with the Supreme Soul, with His  
lotus feet, his heart melted being captured in bliss. With Him in his heart  
tears welled in his eyes and symptoms of ecstasy manifested all over his  
body.'

**_The purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam and many Avatars of the Lord Krishna_**  
 _Suta said: "In the beginning the Supreme Lord assumed, for the creation of  
the worlds, the form of the Original Person[Purusha],the cosmic intelligence  
and such,and created the sixteen primary principles [of the ten knowing and  
working senses, the mind and the five elements]. Resting in His meditative  
slumber in that water, out of the lotus that spread from the lake of His  
navel, Brahma was manifested, the master of the progenitors in the universe.  
One supposes the different worlds to be an expansions and the part of the form  
of the Fortunate One that constitutes the excellence of the purest existence.  
In a perfect spiritual vision His form is seen as having numerous legs,  
thighs, arms and faces, with wonderful heads, ears, eyes and noses, all  
glowing with countless garlands, earrings and dresses. This source of the  
numerous incarnations is the imperishable seed from which the plenary portions  
originate as also the portions thereof, such as the gods, the human beings and  
the animals."   
"The first Divinity created were the sons of Brahma,the Kumaras, who performed  
the most difficult discipline of continuous celibacy so they could realize the  
Absolute (Brahman). The Supreme Enjoyer secondly assumed the form of a Boar  
for the welfare of the earth that had sunken to the lowest regions and lifted  
her up from the ocean. Thirdly He accepted His presence among the seers in the  
form of Narada Muni for the sake of evolving the Vedic knowledge of Bhakti  
Yoga free from material motives. Fourth born as the twin sons of Murti, the  
wife of king Dharma, in the form of Nara-Narayaṇa subjected Himself to severe  
penances to attain control over the senses. Fifth He, carrying the name of  
Kapila, gave an exposition to the brahmin Asuri on the nature of metaphysics  
and the elements of creation, because in the course of time that knowledge had  
been lost. Sixth as the son of Atri,named Dattatreya, being born from Anasusa  
who prayed for Him, He lectured to Alarka, Prahlada and others about  
transcendence. Seventh being born from Akuti as Yajna, the son of Prajapati  
Ruci, He together with His son Yama and other demigods, ruled during the  
period of Svayambhuva Manu. Eighth, from the wife of King Nabhi, Merudev?, the  
Almighty Lord took birth as King Rishabha and showed the path of perfection  
respected by people of all stages of life. His ninth incarnation He accepted  
in response to the prayers of the sages, whereupon He as Prithu ruled the  
earth for the sake of collecting her produces, which made her most attractive.  
Assuming the form of a fish Matsya, He after the period of Cakshusha Manu  
protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him in a boat afloat the waters when the  
world was deeply inundated. Eleventh the mighty Lord in the form of a tortoise  
Kurma sustained the Mandaracala Hill of the theists and atheists that served  
as a pivot in the ocean. Twelfth He appeared as Dhanvantari,Lord of medicine,  
and thirteenth He appeared before the atheists as an alluring beautiful woman  
Mohini and gave nectar to the demigods. In His fourteenth incarnation He, half  
as a lion, appeared as Nrisimha, who with His nails on His lap tore apart the  
king of the atheists like a carpenter splitting cane. Fifteenth He assumed the  
form of Vamana who went to the arena of sacrifice of Maharaja Bali to beg for  
only three steps of land, concealing His wish to regain the three worlds. In  
His sixteenth incarnation He as Bhrigupati or Paras'urama saw that the ruling  
class was hostile towards the brahmins and acted twenty-one times against  
them. Seeing that the common people were less intelligent He, seventeenth,  
incarnated as Vyasa taking birth from Satyavati with Paras'ara Muni as His  
father, for the purpose of dividing the Vedas into several branches. Next He  
performed in a superhuman way having assumed the form of a divine human being  
Rama, by controlling the Indian Ocean and such, so that He could act for the  
sake of the godly souls. Nineteenth as also twentieth Bhagavan took birth in  
the Vrishni family as Balarama and Krishna and thus removed the burden from  
the world. Thereafter at the beginning of the Age of Kali He shall appear as  
the son of mother Anjana with the name Buddha for the purpose of deluding the  
ones envious of the theists. Next, at the conjunction of two yugas, when there  
is hardly a ruler to be found who is not a plunderer, the Lord of the Creation  
carrying the name of Kalki will take birth from the ones(or place) famous  
by(with) Vishnu "   
"Dear brahmins, the incarnations of the Lord who appeared from the ocean of  
goodness are as innumerable as the thousands of streams we have from  
inexhaustible sources of water. All the powerful sages, the godly souls, the  
Manus and their progeny as also the Prajapatis [the founding fathers] are  
aspects of the Lord. They are all part of Krishna, the Bhagavan in person who  
offers protection during all ages and in all worlds against disturbances  
because of the enemies of the king of heaven.   
Anyone who in the morning and the evening carefully recites these mysterious  
births of the Lord, will find relief from all miseries of life. All these  
forms of the Lord that by the qualities of the material energy were created  
with the cosmic intelligence and other elements, originated from His Self-  
awareness that is without a form. The less intelligent observer perceives them  
the way one sees clouds in the sky or dust in the air. This unmanifested Self  
is the beyond,cannot be seen or heard and has no form,but the jiva(individual  
soul) affected by the modes of nature takes birth repeatedly. As soon as one  
by self-knowledge arrives at the rejection of all these gross and subtle forms  
that impose themselves on the soul because of ignorance, one arrives at the  
realization of the Absolute Truth. With the illusory energy subsided and  
mindfulness one is endowed with the full knowledge of enlightenment and  
becomes situated in one's own glory. This is how the learned describe  
activities and the births of the actually Unborn and non-engaged Lord of the  
Heart; this is the hidden meaning of the Vedas. Residing within every living  
being He is the omnipotent master and witness of the six qualities and  
opulences, whose play is spotless, who is independent and not affected by  
creation, destruction and maintenance. Because of His expert manipulations His  
activities, names and forms cannot be understood by the speculations and  
speeches of those with a poor fund of knowledge, just like fools cannot  
understand an actor's performance. Only he who renders unconditional,  
uninterrupted, favorable service to His fragrant lotus feet may know the  
transcendental glories of the all-powerful Creator with the wheel of the  
chariot in His hand. When one in this world becomes aware of the Vasudeva who  
embraces all His universes as their Lord and goes into ecstasy because of it,  
one will never again have to experience there the dreadful repetition of  
births."   
"This book called the Bhagavatam about the activities of the One Hailed in the  
Verses,that as a supplement to the Vedas [a Purana] was compiled by the seer  
of God Vyasadeva, is there for the ultimate good of bringing success,  
happiness and perfection to all people. This story, that as the cream from all  
the Vedic literatures and histories was extracted by Vyasa, he delivered to  
his son who is the most respectable one among the self-realized souls. He  
[S'uka] in his turn told it to emperor Parikchit* who, surrounded by the  
greatest sages, sat down at the Ganges to fast until his death. Now that  
Krishna has left for His abode and with Him also proper conduct and spiritual  
insight have vanished, this Purana bright as the sun has appeared at the  
horizon for the sake of everyone who in the Age of Quarrel has lost his  
vision. Oh brahmins, when the story was recited there by that powerful great  
sage, I, being perfectly attentive by his mercy, also managed to understand  
it, so that I will now relate it to you also, exactly as I learned it free  
from deviations by my own mind."   
*Parikchit was the grandson of Arjuna. Son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The emperor who as a child in the womb was protected by Krishna for the continuation of the Yadu dynasty. The first vedic sovereign who laid out the norms for Kali yuga and was cursed by the son of a brahmana to die in seven days. Because of curse,and so He can be able to attain perfection in seven days,was recited the Srimad Bhagavata by Suka, the son of Vyasa, the original author of the book about the Lord and His devotees.

**_The Birth of Emperor Parikchit_**  
 _S 'aunaka said: "The embryo in the womb of Uttara, that was tormented by the  
enormous heat of the invincible weapon released by As'vatthama, was by the  
Lord again awarded a life. How did the birth take place of Emperor Parikchit  
who was so highly intelligent and what where the activities of this great  
soul? How exactly did his demise take place and what destination did he  
achieve? If you think you can tell us this that we, so very faithful, all want  
to hear, please speak to us then about the transcendental knowledge that was  
delivered by S'uka."   
Suta said: "King Yudhishthhira brought prosperity to everyone during his  
reign, the way his father did, by continuous service of Krishna's feet without  
any ulterior motive for material gain or sensual pleasure. The fame of his  
wealth, sacrifices, what he stood for, his queens, his brothers and his  
sovereignty over the planet earth where we are living, even spread to the  
heavenly worlds. But, just as only food may satisfy a hungry man and nothing  
else, he, in his hunger as someone aware of the Redeemer, Mukunda, oh  
brahmins, was not moved by all those earthly desirables that are aspired by  
even the God-fearing souls.   
At the time Parikchit,the great fighter, as a child in his mother's womb, was  
suffering from the heat of the brahmastra weapon, oh son of Bhrigu, he could  
observe the Purusha in a shining appearance. In the blaze he saw at the size  
of not more than a thumb the transcendental, infallible Lord beautiful with a  
dark skin, a golden helmet and lightening clothes. With the riches of His four  
arms, earrings of the purest gold, bloodshot eyes and a club in His hands, He  
was moving about, constantly whirling the club around like it was a torch. As  
He was vanquishing the radiation of the brahmastra like the sun evaporating  
dew drops, He was observed by the child who wondered who He was. He saw how  
the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Lord and protector of righteousness,  
took away the glare. Next the Lord who stretches in all directions all of a  
sudden disappeared from his sight. Thereupon, when the good signs of a  
favorable position of the stars gradually evolved, he took birth, who would  
prove himself to be of a prowess equal to that of Pandu. King Yudhishthhira  
being fully satisfied had priests like Dhaumya and Kripa perform the birth  
ritual with the recitation of auspicious hymns. Knowing where, when and how,  
he in charity rewarded to the occasion of that birth the brahmins with good  
food and gifts of gold, cows, land, housing, elephants and horses. The  
brahmins happily addressed the king, the chief of the Purus, communicating  
that they felt most obliged to the line of the descendants of their ancestor  
King Puru.   
They said: 'This son has been given to you by the all-pervasive and all-  
powerful Lord to show you His mercy in countering his destruction by the  
irresistible, supernatural weapon. Therefore he shall be known all over the  
world as Vishnu-rata, 'Given by Vishnu'. He will no doubt be a most fortunate,  
supreme devotee endowed with all good qualities.'   
The good king said: 'Oh best of the truthful, will he follow in the footsteps  
of all the great souls of this family of saintly kings? Will he be just as  
meritorious and glorious in his achievements?'   
The brahmins answered: 'Oh son of Pritha [Kunti], he will be the maintainer of  
all living entities, exactly like King Ikshvaku, the son of Manu, and he will  
be faithful to his promises and be of respect for the brahmins, just like  
Rama, the son of Das'aratha. He will be as charitable as King S'ibi of  
Us'inara and protect the ones of surrender, and will, just like Bharata, the  
son of Dushyanta who performed many sacrifices, spread the name and fame of  
his family. Among the archers he will be as good as the two Arjunas [his  
grandfather and the king of Haihaya], he will be as irresistible as fire and  
as unsurpassable as the ocean. As powerful as a lion and as worthy for taking  
shelter as the Himalayas, he will be as forbearing as the earth and as  
tolerant as his parents. With a spirit as good as that of the original father  
Brahma, he will be as generous and equanimous as Lord Shiva and be the refuge  
of all living beings as good as the Supreme Lord who is the refuge of the  
Goddess of fortune. Following in the footsteps of Krishna he will be the  
majesty of all divine virtues, he will have the greatness of King Rantideva  
and be as pious as Yayati. Being as patient as Bali Maharaja this child will  
be as devoted as Prahlada was unto Krishna, he will perform many As'vamedha  
sacrifices and be faithful to the elderly and experienced souls. He will  
father a line of saintly kings, will chastise the upstarts and, as a source of  
righteousness in the world, crush the quarrelsome. After being informed about  
his personal death, as caused by a snakebird that was sent by the son of a  
brahmin, he will free himself from his attachments and take to the shelter in  
the Lord. Having inquired about the proper self-knowledge from the son of  
sage Vyasa, oh King, he will abandon his material life on the bank of the  
river Ganges and attain the state of fearlessness. Constantly keeping Lord in  
mind whom he had seen before his birth, He would acquire fame in this world by  
constant investigation. Just like the waxing moon day by day soon becomes  
full, the royal prince under the care of his protective parents day by day  
grew to become soon the one he would be.'   
The brahmins learned in matters of astrology and birth ceremonies, thus having  
informed the king, were generously rewarded and then all returned to their  
homes.   
King Yudhishthhira, desiring to perform a horse sacrifice to be freed from the  
burden of having fought his kinsmen, thought about acquiring funds because all  
he received stemmed from collecting taxes and fines. In respect of his mindful  
wishes, his brothers on the advise of the Lord Krishna went north to collect  
sufficient riches. With the result of those collected riches Yudhishthhira,  
the anxious, pious king, managed to conduct three sacrifices, by means of  
which he worshiped Lord Hari perfectly. The Supreme Lord being invited by the  
king, had the brahmins perform the sacrifices for him and then stayed a few  
months longer to satisfy the desires of His friends. Then, dear brahmins,Lord  
Krishna, with the permission of the king, Draupadi and His relatives,went back  
to Dvaraka, accompanied by Arjuna and other members of the Yadu dynasty."

_**Prithu Maharaja 's Meeting with the Four Kumaras**_  
 _Maitreya said: 'While the citizens were thus praying to the high and mighty King Prithu, four  
sages arrived there as bright as the sun. The king and his associates could  
recognize the masters of yogic perfection,the four Kumaras,by the glaring  
effulgence of their all-embracing sinlessness, who descended from the ethereal  
realm. Seeing the so very desired life of peace before them, King Prithu and  
his followers jumped to their feet as if they were souls whose senses are  
ruled by the modes of nature. After they had accepted that reverence and had  
taken their seats, he humbly,being aware of their full glory, bowed before  
them and was of worship the way it is prescribed, with everything belonging  
to it. The water of washing their feet he sprinkled on the tuft of his hair  
and thus he behaved like men of respect are supposed to behave. Seated on the  
golden throne the older brothers of Bhava looked like the fire on an altar.  
Pleased with them, the king respectfully and with restraint addressed them.  
Prithu said: 'To what do we owe the grace of your audience, of you who are  
fortune personified? It is an encounter difficult to achieve for even the  
greatest yogis. He with whom the learned are pleased, can achieve whatever is  
difficult to achieve in this world or in the hereafter, including the favor of  
the all-auspicious Lord S'iva and Lord Vishnu. Even though you travel around  
in all the worlds, the people cannot see you, just as they cannot see the  
All-knowing witness present within everyone. A person who is not very rich and  
is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly persons are  
present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the  
exalted visitors water, a sitting place and great reception are glorified, and  
that very home itself is also glorified. But, those houses that, abundant with  
all wealth, are not blessed with the water that washed the feet of the great  
saints, are no doubt like a tree with venomous serpents. I welcome you, oh  
best of the twice-born souls, you who move around like children and,  
controlled by vows, with great faith are motivated for liberation. Oh masters,  
can persons who, having fallen into this material existence, are stricken with  
the illness of living to the command of their senses, all by themselves find  
any good fortune? There is no need to ask you about your well-being, for you,  
supreme souls, are not at all concerned with matters of good or bad fortune.  
I am therefore certain that you for us, who suffer the pains of a material  
existence, are the friends to ask how one in this world soon may find  
salvation. Manifesting as the supreme goal in life of the seekers after  
Truth, the Supreme Lord, the Unborn One, in the form of perfected souls like  
you, moves about on this earth in order to show His devotees His mercy.'   
Maitreya said: 'Hearing that most substantial, appropriate and sweet  
conclusion of Prithu, the Kumara satisfied with a smile replied as follows.  
Sanat-kumara said: 'What a good question for you to ask, my dear King, oh you who desires the  
good of all living beings. Learned as you are, you nevertheless pose this  
question. This speaks for you as someone of wisdom of the saint. An  
association of devotees in which there is discussion, questioning and  
answering, is appreciated by both the parties [of speakers and listeners], and  
real happiness for all will expand from it. Oh King, you are evidently  
attached to the praises of the Lord's lotus feet. Difficult as it is, that,  
given a steady practice, will free the indwelling soul from the dirt of lusty  
feelings. In the scriptures is defended that only the absence of attachment to  
other matters than the soul, in combination with an intense attachment to the  
True Self transcendental to the modes of nature, constitutes the perfect  
conviction for the salvation of man. That is realized when one as a dutiful  
devotee with faith and devotion, by means of discussion, inquiry,and  
determination,with respect for the Lord of Yoga regularly attends and listens  
to the stories of the God-fearing souls. Reluctant to associate with the  
company of those who hanker after money, sense gratification and the acquiring  
of goods,one should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace  
without drinking the nectar of the glorification of Hari. With nonviolence,  
following the footsteps of the Guru, by remembering the Lord of Liberation, by  
testifying of His activities, by the following yoga principles without a  
material motive and by practicing in line with the precepts one, thus being  
without offenses, should live a simple life tolerating worldly dualities. When  
someone always listens about transcendental qualities of the Lord, it may be  
so that one's devotion and Truth consciousness grows,and he easily becomes  
attached to the Brahman. When the person in respect of the Guru, by the force  
of detachment and jnana,completely surrenders to the Supreme, the covering  
within the heart that consists of the five elements will be burned like fuel  
being burned by fire. After one is freed from inner weakness and dominance of  
the material qualities, there is no longer a difference, as there was in the  
past, between the inner and the outer,and this difference being a dream is  
finished. For such a soul that difference has ended, just like a dream ends  
when one wakes up. The one becomes aware how desire bounds the Soul, but there  
is no more division and separation,and he sees himself beyond,as the Witness.  
Because the ruminating mind is agitated by the senses that are drawn towards  
the sense objects, the pure consciousness is easily lost, just like a lake  
easily can be overgrown by plants. Wise ones state that when remembrance is  
lost, all knowledge acquired is based on a false foundation. The constant  
mindfulness of one's consciousness is destroyed and real knowledge is lost.  
There is no stronger obstruction to one's self-interest than thinking other  
matters to be more pleasing than one's self-realization. When one constantly  
thinks of riches and sensual pleasures, all the virtues of human society are  
destroyed. For that reason bereft of knowledge and devotion, one then lapses  
into the inertia [the ignorance]. They who want to cross over that ocean of  
ignorance quickly, should never cling to the slowness of matter(tamas), for  
that is the great stumbling block,as even the virtues of religiousness,  
economic development and sense gratification [dharma, artha, kama]. In this  
respect liberation is likely to be the most important virtue, because being  
engaged in the interest of the other three paths, one regularly finds oneself  
caught in the grip of death and in fear. Following these three notions of a  
higher or lower form of life, one will never find any security, since they,  
depending on the interaction of the material modes, are all destroyed by the  
ordinance of the Lord [in the form of Time]. Oh best of kings, be therefore,  
just as I am, convinced of Him, the Supreme Lord who from within the heart  
everywhere manifests as the Master of the Field. Therein radiating into every  
hair follicle, He is there for the self-realization, for all the moving and  
not moving living beings covered by a body endowed with senses and a life-  
breath. Surrender to Him, the root cause manifesting as the truth within the  
untruth. By this deliberate consideration one is freed from the illusions and  
from the mistake taking the rope as a snake. One is then situated in the pure  
truth, the truth of the original nature transcendental to all the impurities  
of one's karmic activities. Be devoted to Vasudeva. For the devotees who find  
Him by devotion, the One whose lotus toes bring joy, the hard knot of karmic  
desire is uprooted, but that is never so with people missing that respect,  
however hard they try to stop the waves of sense enjoyment. Great is the  
hardship of the ones immersed in material life,which is like an ocean filled  
with the sharks of the six senses. Being unhappy it is very difficult to cross  
that ocean full of misfortune, that danger of separate existence, and  
therefore you should make the worshipable lotus feet of the Supreme Lord your  
boat.'

Maitreya said: 'Thus in full being informed about the ins and outs of  
spiritual advancement by the son of Brahma - the Kumara who was so well versed  
in spiritual knowledge - the king praised him and then spoke. The king said: 'You all, oh brahmins, oh powerful souls, have arrived here in order to  
confirm what was promised by Him, the Lord who from His causeless mercy is so  
compassionate with the distressed. It is my duty, therefore, to offer you  
something, but all I have now are but remnants of food taken by great saintly  
persons. What shall I give except my heart and soul? My life, wife and  
children, oh brahmins, my home with everything belonging to it, my kingdom,  
power, land and treasury, I therefore offer all to you. The post of the  
commander in chief and ruler of the state, the first to chastise or the  
proprietor of the whole planet, are no doubt only reserved for those who know  
the Vedic scriptures. A brahmin enjoys his own food, wears his own clothes  
and gives what he has in charity. It is by his mercy that the kshatriyas [the  
rulers] and the other parts of society eat their food. How can such persons,  
who have done unlimited mercy by explaining the path of self-realization, and  
whose explanations are given for our enlightenment with complete conviction  
and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded palms containing water for  
their satisfaction?'   
Maitreya said: 'After the masters of self-realization had been worshiped by  
the original king, they praised his character and then, for all people to see,  
disappeared in the sky. The son of Vena, the first among the great  
personalities, who according to the teachings had arrived at self-  
realization, considered himself as someone fully satisfied. For the sake of  
the Absolute Truth he performed as good as possible,and as far as his means  
would allow, according to the time, the circumstances and his capacity all his  
actions. Fully dedicated to the Supreme Spirit he, free from attachments  
being of renunciation, always thought of the Lord, the Supersoul beyond this  
material nature. Even though he lived at home, he never felt attracted to all  
the opulence of his mighty kingdom, nor did he indulge in sensual pleasures,  
just like the sun never responds to what it illuminates. Always engaging  
spiritually, he thus begot five sons in his wife Arci who fully met his  
expectations. Their names were Vijitas'va, Dhumrakes'a, Haryaksha, Dravina and  
Vrika. In his personal surrender to the Infallible One he, for the protection  
of the created universe, pleased the citizens during his time with his kind-  
hearted words and actions. The king thus was known as the King of the Moon,  
while he, on the other hand, was like the Sun god in his distributing,  
exacting and ruling over the wealth of the world. In his exercise of power he  
was as unconquerable as fire, he was as insuperable as the King of Heaven, as  
tolerant as the earth itself and alike heaven in fulfilling all desires of  
human society. Just as rainfall satisfies everyone's desires, Maharaja Pṛthu  
used to satisfy everyone. He was like the sea in that no one could understand  
his depths, and he was like Meru, the king of hills, in the fixity of his  
purpose. He was like the King of Righteousness [Yamaraja] in his education, he  
was alike the Himalayas in his opulence, he was like Kuvera in keeping the  
wealth and alike Varuna [the ruler of the waters] in his secrecy. He was as  
all-pervading as the air [the wind] concerning his physical strength, courage  
and power, and he was as inexorable as the most powerful Rudra. He was as  
beautiful as Cupid, he was as attentive as the lion, the king of the animals,  
in his affection he was alike Svayambhuva Manu and in matters of controlling  
the people he resembled the Unborn Lord, Brahma. He understood spiritual  
matters alike Brihaspati, in his personal self-control he was alike the  
Supreme Lord, in his devotion to the cows, the spiritual master and the  
brahmins he was as great devotees, in his shyness he was the most gentle one  
and in matters of philanthropy he was [as good] as he was for himself. All  
over the three worlds the general public loudly declared - and surely all the  
lovers of truth and the women from everywhere came to hear about it - that his  
name and fame was as great as the glory of Rama.'

**_Maharaja Priyavrata_**  
 _The King Parikchit said: 'Why, oh sage, was Priyavrata, the great devotee  
who takes pleasure in self-realization, so happy to stay at home, the place  
that is the root cause of bondage and which is against the main purpose of  
human life(self realisation)? Surely such a thing as indulgence in family  
affairs, oh wisest of the twice-born, cannot be desirable for that kind of  
people who are threading this path? It suffers no doubt that all the great  
souls find their satisfaction in the shade of the feet of the Lord praised in  
the verses, and not so much in the mind of attachment to kith and kin. This is  
my great doubt, oh brahmin: how can someone attached to his wife, home,  
children and so on, find perfection and an unfailing determination to realise  
Krishna?'   
Suka said: 'You are perfectly right in what you said about the hearts of  
liberated persons and devotees that are absorbed in the nectarean honey of the  
talks at the lotus-like feet of their beloved Lord praised in the scriptures.  
Despite the setbacks they sometimes encounter, they practically never give up  
their most exalted position. It is a well-known fact, oh King, that prince  
Priyavrata indeed was a supreme devotee who, in his service at Narada's feet,  
very quickly became aware of the complete truth concerning the spiritual  
purpose that he constantly discussed in dedicated enthusiasm. Even though his  
father asked him to rule over the surface of the earth because he incorporated  
so many of the best qualities, he could not be happy with it. He did not want  
to be distracted from yoga,but wished to be absorbed in the Supreme Lord of  
the Soul of the Universe. Therefore, although the order of his father could  
not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously  
raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by  
accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world. And so it happened that  
the first among the demigods Lord Brahma,surrounded by all his personal  
associates and the Vedas, descended from his abode. It is He who is always  
thinking of the welfare of the complete of this universal creation consisting  
of the three modes. He knows its ultimate purpose, the Supreme Soul, from  
which He originated Himself. Just like the full moon surrounded by  
illuminating stars, He on his way here and there by the leaders of the  
demigods was worshiped from their heavenly carriers. And the same was done by  
groups of perfected ones, inhabitants of heaven, refined ones, singers and  
sages [respectively the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Caranas, the Sadhyas and  
the Munis] when he thus as the shining jewel reached the vicinity of the  
Gandhamadana mountains where Priyavrata was meditating. Recognizing the swan-  
carrier of his almighty father Lord Hiranyagarbha the devarishi Narada,  
Priyavrata and his father Svayambhuva Manu present there immediately rose to  
their feet with their hands folded in order to worship the Lord. Oh son of  
Bharata, the Lord, the original person of the universe, who thus out of  
gratitude for the glory of his descent, according to the customs, was  
confronted with the articles of worship and the praise of his qualities in  
lofty language, then addressed Priyavrata, while he looked at him with a  
compassionate smile.   
The great Lord said: 'My son, pay attention to the truth I am telling you. You  
should not be jealous of the Godhead who is beyond our ken. We, Lord Shiva,  
your father and this great Rishi Narada all carry out His order and cannot  
deviate. No living entity that accepted a material body can escape from what  
was decided by Him; not by austerity nor by education, not by yoga nor by  
one's strength or intelligence, nor can one ever defy His will by one's  
opulence, by the virtue of one's duty, with the help of someone else or by any  
personal endeavor. Oh my dear, under the direction of the One Unseen, all  
living entities accept it to be connected to a material body for performing  
actions according to their karma and are thus always bound to birth and death,  
sadness and illusion, fear, happiness and distress. My dear boy, all of us are  
bound by the Vedic injunctions to the divisions of varṇasrama according to our  
qualities and work. These divisions are difficult to avoid. We must therefore  
carry out our duties of varṇasrama-dharma, like bulls obliged to move  
according to the direction of a driver pulling on ropes knotted to their  
noses. My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes  
of material nature, the Supreme gives us our specific bodies and the happiness  
and distress we achieve. One must therefore remain situated as he is and be  
conducted by the Supreme Lord, exactly as a blind man is led by a person who  
has eyes. Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has  
received according to his past karma. Without misconceptions, however, he  
regards his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an awakened  
person regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and  
never works to achieve another material body under the influence of the three  
modes of material nature. Someone not paying attention to this and someone not  
willing to control his senses has, even when he resides in the forest, to fear  
of the six co-wives [of the five senses and the mind]. But on the other hand  
what harm can a householder's existence do to a self-satisfied, learned man  
who has conquered his senses? Having entered a household existence, anyone  
who wants to conquer those six adversaries must first try to master them from  
within that stronghold. For only when the unregulated desires have lost their  
strength one, thus having ripened with experience, can move about freely. My  
dear Priyavrata, seek shelter at the lotus of the feet of the Lord, whose  
navel is also like a beautiful lotus. Thus conquer the six sense organs.  
Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you  
to do this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be  
able to carry out the Lord's orders. After one has been trained thus and his  
lusty desires have decreased, he can move anywhere without danger.'_

**__Liberation from ignorance**  
 _The Lord Kapila said: 'Even though abides in a material body, the Soul is not affected by the basic  
qualities of matter because he does not claim doership and thus is not subject  
to change, just like the sun is not affected by being reflected in water. But  
when this very Soul is affected with the modes of material nature it becomes  
bewildered by the ego sense and thinks: 'I am the doer'. Dealing with material  
nature in such a way,the wrong actions are the result,and he in discontent,  
helplessly undergoes the repeated birth and death,in births from different  
wombs or species depending on the good or bad life he led or a combination of  
these. Like having landed in a nightmare wherein the things happening do not  
really exist, there is for the Soul, who only thinks and sees what occurs to  
his senses, no end to his materially conditioned existence and illusion.  
Therefore the mind of attachment to material pleasure must, free from  
attachment, gradually be brought under control with the bhakti. Beginning with  
yama [meaning the great vow of yoga of nonviolence, truth, non-stealing,  
celibacy and non-possessiveness in the discipline of detachment], one should  
practice the different forms of yoga and develop, endowed with faith,  
unalloyed devotion unto Me by listening my stories,reading and reflecting on  
the teachings of the Truth. Therein one must be without enmity and regard all  
living beings as equal, not entertain intimate relations and be celibate, be  
free from chatter and offer the results of one's labor. One should be  
satisfied with whatever comes of its own, eat little and live thoughtfully in  
a secluded place and be peaceful, kind, compassionate and self-realized. In  
relating to others and to one's body one should not follow the physical  
concept of life but rather, from the spiritual perspective attend to the  
factual truth of both the material and the personal aspect. One should  
transcend the stages of consciousness [of waking, dreaming and deep sleep] and  
stay away from other conceptions of life. Thus, with a purified intellect, the  
true Self, the Soul within, should be seen as clear as the sun before one's  
eyes. A liberated soul realizes the Truth, which is beyond and which is  
manifest as a reflection in the false ego. He is the support of the material  
cause and He enters into everything. He is Absolute, one without a second, and  
He is the eye of the illusory energy. It is like with the sun that can be seen  
as a reflection on water or on a wall, but factually is situated in the sky.  
The Truth is reflected in the threefold nature of the materially identified  
ego that consists of body, senses and mind. Someone who in this material world  
wrongly identifies with the material elements, the objects of enjoyment, the  
material senses, the mind, intelligence and so on, is actually in deep sleep,  
but once he is awakened he is freed from false ego and illusion. Even though  
not being lost, still the Soul unjustly considers himself lost. But through  
the path of yoga,established in Jnana,he sees himself as a witness,not  
affected with material nature,and with it, he sees also unreality of the ego.  
Coming to understand this,he realizes his true Self,Atma, his original  
individuality [svarupa].'   
Devahuti said: 'Dear brahmin, is it not so that material nature never releases  
the soul because the two are eternally attracted to each other, oh Best One?  
Just as aroma and earth have no separate existence and taste does not exist  
apart from water, intelligence cannot exist independent of consciousness.  
Then how can a soul be free from material nature? Is the soul, being a passive  
observer, not forced to act because of the basic qualities of matter? The  
great fear, one may avoid by contemplating the fundamental principles, will  
not cease because every time its cause appears again.'   
The Bhagavan said: 'One will realize the freedom, when one, with a pure mind serious unto Me and  
faithfully contemplates on the Truth with devotion, manages to perform one's  
duties without desiring the fruits thereof. By means of Jnana, with the vision  
of the Absolute Truth, by penance,with renunciation, detached and firmly fixed  
in that same Truth, one becomes absorbed in the Self. Bound to material nature  
he is day after day consumed, like firewood by fire, disappearing gradually.  
But experiencing his dependency, understanding the futility of the desire to  
always enjoy, he, thus forsaking sensual pleasures, firmly stands in his own  
glory. The many inauspicious matters a person may dream of in his sleep, will  
not in the least daunt him when he has awakened. Someone, who has fixed his  
mind upon Me, the knower of the Absolute Truth within, thus has nothing to  
fear from material nature. When someone wise thus for many years and many  
births is engaged in self-realization, he will develop a distaste for enjoying  
whatever, even the heaven of the creator. Someone devoted to Me who under My  
protection for the sake of awakening his intelligence, by My unlimited mercy  
goes for the ultimate goal of his existence that is called kaivalya  
[enlightenment, emancipation, beatitude], will in this life soon attain a  
steady self-awareness and be free from doubt. The yogi who departed for that  
heavenly abode will, after leaving behind both the subtle and the gross body,  
never return. When the attention of the perfected yogi is not drawn towards  
yogic powers to control the material illusion, my dear mother, then, having no  
other purpose in his life, his progress towards Me will be unbounded, because  
the power of death is lost therein.'   
Book 3,Chapter 27_

**_Explanation of Bhakti Yoga by Lord Kapila   
_**  
 _Devah?ti said: "Please elaborate now at length on the path of bhakti yoga  
that one calls the ultimate purpose."   
Maitreya said: 'Appreciating the words of His mother, oh best of the Kurus,  
the great and gentle sage, contented and being moved by compassion, said the  
following. The Bhagavan said: 'O noble lady, there are many paths and ways of bhakti yoga,depending on  
natural disposition and temperaments of seekers. What one does out of love for  
Me in a spirit of violence, pride and envy or out of anger with a fractional  
view,is considered to be in the mode of darkness(tamas). He who worships Me  
with idols and aims at material things, fame and opulence, is in the mode of  
passion (rajas). Someone who worships Me with offering the results of his  
actions or when he for the sake of transcendence desires to be free from karma  
[profit-minded action],that bhakti is said to be in the mode of goodness  
(sattva). In case of an uninterrupted thinking of Me who is present in  
everyone's heart - just like the water of the Ganges that continuously flows  
towards the ocean - and when one wishes to hear about My qualities only,  
having no ulterior motives, one may speak of pure devotion, of bhakti unto the  
Supreme One. Pure devotees will not accept it - not even when being offered  
these - to be equal with Me, to have the same opulence, to be a personal  
associate, to have the same bodily features or to be joined in oneness,but  
only to be in My service. When one by means of this bhakti yoga - which one  
calls the highest aim - succeeds in dealing with the three modes of nature the  
way I explained it, one attains My transcendental nature. When one performs  
one's duties without attachment to the results one is stronger, and when one  
without unnecessary violence regularly and with dedication practice this yoga,  
one will find happiness. The same as someone worships My statue,by seeing it,  
offering respect to it,by offering obeisances, praise and worship,he should  
,in the spirit of detachment and in the mode of goodness, think of Me and see  
Me being present in all living beings. By means of sense control and proper  
regulation [yama and niyama], being of the greatest respect for the great  
souls, being compassionate with the poor and by being friendly in association  
with like-minded souls; by hearing about spiritual matters, chanting My holy  
names, being straightforward, by association with civilized people and not  
entertaining false ego, the consciousness of a person who with these qualities  
is dutiful towards Me is completely purified. No doubt he by simply hearing  
about My excellence will directly reach Me. The way the sense of smell catches  
the aroma that is carried from its source by means of the air, similarly  
consciousness by means of yoga catches the Supreme Soul who is free from  
change.   
When one who worships the deity but has no respect for Me who, in the form of  
the All pervading Soul, is always situated in every living being,this is  
nothing but a hypocrisy. Someone who in worship of the deity has no regard for  
Me as the Supreme Ruler present in all beings, is in his ignorance only  
offering oblations into the ashes. He who offers Me his respects but is  
envious, lives in his campaigning against others and in enmity, will never  
find peace of mind. Oh sinless one, I am certainly not pleased when they who  
manage to worship Me in My deity form, are not of respect for other living  
beings. Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the  
Ishvara until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of  
other living beings as well. For those who discriminate with regard to the  
body of themselves and that of others, for those who make distinction between  
them and others,as the blazing fire of death, I will cause great fear. One  
should therefore, with charity, respect and in friendship regarding everyone  
as an equal, propitiate Me, the One True Self abiding in all.   
Living entities are better developed than inanimate objects, better than  
entities with life symptoms, oh blessed one, are entities with a developed  
consciousness and better than those are they who developed sense perception.  
Among them, those who developed taste are better than those who only developed  
a sense of touch and better than they are those who developed a sense of  
smell. Even better are those creatures who developed the faculty to hear.  
Better than those are the ones distinguishing differences of form and those  
who have teeth in both their jaws are better than these. Those who have many  
legs are superior to them. Of them the four-legged creatures are the ones  
better developed,while the two-legged ones are even better. Among human  
beings a society with four classes is the better one and of those classes the  
brahmins are the best. Among the brahmins the better one is who knows the  
Vedas, but best of those are the Brahmins who know its purpose.   
The one who puts an end to all doubts is better than he who knows what the  
purpose of the Vedas is and the brahmin among them who performs his duty is  
better than him. He who is free from worldly attachment is still better and  
the one who performs his righteous duty not for himself alone is the best  
developed of them all.   
Therefore I know of no greater being than a person who with a dedicated mind  
has offered all of his actions, wealth and life without any reservation to Me  
and with persistence is of service without any other interest or motive,but  
only from the deep love. Such a one who regards the Supreme Lord, the  
Controller of the individual soul, as having entered all the living beings in  
the form of the Paramatma, is therefore mindfully of respect for his fellow  
creatures. Oh daughter of Manu, someone can attain the Original Person by  
following either of these two paths of bhakti and mystic yoga separately that  
I have described. This Bhagavan is the eternal form of the Brahman. He is  
Purusha,ethereal personality of the primal reality,He is transcendental,and  
all His activities are spiritual.   
Time, known as the divine cause of the different manifestations of the living  
entities, constitutes the reason why all living beings who consider themselves  
as existing in separation, from the greatest on, live in fear. He who from  
within first enters all the living entities, is the support of everyone and  
annihilates them again by means of other living beings, is named Vishnu, the  
enjoyer of all sacrifices. He is that time factor, the Master of all masters.  
There is no one specially favored by Him, nobody is his friend or enemy. He  
approaches those who are attentive and of those who are inattentive He is the  
destroyer.   
 He for whom the wind out of fear blows and this sun is shining, for whom out  
of fear Indra sends his rains and the heavenly bodies are shining; He because  
of whom out of fear the trees, creepers and herbs each in their own time bear  
flowers and produce their fruits; He afraid of whom the rivers flow and the  
oceans do not overflow, because of whom fire burns and the earth with her  
mountains does not submerge; He because of whom the sky provides air to those  
who breathe and under the control of whom the universe expands its body of the  
complete reality [mahat-tattva] with its seven layers, He for whom out of fear  
the gods of creation and more, in charge of the basic qualities of nature,  
within this world carry out their functions according to the yugas, He of whom  
afraid all the animate and inanimate beings find their control; that Infinite,  
final operator of beginningless Time is the Unchangeable Creator who creates  
people out of people and by means of death destroys even the Lord of death  
himself.'

**_Lord Kapila Describes the Adverse Consequences of Karma_**  
 _Lord Kapila said: 'Just like a mass of clouds has no knowledge of the power of the wind,in the  
same way a person has no knowledge of the great power of the Time, even though  
he is being conditioned by it. Whatever the goods one with difficulty acquired  
for one's happiness, they are destroyed by the Bhagavan, and for this reason  
he laments. In his ignorance he foolishly thinks that having a home, land and  
wealth for the sake of his body, would be something permanent. The living  
being will irrespective of the birth he acquired,in any species he finds  
himself,find satisfaction in this worldly existence. Even being in hell a  
person, who in fact is deluded by the divine Maya, does not wish to give up  
his hellish pleasures. With his body, spouse, children, home, animals, wealth  
and friendships deeply rooted in his heart, he considers himself a great  
success. Burning with anxiety about maintaining all the members of his dear  
family, he is always uncomfortable and sinful,acting like a fool. With his  
heart and senses charmed by the woman and by the display of the sweet words of  
his children, he is in the grip of the illusion,considering that which is non-  
permanent to be eternal. Engaged in the supposed duties of his family life -  
which cause him all kinds of trouble, he is busy countering these miseries  
while thinking that that will make him happy as a householder. Only enjoying  
little of it, he maintains his family by unjust means and the wealth that he  
with violence secured, but following that course he ultimately goes against  
himself. When he, despite his repeated efforts, fails in securing what he  
wished, he will, ruled by greed,desire the wealth enjoyed by others and thus  
get into trouble. No longer capable of maintaining his family the unfortunate  
wretch,being old and bereft of wealth and beauty, then with a bewildered  
intelligence full of grief laments over everything he tried in vain.   
Thus finding himself incapable of supporting his wife and children, he is not  
respected as he was before, the way an old ox is not respected by its farmer.  
Despite getting deformed of old age,and being maintained by the ones he once  
maintained, no aversion against a family life rises in him while he, at home  
awaits his death. Remaining there he, like a pet dog, eats what indifferently  
is placed before him, falls sick with indigestion and eats and does only  
little. In that diseased condition, one?s eyes bulge due to the pressure of  
air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty  
breathing, and upon exhaling and inhaling he produces strange sound, a  
rattling within the throat. Lying down surrounded by his lamenting friends and  
relatives he, with the noose of time around his neck, cannot respond to the  
things said to him. He, who was engrossed in maintaining his family and had no  
control over his senses, thus passes away in great pain, with his relatives in  
tears. Witnessing the arrival of the servants of death with their terrible  
eyes full of wrath, he, because of the fear in his heart, passes stool and  
urine. Like the king's soldiers they immobilize his body by binding him in  
ropes for his punishment, whereupon they drag him like a criminal forcefully  
by the neck over a long distance. Innerly broken by their threatening  
presence he, overtaken, trembles on the road and is bitten by dogs in the  
distress of remembering his sins. Afflicted by hunger, thirst and the heat of  
scorching forest fires and winds on hot and sandy roads, he feels how he  
painfully is beaten on his back with a whip, while he, unable to move, can  
find no refuge or water. Now and then he falls, gets tired and loses  
consciousness, and then again he reawakens on the road of his misery where he  
quickly is led before the eternal ruler of death Yamaraja. He sees his entire  
life passing by in a few moments and then receives the punishment he deserves.  
With his limbs covered by firewood he is cremated or sometimes he sees himself  
eating his own flesh. Vividly he then witnesses how dogs pull out his entrails  
at his last resting place where serpents, scorpions, gnats and so on pester  
him to his abhorrence. One by one his limbs are separated from his body by big  
and small animals who tear him apart, throw him from heights or drag him under  
water or into caves. Because of the unregulated sexual association one  
has,one must, whether one is a man or a woman,undergo the reaction in hellish  
states of anger,self-destruction and bewilderment.   
Actually, heaven and hell exist also in this world, oh mother, so they  
sometimes become visible and experienced here. He who thus in greed,  
attachment and infidelity maintained his family or lived for his stomach only,  
will upon leaving this world in his afterlife have to face the consequences  
for himself and his family. After quitting his body he will enter the darkness  
all alone and pay the price for the harm that he out of self-interest did to  
others in his envy of their fortune. By divine arrangement a man who sustained  
his family has to undergo the hellish reaction of his foul play and suffer  
like someone who lost all his wealth. When a person in his eagerness to care  
for his family is simply godless and unscrupulous in his actions, he heads for  
the darkest region of self-destruction. After he, beginning from the lowest  
position of an animal existence prior to a human birth, in due order has  
undergone all the reactions and so on, he, thus being purified, may again  
return here.'

**_Lord Nrisimha Slays the King of the Demons_**  
 _Narada Muni said to Yudhishthhira: 'Having heard explanations of the Truth  
from the Great Prahlada,all the attending Daitya sons (Prahlada's schoolmates)  
accepted his words because of their profundity and rejected what their  
teachers had taught them. When the two sons of the guru [S'ukracarya's sons  
Shanda and Amarka] realized how the intelligence of the boys had gotten fixed  
on this one subject matter, they fearfully contacted the king to submit to him  
what was going on.   
(- the king was Prahlada's father,the great Asura Hiranyakas'ipu. )   
All over his body trembling with anger and with a mind determined to kill his  
son he rebuked Prahlada. With the harshest words he furiously with an angry  
face and crooked, wicked eyes approached him who did not deserve such a  
treatment at all. He from his side gentle and restrained, with his hands  
folded just stood there before his father who was hissing like a vicious snake  
trampled upon.   
Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'Oh you impudent fool, you intriguer of the family, you  
outcaste, you obstinate one going against my rule, I will today send you to  
the abode of Yamaraja! When I am angry all inhabitants of the three worlds and  
their leaders tremble for me. By what power do you so fearlessly overstep my  
rule, you rascal?'.   
Prahlada said: 'He is not only my strength but also yours, oh King and the  
strength of all other exalted and lower living beings. All who move around and  
do not move around, beginning with Lord Brahma, fall under His control. He,  
the supreme controller, the time factor, is Urukrama, the Lord of the Wide  
Steps [Vamana] who is that one strength of one's mind and life, the steadiness  
of one's physical power and senses. He, the True Self, is the Supreme Master  
of the three modes who by His different natural forces creates, maintains and  
withdraws again the entire universe. Please give up the Asura way. Be peaceful  
and create no enemies. Destroy only the true enemy that is an uncontrolled  
mind. That approach is the best method to worship the unlimited Lord. In the  
past there were plunderers who not in control with the six enemies [the mind  
and the five senses] stole away everything. Others saw themselves as  
conquerors of the ten directions. But where are with a saint who managed to  
defeat his senses and is of an equal regard for all living beings, those  
enemies to be found who are a product of one's own imagination?'   
Sri Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'You apparently, with your unlimited pretenses, seek  
your own demise. You prove that people about to die talk gibberish, you  
pityful idiot. You unlucky soul, you talk of someone other than me who would  
be the controller of the universe, but where is He to be found? If He is  
omnipresent, then why do I not see Him in this pillar right in front of me?  
Let that Lord you wished yourself as your protector protect you, now that I am  
going to sever your head from your trunk, now that I am going to put an end to  
someone talking such nonsense like you.'   
Thus with a stream of abuses enraged chastising his son, that great devotee,  
Hiranyakas'ipu, rising from his throne and taking up his sword, with his fist  
struck hard against a column. At that very time from within the column a most  
fearful sound could be heard as if the covering of the universe cracked open.  
That sound dear King, reached as far as the place of the godly ones of Lord  
Brahma and made them believe that the destruction of their abodes was at hand.  
He who in his display of power wanted to kill his son, also heard the  
tumultuous sound one had never heard before and stood together with the  
assembly present amazed about the fact that one could not determine its  
origin. Thus all these men of power were caught in fear. To be true to the  
words that were spoken in defense of His omnipresence, of His pervading each  
and everything, one could see a most wonderful form of Him taking shape in a  
pillar in the middle of the assembly hall. It was neither an animal nor a man.  
The king, studying the phenomenon from all sides, saw how a living being  
emerged from the middle of the pillar. But not being able to ascertain whether  
it was an animal or a human being he said amazed: 'What kind of form is this?  
It is half man and half lion!'   
As he was contemplating the miracle that took place in front of him, the  
extraordinary, most frightening form of Nrisimhadeva appeared. He had eyes  
glowing like molten gold and deadly teeth in a face extending into manes.  
Looking around with a dreadful frown He waved His tongue like a razor sharp  
sword. His ears stood motionless straight up and His nostrils and mouth were  
opened wide like mountain caves. His huge body was short and fat with a broad  
neck and a broad chest over a small waist. His body was covered with whitish  
hairs resembling the rays of the moon and hundreds of arms stretched in all  
directions were equipped with hard to challenge fatal nails who served as  
weapons next to His other personal weapons. Faced with that excellence the  
Daityas and Danavas fled away. 'I guess this is what the Lord so full of  
mystical potency is trying to do in order to get me killed, but what's the  
use?' so Hiranyakas'ipu murmured to himself and taking up his mace the Daitya  
threw himself forward like an elephant to attack the loudly roaring Lord  
Nrisimha. As invisible as an insect that has fallen into a fire, the Asura  
disappeared into the effulgence of Nrisimha. That was something not that  
astonishing at all that moment considering the fact that He with the  
effulgence of His goodness formerly had swallowed the darkness of the entire  
creation. The greatest of the demons reaching Lord Nrisimha thereupon  
furiously with great force exercising his prowess struck Him with his club,  
but the Lord, the Wielder of the Club, seized him just like the son of Garuda  
would capture a great snake.Oh son of Bharata, when He in order to play a game  
allowed the Asura to slip from His hands exactly the way Garuda sometimes  
deals with a snake, the godly ones of the different worlds who were driven  
from their positions, from behind the clouds considered that to be a bad turn  
of events. The demon thinking that He had let him go out of fear for his  
masculine display, after regaining his strength took up his sword and shield  
and with great force attacked Nrisimhadeva for the second time. When he with  
his moon spotted shield and sword fast as a hawk was maneuvering up and down  
so as not to offer any opportunity, the Lord made a very shrill, loud sound of  
laughter that was so frightening that he, with his eyes shortly closed, was  
captured by the Greatest of all Speed. In protest he wrestling with his limbs  
tried to escape, but the Lord placed him whose skin could not even be cut by  
Indra's thunderbolt, at the entrance of the palace on His lap like he was a  
snake or mouse and pierced him with His nails as easy as Garuda pierces a  
poisonous viper. He with His most fearful eyes full of anger was difficult to  
behold. With His mouth wide open licking the edges with His tongue and with  
His mane and face smeared red with traces of blood, He wore the intestines  
like a garland around His neck and looked like a lion that just has killed an  
elephant. The heart He with His pointed nails had ripped out completely and  
thrown aside and the thousands of followers who with their raised weapons  
attended to their leader He all killed using His nails and the other weapons  
in His countless hands. Shaking His manes He scattered the clouds and with His  
glaring glance He outshone the luminaries. The waters and oceans struck by His  
breathing swirled in perturbation and afraid of His roar the elephants  
guarding the quarters of the universe cried. With Him tossing His hair the  
celestial chariots crowding in the sky slipped from their places, the earth  
shook under the heavy weight of His feet, His intolerable force moved the  
mountains and hills and His effulgence outshone everything else in all  
directions of the sky.   
*Hiranyakas'ipu and his brother Hiranyaksha (killed by the Boar Avatar),were actually two doorkeepers of Vaikunta. They were cursed by the great brahmin Sages four Kumaras to become demons,because they would not let them enter the Vaikunta. Hiranyakas'ipu by the power of great dedication and severe penances got the boon from the Lord not die because of any of the living being created by Lord,Neither at home nor outside, neither during the day nor at night, neither from any known weapon nor by any other thing, neither on the ground or in the sky nor by any human being or animal,Neither lifeless things nor living entities, neither demigod or demon nor the great serpents,to have the supremacy in battle and the rule over all embodied souls including the deities of all planets). In the past,Hiranyakas'ipu many times tried to kill his son Prahlada,because of his great devotion,but did not succeed.   
-When two door-keepers and great Devotees Jaya and Vijaya,who later became two great Asuras,were cursed by the Sages,the Lord said:  **' These two will soon elsewhere take birth from a godless womb. With their  
focus of mind intensified by anger, they will remain firmly united with Me and  
before long return to My presence. Know that your curse was ordained by Me  
alone, oh learned ones.'**)

_cont...   
Thereafter sitting in the assembly hall on the highest seat of man with a most  
fearsome, terrible countenance, there was no one to challenge Him nor anyone  
to worship Him. But upon hearing how he, the Daitya who was the headache of  
the three worlds, in the battle had been killed by the Lord, there were  
exclamations of joy, blossoming faces and endless showers of flowers from the  
wives of the demigods. At that time there was an overcast formed by all the  
celestial chariots of the demigods desirous to attend. Drums and kettle drums  
were sounded and the greatest singers and angels of heaven sang and danced.  
All the godly ones, Brahma, Indra and Shiva, the sages, the ancestors, the  
perfected ones, the scientific experts and the great serpents assembled there.  
The founding fathers, the leaders of mankind, the residents of heaven and the  
best of the angels arrived there too, as did the venerable ones, the keepers  
of the wealth and the monkey-like, oh my best one. Also the goblins came, the  
ones of superpower and they who were Vishnu's personal associates like Sunanda  
and Kumuda. With their hands folded before their heads to offer their  
obeisance each of them approached Him who had appeared as half a man, half a  
lion and now sat there on the throne displaying His effulgence.   
Lord Brahma said: 'I bow down before You, oh Inscrutable One of unlimited  
powers. You with all Your might and prowess and the purity of Your actions  
stand for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. While You  
in Your divine game play with the modes, You never change Yourself,and stand  
above this creation.'   
Lord Shiva said: 'The end of the yuga is the time suitable for You to kill in  
anger this insignificant demon; just protect his son, this bhakta of surrender  
next to You, oh caretaker of the devotees.'   
Sri Indra said: 'Our share of the sacrifices was secured by Your Lordship  
protecting us, oh Supreme One. We have no words to describe how afflicted our  
lotus-like hearts were by the Daitya, our hearts that are really Your  
residence. Alas, oh Lord, how insignificant is our world in the grip of Time,  
but for the sake of the devoted ones in Your service You have shed Your light  
so that they may find liberation from their bondage. What else but considering  
the visible world as unimportant would constitute their way oh Nrisimha?'   
The Rishis said: 'You are the shining example who taught us our austerity. By  
this power of Yours this world, oh Original Lord, is created, maintained and  
reabsorbed. That penance was stolen by this unwise soul but is now, oh Shelter  
of the Needy, restored by the protection of Your embodiment.'   
The ancestors [the Pitris] said: 'The demon who engaging with force enjoyed  
our s'raddha sacrifices that were offered by our sons and grandsons, he who  
even at the holy bathing places drank from our offerings of sesame water, by  
piercing the intestines of his belly with the nails of Your hand these  
offerings have reached their proper destination. He, the maintainer of the  
universal principles of religion who appeared as a man-lion, Him we offer our  
obeisances.   
The ones of perfection [the Siddhas] said: 'This most uncivilized and  
dishonest person who stole away the joy of our perfection in yoga and with the  
power of his mysticism and penance was so proud of his wealth, has been torn  
apart by Your nails. We bow down before You, oh Nrisimha.'   
The scientific experts [the Vidyadharas] said: 'Our forms of knowledge that  
each are attained by a different way of concentrating, were pushed aside by  
this fool puffed up about his strength and prowess. He who in battle killed  
him like he was an animal, to Him who appeared as Nrisimha, we surrendered  
souls are ever obliged.'   
The snake people [the Nagas] said: 'By piercing the chest of that greatest of  
all sinners who seized our jewels and beautiful women, You have done our wives  
a great favor. Let us offer You our obeisances.'   
The original fathers [the Manus] said: 'We, the Manus are Your authorities but  
were disrespected by this son of Diti who broke with the moral ties for the  
establishment, oh Lord. With You having killed this villain, oh Master, please  
tell us what we, Your eternal servants, can do for You.'   
The founding fathers [the Prajapatis] said: 'We, the creators of the  
generations owe our lives to You, oh Supreme Controller and not to him who  
denied the living beings that we have put on this world a life. And now, by  
assuming the form of an incarnation of Your pure goodness, You for the well-  
being of the world have split open the chest of him who lies slain.'   
The musicians of heaven [the Gandharvas] said: 'We, oh Lord are Your dancers  
and singers, Your performers, who were brought under the control of the power  
and strength of the one here who You reduced to this condition. Can anyone on  
the path of evil find happiness?'   
The venerable souls [the Caranas] said: 'Oh Lord, Your lotus feet liberate  
from the need to start a new life. We duly seek shelter there because You have  
put an end to this Asura, this snake in the heart of all virtuous people.'   
The keepers of the wealth [the Yakshas] said: 'We, serving You to Your  
pleasure belong to Your best followers. This son of Diti forced us to carry  
his palanquin but caused the sorrow of each and everyone. Thus we acknowledge  
You oh Lord Nrisimha, for You are the one who put him to death, oh twenty-  
fifth principle.'   
The monkey-like beings [the Kimpurushas] said: 'We are questionable humans,  
Kimpurushas but You are the Supreme Lord. And this bad person has been slain  
by You after having been condemned by the saintly ones.'   
The king's bards [the Vaitalikas] said: 'We in great gatherings and arenas of  
sacrifice singing the glories of Your spotless reputation have achieved the  
greatest position of respect. This crooked character who subdued us oh Supreme  
Lord, has to our great fortune been killed by You, like he was a disease.'   
The lower gods [the Kinnaras, those with a human head and an animal body,  
singers of heaven] said: 'Oh Lord, we the Kinnaras are Your faithful servants.  
Because of that son of Diti we had to perform in forced labor, but the sinner  
was by You destroyed, oh Nrisimhadeva, oh Master. Please be there as our  
happiness and welfare.'   
The associates of Lord Vishnu said: 'Today we have seen You in a wondrous  
human-like form. You are our shelter and the happiness of all the worlds. This  
servant of the state, oh Lord, was cursed by the scholars and has therefore  
been killed. We consider that to be Your special grace.'   
Narada Muni said [to Yudhishthhira]: 'None could step forward, not even Lord  
Brahma or Lord Shiva, because He, boiling with anger, was most difficult to  
approach. The Goddess of Fortune personally by the demigods being urged to do  
so could, after seeing Him so huge and wonderful as no one had ever seen or  
heard before, not move in His direction because she was very afraid. Then Lord  
Brahma prompted Prahlada who stood close by: 'My dear son, can you please  
approach the Lord and propitiate Him? He is very angry because of what your  
father did.'   
'Surely' he said and even though he was only a small boy oh King, the great  
devotee slowly, step by step, approached Him and prostrated himself with  
folded hands offering prayers. The godhead was by him, such a little boy  
fallen at His lotus feet, greatly moved and filled with mercy He raised His  
lotus hand, placed it on his head and dispelled the fear for the snake of time  
from all minds present there. Because of that touch he was cleansed from all  
evil. And immediately in this association with the Supreme Soul, with His  
lotus feet, his heart melted being captured in bliss. With Him in his heart  
tears welled in his eyes and symptoms of ecstasy manifested all over his  
body.'

## Re:[80]Love,always love and only love Excerpts from Srimad Bhagavatam

**_The purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam and many Avatars of the Lord Krishna_**  
 _Suta said: "In the beginning the Supreme Lord assumed, for the creation of  
the worlds, the form of the Original Person[Purusha],the cosmic intelligence  
and such,and created the sixteen primary principles [of the ten knowing and  
working senses, the mind and the five elements]. Resting in His meditative  
slumber in that water, out of the lotus that spread from the lake of His  
navel, Brahma was manifested, the master of the progenitors in the universe.  
One supposes the different worlds to be an expansions and the part of the form  
of the Fortunate One that constitutes the excellence of the purest existence.  
In a perfect spiritual vision His form is seen as having numerous legs,  
thighs, arms and faces, with wonderful heads, ears, eyes and noses, all  
glowing with countless garlands, earrings and dresses. This source of the  
numerous incarnations is the imperishable seed from which the plenary portions  
originate as also the portions thereof, such as the gods, the human beings and  
the animals."   
"The first Divinity created were the sons of Brahma,the Kumaras, who performed  
the most difficult discipline of continuous celibacy so they could realize the  
Absolute (Brahman). The Supreme Enjoyer secondly assumed the form of a Boar  
for the welfare of the earth that had sunken to the lowest regions and lifted  
her up from the ocean. Thirdly He accepted His presence among the seers in the  
form of Narada Muni for the sake of evolving the Vedic knowledge of Bhakti  
Yoga free from material motives. Fourth born as the twin sons of Murti, the  
wife of king Dharma, in the form of Nara-Narayaṇa subjected Himself to severe  
penances to attain control over the senses. Fifth He, carrying the name of  
Kapila, gave an exposition to the brahmin Asuri on the nature of metaphysics  
and the elements of creation, because in the course of time that knowledge had  
been lost. Sixth as the son of Atri,named Dattatreya, being born from Anasusa  
who prayed for Him, He lectured to Alarka, Prahlada and others about  
transcendence. Seventh being born from Akuti as Yajna, the son of Prajapati  
Ruci, He together with His son Yama and other demigods, ruled during the  
period of Svayambhuva Manu. Eighth, from the wife of King Nabhi, Merudev?, the  
Almighty Lord took birth as King Rishabha and showed the path of perfection  
respected by people of all stages of life. His ninth incarnation He accepted  
in response to the prayers of the sages, whereupon He as Prithu ruled the  
earth for the sake of collecting her produces, which made her most attractive.  
Assuming the form of a fish Matsya, He after the period of Cakshusha Manu  
protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him in a boat afloat the waters when the  
world was deeply inundated. Eleventh the mighty Lord in the form of a tortoise  
Kurma sustained the Mandaracala Hill of the theists and atheists that served  
as a pivot in the ocean. Twelfth He appeared as Dhanvantari,Lord of medicine,  
and thirteenth He appeared before the atheists as an alluring beautiful woman  
Mohini and gave nectar to the demigods. In His fourteenth incarnation He, half  
as a lion, appeared as Nrisimha, who with His nails on His lap tore apart the  
king of the atheists like a carpenter splitting cane. Fifteenth He assumed the  
form of Vamana who went to the arena of sacrifice of Maharaja Bali to beg for  
only three steps of land, concealing His wish to regain the three worlds. In  
His sixteenth incarnation He as Bhrigupati or Paras'urama saw that the ruling  
class was hostile towards the brahmins and acted twenty-one times against  
them. Seeing that the common people were less intelligent He, seventeenth,  
incarnated as Vyasa taking birth from Satyavati with Paras'ara Muni as His  
father, for the purpose of dividing the Vedas into several branches. Next He  
performed in a superhuman way having assumed the form of a divine human being  
Rama, by controlling the Indian Ocean and such, so that He could act for the  
sake of the godly souls. Nineteenth as also twentieth Bhagavan took birth in  
the Vrishni family as Balarama and Krishna and thus removed the burden from  
the world. Thereafter at the beginning of the Age of Kali He shall appear as  
the son of mother Anjana with the name Buddha for the purpose of deluding the  
ones envious of the theists. Next, at the conjunction of two yugas, when there  
is hardly a ruler to be found who is not a plunderer, the Lord of the Creation  
carrying the name of Kalki will take birth from the ones(or place) famous  
by(with) Vishnu "   
"Dear brahmins, the incarnations of the Lord who appeared from the ocean of  
goodness are as innumerable as the thousands of streams we have from  
inexhaustible sources of water. All the powerful sages, the godly souls, the  
Manus and their progeny as also the Prajapatis [the founding fathers] are  
aspects of the Lord. They are all part of Krishna, the Bhagavan in person who  
offers protection during all ages and in all worlds against disturbances  
because of the enemies of the king of heaven.   
Anyone who in the morning and the evening carefully recites these mysterious  
births of the Lord, will find relief from all miseries of life. All these  
forms of the Lord that by the qualities of the material energy were created  
with the cosmic intelligence and other elements, originated from His Self-  
awareness that is without a form. The less intelligent observer perceives them  
the way one sees clouds in the sky or dust in the air. This unmanifested Self  
is the beyond,cannot be seen or heard and has no form,but the jiva(individual  
soul) affected by the modes of nature takes birth repeatedly. As soon as one  
by self-knowledge arrives at the rejection of all these gross and subtle forms  
that impose themselves on the soul because of ignorance, one arrives at the  
realization of the Absolute Truth. With the illusory energy subsided and  
mindfulness one is endowed with the full knowledge of enlightenment and  
becomes situated in one's own glory. This is how the learned describe  
activities and the births of the actually Unborn and non-engaged Lord of the  
Heart; this is the hidden meaning of the Vedas. Residing within every living  
being He is the omnipotent master and witness of the six qualities and  
opulences, whose play is spotless, who is independent and not affected by  
creation, destruction and maintenance. Because of His expert manipulations His  
activities, names and forms cannot be understood by the speculations and  
speeches of those with a poor fund of knowledge, just like fools cannot  
understand an actor's performance. Only he who renders unconditional,  
uninterrupted, favorable service to His fragrant lotus feet may know the  
transcendental glories of the all-powerful Creator with the wheel of the  
chariot in His hand. When one in this world becomes aware of the Vasudeva who  
embraces all His universes as their Lord and goes into ecstasy because of it,  
one will never again have to experience there the dreadful repetition of  
births."   
"This book called the Bhagavatam about the activities of the One Hailed in the  
Verses,that as a supplement to the Vedas [a Purana] was compiled by the seer  
of God Vyasadeva, is there for the ultimate good of bringing success,  
happiness and perfection to all people. This story, that as the cream from all  
the Vedic literatures and histories was extracted by Vyasa, he delivered to  
his son who is the most respectable one among the self-realized souls. He  
[S'uka] in his turn told it to emperor Parikchit* who, surrounded by the  
greatest sages, sat down at the Ganges to fast until his death. Now that  
Krishna has left for His abode and with Him also proper conduct and spiritual  
insight have vanished, this Purana bright as the sun has appeared at the  
horizon for the sake of everyone who in the Age of Quarrel has lost his  
vision. Oh brahmins, when the story was recited there by that powerful great  
sage, I, being perfectly attentive by his mercy, also managed to understand  
it, so that I will now relate it to you also, exactly as I learned it free  
from deviations by my own mind."   
*Parikchit was the grandson of Arjuna. Son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The emperor who as a child in the womb was protected by Krishna for the continuation of the Yadu dynasty. The first vedic sovereign who laid out the norms for Kali yuga and was cursed by the son of a brahmana to die in seven days. Because of curse,and so He can be able to attain perfection in seven days,was recited the Srimad Bhagavata by Suka, the son of Vyasa, the original author of the book about the Lord and His devotees.

**_The Birth of Emperor Parikchit_**  
 _S 'aunaka said: "The embryo in the womb of Uttara, that was tormented by the  
enormous heat of the invincible weapon released by As'vatthama, was by the  
Lord again awarded a life. How did the birth take place of Emperor Parikchit  
who was so highly intelligent and what where the activities of this great  
soul? How exactly did his demise take place and what destination did he  
achieve? If you think you can tell us this that we, so very faithful, all want  
to hear, please speak to us then about the transcendental knowledge that was  
delivered by S'uka."   
Suta said: "King Yudhishthhira brought prosperity to everyone during his  
reign, the way his father did, by continuous service of Krishna's feet without  
any ulterior motive for material gain or sensual pleasure. The fame of his  
wealth, sacrifices, what he stood for, his queens, his brothers and his  
sovereignty over the planet earth where we are living, even spread to the  
heavenly worlds. But, just as only food may satisfy a hungry man and nothing  
else, he, in his hunger as someone aware of the Redeemer, Mukunda, oh  
brahmins, was not moved by all those earthly desirables that are aspired by  
even the God-fearing souls.   
At the time Parikchit,the great fighter, as a child in his mother's womb, was  
suffering from the heat of the brahmastra weapon, oh son of Bhrigu, he could  
observe the Purusha in a shining appearance. In the blaze he saw at the size  
of not more than a thumb the transcendental, infallible Lord beautiful with a  
dark skin, a golden helmet and lightening clothes. With the riches of His four  
arms, earrings of the purest gold, bloodshot eyes and a club in His hands, He  
was moving about, constantly whirling the club around like it was a torch. As  
He was vanquishing the radiation of the brahmastra like the sun evaporating  
dew drops, He was observed by the child who wondered who He was. He saw how  
the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Lord and protector of righteousness,  
took away the glare. Next the Lord who stretches in all directions all of a  
sudden disappeared from his sight. Thereupon, when the good signs of a  
favorable position of the stars gradually evolved, he took birth, who would  
prove himself to be of a prowess equal to that of Pandu. King Yudhishthhira  
being fully satisfied had priests like Dhaumya and Kripa perform the birth  
ritual with the recitation of auspicious hymns. Knowing where, when and how,  
he in charity rewarded to the occasion of that birth the brahmins with good  
food and gifts of gold, cows, land, housing, elephants and horses. The  
brahmins happily addressed the king, the chief of the Purus, communicating  
that they felt most obliged to the line of the descendants of their ancestor  
King Puru.   
They said: 'This son has been given to you by the all-pervasive and all-  
powerful Lord to show you His mercy in countering his destruction by the  
irresistible, supernatural weapon. Therefore he shall be known all over the  
world as Vishnu-rata, 'Given by Vishnu'. He will no doubt be a most fortunate,  
supreme devotee endowed with all good qualities.'   
The good king said: 'Oh best of the truthful, will he follow in the footsteps  
of all the great souls of this family of saintly kings? Will he be just as  
meritorious and glorious in his achievements?'   
The brahmins answered: 'Oh son of Pritha [Kunti], he will be the maintainer of  
all living entities, exactly like King Ikshvaku, the son of Manu, and he will  
be faithful to his promises and be of respect for the brahmins, just like  
Rama, the son of Das'aratha. He will be as charitable as King S'ibi of  
Us'inara and protect the ones of surrender, and will, just like Bharata, the  
son of Dushyanta who performed many sacrifices, spread the name and fame of  
his family. Among the archers he will be as good as the two Arjunas [his  
grandfather and the king of Haihaya], he will be as irresistible as fire and  
as unsurpassable as the ocean. As powerful as a lion and as worthy for taking  
shelter as the Himalayas, he will be as forbearing as the earth and as  
tolerant as his parents. With a spirit as good as that of the original father  
Brahma, he will be as generous and equanimous as Lord Shiva and be the refuge  
of all living beings as good as the Supreme Lord who is the refuge of the  
Goddess of fortune. Following in the footsteps of Krishna he will be the  
majesty of all divine virtues, he will have the greatness of King Rantideva  
and be as pious as Yayati. Being as patient as Bali Maharaja this child will  
be as devoted as Prahlada was unto Krishna, he will perform many As'vamedha  
sacrifices and be faithful to the elderly and experienced souls. He will  
father a line of saintly kings, will chastise the upstarts and, as a source of  
righteousness in the world, crush the quarrelsome. After being informed about  
his personal death, as caused by a snakebird that was sent by the son of a  
brahmin, he will free himself from his attachments and take to the shelter in  
the Lord. Having inquired about the proper self-knowledge from the son of  
sage Vyasa, oh King, he will abandon his material life on the bank of the  
river Ganges and attain the state of fearlessness. Constantly keeping Lord in  
mind whom he had seen before his birth, He would acquire fame in this world by  
constant investigation. Just like the waxing moon day by day soon becomes  
full, the royal prince under the care of his protective parents day by day  
grew to become soon the one he would be.'   
The brahmins learned in matters of astrology and birth ceremonies, thus having  
informed the king, were generously rewarded and then all returned to their  
homes.   
King Yudhishthhira, desiring to perform a horse sacrifice to be freed from the  
burden of having fought his kinsmen, thought about acquiring funds because all  
he received stemmed from collecting taxes and fines. In respect of his mindful  
wishes, his brothers on the advise of the Lord Krishna went north to collect  
sufficient riches. With the result of those collected riches Yudhishthhira,  
the anxious, pious king, managed to conduct three sacrifices, by means of  
which he worshiped Lord Hari perfectly. The Supreme Lord being invited by the  
king, had the brahmins perform the sacrifices for him and then stayed a few  
months longer to satisfy the desires of His friends. Then, dear brahmins,Lord  
Krishna, with the permission of the king, Draupadi and His relatives,went back  
to Dvaraka, accompanied by Arjuna and other members of the Yadu dynasty."

_**Prithu Maharaja 's Meeting with the Four Kumaras**_  
 _Maitreya said: 'While the citizens were thus praying to the high and mighty King Prithu, four  
sages arrived there as bright as the sun. The king and his associates could  
recognize the masters of yogic perfection,the four Kumaras,by the glaring  
effulgence of their all-embracing sinlessness, who descended from the ethereal  
realm. Seeing the so very desired life of peace before them, King Prithu and  
his followers jumped to their feet as if they were souls whose senses are  
ruled by the modes of nature. After they had accepted that reverence and had  
taken their seats, he humbly,being aware of their full glory, bowed before  
them and was of worship the way it is prescribed, with everything belonging  
to it. The water of washing their feet he sprinkled on the tuft of his hair  
and thus he behaved like men of respect are supposed to behave. Seated on the  
golden throne the older brothers of Bhava looked like the fire on an altar.  
Pleased with them, the king respectfully and with restraint addressed them.  
Prithu said: 'To what do we owe the grace of your audience, of you who are  
fortune personified? It is an encounter difficult to achieve for even the  
greatest yogis. He with whom the learned are pleased, can achieve whatever is  
difficult to achieve in this world or in the hereafter, including the favor of  
the all-auspicious Lord S'iva and Lord Vishnu. Even though you travel around  
in all the worlds, the people cannot see you, just as they cannot see the  
All-knowing witness present within everyone. A person who is not very rich and  
is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly persons are  
present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the  
exalted visitors water, a sitting place and great reception are glorified, and  
that very home itself is also glorified. But, those houses that, abundant with  
all wealth, are not blessed with the water that washed the feet of the great  
saints, are no doubt like a tree with venomous serpents. I welcome you, oh  
best of the twice-born souls, you who move around like children and,  
controlled by vows, with great faith are motivated for liberation. Oh masters,  
can persons who, having fallen into this material existence, are stricken with  
the illness of living to the command of their senses, all by themselves find  
any good fortune? There is no need to ask you about your well-being, for you,  
supreme souls, are not at all concerned with matters of good or bad fortune.  
I am therefore certain that you for us, who suffer the pains of a material  
existence, are the friends to ask how one in this world soon may find  
salvation. Manifesting as the supreme goal in life of the seekers after  
Truth, the Supreme Lord, the Unborn One, in the form of perfected souls like  
you, moves about on this earth in order to show His devotees His mercy.'   
Maitreya said: 'Hearing that most substantial, appropriate and sweet  
conclusion of Prithu, the Kumara satisfied with a smile replied as follows.  
Sanat-kumara said: 'What a good question for you to ask, my dear King, oh you who desires the  
good of all living beings. Learned as you are, you nevertheless pose this  
question. This speaks for you as someone of wisdom of the saint. An  
association of devotees in which there is discussion, questioning and  
answering, is appreciated by both the parties [of speakers and listeners], and  
real happiness for all will expand from it. Oh King, you are evidently  
attached to the praises of the Lord's lotus feet. Difficult as it is, that,  
given a steady practice, will free the indwelling soul from the dirt of lusty  
feelings. In the scriptures is defended that only the absence of attachment to  
other matters than the soul, in combination with an intense attachment to the  
True Self transcendental to the modes of nature, constitutes the perfect  
conviction for the salvation of man. That is realized when one as a dutiful  
devotee with faith and devotion, by means of discussion, inquiry,and  
determination,with respect for the Lord of Yoga regularly attends and listens  
to the stories of the God-fearing souls. Reluctant to associate with the  
company of those who hanker after money, sense gratification and the acquiring  
of goods,one should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace  
without drinking the nectar of the glorification of Hari. With nonviolence,  
following the footsteps of the Guru, by remembering the Lord of Liberation, by  
testifying of His activities, by the following yoga principles without a  
material motive and by practicing in line with the precepts one, thus being  
without offenses, should live a simple life tolerating worldly dualities. When  
someone always listens about transcendental qualities of the Lord, it may be  
so that one's devotion and Truth consciousness grows,and he easily becomes  
attached to the Brahman. When the person in respect of the Guru, by the force  
of detachment and jnana,completely surrenders to the Supreme, the covering  
within the heart that consists of the five elements will be burned like fuel  
being burned by fire. After one is freed from inner weakness and dominance of  
the material qualities, there is no longer a difference, as there was in the  
past, between the inner and the outer,and this difference being a dream is  
finished. For such a soul that difference has ended, just like a dream ends  
when one wakes up. The one becomes aware how desire bounds the Soul, but there  
is no more division and separation,and he sees himself beyond,as the Witness.  
Because the ruminating mind is agitated by the senses that are drawn towards  
the sense objects, the pure consciousness is easily lost, just like a lake  
easily can be overgrown by plants. Wise ones state that when remembrance is  
lost, all knowledge acquired is based on a false foundation. The constant  
mindfulness of one's consciousness is destroyed and real knowledge is lost.  
There is no stronger obstruction to one's self-interest than thinking other  
matters to be more pleasing than one's self-realization. When one constantly  
thinks of riches and sensual pleasures, all the virtues of human society are  
destroyed. For that reason bereft of knowledge and devotion, one then lapses  
into the inertia [the ignorance]. They who want to cross over that ocean of  
ignorance quickly, should never cling to the slowness of matter(tamas), for  
that is the great stumbling block,as even the virtues of religiousness,  
economic development and sense gratification [dharma, artha, kama]. In this  
respect liberation is likely to be the most important virtue, because being  
engaged in the interest of the other three paths, one regularly finds oneself  
caught in the grip of death and in fear. Following these three notions of a  
higher or lower form of life, one will never find any security, since they,  
depending on the interaction of the material modes, are all destroyed by the  
ordinance of the Lord [in the form of Time]. Oh best of kings, be therefore,  
just as I am, convinced of Him, the Supreme Lord who from within the heart  
everywhere manifests as the Master of the Field. Therein radiating into every  
hair follicle, He is there for the self-realization, for all the moving and  
not moving living beings covered by a body endowed with senses and a life-  
breath. Surrender to Him, the root cause manifesting as the truth within the  
untruth. By this deliberate consideration one is freed from the illusions and  
from the mistake taking the rope as a snake. One is then situated in the pure  
truth, the truth of the original nature transcendental to all the impurities  
of one's karmic activities. Be devoted to Vasudeva. For the devotees who find  
Him by devotion, the One whose lotus toes bring joy, the hard knot of karmic  
desire is uprooted, but that is never so with people missing that respect,  
however hard they try to stop the waves of sense enjoyment. Great is the  
hardship of the ones immersed in material life,which is like an ocean filled  
with the sharks of the six senses. Being unhappy it is very difficult to cross  
that ocean full of misfortune, that danger of separate existence, and  
therefore you should make the worshipable lotus feet of the Supreme Lord your  
boat.'

_cont...   
Maitreya said: 'Thus in full being informed about the ins and outs of  
spiritual advancement by the son of Brahma - the Kumara who was so well versed  
in spiritual knowledge - the king praised him and then spoke. The king said: 'You all, oh brahmins, oh powerful souls, have arrived here in order to  
confirm what was promised by Him, the Lord who from His causeless mercy is so  
compassionate with the distressed. It is my duty, therefore, to offer you  
something, but all I have now are but remnants of food taken by great saintly  
persons. What shall I give except my heart and soul? My life, wife and  
children, oh brahmins, my home with everything belonging to it, my kingdom,  
power, land and treasury, I therefore offer all to you. The post of the  
commander in chief and ruler of the state, the first to chastise or the  
proprietor of the whole planet, are no doubt only reserved for those who know  
the Vedic scriptures. A brahmin enjoys his own food, wears his own clothes  
and gives what he has in charity. It is by his mercy that the kshatriyas [the  
rulers] and the other parts of society eat their food. How can such persons,  
who have done unlimited mercy by explaining the path of self-realization, and  
whose explanations are given for our enlightenment with complete conviction  
and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded palms containing water for  
their satisfaction?'   
Maitreya said: 'After the masters of self-realization had been worshiped by  
the original king, they praised his character and then, for all people to see,  
disappeared in the sky. The son of Vena, the first among the great  
personalities, who according to the teachings had arrived at self-  
realization, considered himself as someone fully satisfied. For the sake of  
the Absolute Truth he performed as good as possible,and as far as his means  
would allow, according to the time, the circumstances and his capacity all his  
actions. Fully dedicated to the Supreme Spirit he, free from attachments  
being of renunciation, always thought of the Lord, the Supersoul beyond this  
material nature. Even though he lived at home, he never felt attracted to all  
the opulence of his mighty kingdom, nor did he indulge in sensual pleasures,  
just like the sun never responds to what it illuminates. Always engaging  
spiritually, he thus begot five sons in his wife Arci who fully met his  
expectations. Their names were Vijitas'va, Dhumrakes'a, Haryaksha, Dravina and  
Vrika. In his personal surrender to the Infallible One he, for the protection  
of the created universe, pleased the citizens during his time with his kind-  
hearted words and actions. The king thus was known as the King of the Moon,  
while he, on the other hand, was like the Sun god in his distributing,  
exacting and ruling over the wealth of the world. In his exercise of power he  
was as unconquerable as fire, he was as insuperable as the King of Heaven, as  
tolerant as the earth itself and alike heaven in fulfilling all desires of  
human society. Just as rainfall satisfies everyone's desires, Maharaja Pṛthu  
used to satisfy everyone. He was like the sea in that no one could understand  
his depths, and he was like Meru, the king of hills, in the fixity of his  
purpose. He was like the King of Righteousness [Yamaraja] in his education, he  
was alike the Himalayas in his opulence, he was like Kuvera in keeping the  
wealth and alike Varuna [the ruler of the waters] in his secrecy. He was as  
all-pervading as the air [the wind] concerning his physical strength, courage  
and power, and he was as inexorable as the most powerful Rudra. He was as  
beautiful as Cupid, he was as attentive as the lion, the king of the animals,  
in his affection he was alike Svayambhuva Manu and in matters of controlling  
the people he resembled the Unborn Lord, Brahma. He understood spiritual  
matters alike Brihaspati, in his personal self-control he was alike the  
Supreme Lord, in his devotion to the cows, the spiritual master and the  
brahmins he was as great devotees, in his shyness he was the most gentle one  
and in matters of philanthropy he was [as good] as he was for himself. All  
over the three worlds the general public loudly declared - and surely all the  
lovers of truth and the women from everywhere came to hear about it - that his  
name and fame was as great as the glory of Rama.'

**_Maharaja Priyavrata_**  
 _The King Parikchit said: 'Why, oh sage, was Priyavrata, the great devotee  
who takes pleasure in self-realization, so happy to stay at home, the place  
that is the root cause of bondage and which is against the main purpose of  
human life(self realisation)? Surely such a thing as indulgence in family  
affairs, oh wisest of the twice-born, cannot be desirable for that kind of  
people who are threading this path? It suffers no doubt that all the great  
souls find their satisfaction in the shade of the feet of the Lord praised in  
the verses, and not so much in the mind of attachment to kith and kin. This is  
my great doubt, oh brahmin: how can someone attached to his wife, home,  
children and so on, find perfection and an unfailing determination to realise  
Krishna?'   
Suka said: 'You are perfectly right in what you said about the hearts of  
liberated persons and devotees that are absorbed in the nectarean honey of the  
talks at the lotus-like feet of their beloved Lord praised in the scriptures.  
Despite the setbacks they sometimes encounter, they practically never give up  
their most exalted position. It is a well-known fact, oh King, that prince  
Priyavrata indeed was a supreme devotee who, in his service at Narada's feet,  
very quickly became aware of the complete truth concerning the spiritual  
purpose that he constantly discussed in dedicated enthusiasm. Even though his  
father asked him to rule over the surface of the earth because he incorporated  
so many of the best qualities, he could not be happy with it. He did not want  
to be distracted from yoga,but wished to be absorbed in the Supreme Lord of  
the Soul of the Universe. Therefore, although the order of his father could  
not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously  
raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by  
accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world. And so it happened that  
the first among the demigods Lord Brahma,surrounded by all his personal  
associates and the Vedas, descended from his abode. It is He who is always  
thinking of the welfare of the complete of this universal creation consisting  
of the three modes. He knows its ultimate purpose, the Supreme Soul, from  
which He originated Himself. Just like the full moon surrounded by  
illuminating stars, He on his way here and there by the leaders of the  
demigods was worshiped from their heavenly carriers. And the same was done by  
groups of perfected ones, inhabitants of heaven, refined ones, singers and  
sages [respectively the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Caranas, the Sadhyas and  
the Munis] when he thus as the shining jewel reached the vicinity of the  
Gandhamadana mountains where Priyavrata was meditating. Recognizing the swan-  
carrier of his almighty father Lord Hiranyagarbha the devarishi Narada,  
Priyavrata and his father Svayambhuva Manu present there immediately rose to  
their feet with their hands folded in order to worship the Lord. Oh son of  
Bharata, the Lord, the original person of the universe, who thus out of  
gratitude for the glory of his descent, according to the customs, was  
confronted with the articles of worship and the praise of his qualities in  
lofty language, then addressed Priyavrata, while he looked at him with a  
compassionate smile.   
The great Lord said: 'My son, pay attention to the truth I am telling you. You  
should not be jealous of the Godhead who is beyond our ken. We, Lord Shiva,  
your father and this great Rishi Narada all carry out His order and cannot  
deviate. No living entity that accepted a material body can escape from what  
was decided by Him; not by austerity nor by education, not by yoga nor by  
one's strength or intelligence, nor can one ever defy His will by one's  
opulence, by the virtue of one's duty, with the help of someone else or by any  
personal endeavor. Oh my dear, under the direction of the One Unseen, all  
living entities accept it to be connected to a material body for performing  
actions according to their karma and are thus always bound to birth and death,  
sadness and illusion, fear, happiness and distress. My dear boy, all of us are  
bound by the Vedic injunctions to the divisions of varṇasrama according to our  
qualities and work. These divisions are difficult to avoid. We must therefore  
carry out our duties of varṇasrama-dharma, like bulls obliged to move  
according to the direction of a driver pulling on ropes knotted to their  
noses. My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes  
of material nature, the Supreme gives us our specific bodies and the happiness  
and distress we achieve. One must therefore remain situated as he is and be  
conducted by the Supreme Lord, exactly as a blind man is led by a person who  
has eyes. Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has  
received according to his past karma. Without misconceptions, however, he  
regards his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an awakened  
person regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and  
never works to achieve another material body under the influence of the three  
modes of material nature. Someone not paying attention to this and someone not  
willing to control his senses has, even when he resides in the forest, to fear  
of the six co-wives [of the five senses and the mind]. But on the other hand  
what harm can a householder's existence do to a self-satisfied, learned man  
who has conquered his senses? Having entered a household existence, anyone  
who wants to conquer those six adversaries must first try to master them from  
within that stronghold. For only when the unregulated desires have lost their  
strength one, thus having ripened with experience, can move about freely. My  
dear Priyavrata, seek shelter at the lotus of the feet of the Lord, whose  
navel is also like a beautiful lotus. Thus conquer the six sense organs.  
Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you  
to do this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be  
able to carry out the Lord's orders. After one has been trained thus and his  
lusty desires have decreased, he can move anywhere without danger.'_

**_Lord Rishabha 's Activities_**  
 _The king said: 'Oh Supreme One, self-satisfied souls of whom the seed of  
fruitive action has been burned by the spiritual knowledge acquired by the  
practice of yoga, automatically achieve mystical powers; how can those siddhis  
become a hindrance?'   
The sage said: 'You are quite right, but in this world one should not put  
faith in the mind because it is unsteady and always runs off. The mind is by  
nature very restless, and one should not make friends with it. If we place  
full confidence in the mind, it may cheat us at any moment. Even the greatest  
souls having practiced austerities for a long time got disturbed putting faith  
in it. Just as a husband with an adulterous wife must guard against  
competitors, also a yogi must guard himself,since the mind always offers  
opportunity to lust, greed and anger. Which man of wisdom would confide in the  
mind that is the breeding ground for the lust, anger, pride, greed,  
lamentation, illusion and fear that together constitute the bondage to one's  
karma? Even though He, Rishabha,was the head of all kings and rulers of this  
universe, He,assuming the dress and language of an avadhuta,acted as if dull  
and materially bound. Consequently no one could observe His divine opulence.  
He adopted this behavior just to teach yogīs how to give up the body.  
Nonetheless, He maintained His original position of transcendence and  
remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord Rishabha  
within the material world. If, following the footsteps of Lord Rishabha, one  
can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a  
material body again. With Him, the Bhagavan Rishabha, free from identification  
with His material form, we thus witnessed the apparent physical presence, the  
engagement of His body in this illusory world. He all alone traveled the lands  
of South India: Konka, Venka and Kuthaka in the province of Karnatha, and  
reached a forest nearby Kuthakacala. There He, with a handful of stones in His  
mouth, wandered around naked with scattered hair, like He was a madman. In a  
fierce forest fire blazing all around - that was caused by the friction of  
bamboo stalks tossed about by the force of the wind - His body then burned to  
ashes.   
Hearing about His pastimes of being free from all ritual and custom, the king  
of Konka, Venka and Kuthaka who carried the name Arhat took to an imitation of  
Lord Rishabha. Bewildered by an increase of irreligious life that forebode the  
arrival of the Kali-yuga Age of Quarrel, he gave up the safe path of religion  
that wards off all fear and adopted a non-conformistic, wrong, heretical view  
by introducing most foolishly a concoction of his own. The lowest of mankind  
in this age of Kali who, lacking in character, cleanliness and dutifulness in  
respect of the rules and regulations, are bewildered by the illusory energy of  
God, will, because of this in neglect of the divine, self-willed and with  
wrong principles, follow strange rules, like not bathing, not cleaning the  
mouth, being dirty and plucking out the hair. With their consciousness spoiled  
by an abundance of modern time adharma they will fall into blaspheming the  
Vedas, the brahmins, rituals,the Supreme and the devotees. They who,  
encouraged by blind predecessors, with a deviating practice have built their  
own little cult, will, themselves being blinded, land in darkness. This  
avatara of the Lord was there for the purpose of instructing the people who  
are overwhelmed by passion,how to attain eternal happiness and liberation. In  
line with these teachings the people sing the following verses about Him: 'Oh,  
of all the lands on the continents of this world with its seven seas, this  
land is the most meritorious, for their people sing about the all-auspicious  
activities of Murari in His many incarnations [Krishna as the enemy of the  
foolish one, Mura].' 'Oh, what shall I say of the dynasty of Priyavrata,  
which is pure and very much celebrated. In that dynasty, the Supreme Lord, the  
Original One, descended as an incarnation to show us by His teachings and His  
own example how to attain liberation.'   
I have thus expounded on the pure activities of the Lord named Rishabha, who  
is the supreme master of all Vedic knowledge, of the common man, the God-  
conscious souls, the brahmins and the cows. He who with a growing faith and  
devotion attentively listens to, speaks to others about or personally attends  
to this refuge of His great and supreme auspiciousness, that puts an end to  
all the sins of every living being, will unto Him, the Supreme Lord Vasudeva,  
be favorably disposed with an unflinching devotion in both the positions of  
listening and speaking. Incessantly bathing themselves in that devotion in  
order to be free from suffering the various troublesome conditions of material  
existence, those who developed spiritual wisdom enjoy the highest bliss. But  
despite having achieved that liberation they do not strive for that supreme  
goal of all human beings. Having love and devotion for the Bhagavan they,  
after all, attained all their goals. Dear King, He undoubtedly was the  
maintainer and teacher, the worshipable deity, friend and master of your Yadu  
line and sometimes He even acted as a servant. Thus, my best one, He indeed  
was Mukunda, the Supreme Lord of Liberation [mukti] of those engaged in  
devotion. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the  
Lord, but pure love(bhakti) He does not give so easily.   
 All glories to Him, the Supreme Lord Rishabha! He was constantly aware of His  
true identity, complete within Himself and without desires. Gracefully, for  
the true welfare of man, He gave instruction about the true Self free from  
fear to those whose intelligence slept for a long time and who are mistaking  
the body for the Self.'

**_Krishna Rescues His Teacher 's Son_**  
 _   
S 'uka said: 'Knowing that His parents were thinking that He would be the  
Supreme Personality, He said to Himself: 'This should not be so'. And thus He  
expanded His personal illusory potency His yogamaya that bewilders the people.  
Approaching them together with His elder brother, the Greatest Devotee of All,  
with humility bowed down to His parents in order to satisfy them and  
respectfully said: 'Dear father and mother! Oh father, because of Us you were  
always afraid and have never seen anything of the toddler age, the boyhood and  
youth of your two sons. As ordained by fate We, being deprived of living in  
your presence, could not experience the joy of the happiness of children who  
live at home with their parents. A mortal person may never, not even for a  
lifespan of a hundred years, be able to repay the debt to his parents. He took  
his birth from them and by them he is maintained. They are the source of the  
body that is suitable for all goals of life. A son who, even though capable,  
with his resources and wealth does not provide for their sustenance, will  
after his death be forced to eat his own flesh. When one is capable of, but  
not maintains one's mother and father, the elderly, one's chaste wife, one's  
very young child, one's spiritual master, a brahmin or anyone seeking one's  
protection, one is a person who is dead even though he breathes. Because of  
Kamsa who always disturbed our minds, we could not honor you and have spent  
our days of youth without having been of any use to you. Please oh father and  
mother, forgive us the fact that, falling under the control of others, we from  
our part could not serve you so that the hardhearted one Kamsa could give you  
such a great pain.'   
S'uka said: 'Thus bewildered by the words of Him, the Lord and Soul of the  
Universe who through His maya appeared as a human being, they raised Them upon  
their laps to experience the joy of closeness with their sons. Bound by the  
rope of affection crying a river they, with their throats full of tears  
,overwhelmed could not say a word oh King. The Supreme Lord, the son of  
Devaki, who thus comforted His parents, then made His maternal grandfather  
Ugrasena, King over the Yadus. He told him: 'Please, oh great King, with Us as  
your subjects, take command, for because of the curse of Yayati one being  
born as a Yadu should not sit on the throne. When I am there as a servant to  
attend to you, the demigods and such will bow down before you to offer you  
tribute. Then what to speak of the other rulers of men?'   
All His close relatives and other relations, the Yadus, Vrishnis, Andhakas,  
Madhus, Das'arhas, Kukuras and other clans, who disturbed in their fear of  
Kamsa had fled in all directions, were honored and consoled, for living in  
foreign regions had made them weary. He, the Maker of the Universe, brought  
them back to their homes and satisfied them with valuable gifts. Protected by  
the arms of Krishna and Sankarshana they in their homes enjoyed the complete  
fulfillment of their desires because, now that they day after day saw the  
loving, always cheerful, beautiful lotus face and merciful, smiling glances of  
Mukunda, with Krishna and Balar?ma the fever of a material existence had  
ended.Even the eldest ones were youthful and full of strength and vitality,  
now that they there time and again through their eyes could imbibe the nectar  
of Mukunda's lotus face. Thereupon the Supreme Lord, the son of Devaki, and  
Sankarshana approached Nanda oh great King. They, embracing him, said: 'Oh  
father, with the great affection and the fondling of the two of you, you have  
cared for us in a great way. The love the parents have for their children is  
truly greater than even the love they have for each other. Those persons are  
father and mother who nourish, like they were their own sons, the children who  
were abandoned by relatives unable to maintain and protect them. Now you  
should all return to Vraja, dear Father. We shall come to see you, our dear  
relatives who suffer in separation from Us, as soon as we have given some  
happiness to your well-wishing friends. The Supreme Lord, the Infallible One  
thus appeasing Nanda and the people from Vraja, thereupon respectfully honored  
them with clothing, jewelry and pots and such.   
Thus being addressed by the two of Them, Nanda engulfed by affection, embraced  
Them with tears filling his eyes and went together with the gopas to Vraja.  
The son of S'urasena [Vasudeva], oh King, then arranged for a priest and  
brahmins to properly perform the second-birth initiation of his sons. For  
their remuneration he donated in worship fully decorated cows with golden  
chains and ornaments, complete with calves and linen wreaths. Magnanimously  
he gave them in charity the cows that were stolen away by Kamsa, the same cows  
he previously had donated within his mind the very day that Krishna and Rama  
were born. After having been initiated into the twice-born status, They, of  
proper vows, took the vow of celibacy from Garga, the preceptor of the Yadus.  
The Lords of the Universe who are the source of any form of knowledge,  
concealed in Their human activities the perfection of Their omniscience that  
is not founded on any knowledge from the outside. They nevertheless then  
desired to reside in the school of the guru and approached a native of Benares  
called Sandipani, who dwelt in the city of Avanti. Thus obtaining the company  
of these self-controlled souls, he was by Them respected as if he was the Lord  
Himself. Doing this They in Their devotion formed an irreproachable example of  
service to the teacher. That best of the twice-born souls as Their guru,  
taught Them, contented as he was with Their pure love and submissive acts, all  
the Vedas with their corollary literatures and philosophical treatises  
[Upanishads], the Dhanur-veda [military science, archery] along with all its  
secrets [the mantras], the dharma [the codes of human conduct, the laws] and  
the nyaya [the methods of logic] as also the anvikshikim [the knowledge of  
philosophical debate or tarka] and the six aspects of political sciencei. As  
the best of all first class persons and as the promulgators of all knowledge  
They, oh ruler of man, fixed in concentration, fully assimilated with simply  
having heard it only once, the complete of the sixty-four arts in as many days  
and nights and satisfied Their preceptor, oh King, by offering him  
compensation [gurudakshina]. Oh King, the bramin in consideration of the  
amazing greatness of Their superhuman intelligence, after consulting with his  
wife, arrived at the wish to see his child again that had perished in the  
ocean at Prabhasa.'So be it' the two great warlords of unlimited prowess said  
and next mounted a chariot to head for Prabhasa. Having arrived there, they  
walked up to the shore and sat down for a moment. The god of the ocean  
recognized Them and offered Them tribute. The Supreme Lord said to him: 'Present Us at once the son of Our guru, a young boy you have seized here with  
a mighty wave.'   
The god of the ocean said: 'It was not I who took him away, oh Lord, it was a  
powerful Daitya named Pa?cajana, oh Krishna, a demon who moves through the  
water in the form of a conch. He who lives here indeed has kidnapped him.'  
Hearing that the Master quickly entered the water and killed him, but He could  
not find the boy in his belly. Taking the conch shell that had grown as a part  
of the demon, He returned to the chariot and went to the beloved city of  
Yamaraja [the lord of death] known as Samyamani. Arriving there, Janardana  
together with the Lord who has a plow for His weapon [Balarama] blew loudly on  
His conch shell so that Yamaraja, he who restrains the living beings, could  
hear the sound. Overflowing with devotion Yamaraja worshiped Them elaborately  
and humbly bowing down said to Krishna who dwells in each his heart: 'What can  
I do for the two of You, oh Vishnu who, for Your pastime, has appeared in the  
form of human beings?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Please bring Me the son of My guru who was brought  
here because of his karmic bondage, oh great King. It is My command that  
should be given priority.'   
'So be it' he said and brought forward the preceptor's son. The Best of the  
Yadus gave him back to Their guru whom They then said: 'Please make another  
wish.'   
The honorable guru said: 'My dear Boys, I am completely fulfilled by the  
remuneration for the guru the two of You have offered. What else would there  
be left for the spiritual master to desire from someone like You? O heroes,  
now please return home. May Your fame sanctify the world, and may the Vedic  
hymns be ever fresh in Your minds, both in this life and the next.'   
Thus by Their guru permitted to leave, They, on Their chariot as fast as the  
wind and thundering like a cloud, reached Their city. The citizens who had not  
seen Balarama and Janardana for many days, all rejoiced to see Them again,  
like having regained a lost treasure.'

**_Yamaraja Instructs His Messengers_**  
 _Yamaraja said: 'Superior to me there is another one, another Lord, who is as  
the warp and woof of cloth to all the mobile and immobile living beings. In  
Him the entire cosmos is found and of Him there are the partial manifestations  
of the maintenance, creation and destruction of this universe. The entire  
creation is controlled by Him like a bull is by a rope through his nose. Just  
like one ties oxen to a rope He ties the people with different basic  
denominations and duties to His word, according to which they scrupulously  
carry their offerings to Him. I myself, the Lord of death, Indra the king of  
heaven, Nirriti of chaos, Varuna of water, Candra of the moon, Agni of fire,  
S'iva of destruction, Pavana of the air, Brahma of creation, Surya of the sun,  
Vis'vasu of beauty, the eight Vasus of goodness, the Sadhyas of cultivation,  
the Maruts of the wind, the Rudras of anger, the Siddhas of perfection and the  
other ones creating order in the universe, as also immortal rulers like  
Brihaspati and sages like Bhrigu, despite being ruled by goodness and being  
free from passion and ignorance, under the influence of His maya have no  
knowledge of His motives. And how much more wouldn't that be true for others  
besides them? He, the Soul present in the heart of all living beings, can  
factually not be seen or known through the senses, the mind, the breath or by  
means of ideation and words just like the different parts of the body cannot  
see the eyes watching over them. The attractive servants of the independent,  
transcendental Lord ruling everything, the Master of Maya, the Great Soul,  
generally move around in this world with His physical qualities and nature.  
The ones of Vishnu who are worshiped by the enlightened, have forms rarely  
seen that are most wonderful to behold. They protect the mortals devoted to  
the Lord from enemies and from my men, so that they are protected from  
practically every side. The great rishis, the gods, the best ones of  
perfection and also the demons, the humans including the ones founded in  
knowledge and the celestial singers [the Caranas] and such, have no knowledge  
of the dharma that is established by the Supreme Lord in person. Lord Brahma,  
Narada, Shambu, the four Kumaras, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada, Janaka, Bhishma,  
Bali, the son of Vyasa [S'uka] and I myself [Yamaraja]; we, these twelve  
[mahajanas], have knowledge of the bhagavata-dharma [of surrender to the  
Supreme Lord] my dear servants, that is most confidential, transcendental and  
hard to grasp. He who understands it achieves eternal life. We all recognize  
that for the people living in this material world the yoga of devotion unto  
the Supreme Lord beginning with the singing of the holy name, constitutes the  
supreme dharma. Just consider how by pronouncing the holy name of the Lord my  
dear sons, even Ajamila was delivered from the noose of death. Even this  
sinner Ajamila attained liberation when he, at the moment of his death,  
innocently with 'Narayana' called for his son. Singing of the qualities of His  
names and deeds is more than enough to remove the sins of man. Understand  
that this truth of the mahajanas is practically always missed by those whose  
minds were bewildered by maya, the illusory energy of the Goddess, by those  
whose intelligence to a great extend was dulled with activities and motives to  
gain wealth and name and fame,led by the wrong understanding of the flowery  
statements in the Vedas. With this in mind the sharp-witted ones with all  
their heart and soul love the Supreme and Unlimited Lord. Such persons do  
therefore not deserve my punishment. And if there would be any fall down with  
them, that also will be destroyed by the singing of Hari's names. They, the  
devotees who with an equal vision are of surrender to the Supreme Lord and  
whose sacred histories are proclaimed by the demigods and perfected ones, you  
should never approach, for they are fully protected by the mace of the Lord.  
It is not given to us to punish them, just as it isn't given to time itself.   
Communities of transcendental swanlike souls who free from material attachment  
are of self-realization, continuously relish the honey of His lotus feet. But  
they who are full of desires and attachments are on the path that leads to  
hell. Bring those before me who in their falsehood turned against Mukunda, the  
Lord of Liberation. They who run from the truth and fail in their duties unto  
Lord Vishnu, whose tongues never express the names and qualities of the  
Supreme Lord, who do not carry Him in their heart or remember His lotus feet  
and not even once bowed their heads to Krishna, bring them all before me. I  
pray that He, the Supreme Lord, the original and oldest Lord Narayana, will  
excuse me for the impudence of my servants. My men and we, acted in ignorance  
and therefore we with folded hands beg the most venerable, all-pervading Lord  
for forgiveness.'   
S'uka said: 'Therefore, oh descendant of Kuru, understand that the  
glorification of Lord Vishnu is the ultimate form of atonement, the best one  
can do in the world to deal with one's sins, however great they are.The hearts  
of those who always listen to and sing about the heroism of the Lord that  
wipes away all sin, are by their bhakti, very easily purified, while such a  
thing is not as easily brought about when one is bent upon religious customs  
and such. He who holds on to the honey of Krishna's lotus feet will not fall  
in sin again because he renounced the desire to enjoy the illusory quality of  
maya which brings distress. Anyone else however, who enchanted by lust tries  
to do something to cleanse the passion out of his soul, will surely find the  
passion reappear.   
After hearing from the mouth of their master about the extraordinary glories  
of the Lord and His name, fame and attributes, the Yamadutas were struck with  
wonder. Since then, as soon as they see a devotee, they fear him and dare not  
look at him again.

**_Lord Shiva Drinks the Poison Churned with the Mountain Mandara_**  
 _S 'uka said: 'The Suras invited the king of the snakes Vasuki, promised him  
a share of the result and wound him around the mountain to serve as a churning  
rope. Thereupon they commenced in great delight to churn the ocean in order to  
produce the nectar oh best of the Kurus. Lord Hari was the first to take him  
by the head and then the demigods followed. The Daitya leaders did not like  
the initiative of the Supreme Lord and said: 'We are not going to take the  
snake by its tail, that is its inferior part, that is not in accord with our  
education and the fame of our birth and activities.' Seeing how consequently  
the Daityas let it pass, the Lord smiled. He gave up the front portion and  
grasped together with the demigods the rear end.Thus having settled on the  
positions to hold the snake, the sons of Kas'yapa [the godly and the demoniac  
ones] with great zeal churned to get the nectar from the ocean of milk. As  
they were churning the ocean with the mountain it had no support so that it,  
despite the fact that it was held by the strong men, because of its weight  
sank down in the water, oh son of Pandu. Confronted with the fact that their  
manliness was defeated by the stronger will of providence, their faces,  
heavily disappointed, darkened. The infallible Lord, He whose ways and powers  
are inscrutable, saw the hindrance as arranged by providence and then expanded  
Himself into the wondrous body of a giant tortoise Kurma. _   
_He entered the water with it and lifted up the mountain. When the Suras and  
Asuras saw it rising they decided to churn again with the mountain Mandara  
that like a continent extended a hundred thousand yojanas wide on His back.  
The rotating of the mountain that was moved by the strong arms of the Sura and  
Asura leaders my best one, was by the primal tortoise who carried it on His  
back, considered an infinitely pleasant scratching. Thereafter, to encourage  
them and increase their strength and energy, Lord Vishnu entered the Asuras in  
the form of passion, the godly ones in the form of goodness and the king of  
the serpents Vasuki in the form of ignorance. Like another mountain holding on  
to the king of all mountains with one hand, He exhibited thousands of hands  
while from the sky Lord Brahma, Lord S 'iva and King Indra, the head of the  
gods, offered prayers to Him who was showered with flowers. With the Lord, the  
Supreme One, present on top and below the mountain as also within themselves  
and within the snake, the ocean that with great strength was churned  
vehemently with the great mountain, got seriously agitated. The serpent king  
spitted, hissing violently in all directions, fire and smoke from his  
thousands of heads. For that reason the Asuras headed by Pauloma, Kaleya, Bali  
and Ilvala, being troubled by the heat of his radiation, all began to look  
like sarala trees scorched in a forest fire. Also the luster of the Gods was  
affected by his fiery breath that smoked their dresses, fine garlands,  
armament and faces. Ordained by the Supreme Lord it then profusely began to  
rain while breezes were blowing clouds of vapor originating from the waves of  
the ocean. When the ocean by the best of the Godly ones and the Asuras was  
duly churned but no nectar appeared, the Invincible One Himself began to  
churn. He as dark as a cloud, in yellow silks, with lightning earrings on His  
ears, with the gleaming hair on His head disheveled, with His garland, reddish  
eyes and victorious arms securing the universe, grabbed the snake to churn  
with the churning rod for which the mountain was used and assumed for that  
purpose a size as big as a mountain Himself. From the churning of the ocean  
that agitated all kinds of fish, sharks, snakes, tortoises, whales, water  
elephants, crocodiles and timingilas, there came first of all a very strong  
poison called Halahala. The terribly strong, unbearable poison, that  
unstoppably spread itself in all directions upwards and downwards, scared all  
the people so that they, missing the protection of their Lord and Master oh my  
best, sought the shelter of Lord S'iva. When they saw Him who for the welfare  
of the three worlds together with His wife sits on His mountain, He, the best  
of all served by saints who in austerity walk the path of liberation, they  
offered him their obeisances.   
The lords of the created beings [the Prajapatis] said: 'Oh Lord of Lords, oh  
Mahadeva, oh soul of each, oh love of all, deliver us, who took shelter at  
your lotus feet, from this poison burning the three worlds. You are the one  
lord and master over bondage and liberation in the entire universe. You whom  
we worship are the spiritual master able to carry the burden of the  
surrendered followers. Oh mighty one, oh greatness, by your material potency,  
you are operating with the three modes of nature, in acceptance of the  
creation, maintenance and destruction of this material world, manifest  
yourself as Brahma, Vishnu or S'iva. You are the Supreme Brahman, the secret  
of the cause and effect of all the life forms of creation. You are with all  
the potencies that you manifest the Controller and Supersoul of the universe.  
You are the source of the Vedic sound, the origin of the universe, the soul,  
the life breath, the senses and the elements. You are the modes of nature and  
the natural disposition, the eternal time, the sacrifice and the dharma of  
truth and truthfulness. It is unto you that one utters the original syllable  
consisting of the three letters [A-U-M].Oh soul of all the godly ones, fire  
constitutes your mouth;, oh Lord of all the worlds the surface of the globe is  
known as your lotus feet;, oh self of the gods, time constitutes your  
movement, the directions are your ears and the controller of the waters Varuna  
is your taste. With the ether for your navel, the air for your breath, the sun  
globe for your eyes, the water for your semen, the moon for your mind and the  
higher worlds, oh Lord, for your head, your self constitutes the shelter of  
all living beings high and low. The oceans are your belly, the mountains are  
your bones, all the plants, creepers and herbs are your hairs, the seven  
types of mantras are your seven layers [koshas] and all the religions, oh you  
three Vedas [Rig, Yajur and Sama] in person, constitute the core of your  
heart. The five secret texts of the Vedic philosophy constitute your faces  
with the collection of the thirty-eight important mantras that describe the  
reality of the Soul, of you, oh Lord, who in your position of enlightenment  
are celebrated as S'iva. The waves of irreligion [lust, anger, greed and  
illusion] are nothing but your shadow, the shadow on the basis of which there  
are so many secondary creations. Your three eyes stand for the goodness, the  
passion and the darkness and simply glancing over the creation with them  
brought about the analytic scriptures of the Soul, oh Lord full of verses, oh  
god of the Vedic literatures and their supplements.None of the directors of  
the world, oh Ruler on the Mountain, neither Brahma, nor Vishnu, nor the king  
of the Suras [Indra], can fathom your transcendental effulgence, the  
impersonal spirit equal to everyone wherein the modes of passion, ignorance  
and goodness are not found. In this world that has originated from you and at  
the time of her destruction is burned to ashes by you with the sparks of the  
fire emanating from your eyes, you have out of your mercy for the living  
beings annihilated Tripura as also put an end to the sacrifices out of desire,  
the poison of time and many other forms of misery. But these matters are not  
part of your praises, since you ban this world from your mind. People not  
knowing your help and kindness shamelessly criticize you for being a savage  
person whom one always finds at the burial place smeared with ashes and for  
moving with your consort Uma despite your highly advanced austerity and the  
fact that your lotus feet are remembered by the realised Gurus. Because you  
are transcendentally situated above the moving and the not moving living  
beings, you are difficult to understand. And when it is not possible for even  
Brahma and the ones belonging to him to properly understand your real nature  
oh great one, how can we? Since no one can understand you in truth, how can  
one offer you prayers? It is impossible. As far as we are concerned, we are  
creatures of Lord Brahma's creation. Under the circumstances, therefore, we  
cannot offer you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have  
expressed our feelings. We see the Supreme form that you manifested to bless  
the world, but not your transcendence, oh great Lord whose ways are  
inscrutable.'   
S'uka said: 'Seeing their pernicious predicament he, Mahadeva, the friend of  
all living beings out of his compassion for the great distress spoke to his  
beloved Sati. Lord S'iva said: 'Dear Bhavani, just see how pitiable this  
situation is of all the living beings that are threatened by the poison  
resulting from churning the ocean. Feeling responsible for all their lives, I  
must do something for their safety; is it my duty as the master to protect  
against distress. Devotees at the cost of their own lives protect other  
living beings who, time bound and bewildered by the external energy, are of  
enmity with one another. The Soul of All, the Lord, is pleased when one takes  
pity on others, oh gentle one. When the Lord is pleased also I and all other  
moving and not moving entities are happy. May there be the well-being of all  
creatures, with me drinking this poison.'   
S'uka said: 'After Lord S'iva, the well-wisher of the universe thus had  
addressed Bhavani she gave her permission, very well knowing his capabilities,  
whereupon he proceeded to drink the poison. Mahadeva out of compassion for the  
welfare of all living beings consequently took the widespread Halahala poison  
in his hand and drank it. That poison from the water exhibited its potency to  
him by turning his neck dark-blue, a feature considered an ornament by the  
virtuous ones, the saints and the sages. Good and honest people practically  
always take to heart the sufferings of their fellow men. This is considered  
the highest form of worshiping the Lord. Hearing about that act of S'iva, the  
god of gods, the graceful one, he was highly praised by the daughter of  
Daksha, by Brahma, by the Lord of Vaikunthha and by all the people. Scorpions,  
cobras and other poisonous animals and plants are the beings who took care of  
the little bit that was scattered here and there as he drank from his palm.'

**__Liberation from ignorance**  
 _The Lord Kapila said: 'Even though abides in a material body, the Soul is not affected by the basic  
qualities of matter because he does not claim doership and thus is not subject  
to change, just like the sun is not affected by being reflected in water. But  
when this very Soul is affected with the modes of material nature it becomes  
bewildered by the ego sense and thinks: 'I am the doer'. Dealing with material  
nature in such a way,the wrong actions are the result,and he in discontent,  
helplessly undergoes the repeated birth and death,in births from different  
wombs or species depending on the good or bad life he led or a combination of  
these. Like having landed in a nightmare wherein the things happening do not  
really exist, there is for the Soul, who only thinks and sees what occurs to  
his senses, no end to his materially conditioned existence and illusion.  
Therefore the mind of attachment to material pleasure must, free from  
attachment, gradually be brought under control with the bhakti. Beginning with  
yama [meaning the great vow of yoga of nonviolence, truth, non-stealing,  
celibacy and non-possessiveness in the discipline of detachment], one should  
practice the different forms of yoga and develop, endowed with faith,  
unalloyed devotion unto Me by listening my stories,reading and reflecting on  
the teachings of the Truth. Therein one must be without enmity and regard all  
living beings as equal, not entertain intimate relations and be celibate, be  
free from chatter and offer the results of one's labor. One should be  
satisfied with whatever comes of its own, eat little and live thoughtfully in  
a secluded place and be peaceful, kind, compassionate and self-realized. In  
relating to others and to one's body one should not follow the physical  
concept of life but rather, from the spiritual perspective attend to the  
factual truth of both the material and the personal aspect. One should  
transcend the stages of consciousness [of waking, dreaming and deep sleep] and  
stay away from other conceptions of life. Thus, with a purified intellect, the  
true Self, the Soul within, should be seen as clear as the sun before one's  
eyes. A liberated soul realizes the Truth, which is beyond and which is  
manifest as a reflection in the false ego. He is the support of the material  
cause and He enters into everything. He is Absolute, one without a second, and  
He is the eye of the illusory energy. It is like with the sun that can be seen  
as a reflection on water or on a wall, but factually is situated in the sky.  
The Truth is reflected in the threefold nature of the materially identified  
ego that consists of body, senses and mind. Someone who in this material world  
wrongly identifies with the material elements, the objects of enjoyment, the  
material senses, the mind, intelligence and so on, is actually in deep sleep,  
but once he is awakened he is freed from false ego and illusion. Even though  
not being lost, still the Soul unjustly considers himself lost. But through  
the path of yoga,established in Jnana,he sees himself as a witness,not  
affected with material nature,and with it, he sees also unreality of the ego.  
Coming to understand this,he realizes his true Self,Atma, his original  
individuality [svarupa].'   
Devahuti said: 'Dear brahmin, is it not so that material nature never releases  
the soul because the two are eternally attracted to each other, oh Best One?  
Just as aroma and earth have no separate existence and taste does not exist  
apart from water, intelligence cannot exist independent of consciousness.  
Then how can a soul be free from material nature? Is the soul, being a passive  
observer, not forced to act because of the basic qualities of matter? The  
great fear, one may avoid by contemplating the fundamental principles, will  
not cease because every time its cause appears again.'   
The Bhagavan said: 'One will realize the freedom, when one, with a pure mind serious unto Me and  
faithfully contemplates on the Truth with devotion, manages to perform one's  
duties without desiring the fruits thereof. By means of Jnana, with the vision  
of the Absolute Truth, by penance,with renunciation, detached and firmly fixed  
in that same Truth, one becomes absorbed in the Self. Bound to material nature  
he is day after day consumed, like firewood by fire, disappearing gradually.  
But experiencing his dependency, understanding the futility of the desire to  
always enjoy, he, thus forsaking sensual pleasures, firmly stands in his own  
glory. The many inauspicious matters a person may dream of in his sleep, will  
not in the least daunt him when he has awakened. Someone, who has fixed his  
mind upon Me, the knower of the Absolute Truth within, thus has nothing to  
fear from material nature. When someone wise thus for many years and many  
births is engaged in self-realization, he will develop a distaste for enjoying  
whatever, even the heaven of the creator. Someone devoted to Me who under My  
protection for the sake of awakening his intelligence, by My unlimited mercy  
goes for the ultimate goal of his existence that is called kaivalya  
[enlightenment, emancipation, beatitude], will in this life soon attain a  
steady self-awareness and be free from doubt. The yogi who departed for that  
heavenly abode will, after leaving behind both the subtle and the gross body,  
never return. When the attention of the perfected yogi is not drawn towards  
yogic powers to control the material illusion, my dear mother, then, having no  
other purpose in his life, his progress towards Me will be unbounded, because  
the power of death is lost therein.'   
Book 3,Chapter 27_

**_Explanation of Bhakti Yoga by Lord Kapila   
_**  
 _Devah?ti said: "Please elaborate now at length on the path of bhakti yoga  
that one calls the ultimate purpose."   
Maitreya said: 'Appreciating the words of His mother, oh best of the Kurus,  
the great and gentle sage, contented and being moved by compassion, said the  
following. The Bhagavan said: 'O noble lady, there are many paths and ways of bhakti yoga,depending on  
natural disposition and temperaments of seekers. What one does out of love for  
Me in a spirit of violence, pride and envy or out of anger with a fractional  
view,is considered to be in the mode of darkness(tamas). He who worships Me  
with idols and aims at material things, fame and opulence, is in the mode of  
passion (rajas). Someone who worships Me with offering the results of his  
actions or when he for the sake of transcendence desires to be free from karma  
[profit-minded action],that bhakti is said to be in the mode of goodness  
(sattva). In case of an uninterrupted thinking of Me who is present in  
everyone's heart - just like the water of the Ganges that continuously flows  
towards the ocean - and when one wishes to hear about My qualities only,  
having no ulterior motives, one may speak of pure devotion, of bhakti unto the  
Supreme One. Pure devotees will not accept it - not even when being offered  
these - to be equal with Me, to have the same opulence, to be a personal  
associate, to have the same bodily features or to be joined in oneness,but  
only to be in My service. When one by means of this bhakti yoga - which one  
calls the highest aim - succeeds in dealing with the three modes of nature the  
way I explained it, one attains My transcendental nature. When one performs  
one's duties without attachment to the results one is stronger, and when one  
without unnecessary violence regularly and with dedication practice this yoga,  
one will find happiness. The same as someone worships My statue,by seeing it,  
offering respect to it,by offering obeisances, praise and worship,he should  
,in the spirit of detachment and in the mode of goodness, think of Me and see  
Me being present in all living beings. By means of sense control and proper  
regulation [yama and niyama], being of the greatest respect for the great  
souls, being compassionate with the poor and by being friendly in association  
with like-minded souls; by hearing about spiritual matters, chanting My holy  
names, being straightforward, by association with civilized people and not  
entertaining false ego, the consciousness of a person who with these qualities  
is dutiful towards Me is completely purified. No doubt he by simply hearing  
about My excellence will directly reach Me. The way the sense of smell catches  
the aroma that is carried from its source by means of the air, similarly  
consciousness by means of yoga catches the Supreme Soul who is free from  
change.   
When one who worships the deity but has no respect for Me who, in the form of  
the All pervading Soul, is always situated in every living being,this is  
nothing but a hypocrisy. Someone who in worship of the deity has no regard for  
Me as the Supreme Ruler present in all beings, is in his ignorance only  
offering oblations into the ashes. He who offers Me his respects but is  
envious, lives in his campaigning against others and in enmity, will never  
find peace of mind. Oh sinless one, I am certainly not pleased when they who  
manage to worship Me in My deity form, are not of respect for other living  
beings. Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the  
Ishvara until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of  
other living beings as well. For those who discriminate with regard to the  
body of themselves and that of others, for those who make distinction between  
them and others,as the blazing fire of death, I will cause great fear. One  
should therefore, with charity, respect and in friendship regarding everyone  
as an equal, propitiate Me, the One True Self abiding in all.   
Living entities are better developed than inanimate objects, better than  
entities with life symptoms, oh blessed one, are entities with a developed  
consciousness and better than those are they who developed sense perception.  
Among them, those who developed taste are better than those who only developed  
a sense of touch and better than they are those who developed a sense of  
smell. Even better are those creatures who developed the faculty to hear.  
Better than those are the ones distinguishing differences of form and those  
who have teeth in both their jaws are better than these. Those who have many  
legs are superior to them. Of them the four-legged creatures are the ones  
better developed,while the two-legged ones are even better. Among human  
beings a society with four classes is the better one and of those classes the  
brahmins are the best. Among the brahmins the better one is who knows the  
Vedas, but best of those are the Brahmins who know its purpose.   
The one who puts an end to all doubts is better than he who knows what the  
purpose of the Vedas is and the brahmin among them who performs his duty is  
better than him. He who is free from worldly attachment is still better and  
the one who performs his righteous duty not for himself alone is the best  
developed of them all.   
Therefore I know of no greater being than a person who with a dedicated mind  
has offered all of his actions, wealth and life without any reservation to Me  
and with persistence is of service without any other interest or motive,but  
only from the deep love. Such a one who regards the Supreme Lord, the  
Controller of the individual soul, as having entered all the living beings in  
the form of the Paramatma, is therefore mindfully of respect for his fellow  
creatures. Oh daughter of Manu, someone can attain the Original Person by  
following either of these two paths of bhakti and mystic yoga separately that  
I have described. This Bhagavan is the eternal form of the Brahman. He is  
Purusha,ethereal personality of the primal reality,He is transcendental,and  
all His activities are spiritual.   
Time, known as the divine cause of the different manifestations of the living  
entities, constitutes the reason why all living beings who consider themselves  
as existing in separation, from the greatest on, live in fear. He who from  
within first enters all the living entities, is the support of everyone and  
annihilates them again by means of other living beings, is named Vishnu, the  
enjoyer of all sacrifices. He is that time factor, the Master of all masters.  
There is no one specially favored by Him, nobody is his friend or enemy. He  
approaches those who are attentive and of those who are inattentive He is the  
destroyer.   
 He for whom the wind out of fear blows and this sun is shining, for whom out  
of fear Indra sends his rains and the heavenly bodies are shining; He because  
of whom out of fear the trees, creepers and herbs each in their own time bear  
flowers and produce their fruits; He afraid of whom the rivers flow and the  
oceans do not overflow, because of whom fire burns and the earth with her  
mountains does not submerge; He because of whom the sky provides air to those  
who breathe and under the control of whom the universe expands its body of the  
complete reality [mahat-tattva] with its seven layers, He for whom out of fear  
the gods of creation and more, in charge of the basic qualities of nature,  
within this world carry out their functions according to the yugas, He of whom  
afraid all the animate and inanimate beings find their control; that Infinite,  
final operator of beginningless Time is the Unchangeable Creator who creates  
people out of people and by means of death destroys even the Lord of death  
himself.'

**_Lord Kapila Describes the Adverse Consequences of Karma_**  
 _Lord Kapila said: 'Just like a mass of clouds has no knowledge of the power of the wind,in the  
same way a person has no knowledge of the great power of the Time, even though  
he is being conditioned by it. Whatever the goods one with difficulty acquired  
for one's happiness, they are destroyed by the Bhagavan, and for this reason  
he laments. In his ignorance he foolishly thinks that having a home, land and  
wealth for the sake of his body, would be something permanent. The living  
being will irrespective of the birth he acquired,in any species he finds  
himself,find satisfaction in this worldly existence. Even being in hell a  
person, who in fact is deluded by the divine Maya, does not wish to give up  
his hellish pleasures. With his body, spouse, children, home, animals, wealth  
and friendships deeply rooted in his heart, he considers himself a great  
success. Burning with anxiety about maintaining all the members of his dear  
family, he is always uncomfortable and sinful,acting like a fool. With his  
heart and senses charmed by the woman and by the display of the sweet words of  
his children, he is in the grip of the illusion,considering that which is non-  
permanent to be eternal. Engaged in the supposed duties of his family life -  
which cause him all kinds of trouble, he is busy countering these miseries  
while thinking that that will make him happy as a householder. Only enjoying  
little of it, he maintains his family by unjust means and the wealth that he  
with violence secured, but following that course he ultimately goes against  
himself. When he, despite his repeated efforts, fails in securing what he  
wished, he will, ruled by greed,desire the wealth enjoyed by others and thus  
get into trouble. No longer capable of maintaining his family the unfortunate  
wretch,being old and bereft of wealth and beauty, then with a bewildered  
intelligence full of grief laments over everything he tried in vain.   
Thus finding himself incapable of supporting his wife and children, he is not  
respected as he was before, the way an old ox is not respected by its farmer.  
Despite getting deformed of old age,and being maintained by the ones he once  
maintained, no aversion against a family life rises in him while he, at home  
awaits his death. Remaining there he, like a pet dog, eats what indifferently  
is placed before him, falls sick with indigestion and eats and does only  
little. In that diseased condition, one?s eyes bulge due to the pressure of  
air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty  
breathing, and upon exhaling and inhaling he produces strange sound, a  
rattling within the throat. Lying down surrounded by his lamenting friends and  
relatives he, with the noose of time around his neck, cannot respond to the  
things said to him. He, who was engrossed in maintaining his family and had no  
control over his senses, thus passes away in great pain, with his relatives in  
tears. Witnessing the arrival of the servants of death with their terrible  
eyes full of wrath, he, because of the fear in his heart, passes stool and  
urine. Like the king's soldiers they immobilize his body by binding him in  
ropes for his punishment, whereupon they drag him like a criminal forcefully  
by the neck over a long distance. Innerly broken by their threatening  
presence he, overtaken, trembles on the road and is bitten by dogs in the  
distress of remembering his sins. Afflicted by hunger, thirst and the heat of  
scorching forest fires and winds on hot and sandy roads, he feels how he  
painfully is beaten on his back with a whip, while he, unable to move, can  
find no refuge or water. Now and then he falls, gets tired and loses  
consciousness, and then again he reawakens on the road of his misery where he  
quickly is led before the eternal ruler of death Yamaraja. He sees his entire  
life passing by in a few moments and then receives the punishment he deserves.  
With his limbs covered by firewood he is cremated or sometimes he sees himself  
eating his own flesh. Vividly he then witnesses how dogs pull out his entrails  
at his last resting place where serpents, scorpions, gnats and so on pester  
him to his abhorrence. One by one his limbs are separated from his body by big  
and small animals who tear him apart, throw him from heights or drag him under  
water or into caves. Because of the unregulated sexual association one  
has,one must, whether one is a man or a woman,undergo the reaction in hellish  
states of anger,self-destruction and bewilderment.   
Actually, heaven and hell exist also in this world, oh mother, so they  
sometimes become visible and experienced here. He who thus in greed,  
attachment and infidelity maintained his family or lived for his stomach only,  
will upon leaving this world in his afterlife have to face the consequences  
for himself and his family. After quitting his body he will enter the darkness  
all alone and pay the price for the harm that he out of self-interest did to  
others in his envy of their fortune. By divine arrangement a man who sustained  
his family has to undergo the hellish reaction of his foul play and suffer  
like someone who lost all his wealth. When a person in his eagerness to care  
for his family is simply godless and unscrupulous in his actions, he heads for  
the darkest region of self-destruction. After he, beginning from the lowest  
position of an animal existence prior to a human birth, in due order has  
undergone all the reactions and so on, he, thus being purified, may again  
return here.'

**_Lord Nrisimha Slays the King of the Demons_**  
 _Narada Muni said to Yudhishthhira: 'Having heard explanations of the Truth  
from the Great Prahlada,all the attending Daitya sons (Prahlada's schoolmates)  
accepted his words because of their profundity and rejected what their  
teachers had taught them. When the two sons of the guru [S'ukracarya's sons  
Shanda and Amarka] realized how the intelligence of the boys had gotten fixed  
on this one subject matter, they fearfully contacted the king to submit to him  
what was going on.   
(- the king was Prahlada's father,the great Asura Hiranyakas'ipu. )   
All over his body trembling with anger and with a mind determined to kill his  
son he rebuked Prahlada. With the harshest words he furiously with an angry  
face and crooked, wicked eyes approached him who did not deserve such a  
treatment at all. He from his side gentle and restrained, with his hands  
folded just stood there before his father who was hissing like a vicious snake  
trampled upon.   
Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'Oh you impudent fool, you intriguer of the family, you  
outcaste, you obstinate one going against my rule, I will today send you to  
the abode of Yamaraja! When I am angry all inhabitants of the three worlds and  
their leaders tremble for me. By what power do you so fearlessly overstep my  
rule, you rascal?'.   
Prahlada said: 'He is not only my strength but also yours, oh King and the  
strength of all other exalted and lower living beings. All who move around and  
do not move around, beginning with Lord Brahma, fall under His control. He,  
the supreme controller, the time factor, is Urukrama, the Lord of the Wide  
Steps [Vamana] who is that one strength of one's mind and life, the steadiness  
of one's physical power and senses. He, the True Self, is the Supreme Master  
of the three modes who by His different natural forces creates, maintains and  
withdraws again the entire universe. Please give up the Asura way. Be peaceful  
and create no enemies. Destroy only the true enemy that is an uncontrolled  
mind. That approach is the best method to worship the unlimited Lord. In the  
past there were plunderers who not in control with the six enemies [the mind  
and the five senses] stole away everything. Others saw themselves as  
conquerors of the ten directions. But where are with a saint who managed to  
defeat his senses and is of an equal regard for all living beings, those  
enemies to be found who are a product of one's own imagination?'   
Sri Hiranyakas'ipu said: 'You apparently, with your unlimited pretenses, seek  
your own demise. You prove that people about to die talk gibberish, you  
pityful idiot. You unlucky soul, you talk of someone other than me who would  
be the controller of the universe, but where is He to be found? If He is  
omnipresent, then why do I not see Him in this pillar right in front of me?  
Let that Lord you wished yourself as your protector protect you, now that I am  
going to sever your head from your trunk, now that I am going to put an end to  
someone talking such nonsense like you.'   
Thus with a stream of abuses enraged chastising his son, that great devotee,  
Hiranyakas'ipu, rising from his throne and taking up his sword, with his fist  
struck hard against a column. At that very time from within the column a most  
fearful sound could be heard as if the covering of the universe cracked open.  
That sound dear King, reached as far as the place of the godly ones of Lord  
Brahma and made them believe that the destruction of their abodes was at hand.  
He who in his display of power wanted to kill his son, also heard the  
tumultuous sound one had never heard before and stood together with the  
assembly present amazed about the fact that one could not determine its  
origin. Thus all these men of power were caught in fear. To be true to the  
words that were spoken in defense of His omnipresence, of His pervading each  
and everything, one could see a most wonderful form of Him taking shape in a  
pillar in the middle of the assembly hall. It was neither an animal nor a man.  
The king, studying the phenomenon from all sides, saw how a living being  
emerged from the middle of the pillar. But not being able to ascertain whether  
it was an animal or a human being he said amazed: 'What kind of form is this?  
It is half man and half lion!'   
As he was contemplating the miracle that took place in front of him, the  
extraordinary, most frightening form of Nrisimhadeva appeared. He had eyes  
glowing like molten gold and deadly teeth in a face extending into manes.  
Looking around with a dreadful frown He waved His tongue like a razor sharp  
sword. His ears stood motionless straight up and His nostrils and mouth were  
opened wide like mountain caves. His huge body was short and fat with a broad  
neck and a broad chest over a small waist. His body was covered with whitish  
hairs resembling the rays of the moon and hundreds of arms stretched in all  
directions were equipped with hard to challenge fatal nails who served as  
weapons next to His other personal weapons. Faced with that excellence the  
Daityas and Danavas fled away. 'I guess this is what the Lord so full of  
mystical potency is trying to do in order to get me killed, but what's the  
use?' so Hiranyakas'ipu murmured to himself and taking up his mace the Daitya  
threw himself forward like an elephant to attack the loudly roaring Lord  
Nrisimha. As invisible as an insect that has fallen into a fire, the Asura  
disappeared into the effulgence of Nrisimha. That was something not that  
astonishing at all that moment considering the fact that He with the  
effulgence of His goodness formerly had swallowed the darkness of the entire  
creation. The greatest of the demons reaching Lord Nrisimha thereupon  
furiously with great force exercising his prowess struck Him with his club,  
but the Lord, the Wielder of the Club, seized him just like the son of Garuda  
would capture a great snake.Oh son of Bharata, when He in order to play a game  
allowed the Asura to slip from His hands exactly the way Garuda sometimes  
deals with a snake, the godly ones of the different worlds who were driven  
from their positions, from behind the clouds considered that to be a bad turn  
of events. The demon thinking that He had let him go out of fear for his  
masculine display, after regaining his strength took up his sword and shield  
and with great force attacked Nrisimhadeva for the second time. When he with  
his moon spotted shield and sword fast as a hawk was maneuvering up and down  
so as not to offer any opportunity, the Lord made a very shrill, loud sound of  
laughter that was so frightening that he, with his eyes shortly closed, was  
captured by the Greatest of all Speed. In protest he wrestling with his limbs  
tried to escape, but the Lord placed him whose skin could not even be cut by  
Indra's thunderbolt, at the entrance of the palace on His lap like he was a  
snake or mouse and pierced him with His nails as easy as Garuda pierces a  
poisonous viper. He with His most fearful eyes full of anger was difficult to  
behold. With His mouth wide open licking the edges with His tongue and with  
His mane and face smeared red with traces of blood, He wore the intestines  
like a garland around His neck and looked like a lion that just has killed an  
elephant. The heart He with His pointed nails had ripped out completely and  
thrown aside and the thousands of followers who with their raised weapons  
attended to their leader He all killed using His nails and the other weapons  
in His countless hands. Shaking His manes He scattered the clouds and with His  
glaring glance He outshone the luminaries. The waters and oceans struck by His  
breathing swirled in perturbation and afraid of His roar the elephants  
guarding the quarters of the universe cried. With Him tossing His hair the  
celestial chariots crowding in the sky slipped from their places, the earth  
shook under the heavy weight of His feet, His intolerable force moved the  
mountains and hills and His effulgence outshone everything else in all  
directions of the sky.   
*Hiranyakas'ipu and his brother Hiranyaksha (killed by the Boar Avatar),were actually two doorkeepers of Vaikunta. They were cursed by the great brahmin Sages four Kumaras to become demons,because they would not let them enter the Vaikunta. Hiranyakas'ipu by the power of great dedication and severe penances got the boon from the Lord not die because of any of the living being created by Lord,Neither at home nor outside, neither during the day nor at night, neither from any known weapon nor by any other thing, neither on the ground or in the sky nor by any human being or animal,Neither lifeless things nor living entities, neither demigod or demon nor the great serpents,to have the supremacy in battle and the rule over all embodied souls including the deities of all planets). In the past,Hiranyakas'ipu many times tried to kill his son Prahlada,because of his great devotion,but did not succeed.   
-When two door-keepers and great Devotees Jaya and Vijaya,who later became two great Asuras,were cursed by the Sages,the Lord said:  **' These two will soon elsewhere take birth from a godless womb. With their  
focus of mind intensified by anger, they will remain firmly united with Me and  
before long return to My presence. Know that your curse was ordained by Me  
alone, oh learned ones.'**)

Thereafter sitting in the assembly hall on the highest seat of man with a most  
fearsome, terrible countenance, there was no one to challenge Him nor anyone  
to worship Him. But upon hearing how he, the Daitya who was the headache of  
the three worlds, in the battle had been killed by the Lord, there were  
exclamations of joy, blossoming faces and endless showers of flowers from the  
wives of the demigods. At that time there was an overcast formed by all the  
celestial chariots of the demigods desirous to attend. Drums and kettle drums  
were sounded and the greatest singers and angels of heaven sang and danced.  
All the godly ones, Brahma, Indra and Shiva, the sages, the ancestors, the  
perfected ones, the scientific experts and the great serpents assembled there.  
The founding fathers, the leaders of mankind, the residents of heaven and the  
best of the angels arrived there too, as did the venerable ones, the keepers  
of the wealth and the monkey-like, oh my best one. Also the goblins came, the  
ones of superpower and they who were Vishnu's personal associates like Sunanda  
and Kumuda. With their hands folded before their heads to offer their  
obeisance each of them approached Him who had appeared as half a man, half a  
lion and now sat there on the throne displaying His effulgence.   
Lord Brahma said: 'I bow down before You, oh Inscrutable One of unlimited  
powers. You with all Your might and prowess and the purity of Your actions  
stand for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. While You  
in Your divine game play with the modes, You never change Yourself,and stand  
above this creation.'   
Lord Shiva said: 'The end of the yuga is the time suitable for You to kill in  
anger this insignificant demon; just protect his son, this bhakta of surrender  
next to You, oh caretaker of the devotees.'   
Sri Indra said: 'Our share of the sacrifices was secured by Your Lordship  
protecting us, oh Supreme One. We have no words to describe how afflicted our  
lotus-like hearts were by the Daitya, our hearts that are really Your  
residence. Alas, oh Lord, how insignificant is our world in the grip of Time,  
but for the sake of the devoted ones in Your service You have shed Your light  
so that they may find liberation from their bondage. What else but considering  
the visible world as unimportant would constitute their way oh Nrisimha?'   
The Rishis said: 'You are the shining example who taught us our austerity. By  
this power of Yours this world, oh Original Lord, is created, maintained and  
reabsorbed. That penance was stolen by this unwise soul but is now, oh Shelter  
of the Needy, restored by the protection of Your embodiment.'   
The ancestors [the Pitris] said: 'The demon who engaging with force enjoyed  
our s'raddha sacrifices that were offered by our sons and grandsons, he who  
even at the holy bathing places drank from our offerings of sesame water, by  
piercing the intestines of his belly with the nails of Your hand these  
offerings have reached their proper destination. He, the maintainer of the  
universal principles of religion who appeared as a man-lion, Him we offer our  
obeisances.   
The ones of perfection [the Siddhas] said: 'This most uncivilized and  
dishonest person who stole away the joy of our perfection in yoga and with the  
power of his mysticism and penance was so proud of his wealth, has been torn  
apart by Your nails. We bow down before You, oh Nrisimha.'   
The scientific experts [the Vidyadharas] said: 'Our forms of knowledge that  
each are attained by a different way of concentrating, were pushed aside by  
this fool puffed up about his strength and prowess. He who in battle killed  
him like he was an animal, to Him who appeared as Nrisimha, we surrendered  
souls are ever obliged.'   
The snake people [the Nagas] said: 'By piercing the chest of that greatest of  
all sinners who seized our jewels and beautiful women, You have done our wives  
a great favor. Let us offer You our obeisances.'   
The original fathers [the Manus] said: 'We, the Manus are Your authorities but  
were disrespected by this son of Diti who broke with the moral ties for the  
establishment, oh Lord. With You having killed this villain, oh Master, please  
tell us what we, Your eternal servants, can do for You.'   
The founding fathers [the Prajapatis] said: 'We, the creators of the  
generations owe our lives to You, oh Supreme Controller and not to him who  
denied the living beings that we have put on this world a life. And now, by  
assuming the form of an incarnation of Your pure goodness, You for the well-  
being of the world have split open the chest of him who lies slain.'   
The musicians of heaven [the Gandharvas] said: 'We, oh Lord are Your dancers  
and singers, Your performers, who were brought under the control of the power  
and strength of the one here who You reduced to this condition. Can anyone on  
the path of evil find happiness?'   
The venerable souls [the Caranas] said: 'Oh Lord, Your lotus feet liberate  
from the need to start a new life. We duly seek shelter there because You have  
put an end to this Asura, this snake in the heart of all virtuous people.'   
The keepers of the wealth [the Yakshas] said: 'We, serving You to Your  
pleasure belong to Your best followers. This son of Diti forced us to carry  
his palanquin but caused the sorrow of each and everyone. Thus we acknowledge  
You oh Lord Nrisimha, for You are the one who put him to death, oh twenty-  
fifth principle.'   
The monkey-like beings [the Kimpurushas] said: 'We are questionable humans,  
Kimpurushas but You are the Supreme Lord. And this bad person has been slain  
by You after having been condemned by the saintly ones.'   
The king's bards [the Vaitalikas] said: 'We in great gatherings and arenas of  
sacrifice singing the glories of Your spotless reputation have achieved the  
greatest position of respect. This crooked character who subdued us oh Supreme  
Lord, has to our great fortune been killed by You, like he was a disease.'   
The lower gods [the Kinnaras, those with a human head and an animal body,  
singers of heaven] said: 'Oh Lord, we the Kinnaras are Your faithful servants.  
Because of that son of Diti we had to perform in forced labor, but the sinner  
was by You destroyed, oh Nrisimhadeva, oh Master. Please be there as our  
happiness and welfare.'   
The associates of Lord Vishnu said: 'Today we have seen You in a wondrous  
human-like form. You are our shelter and the happiness of all the worlds. This  
servant of the state, oh Lord, was cursed by the scholars and has therefore  
been killed. We consider that to be Your special grace.'   
Narada Muni said [to Yudhishthhira]: 'None could step forward, not even Lord  
Brahma or Lord Shiva, because He, boiling with anger, was most difficult to  
approach. The Goddess of Fortune personally by the demigods being urged to do  
so could, after seeing Him so huge and wonderful as no one had ever seen or  
heard before, not move in His direction because she was very afraid. Then Lord  
Brahma prompted Prahlada who stood close by: 'My dear son, can you please  
approach the Lord and propitiate Him? He is very angry because of what your  
father did.'   
'Surely' he said and even though he was only a small boy oh King, the great  
devotee slowly, step by step, approached Him and prostrated himself with  
folded hands offering prayers. The godhead was by him, such a little boy  
fallen at His lotus feet, greatly moved and filled with mercy He raised His  
lotus hand, placed it on his head and dispelled the fear for the snake of time  
from all minds present there. Because of that touch he was cleansed from all  
evil. And immediately in this association with the Supreme Soul, with His  
lotus feet, his heart melted being captured in bliss. With Him in his heart  
tears welled in his eyes and symptoms of ecstasy manifested all over his  
body.'

**_The purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam and many Avatars of the Lord Krishna_**  
 _Suta said: "In the beginning the Supreme Lord assumed, for the creation of  
the worlds, the form of the Original Person[Purusha],the cosmic intelligence  
and such,and created the sixteen primary principles [of the ten knowing and  
working senses, the mind and the five elements]. Resting in His meditative  
slumber in that water, out of the lotus that spread from the lake of His  
navel, Brahma was manifested, the master of the progenitors in the universe.  
One supposes the different worlds to be an expansions and the part of the form  
of the Fortunate One that constitutes the excellence of the purest existence.  
In a perfect spiritual vision His form is seen as having numerous legs,  
thighs, arms and faces, with wonderful heads, ears, eyes and noses, all  
glowing with countless garlands, earrings and dresses. This source of the  
numerous incarnations is the imperishable seed from which the plenary portions  
originate as also the portions thereof, such as the gods, the human beings and  
the animals."   
"The first Divinity created were the sons of Brahma,the Kumaras, who performed  
the most difficult discipline of continuous celibacy so they could realize the  
Absolute (Brahman). The Supreme Enjoyer secondly assumed the form of a Boar  
for the welfare of the earth that had sunken to the lowest regions and lifted  
her up from the ocean. Thirdly He accepted His presence among the seers in the  
form of Narada Muni for the sake of evolving the Vedic knowledge of Bhakti  
Yoga free from material motives. Fourth born as the twin sons of Murti, the  
wife of king Dharma, in the form of Nara-Narayaṇa subjected Himself to severe  
penances to attain control over the senses. Fifth He, carrying the name of  
Kapila, gave an exposition to the brahmin Asuri on the nature of metaphysics  
and the elements of creation, because in the course of time that knowledge had  
been lost. Sixth as the son of Atri,named Dattatreya, being born from Anasusa  
who prayed for Him, He lectured to Alarka, Prahlada and others about  
transcendence. Seventh being born from Akuti as Yajna, the son of Prajapati  
Ruci, He together with His son Yama and other demigods, ruled during the  
period of Svayambhuva Manu. Eighth, from the wife of King Nabhi, Merudev?, the  
Almighty Lord took birth as King Rishabha and showed the path of perfection  
respected by people of all stages of life. His ninth incarnation He accepted  
in response to the prayers of the sages, whereupon He as Prithu ruled the  
earth for the sake of collecting her produces, which made her most attractive.  
Assuming the form of a fish Matsya, He after the period of Cakshusha Manu  
protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him in a boat afloat the waters when the  
world was deeply inundated. Eleventh the mighty Lord in the form of a tortoise  
Kurma sustained the Mandaracala Hill of the theists and atheists that served  
as a pivot in the ocean. Twelfth He appeared as Dhanvantari,Lord of medicine,  
and thirteenth He appeared before the atheists as an alluring beautiful woman  
Mohini and gave nectar to the demigods. In His fourteenth incarnation He, half  
as a lion, appeared as Nrisimha, who with His nails on His lap tore apart the  
king of the atheists like a carpenter splitting cane. Fifteenth He assumed the  
form of Vamana who went to the arena of sacrifice of Maharaja Bali to beg for  
only three steps of land, concealing His wish to regain the three worlds. In  
His sixteenth incarnation He as Bhrigupati or Paras'urama saw that the ruling  
class was hostile towards the brahmins and acted twenty-one times against  
them. Seeing that the common people were less intelligent He, seventeenth,  
incarnated as Vyasa taking birth from Satyavati with Paras'ara Muni as His  
father, for the purpose of dividing the Vedas into several branches. Next He  
performed in a superhuman way having assumed the form of a divine human being  
Rama, by controlling the Indian Ocean and such, so that He could act for the  
sake of the godly souls. Nineteenth as also twentieth Bhagavan took birth in  
the Vrishni family as Balarama and Krishna and thus removed the burden from  
the world. Thereafter at the beginning of the Age of Kali He shall appear as  
the son of mother Anjana with the name Buddha for the purpose of deluding the  
ones envious of the theists. Next, at the conjunction of two yugas, when there  
is hardly a ruler to be found who is not a plunderer, the Lord of the Creation  
carrying the name of Kalki will take birth from the ones(or place) famous  
by(with) Vishnu "   
"Dear brahmins, the incarnations of the Lord who appeared from the ocean of  
goodness are as innumerable as the thousands of streams we have from  
inexhaustible sources of water. All the powerful sages, the godly souls, the  
Manus and their progeny as also the Prajapatis [the founding fathers] are  
aspects of the Lord. They are all part of Krishna, the Bhagavan in person who  
offers protection during all ages and in all worlds against disturbances  
because of the enemies of the king of heaven.   
Anyone who in the morning and the evening carefully recites these mysterious  
births of the Lord, will find relief from all miseries of life. All these  
forms of the Lord that by the qualities of the material energy were created  
with the cosmic intelligence and other elements, originated from His Self-  
awareness that is without a form. The less intelligent observer perceives them  
the way one sees clouds in the sky or dust in the air. This unmanifested Self  
is the beyond,cannot be seen or heard and has no form,but the jiva(individual  
soul) affected by the modes of nature takes birth repeatedly. As soon as one  
by self-knowledge arrives at the rejection of all these gross and subtle forms  
that impose themselves on the soul because of ignorance, one arrives at the  
realization of the Absolute Truth. With the illusory energy subsided and  
mindfulness one is endowed with the full knowledge of enlightenment and  
becomes situated in one's own glory. This is how the learned describe  
activities and the births of the actually Unborn and non-engaged Lord of the  
Heart; this is the hidden meaning of the Vedas. Residing within every living  
being He is the omnipotent master and witness of the six qualities and  
opulences, whose play is spotless, who is independent and not affected by  
creation, destruction and maintenance. Because of His expert manipulations His  
activities, names and forms cannot be understood by the speculations and  
speeches of those with a poor fund of knowledge, just like fools cannot  
understand an actor's performance. Only he who renders unconditional,  
uninterrupted, favorable service to His fragrant lotus feet may know the  
transcendental glories of the all-powerful Creator with the wheel of the  
chariot in His hand. When one in this world becomes aware of the Vasudeva who  
embraces all His universes as their Lord and goes into ecstasy because of it,  
one will never again have to experience there the dreadful repetition of  
births."   
"This book called the Bhagavatam about the activities of the One Hailed in the  
Verses,that as a supplement to the Vedas [a Purana] was compiled by the seer  
of God Vyasadeva, is there for the ultimate good of bringing success,  
happiness and perfection to all people. This story, that as the cream from all  
the Vedic literatures and histories was extracted by Vyasa, he delivered to  
his son who is the most respectable one among the self-realized souls. He  
[S'uka] in his turn told it to emperor Parikchit* who, surrounded by the  
greatest sages, sat down at the Ganges to fast until his death. Now that  
Krishna has left for His abode and with Him also proper conduct and spiritual  
insight have vanished, this Purana bright as the sun has appeared at the  
horizon for the sake of everyone who in the Age of Quarrel has lost his  
vision. Oh brahmins, when the story was recited there by that powerful great  
sage, I, being perfectly attentive by his mercy, also managed to understand  
it, so that I will now relate it to you also, exactly as I learned it free  
from deviations by my own mind."   
*Parikchit was the grandson of Arjuna. Son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The emperor who as a child in the womb was protected by Krishna for the continuation of the Yadu dynasty. The first vedic sovereign who laid out the norms for Kali yuga and was cursed by the son of a brahmana to die in seven days. Because of curse,and so He can be able to attain perfection in seven days,was recited the Srimad Bhagavata by Suka, the son of Vyasa, the original author of the book about the Lord and His devotees.

**_The Birth of Emperor Parikchit_**  
 _S 'aunaka said: "The embryo in the womb of Uttara, that was tormented by the  
enormous heat of the invincible weapon released by As'vatthama, was by the  
Lord again awarded a life. How did the birth take place of Emperor Parikchit  
who was so highly intelligent and what where the activities of this great  
soul? How exactly did his demise take place and what destination did he  
achieve? If you think you can tell us this that we, so very faithful, all want  
to hear, please speak to us then about the transcendental knowledge that was  
delivered by S'uka."   
Suta said: "King Yudhishthhira brought prosperity to everyone during his  
reign, the way his father did, by continuous service of Krishna's feet without  
any ulterior motive for material gain or sensual pleasure. The fame of his  
wealth, sacrifices, what he stood for, his queens, his brothers and his  
sovereignty over the planet earth where we are living, even spread to the  
heavenly worlds. But, just as only food may satisfy a hungry man and nothing  
else, he, in his hunger as someone aware of the Redeemer, Mukunda, oh  
brahmins, was not moved by all those earthly desirables that are aspired by  
even the God-fearing souls.   
At the time Parikchit,the great fighter, as a child in his mother's womb, was  
suffering from the heat of the brahmastra weapon, oh son of Bhrigu, he could  
observe the Purusha in a shining appearance. In the blaze he saw at the size  
of not more than a thumb the transcendental, infallible Lord beautiful with a  
dark skin, a golden helmet and lightening clothes. With the riches of His four  
arms, earrings of the purest gold, bloodshot eyes and a club in His hands, He  
was moving about, constantly whirling the club around like it was a torch. As  
He was vanquishing the radiation of the brahmastra like the sun evaporating  
dew drops, He was observed by the child who wondered who He was. He saw how  
the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Lord and protector of righteousness,  
took away the glare. Next the Lord who stretches in all directions all of a  
sudden disappeared from his sight. Thereupon, when the good signs of a  
favorable position of the stars gradually evolved, he took birth, who would  
prove himself to be of a prowess equal to that of Pandu. King Yudhishthhira  
being fully satisfied had priests like Dhaumya and Kripa perform the birth  
ritual with the recitation of auspicious hymns. Knowing where, when and how,  
he in charity rewarded to the occasion of that birth the brahmins with good  
food and gifts of gold, cows, land, housing, elephants and horses. The  
brahmins happily addressed the king, the chief of the Purus, communicating  
that they felt most obliged to the line of the descendants of their ancestor  
King Puru.   
They said: 'This son has been given to you by the all-pervasive and all-  
powerful Lord to show you His mercy in countering his destruction by the  
irresistible, supernatural weapon. Therefore he shall be known all over the  
world as Vishnu-rata, 'Given by Vishnu'. He will no doubt be a most fortunate,  
supreme devotee endowed with all good qualities.'   
The good king said: 'Oh best of the truthful, will he follow in the footsteps  
of all the great souls of this family of saintly kings? Will he be just as  
meritorious and glorious in his achievements?'   
The brahmins answered: 'Oh son of Pritha [Kunti], he will be the maintainer of  
all living entities, exactly like King Ikshvaku, the son of Manu, and he will  
be faithful to his promises and be of respect for the brahmins, just like  
Rama, the son of Das'aratha. He will be as charitable as King S'ibi of  
Us'inara and protect the ones of surrender, and will, just like Bharata, the  
son of Dushyanta who performed many sacrifices, spread the name and fame of  
his family. Among the archers he will be as good as the two Arjunas [his  
grandfather and the king of Haihaya], he will be as irresistible as fire and  
as unsurpassable as the ocean. As powerful as a lion and as worthy for taking  
shelter as the Himalayas, he will be as forbearing as the earth and as  
tolerant as his parents. With a spirit as good as that of the original father  
Brahma, he will be as generous and equanimous as Lord Shiva and be the refuge  
of all living beings as good as the Supreme Lord who is the refuge of the  
Goddess of fortune. Following in the footsteps of Krishna he will be the  
majesty of all divine virtues, he will have the greatness of King Rantideva  
and be as pious as Yayati. Being as patient as Bali Maharaja this child will  
be as devoted as Prahlada was unto Krishna, he will perform many As'vamedha  
sacrifices and be faithful to the elderly and experienced souls. He will  
father a line of saintly kings, will chastise the upstarts and, as a source of  
righteousness in the world, crush the quarrelsome. After being informed about  
his personal death, as caused by a snakebird that was sent by the son of a  
brahmin, he will free himself from his attachments and take to the shelter in  
the Lord. Having inquired about the proper self-knowledge from the son of  
sage Vyasa, oh King, he will abandon his material life on the bank of the  
river Ganges and attain the state of fearlessness. Constantly keeping Lord in  
mind whom he had seen before his birth, He would acquire fame in this world by  
constant investigation. Just like the waxing moon day by day soon becomes  
full, the royal prince under the care of his protective parents day by day  
grew to become soon the one he would be.'   
The brahmins learned in matters of astrology and birth ceremonies, thus having  
informed the king, were generously rewarded and then all returned to their  
homes.   
King Yudhishthhira, desiring to perform a horse sacrifice to be freed from the  
burden of having fought his kinsmen, thought about acquiring funds because all  
he received stemmed from collecting taxes and fines. In respect of his mindful  
wishes, his brothers on the advise of the Lord Krishna went north to collect  
sufficient riches. With the result of those collected riches Yudhishthhira,  
the anxious, pious king, managed to conduct three sacrifices, by means of  
which he worshiped Lord Hari perfectly. The Supreme Lord being invited by the  
king, had the brahmins perform the sacrifices for him and then stayed a few  
months longer to satisfy the desires of His friends. Then, dear brahmins,Lord  
Krishna, with the permission of the king, Draupadi and His relatives,went back  
to Dvaraka, accompanied by Arjuna and other members of the Yadu dynasty."

_**Prithu Maharaja 's Meeting with the Four Kumaras**_  
 _Maitreya said: 'While the citizens were thus praying to the high and mighty King Prithu, four  
sages arrived there as bright as the sun. The king and his associates could  
recognize the masters of yogic perfection,the four Kumaras,by the glaring  
effulgence of their all-embracing sinlessness, who descended from the ethereal  
realm. Seeing the so very desired life of peace before them, King Prithu and  
his followers jumped to their feet as if they were souls whose senses are  
ruled by the modes of nature. After they had accepted that reverence and had  
taken their seats, he humbly,being aware of their full glory, bowed before  
them and was of worship the way it is prescribed, with everything belonging  
to it. The water of washing their feet he sprinkled on the tuft of his hair  
and thus he behaved like men of respect are supposed to behave. Seated on the  
golden throne the older brothers of Bhava looked like the fire on an altar.  
Pleased with them, the king respectfully and with restraint addressed them.  
Prithu said: 'To what do we owe the grace of your audience, of you who are  
fortune personified? It is an encounter difficult to achieve for even the  
greatest yogis. He with whom the learned are pleased, can achieve whatever is  
difficult to achieve in this world or in the hereafter, including the favor of  
the all-auspicious Lord S'iva and Lord Vishnu. Even though you travel around  
in all the worlds, the people cannot see you, just as they cannot see the  
All-knowing witness present within everyone. A person who is not very rich and  
is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly persons are  
present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the  
exalted visitors water, a sitting place and great reception are glorified, and  
that very home itself is also glorified. But, those houses that, abundant with  
all wealth, are not blessed with the water that washed the feet of the great  
saints, are no doubt like a tree with venomous serpents. I welcome you, oh  
best of the twice-born souls, you who move around like children and,  
controlled by vows, with great faith are motivated for liberation. Oh masters,  
can persons who, having fallen into this material existence, are stricken with  
the illness of living to the command of their senses, all by themselves find  
any good fortune? There is no need to ask you about your well-being, for you,  
supreme souls, are not at all concerned with matters of good or bad fortune.  
I am therefore certain that you for us, who suffer the pains of a material  
existence, are the friends to ask how one in this world soon may find  
salvation. Manifesting as the supreme goal in life of the seekers after  
Truth, the Supreme Lord, the Unborn One, in the form of perfected souls like  
you, moves about on this earth in order to show His devotees His mercy.'   
Maitreya said: 'Hearing that most substantial, appropriate and sweet  
conclusion of Prithu, the Kumara satisfied with a smile replied as follows.  
Sanat-kumara said: 'What a good question for you to ask, my dear King, oh you who desires the  
good of all living beings. Learned as you are, you nevertheless pose this  
question. This speaks for you as someone of wisdom of the saint. An  
association of devotees in which there is discussion, questioning and  
answering, is appreciated by both the parties [of speakers and listeners], and  
real happiness for all will expand from it. Oh King, you are evidently  
attached to the praises of the Lord's lotus feet. Difficult as it is, that,  
given a steady practice, will free the indwelling soul from the dirt of lusty  
feelings. In the scriptures is defended that only the absence of attachment to  
other matters than the soul, in combination with an intense attachment to the  
True Self transcendental to the modes of nature, constitutes the perfect  
conviction for the salvation of man. That is realized when one as a dutiful  
devotee with faith and devotion, by means of discussion, inquiry,and  
determination,with respect for the Lord of Yoga regularly attends and listens  
to the stories of the God-fearing souls. Reluctant to associate with the  
company of those who hanker after money, sense gratification and the acquiring  
of goods,one should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace  
without drinking the nectar of the glorification of Hari. With nonviolence,  
following the footsteps of the Guru, by remembering the Lord of Liberation, by  
testifying of His activities, by the following yoga principles without a  
material motive and by practicing in line with the precepts one, thus being  
without offenses, should live a simple life tolerating worldly dualities. When  
someone always listens about transcendental qualities of the Lord, it may be  
so that one's devotion and Truth consciousness grows,and he easily becomes  
attached to the Brahman. When the person in respect of the Guru, by the force  
of detachment and jnana,completely surrenders to the Supreme, the covering  
within the heart that consists of the five elements will be burned like fuel  
being burned by fire. After one is freed from inner weakness and dominance of  
the material qualities, there is no longer a difference, as there was in the  
past, between the inner and the outer,and this difference being a dream is  
finished. For such a soul that difference has ended, just like a dream ends  
when one wakes up. The one becomes aware how desire bounds the Soul, but there  
is no more division and separation,and he sees himself beyond,as the Witness.  
Because the ruminating mind is agitated by the senses that are drawn towards  
the sense objects, the pure consciousness is easily lost, just like a lake  
easily can be overgrown by plants. Wise ones state that when remembrance is  
lost, all knowledge acquired is based on a false foundation. The constant  
mindfulness of one's consciousness is destroyed and real knowledge is lost.  
There is no stronger obstruction to one's self-interest than thinking other  
matters to be more pleasing than one's self-realization. When one constantly  
thinks of riches and sensual pleasures, all the virtues of human society are  
destroyed. For that reason bereft of knowledge and devotion, one then lapses  
into the inertia [the ignorance]. They who want to cross over that ocean of  
ignorance quickly, should never cling to the slowness of matter(tamas), for  
that is the great stumbling block,as even the virtues of religiousness,  
economic development and sense gratification [dharma, artha, kama]. In this  
respect liberation is likely to be the most important virtue, because being  
engaged in the interest of the other three paths, one regularly finds oneself  
caught in the grip of death and in fear. Following these three notions of a  
higher or lower form of life, one will never find any security, since they,  
depending on the interaction of the material modes, are all destroyed by the  
ordinance of the Lord [in the form of Time]. Oh best of kings, be therefore,  
just as I am, convinced of Him, the Supreme Lord who from within the heart  
everywhere manifests as the Master of the Field. Therein radiating into every  
hair follicle, He is there for the self-realization, for all the moving and  
not moving living beings covered by a body endowed with senses and a life-  
breath. Surrender to Him, the root cause manifesting as the truth within the  
untruth. By this deliberate consideration one is freed from the illusions and  
from the mistake taking the rope as a snake. One is then situated in the pure  
truth, the truth of the original nature transcendental to all the impurities  
of one's karmic activities. Be devoted to Vasudeva. For the devotees who find  
Him by devotion, the One whose lotus toes bring joy, the hard knot of karmic  
desire is uprooted, but that is never so with people missing that respect,  
however hard they try to stop the waves of sense enjoyment. Great is the  
hardship of the ones immersed in material life,which is like an ocean filled  
with the sharks of the six senses. Being unhappy it is very difficult to cross  
that ocean full of misfortune, that danger of separate existence, and  
therefore you should make the worshipable lotus feet of the Supreme Lord your  
boat.'

_cont...   
Maitreya said: 'Thus in full being informed about the ins and outs of  
spiritual advancement by the son of Brahma - the Kumara who was so well versed  
in spiritual knowledge - the king praised him and then spoke. The king said: 'You all, oh brahmins, oh powerful souls, have arrived here in order to  
confirm what was promised by Him, the Lord who from His causeless mercy is so  
compassionate with the distressed. It is my duty, therefore, to offer you  
something, but all I have now are but remnants of food taken by great saintly  
persons. What shall I give except my heart and soul? My life, wife and  
children, oh brahmins, my home with everything belonging to it, my kingdom,  
power, land and treasury, I therefore offer all to you. The post of the  
commander in chief and ruler of the state, the first to chastise or the  
proprietor of the whole planet, are no doubt only reserved for those who know  
the Vedic scriptures. A brahmin enjoys his own food, wears his own clothes  
and gives what he has in charity. It is by his mercy that the kshatriyas [the  
rulers] and the other parts of society eat their food. How can such persons,  
who have done unlimited mercy by explaining the path of self-realization, and  
whose explanations are given for our enlightenment with complete conviction  
and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded palms containing water for  
their satisfaction?'   
Maitreya said: 'After the masters of self-realization had been worshiped by  
the original king, they praised his character and then, for all people to see,  
disappeared in the sky. The son of Vena, the first among the great  
personalities, who according to the teachings had arrived at self-  
realization, considered himself as someone fully satisfied. For the sake of  
the Absolute Truth he performed as good as possible,and as far as his means  
would allow, according to the time, the circumstances and his capacity all his  
actions. Fully dedicated to the Supreme Spirit he, free from attachments  
being of renunciation, always thought of the Lord, the Supersoul beyond this  
material nature. Even though he lived at home, he never felt attracted to all  
the opulence of his mighty kingdom, nor did he indulge in sensual pleasures,  
just like the sun never responds to what it illuminates. Always engaging  
spiritually, he thus begot five sons in his wife Arci who fully met his  
expectations. Their names were Vijitas'va, Dhumrakes'a, Haryaksha, Dravina and  
Vrika. In his personal surrender to the Infallible One he, for the protection  
of the created universe, pleased the citizens during his time with his kind-  
hearted words and actions. The king thus was known as the King of the Moon,  
while he, on the other hand, was like the Sun god in his distributing,  
exacting and ruling over the wealth of the world. In his exercise of power he  
was as unconquerable as fire, he was as insuperable as the King of Heaven, as  
tolerant as the earth itself and alike heaven in fulfilling all desires of  
human society. Just as rainfall satisfies everyone's desires, Maharaja Pṛthu  
used to satisfy everyone. He was like the sea in that no one could understand  
his depths, and he was like Meru, the king of hills, in the fixity of his  
purpose. He was like the King of Righteousness [Yamaraja] in his education, he  
was alike the Himalayas in his opulence, he was like Kuvera in keeping the  
wealth and alike Varuna [the ruler of the waters] in his secrecy. He was as  
all-pervading as the air [the wind] concerning his physical strength, courage  
and power, and he was as inexorable as the most powerful Rudra. He was as  
beautiful as Cupid, he was as attentive as the lion, the king of the animals,  
in his affection he was alike Svayambhuva Manu and in matters of controlling  
the people he resembled the Unborn Lord, Brahma. He understood spiritual  
matters alike Brihaspati, in his personal self-control he was alike the  
Supreme Lord, in his devotion to the cows, the spiritual master and the  
brahmins he was as great devotees, in his shyness he was the most gentle one  
and in matters of philanthropy he was [as good] as he was for himself. All  
over the three worlds the general public loudly declared - and surely all the  
lovers of truth and the women from everywhere came to hear about it - that his  
name and fame was as great as the glory of Rama.'

**_Maharaja Priyavrata_**  
 _The King Parikchit said: 'Why, oh sage, was Priyavrata, the great devotee  
who takes pleasure in self-realization, so happy to stay at home, the place  
that is the root cause of bondage and which is against the main purpose of  
human life(self realisation)? Surely such a thing as indulgence in family  
affairs, oh wisest of the twice-born, cannot be desirable for that kind of  
people who are threading this path? It suffers no doubt that all the great  
souls find their satisfaction in the shade of the feet of the Lord praised in  
the verses, and not so much in the mind of attachment to kith and kin. This is  
my great doubt, oh brahmin: how can someone attached to his wife, home,  
children and so on, find perfection and an unfailing determination to realise  
Krishna?'   
Suka said: 'You are perfectly right in what you said about the hearts of  
liberated persons and devotees that are absorbed in the nectarean honey of the  
talks at the lotus-like feet of their beloved Lord praised in the scriptures.  
Despite the setbacks they sometimes encounter, they practically never give up  
their most exalted position. It is a well-known fact, oh King, that prince  
Priyavrata indeed was a supreme devotee who, in his service at Narada's feet,  
very quickly became aware of the complete truth concerning the spiritual  
purpose that he constantly discussed in dedicated enthusiasm. Even though his  
father asked him to rule over the surface of the earth because he incorporated  
so many of the best qualities, he could not be happy with it. He did not want  
to be distracted from yoga,but wished to be absorbed in the Supreme Lord of  
the Soul of the Universe. Therefore, although the order of his father could  
not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously  
raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by  
accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world. And so it happened that  
the first among the demigods Lord Brahma,surrounded by all his personal  
associates and the Vedas, descended from his abode. It is He who is always  
thinking of the welfare of the complete of this universal creation consisting  
of the three modes. He knows its ultimate purpose, the Supreme Soul, from  
which He originated Himself. Just like the full moon surrounded by  
illuminating stars, He on his way here and there by the leaders of the  
demigods was worshiped from their heavenly carriers. And the same was done by  
groups of perfected ones, inhabitants of heaven, refined ones, singers and  
sages [respectively the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Caranas, the Sadhyas and  
the Munis] when he thus as the shining jewel reached the vicinity of the  
Gandhamadana mountains where Priyavrata was meditating. Recognizing the swan-  
carrier of his almighty father Lord Hiranyagarbha the devarishi Narada,  
Priyavrata and his father Svayambhuva Manu present there immediately rose to  
their feet with their hands folded in order to worship the Lord. Oh son of  
Bharata, the Lord, the original person of the universe, who thus out of  
gratitude for the glory of his descent, according to the customs, was  
confronted with the articles of worship and the praise of his qualities in  
lofty language, then addressed Priyavrata, while he looked at him with a  
compassionate smile.   
The great Lord said: 'My son, pay attention to the truth I am telling you. You  
should not be jealous of the Godhead who is beyond our ken. We, Lord Shiva,  
your father and this great Rishi Narada all carry out His order and cannot  
deviate. No living entity that accepted a material body can escape from what  
was decided by Him; not by austerity nor by education, not by yoga nor by  
one's strength or intelligence, nor can one ever defy His will by one's  
opulence, by the virtue of one's duty, with the help of someone else or by any  
personal endeavor. Oh my dear, under the direction of the One Unseen, all  
living entities accept it to be connected to a material body for performing  
actions according to their karma and are thus always bound to birth and death,  
sadness and illusion, fear, happiness and distress. My dear boy, all of us are  
bound by the Vedic injunctions to the divisions of varṇasrama according to our  
qualities and work. These divisions are difficult to avoid. We must therefore  
carry out our duties of varṇasrama-dharma, like bulls obliged to move  
according to the direction of a driver pulling on ropes knotted to their  
noses. My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes  
of material nature, the Supreme gives us our specific bodies and the happiness  
and distress we achieve. One must therefore remain situated as he is and be  
conducted by the Supreme Lord, exactly as a blind man is led by a person who  
has eyes. Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has  
received according to his past karma. Without misconceptions, however, he  
regards his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an awakened  
person regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and  
never works to achieve another material body under the influence of the three  
modes of material nature. Someone not paying attention to this and someone not  
willing to control his senses has, even when he resides in the forest, to fear  
of the six co-wives [of the five senses and the mind]. But on the other hand  
what harm can a householder's existence do to a self-satisfied, learned man  
who has conquered his senses? Having entered a household existence, anyone  
who wants to conquer those six adversaries must first try to master them from  
within that stronghold. For only when the unregulated desires have lost their  
strength one, thus having ripened with experience, can move about freely. My  
dear Priyavrata, seek shelter at the lotus of the feet of the Lord, whose  
navel is also like a beautiful lotus. Thus conquer the six sense organs.  
Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you  
to do this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be  
able to carry out the Lord's orders. After one has been trained thus and his  
lusty desires have decreased, he can move anywhere without danger.'_

**_Lord Rishabha 's Activities_**  
 _The king said: 'Oh Supreme One, self-satisfied souls of whom the seed of  
fruitive action has been burned by the spiritual knowledge acquired by the  
practice of yoga, automatically achieve mystical powers; how can those siddhis  
become a hindrance?'   
The sage said: 'You are quite right, but in this world one should not put  
faith in the mind because it is unsteady and always runs off. The mind is by  
nature very restless, and one should not make friends with it. If we place  
full confidence in the mind, it may cheat us at any moment. Even the greatest  
souls having practiced austerities for a long time got disturbed putting faith  
in it. Just as a husband with an adulterous wife must guard against  
competitors, also a yogi must guard himself,since the mind always offers  
opportunity to lust, greed and anger. Which man of wisdom would confide in the  
mind that is the breeding ground for the lust, anger, pride, greed,  
lamentation, illusion and fear that together constitute the bondage to one's  
karma? Even though He, Rishabha,was the head of all kings and rulers of this  
universe, He,assuming the dress and language of an avadhuta,acted as if dull  
and materially bound. Consequently no one could observe His divine opulence.  
He adopted this behavior just to teach yogīs how to give up the body.  
Nonetheless, He maintained His original position of transcendence and  
remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord Rishabha  
within the material world. If, following the footsteps of Lord Rishabha, one  
can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a  
material body again. With Him, the Bhagavan Rishabha, free from identification  
with His material form, we thus witnessed the apparent physical presence, the  
engagement of His body in this illusory world. He all alone traveled the lands  
of South India: Konka, Venka and Kuthaka in the province of Karnatha, and  
reached a forest nearby Kuthakacala. There He, with a handful of stones in His  
mouth, wandered around naked with scattered hair, like He was a madman. In a  
fierce forest fire blazing all around - that was caused by the friction of  
bamboo stalks tossed about by the force of the wind - His body then burned to  
ashes.   
Hearing about His pastimes of being free from all ritual and custom, the king  
of Konka, Venka and Kuthaka who carried the name Arhat took to an imitation of  
Lord Rishabha. Bewildered by an increase of irreligious life that forebode the  
arrival of the Kali-yuga Age of Quarrel, he gave up the safe path of religion  
that wards off all fear and adopted a non-conformistic, wrong, heretical view  
by introducing most foolishly a concoction of his own. The lowest of mankind  
in this age of Kali who, lacking in character, cleanliness and dutifulness in  
respect of the rules and regulations, are bewildered by the illusory energy of  
God, will, because of this in neglect of the divine, self-willed and with  
wrong principles, follow strange rules, like not bathing, not cleaning the  
mouth, being dirty and plucking out the hair. With their consciousness spoiled  
by an abundance of modern time adharma they will fall into blaspheming the  
Vedas, the brahmins, rituals,the Supreme and the devotees. They who,  
encouraged by blind predecessors, with a deviating practice have built their  
own little cult, will, themselves being blinded, land in darkness. This  
avatara of the Lord was there for the purpose of instructing the people who  
are overwhelmed by passion,how to attain eternal happiness and liberation. In  
line with these teachings the people sing the following verses about Him: 'Oh,  
of all the lands on the continents of this world with its seven seas, this  
land is the most meritorious, for their people sing about the all-auspicious  
activities of Murari in His many incarnations [Krishna as the enemy of the  
foolish one, Mura].' 'Oh, what shall I say of the dynasty of Priyavrata,  
which is pure and very much celebrated. In that dynasty, the Supreme Lord, the  
Original One, descended as an incarnation to show us by His teachings and His  
own example how to attain liberation.'   
I have thus expounded on the pure activities of the Lord named Rishabha, who  
is the supreme master of all Vedic knowledge, of the common man, the God-  
conscious souls, the brahmins and the cows. He who with a growing faith and  
devotion attentively listens to, speaks to others about or personally attends  
to this refuge of His great and supreme auspiciousness, that puts an end to  
all the sins of every living being, will unto Him, the Supreme Lord Vasudeva,  
be favorably disposed with an unflinching devotion in both the positions of  
listening and speaking. Incessantly bathing themselves in that devotion in  
order to be free from suffering the various troublesome conditions of material  
existence, those who developed spiritual wisdom enjoy the highest bliss. But  
despite having achieved that liberation they do not strive for that supreme  
goal of all human beings. Having love and devotion for the Bhagavan they,  
after all, attained all their goals. Dear King, He undoubtedly was the  
maintainer and teacher, the worshipable deity, friend and master of your Yadu  
line and sometimes He even acted as a servant. Thus, my best one, He indeed  
was Mukunda, the Supreme Lord of Liberation [mukti] of those engaged in  
devotion. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the  
Lord, but pure love(bhakti) He does not give so easily.   
 All glories to Him, the Supreme Lord Rishabha! He was constantly aware of His  
true identity, complete within Himself and without desires. Gracefully, for  
the true welfare of man, He gave instruction about the true Self free from  
fear to those whose intelligence slept for a long time and who are mistaking  
the body for the Self.'

**_Krishna Rescues His Teacher 's Son_**  
 _   
S 'uka said: 'Knowing that His parents were thinking that He would be the  
Supreme Personality, He said to Himself: 'This should not be so'. And thus He  
expanded His personal illusory potency His yogamaya that bewilders the people.  
Approaching them together with His elder brother, the Greatest Devotee of All,  
with humility bowed down to His parents in order to satisfy them and  
respectfully said: 'Dear father and mother! Oh father, because of Us you were  
always afraid and have never seen anything of the toddler age, the boyhood and  
youth of your two sons. As ordained by fate We, being deprived of living in  
your presence, could not experience the joy of the happiness of children who  
live at home with their parents. A mortal person may never, not even for a  
lifespan of a hundred years, be able to repay the debt to his parents. He took  
his birth from them and by them he is maintained. They are the source of the  
body that is suitable for all goals of life. A son who, even though capable,  
with his resources and wealth does not provide for their sustenance, will  
after his death be forced to eat his own flesh. When one is capable of, but  
not maintains one's mother and father, the elderly, one's chaste wife, one's  
very young child, one's spiritual master, a brahmin or anyone seeking one's  
protection, one is a person who is dead even though he breathes. Because of  
Kamsa who always disturbed our minds, we could not honor you and have spent  
our days of youth without having been of any use to you. Please oh father and  
mother, forgive us the fact that, falling under the control of others, we from  
our part could not serve you so that the hardhearted one Kamsa could give you  
such a great pain.'   
S'uka said: 'Thus bewildered by the words of Him, the Lord and Soul of the  
Universe who through His maya appeared as a human being, they raised Them upon  
their laps to experience the joy of closeness with their sons. Bound by the  
rope of affection crying a river they, with their throats full of tears  
,overwhelmed could not say a word oh King. The Supreme Lord, the son of  
Devaki, who thus comforted His parents, then made His maternal grandfather  
Ugrasena, King over the Yadus. He told him: 'Please, oh great King, with Us as  
your subjects, take command, for because of the curse of Yayati one being  
born as a Yadu should not sit on the throne. When I am there as a servant to  
attend to you, the demigods and such will bow down before you to offer you  
tribute. Then what to speak of the other rulers of men?'   
All His close relatives and other relations, the Yadus, Vrishnis, Andhakas,  
Madhus, Das'arhas, Kukuras and other clans, who disturbed in their fear of  
Kamsa had fled in all directions, were honored and consoled, for living in  
foreign regions had made them weary. He, the Maker of the Universe, brought  
them back to their homes and satisfied them with valuable gifts. Protected by  
the arms of Krishna and Sankarshana they in their homes enjoyed the complete  
fulfillment of their desires because, now that they day after day saw the  
loving, always cheerful, beautiful lotus face and merciful, smiling glances of  
Mukunda, with Krishna and Balar?ma the fever of a material existence had  
ended.Even the eldest ones were youthful and full of strength and vitality,  
now that they there time and again through their eyes could imbibe the nectar  
of Mukunda's lotus face. Thereupon the Supreme Lord, the son of Devaki, and  
Sankarshana approached Nanda oh great King. They, embracing him, said: 'Oh  
father, with the great affection and the fondling of the two of you, you have  
cared for us in a great way. The love the parents have for their children is  
truly greater than even the love they have for each other. Those persons are  
father and mother who nourish, like they were their own sons, the children who  
were abandoned by relatives unable to maintain and protect them. Now you  
should all return to Vraja, dear Father. We shall come to see you, our dear  
relatives who suffer in separation from Us, as soon as we have given some  
happiness to your well-wishing friends. The Supreme Lord, the Infallible One  
thus appeasing Nanda and the people from Vraja, thereupon respectfully honored  
them with clothing, jewelry and pots and such.   
Thus being addressed by the two of Them, Nanda engulfed by affection, embraced  
Them with tears filling his eyes and went together with the gopas to Vraja.  
The son of S'urasena [Vasudeva], oh King, then arranged for a priest and  
brahmins to properly perform the second-birth initiation of his sons. For  
their remuneration he donated in worship fully decorated cows with golden  
chains and ornaments, complete with calves and linen wreaths. Magnanimously  
he gave them in charity the cows that were stolen away by Kamsa, the same cows  
he previously had donated within his mind the very day that Krishna and Rama  
were born. After having been initiated into the twice-born status, They, of  
proper vows, took the vow of celibacy from Garga, the preceptor of the Yadus.  
The Lords of the Universe who are the source of any form of knowledge,  
concealed in Their human activities the perfection of Their omniscience that  
is not founded on any knowledge from the outside. They nevertheless then  
desired to reside in the school of the guru and approached a native of Benares  
called Sandipani, who dwelt in the city of Avanti. Thus obtaining the company  
of these self-controlled souls, he was by Them respected as if he was the Lord  
Himself. Doing this They in Their devotion formed an irreproachable example of  
service to the teacher. That best of the twice-born souls as Their guru,  
taught Them, contented as he was with Their pure love and submissive acts, all  
the Vedas with their corollary literatures and philosophical treatises  
[Upanishads], the Dhanur-veda [military science, archery] along with all its  
secrets [the mantras], the dharma [the codes of human conduct, the laws] and  
the nyaya [the methods of logic] as also the anvikshikim [the knowledge of  
philosophical debate or tarka] and the six aspects of political sciencei. As  
the best of all first class persons and as the promulgators of all knowledge  
They, oh ruler of man, fixed in concentration, fully assimilated with simply  
having heard it only once, the complete of the sixty-four arts in as many days  
and nights and satisfied Their preceptor, oh King, by offering him  
compensation [gurudakshina]. Oh King, the bramin in consideration of the  
amazing greatness of Their superhuman intelligence, after consulting with his  
wife, arrived at the wish to see his child again that had perished in the  
ocean at Prabhasa.'So be it' the two great warlords of unlimited prowess said  
and next mounted a chariot to head for Prabhasa. Having arrived there, they  
walked up to the shore and sat down for a moment. The god of the ocean  
recognized Them and offered Them tribute. The Supreme Lord said to him: 'Present Us at once the son of Our guru, a young boy you have seized here with  
a mighty wave.'   
The god of the ocean said: 'It was not I who took him away, oh Lord, it was a  
powerful Daitya named Pa?cajana, oh Krishna, a demon who moves through the  
water in the form of a conch. He who lives here indeed has kidnapped him.'  
Hearing that the Master quickly entered the water and killed him, but He could  
not find the boy in his belly. Taking the conch shell that had grown as a part  
of the demon, He returned to the chariot and went to the beloved city of  
Yamaraja [the lord of death] known as Samyamani. Arriving there, Janardana  
together with the Lord who has a plow for His weapon [Balarama] blew loudly on  
His conch shell so that Yamaraja, he who restrains the living beings, could  
hear the sound. Overflowing with devotion Yamaraja worshiped Them elaborately  
and humbly bowing down said to Krishna who dwells in each his heart: 'What can  
I do for the two of You, oh Vishnu who, for Your pastime, has appeared in the  
form of human beings?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Please bring Me the son of My guru who was brought  
here because of his karmic bondage, oh great King. It is My command that  
should be given priority.'   
'So be it' he said and brought forward the preceptor's son. The Best of the  
Yadus gave him back to Their guru whom They then said: 'Please make another  
wish.'   
The honorable guru said: 'My dear Boys, I am completely fulfilled by the  
remuneration for the guru the two of You have offered. What else would there  
be left for the spiritual master to desire from someone like You? O heroes,  
now please return home. May Your fame sanctify the world, and may the Vedic  
hymns be ever fresh in Your minds, both in this life and the next.'   
Thus by Their guru permitted to leave, They, on Their chariot as fast as the  
wind and thundering like a cloud, reached Their city. The citizens who had not  
seen Balarama and Janardana for many days, all rejoiced to see Them again,  
like having regained a lost treasure.'

**_Yamaraja Instructs His Messengers_**  
 _Yamaraja said: 'Superior to me there is another one, another Lord, who is as  
the warp and woof of cloth to all the mobile and immobile living beings. In  
Him the entire cosmos is found and of Him there are the partial manifestations  
of the maintenance, creation and destruction of this universe. The entire  
creation is controlled by Him like a bull is by a rope through his nose. Just  
like one ties oxen to a rope He ties the people with different basic  
denominations and duties to His word, according to which they scrupulously  
carry their offerings to Him. I myself, the Lord of death, Indra the king of  
heaven, Nirriti of chaos, Varuna of water, Candra of the moon, Agni of fire,  
S'iva of destruction, Pavana of the air, Brahma of creation, Surya of the sun,  
Vis'vasu of beauty, the eight Vasus of goodness, the Sadhyas of cultivation,  
the Maruts of the wind, the Rudras of anger, the Siddhas of perfection and the  
other ones creating order in the universe, as also immortal rulers like  
Brihaspati and sages like Bhrigu, despite being ruled by goodness and being  
free from passion and ignorance, under the influence of His maya have no  
knowledge of His motives. And how much more wouldn't that be true for others  
besides them? He, the Soul present in the heart of all living beings, can  
factually not be seen or known through the senses, the mind, the breath or by  
means of ideation and words just like the different parts of the body cannot  
see the eyes watching over them. The attractive servants of the independent,  
transcendental Lord ruling everything, the Master of Maya, the Great Soul,  
generally move around in this world with His physical qualities and nature.  
The ones of Vishnu who are worshiped by the enlightened, have forms rarely  
seen that are most wonderful to behold. They protect the mortals devoted to  
the Lord from enemies and from my men, so that they are protected from  
practically every side. The great rishis, the gods, the best ones of  
perfection and also the demons, the humans including the ones founded in  
knowledge and the celestial singers [the Caranas] and such, have no knowledge  
of the dharma that is established by the Supreme Lord in person. Lord Brahma,  
Narada, Shambu, the four Kumaras, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada, Janaka, Bhishma,  
Bali, the son of Vyasa [S'uka] and I myself [Yamaraja]; we, these twelve  
[mahajanas], have knowledge of the bhagavata-dharma [of surrender to the  
Supreme Lord] my dear servants, that is most confidential, transcendental and  
hard to grasp. He who understands it achieves eternal life. We all recognize  
that for the people living in this material world the yoga of devotion unto  
the Supreme Lord beginning with the singing of the holy name, constitutes the  
supreme dharma. Just consider how by pronouncing the holy name of the Lord my  
dear sons, even Ajamila was delivered from the noose of death. Even this  
sinner Ajamila attained liberation when he, at the moment of his death,  
innocently with 'Narayana' called for his son. Singing of the qualities of His  
names and deeds is more than enough to remove the sins of man. Understand  
that this truth of the mahajanas is practically always missed by those whose  
minds were bewildered by maya, the illusory energy of the Goddess, by those  
whose intelligence to a great extend was dulled with activities and motives to  
gain wealth and name and fame,led by the wrong understanding of the flowery  
statements in the Vedas. With this in mind the sharp-witted ones with all  
their heart and soul love the Supreme and Unlimited Lord. Such persons do  
therefore not deserve my punishment. And if there would be any fall down with  
them, that also will be destroyed by the singing of Hari's names. They, the  
devotees who with an equal vision are of surrender to the Supreme Lord and  
whose sacred histories are proclaimed by the demigods and perfected ones, you  
should never approach, for they are fully protected by the mace of the Lord.  
It is not given to us to punish them, just as it isn't given to time itself.   
Communities of transcendental swanlike souls who free from material attachment  
are of self-realization, continuously relish the honey of His lotus feet. But  
they who are full of desires and attachments are on the path that leads to  
hell. Bring those before me who in their falsehood turned against Mukunda, the  
Lord of Liberation. They who run from the truth and fail in their duties unto  
Lord Vishnu, whose tongues never express the names and qualities of the  
Supreme Lord, who do not carry Him in their heart or remember His lotus feet  
and not even once bowed their heads to Krishna, bring them all before me. I  
pray that He, the Supreme Lord, the original and oldest Lord Narayana, will  
excuse me for the impudence of my servants. My men and we, acted in ignorance  
and therefore we with folded hands beg the most venerable, all-pervading Lord  
for forgiveness.'   
S'uka said: 'Therefore, oh descendant of Kuru, understand that the  
glorification of Lord Vishnu is the ultimate form of atonement, the best one  
can do in the world to deal with one's sins, however great they are.The hearts  
of those who always listen to and sing about the heroism of the Lord that  
wipes away all sin, are by their bhakti, very easily purified, while such a  
thing is not as easily brought about when one is bent upon religious customs  
and such. He who holds on to the honey of Krishna's lotus feet will not fall  
in sin again because he renounced the desire to enjoy the illusory quality of  
maya which brings distress. Anyone else however, who enchanted by lust tries  
to do something to cleanse the passion out of his soul, will surely find the  
passion reappear.   
After hearing from the mouth of their master about the extraordinary glories  
of the Lord and His name, fame and attributes, the Yamadutas were struck with  
wonder. Since then, as soon as they see a devotee, they fear him and dare not  
look at him again.

**_Lord Shiva Drinks the Poison Churned with the Mountain Mandara_**  
 _S 'uka said: 'The Suras invited the king of the snakes Vasuki, promised him  
a share of the result and wound him around the mountain to serve as a churning  
rope. Thereupon they commenced in great delight to churn the ocean in order to  
produce the nectar oh best of the Kurus. Lord Hari was the first to take him  
by the head and then the demigods followed. The Daitya leaders did not like  
the initiative of the Supreme Lord and said: 'We are not going to take the  
snake by its tail, that is its inferior part, that is not in accord with our  
education and the fame of our birth and activities.' Seeing how consequently  
the Daityas let it pass, the Lord smiled. He gave up the front portion and  
grasped together with the demigods the rear end.Thus having settled on the  
positions to hold the snake, the sons of Kas'yapa [the godly and the demoniac  
ones] with great zeal churned to get the nectar from the ocean of milk. As  
they were churning the ocean with the mountain it had no support so that it,  
despite the fact that it was held by the strong men, because of its weight  
sank down in the water, oh son of Pandu. Confronted with the fact that their  
manliness was defeated by the stronger will of providence, their faces,  
heavily disappointed, darkened. The infallible Lord, He whose ways and powers  
are inscrutable, saw the hindrance as arranged by providence and then expanded  
Himself into the wondrous body of a giant tortoise Kurma. _   
_He entered the water and lifted up the mountain. When the Suras and Asuras  
saw it rising they decided to churn again with the mountain Mandara that like  
a continent extended a hundred thousand yojanas wide on His back. The rotating  
of the mountain that was moved by the strong arms of the Sura and Asura  
leaders my best one, was by the primal tortoise who carried it on His back,  
considered an infinitely pleasant scratching. Thereafter, to encourage them  
and increase their strength and energy, Lord Vishnu entered the Asuras in the  
form of passion, the Godly ones in the form of goodness and the king of the  
serpents Vasuki in the form of ignorance. Like another mountain holding on to  
the king of all mountains with one hand, He exhibited thousands of hands while  
from the sky Lord Brahma, Lord S 'iva and King Indra, the head of the gods,  
offered prayers to Him who was showered with flowers. With the Lord, the  
Supreme One, present on top and below the mountain as also within themselves  
and within the snake, the ocean that with great strength was churned  
vehemently with the great mountain, got seriously agitated. The serpent king  
spitted, hissing violently in all directions, fire and smoke from his  
thousands of heads. For that reason the Asuras headed by Pauloma, Kaleya, Bali  
and Ilvala, being troubled by the heat of his radiation, all began to look  
like sarala trees scorched in a forest fire. Also the luster of the Gods was  
affected by his fiery breath that smoked their dresses, fine garlands,  
armament and faces. Ordained by the Supreme Lord it then profusely began to  
rain while breezes were blowing clouds of vapor originating from the waves of  
the ocean. When the ocean by the best of the Godly ones and the Asuras was  
duly churned but no nectar appeared, the Invincible One Himself began to  
churn. He as dark as a cloud, in yellow silks, with lightning earrings on His  
ears, with the gleaming hair on His head disheveled, with His garland, reddish  
eyes and victorious arms securing the universe, grabbed the snake to churn  
with the churning rod for which the mountain was used and assumed for that  
purpose a size as big as a mountain Himself. From the churning of the ocean  
that agitated all kinds of fish, sharks, snakes, tortoises, whales, water  
elephants, crocodiles and timingilas, there came first of all a very strong  
poison called Halahala. The terribly strong, unbearable poison, that  
unstoppably spread itself in all directions upwards and downwards, scared all  
the people so that they, missing the protection of their Lord and Master oh my  
best, sought the shelter of Lord S'iva. When they saw Him who for the welfare  
of the three worlds together with His wife sits on His mountain, He, the best  
of all served by saints who in austerity walk the path of liberation, they  
offered him their obeisances.   
The lords of the created beings [the Prajapatis] said: 'Oh Lord of Lords, oh  
Mahadeva, oh soul of each, oh love of all, deliver us, who took shelter at  
your lotus feet, from this poison burning the three worlds. You are the one  
Lord and Master over bondage and liberation in the entire universe. You whom  
we worship are the spiritual master able to carry the burden of the  
surrendered followers. Oh mighty one, oh Greatness, by your material potency,  
you are operating with the three modes of nature, in acceptance of the  
creation, maintenance and destruction of this material world, manifest  
yourself as Brahma, Vishnu or S'iva. You are the Supreme Brahman, the secret  
of the cause and effect of all the life forms of creation. You are with all  
the potencies that you manifest the Controller and Supersoul of the universe.  
You are the source of the Vedic sound, the origin of the universe, the soul,  
the life breath, the senses and the elements. You are the modes of nature and  
the natural disposition, the eternal time, the sacrifice and the dharma of  
truth and truthfulness. It is unto you that one utters the original syllable  
consisting of the three letters [A-U-M].Oh soul of all the godly ones, fire  
constitutes your mouth;, oh Lord of all the worlds the surface of the globe is  
known as your lotus feet;, oh self of the gods, time constitutes your  
movement, the directions are your ears and the controller of the waters Varuna  
is your taste. With the ether for your navel, the air for your breath, the sun  
globe for your eyes, the water for your semen, the moon for your mind and the  
higher worlds, oh Lord, for your head, your self constitutes the shelter of  
all living beings high and low. The oceans are your belly, the mountains are  
your bones, all the plants, creepers and herbs are your hairs, the seven  
types of mantras are your seven layers [koshas] and all the religions, oh you  
three Vedas [Rig, Yajur and Sama] in person, constitute the core of your  
heart. The five secret texts of the Vedic philosophy constitute your faces  
with the collection of the thirty-eight important mantras that describe the  
reality of the Soul, of you, oh Lord, who in your position of enlightenment  
are celebrated as S'iva. O lord, your shadow is seen in irreligion, which  
brings about varieties of irreligious creations. The three modes of nature -  
goodness, passion and ignorance - are your three eyes. All the Vedic  
literatures, which are full of verses, are emanations from you because their  
compilers wrote the various scriptures after receiving your glance. None of  
the directors of the world, oh Ruler on the Mountain, neither Brahma, nor  
Vishnu, nor the king of the Suras [Indra], can fathom your transcendental  
effulgence, the impersonal spirit wherein the modes of passion, ignorance and  
goodness are not found. In this world that has originated from you and at the  
time of her destruction is burned to ashes by you with the sparks of the fire  
emanating from your eyes, you have out of your mercy for the living beings  
annihilated Tripura as also put an end to the sacrifices out of desire, the  
poison of time and many other forms of misery. But these matters are not part  
of your praises, since you ban this world from your mind. People not knowing  
your help and kindness shamelessly criticize you for being a savage person  
whom one always finds at the burial place smeared with ashes and for moving  
with your consort Uma despite your highly advanced austerity and the fact that  
your lotus feet are remembered by the realised Gurus. Because you are  
transcendentally situated above the moving and the not moving living beings,  
you are difficult to understand. And when it is not possible for even Brahma  
and the ones belonging to him to properly understand your real nature oh great  
one, how can we? Since no one can understand you in truth, how can one offer  
you prayers? It is impossible. As far as we are concerned, we are creatures of  
Lord Brahma's creation. Under the circumstances, therefore, we cannot offer  
you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have expressed our  
feelings. We see the Supreme form that you manifested to bless the world, but  
not your transcendence, oh great Lord whose ways are inscrutable.'   
S'uka said: 'Seeing their pernicious predicament he, Mahadeva, the friend of  
all living beings out of his compassion for the great distress spoke to his  
beloved Sati. Lord S'iva said: 'Dear Bhavani, just see how pitiable this  
situation is of all the living beings that are threatened by the poison  
resulting from churning the ocean. Feeling responsible for all their lives, I  
must do something for their safety; is it my duty as the master to protect  
against distress. Devotees at the cost of their own lives protect other  
living beings who, time bound and bewildered by the external energy, are of  
enmity with one another. The Soul of All, the Lord, is pleased when one takes  
pity on others, oh gentle one. When the Lord is pleased also I and all other  
moving and not moving entities are happy. May there be the well-being of all  
creatures, with me drinking this poison.'   
S'uka said: 'After Lord S'iva, the well-wisher of the universe thus had  
addressed Bhavani she gave her permission, very well knowing his capabilities,  
whereupon he proceeded to drink the poison. Mahadeva out of compassion for the  
welfare of all living beings consequently took the widespread Halahala poison  
in his hand and drank it. That poison from the water exhibited its potency to  
him by turning his neck dark-blue, a feature considered an ornament by the  
virtuous ones, the saints and the sages. Good and honest people practically  
always take to heart the sufferings of their fellow men. This is considered  
the highest form of worshiping the Lord. Hearing about that act of S'iva, the  
god of gods, the graceful one, he was highly praised by the daughter of  
Daksha, by Brahma, by the Lord of Vaikunthha and by all the people. Scorpions,  
cobras and other poisonous animals and plants are the beings who took care of  
the little bit that was scattered here and there as he drank from his palm.'

**_More Appears from the Churning: Mother Lakshmi,Dhanvantari and Mohini_**  
 _S 'uka said: 'When the poison had been drunk by Lord S'iva, the immortals  
and Danavas gladly resumed the churning of the ocean quickly whereupon the cow  
of plenty appeared [the surabhi, the source of the ghee]. The sages  
conversant with the injunctions for the yajnas took care of her, oh King, for  
she was useful for the divine sacrifices because of her clarified butter.   
Next a horse as white as the moon manifested named Uccaihs'rava that Maharaja  
Bali liked to have, while Indra desisted from claiming it on the advise of the  
Lord.   
Thereafter the elephant Airavata appeared who with his four tusks defied the  
glories of the white mountain of the First Devotee [Lord S'iva]. Airavana was  
the first of eight elephants manifesting for each direction of the sky and  
also a group of eight she-elephants was generated that was headed by one named  
Abhramu, oh King.   
Then a valuable lotus-hued gem known as the Kaustubha jewel was generated from  
the wide expanse of milk. Lord Hari who desired to possess it decorates His  
chest with it. Thereupon the parijata tree was generated that adorns the  
heavenly places and, just as you who likes to fulfill each his wishes,  
fulfills every wish on this planet by providing whatever that is wanted oh  
King.   
 Next the Apsarascame, the extremely beautiful and attractive inhabitants of  
heaven who, exquisitely dressed and decorated with gold, smoothly moved  
around.   
After that had happened the Goddess of Splendor [Rama or Lakshmi] manifested  
in person. With her lightening luster she as bright as Saudamani mountain  
illumined along with the Lord all the directions. Each Sura, Asura and human  
being desired her, for the magnificent beauty of her features, youth,  
complexion and glories had caught their minds. The great Indra brought a  
glorious, wonderful seat for her and the most sacred rivers and reservoirs  
assumed a personal form by filling golden water pots with pure water. The land  
offered all the herbs needed for installing the deity. The cows contributed  
with their five pure products and springtime delivered fresh flowers and  
fruits. The sages performed the bathing ceremony as prescribed, the Gandharvas  
sang the all-auspicious mantras and their wives danced and sang along. The  
clouds vibrated two-sided drums, kettledrums, murajas and that created,  
combined with the sounds of bugles, conch shells, flutes and vinas, a great  
tumult. And while the twice-born ones, the Brahmins, were singing hymns the  
elephants next poured jugs full of sacred water over the chaste Goddess so  
beautiful with the lotus in her hand. The ocean presented yellow silks for  
her to dress from top to toe and Varuna offered a large garland swarming with  
bumblebees intoxicated by its sweetness. From Prajapati Vis'vakarma there was  
a choice of ornaments, Sarasvati supplied a necklace, Lord Brahma provided a  
lotus flower and the Nagas [the excellent ones] gave earrings. Thereupon being  
worshiped in an all-auspicious ceremony she, radiating a natural beauty with  
the decoration of the earrings to her cheeks and a coy smile on her face, went  
around the sacrificial arena with the lotus garland in her hand. With her  
beautiful breasts, her thin waist in harmony and smeared with sandalwood pulp  
and kunkuma, she, moving here and there with the sweet tinkling of her ankle  
bells, appeared exactly like a golden creeper. In that position looking for  
the eternal qualities she could not find a single soul among the indwellers of  
heaven, the perfected ones, the unenlightened ones, the keepers of the wealth,  
the venerable ones and the rest of all the demigods, who was complete in every  
respect._   
 _She contemplated: 'Someone who has undergone great austerity has not yet  
conquered anger. Someone possesses knowledge, but he has not conquered  
material desires. Someone is a very great personality, but he cannot conquer  
lusty desires. Even a great personality depends on something else. How, then,  
can he be the supreme controller? Someone might be of dharma but is he  
friendly towards other living beings? Someone can be of renunciation but he  
might miss the cause of liberation. A person may have power over people, but  
he is still not released from the great force of material nature. Someone else  
may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to  
the Lord. Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the  
material modes of nature. Someone may live a long time but still not know how  
to behave and be happy, someone may master the art of living but still not  
know how to get old. And when someone knows the both of them, such a person  
still might be unlucky in another respect. And even if others are well  
qualified in all respects, they are not devotees of the Supreme!'   
With these considerations in mind the Goddess of Wealth and Splendor turned to  
Mukunda, the reservoir of Transcendence who was so desirable and qualified in  
every way as the husband of her choice - even though He had no desire for it.  
He, after all, did not depend on others and had the extraordinary, supreme  
qualities perfect in every respect. After placing on His shoulders a  
ravishing, fresh garland of lotuses vibrating with humming, maddened  
bumblebees, she remained, with a shy smile and glittering eyes, at His side  
with His bosom as her true resort. He, the father of the universe, made His  
bosom the residence of the Mother, the Goddess, the supreme opulence. The  
goddess of fortune, by her favorable and merciful glance, can increase the  
opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants and their  
directors, the demigods. The servants of the gods and their women, all  
became engaged in singing and dancing accompanied by the loud sound of musical  
instruments like conch shells, bugles and drums. Brahma, S'iva and all the  
directors of the world headed by Angira honored the Supreme Lord by showering  
flowers and chanting mantras that described His true nature. With the  
merciful glance of the Goddess resting upon the godly ones, the fathers of  
mankind and their generations, they were all blessed with good conduct and  
good qualities and thus achieved the ultimate satisfaction.   
But when the Daityas and Danavas, oh King, were neglected by Lakshmi they,  
being depressed in their aching greed, got disheartened and lost all sense of  
shame. Thereupon Varuni, a young lotus-eyed girl who, with the permission of  
the Lord, was accepted by the Asuras.   
 With the sons of Kas'yapa thereupon zealously churning the ocean for the  
nectar, there finally appeared a most wonderful man, oh great King. He was  
tall, youthful, had stout and strong arms, a neck like a conch, a dark skin,  
reddish eyes, a garland and was adorned with all kinds of ornaments. Being  
clad in yellow, with a broad chest, with well polished, jeweled earrings, with  
gleaming curly locks of hair and decorated with bangles he, as strong as a  
lion, came forward with a jar that was filled to the rim with nectar.He was a  
partial appearance of a part of Lord Vishnu Himself known by the name of  
Dhanvantari who, seeing to medical science, was one of the demigods entitled  
to a share in the offerings. _   
_All the Asuras who saw him with the container full of nectar, greedy after  
the contents, immediately snatched the pot away. When the pot of nectar was  
carried away by the Asuras, the demigods were desolate and turned to the Lord  
for their protection. When He saw their sadness the Supreme Lord who always  
acts according to the desires of His servants said: 'Do not grieve, I will  
personally see to it that the nectar will be there for all of you.' Oh master  
of man, there was a quarrel among them [the Asuras] about the nectar in which  
they with a thirsting heart said: 'Me first, me first, not you, not you!'  
Others roared: 'The gods were of a likewise effort in the duty of sacrifice  
and deserve an equal share. This is a matter of traditional duties [sanatana  
dharma]!' The Daityas violently trying to appropriate the jug thus being  
envious and weak constantly denied each other the right oh King. After this  
had passed Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Controller who has a solution for any  
problem, assumed the form of a supremely beautiful, wonderful woman who  
mystified them all. Pleasing to behold she was as dark as a newly grown lotus.  
She was of the greatest beauty and harmony in all her limbs, she had a  
straight nose, fine cheeks and ornamented ears. She had fresh, firm, young but  
weighty breasts to her thin waist and a blissful expression on her face. She  
looked a bit anxious because of the humming bumblebees around her. With the  
mass of her beautiful, waving hair and the mallika flower garland about her  
attractive neck, with the beauty of her arms that were ornamented with the  
finest jewelry and bangles, with the fair sari spread over her breast that was  
an island of beauty and with the belt that covered her waist, she moved about  
gracefully with her ankle bells. Coyly casting her glances while moving with  
her eyebrows, she gave rise to a constant lusty desire in the core of the  
hearts of the Daitya leaders.'

**_The Glories of Bharata-varsha_**  
_This is what the demigods chant: 'Oh, what kind of pious deeds have these people performed or what blessing has  
the Lord Himself pronounced being pleased with them, that they obtained a  
birth in the land of Bharata-varsha, a birth favorable for serving Lord  
Mukunda that is our aspiration?   
What is the use of being engaged in difficult rituals, austerities, vows,  
charitable deeds or achieving the heavenly kingdom when one, due to an  
excessive sensuality, has lost the remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord  
Narayana?   
 Of greater value than living in some heavenly places for thousand years or  
even kalpas, is to be born in the land of Bharata for a life of only hundred  
years. For the one who lives there,understanding the true value of life, can  
elevate himself and achieve the highest perfection by surrendering to the  
Lord.   
What is the reason to visit those places - even those inhabited by the gods -  
where there is not the sweet stream of talks about Vaikunthha, nor the  
devotees are found who, always engaged in His service, take to His shelter,  
nor the festivals are celebrated for the Lord.   
Those souls who, having achieved a human birth, have all the knowledge, are  
capable of engaging in action and have all means at their disposition, but  
despite this opportunity do not make efforts for immortality, will fall back  
into bondage, just like careless birds bound by a hunter.   
 By their faith they [the inhabitants of India] are divided in their  
performance of the rituals. [But] with the oblations offered to the ruling  
deity and the reciting of mantras according to the proper method, the One God  
who is addressed with different names, He, the bestower of all benedictions in  
person, complete in Himself, accepts that most happily.   
 The Lord fulfills the material desires of a devotee who approaches Him with  
such motives, but He does not bestow benedictions upon the devotee that will  
cause him to demand more benedictions again. However,He out of His own,  
unasked, grants to those devoted to Him, the lotus flower of His feet that put  
an end to all desires. Such is His mercy.   
We are now living in the heavenly planets, undoubtedly as a result of our  
having performed ritualistic ceremonies, pious activities and yajnas and  
having studied the Vedas. However, our lives here will one day be finished. We  
pray that at that time, if any merit remains from our pious activities, we may  
again take birth in Bharata-varṣa as human beings able to remember the lotus  
feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind that He personally comes to the land of  
Bharata-varsa and expands the auspiciousness.'

**_The Glories of Bharata-varsha_**  
_This is what the demigods chant: 'Oh, what kind of pious deeds have these people performed or what blessing has  
the Lord Himself pronounced being pleased with them, that they obtained a  
birth in the land of Bharata-varsha, a birth favorable for serving Lord  
Mukunda that is our aspiration?   
What is the use of being engaged in difficult rituals, austerities, vows,  
charitable deeds or achieving the heavenly kingdom when one, due to an  
excessive sensuality, has lost the remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord  
Narayana?   
 Of greater value than living in some heavenly places for thousand years or  
even kalpas, is to be born in the land of Bharata for a life of only hundred  
years. For the one who lives there,understanding the true value of life, can  
elevate himself and achieve the highest perfection by surrendering to the  
Lord.   
What is the reason to visit those places - even those inhabited by the gods -  
where there is not the sweet stream of talks about Vaikunthha, nor the  
devotees are found who, always engaged in His service, take to His shelter,  
nor the festivals are celebrated for the Lord.

**_My praise for You, oh Son of the Cowherd King,   
oh worshipable,beautiful Lord   
with a resplendent face, soft feet, a body as dark as a raincloud,   
clothes as bright as lightening, gu?j? [seed] ornaments on Your ears, peacock  
feathers,   
a garland of forest flowers, a morsel of food, a rod, a bugle and a flute.   
 Oh Lord so full of mercy for me, even with this body of Yours before me,   
that to the desire of Your devotees has manifested,   
but at the other hand is not a material product at all,   
I, Brahma, with my inward mind cannot directly fathom Your greatness,   
not to mention the bliss You experience within Yourself.   
Even though You are Invincible in the three worlds,   
You surrender to the will of those souls   
whose body, words and mind are completely surrendered to You,   
and who are ever willing to listen the stories about You   
the way they are described by the devotees -   
\- by those truthful souls who, living simply, offer their obeisances   
and no longer have any other goal but You.
