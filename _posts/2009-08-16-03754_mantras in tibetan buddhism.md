## mantras in tibetan buddhism

Iam back froma ten day retreat with tenga rinpoche and as always in such  
surroundings musings and inspirations occur in the mind....   
to resume it all, and deepen the impression in my mind I will write a little  
bit about it (not about my expereinces because they are ll gone now ), if  
this aids someone my wish is fullfilled...   
so I would like to talk about mantras in the tibetan vayrajana (or  
mantrayana), and see if this could be of some aid for the poeple here and I  
also would like to tlak about guruyoga (in another post) as thought by ch√∂gyal  
namkhai norbu, who I believe to be one of hte greatest dzogchen masters living  
today...and also on guruyoga in other buddhist traditions..   
the mantryana buddhism is called the "diamond-fruit-vehicle" because the  
tantras it teaches are said to clean the mind of wrong impressions in a very  
fast way, therefor the fruit (buddhahood) can be realized in one live...   
we recieved the abisheka of charkasamvara during the 10 days, an empowerment  
that lasts for 2 days...and then it was followed with praxis..   
the mantra of chakrasamvara is as follows: Om Hri Ha Ha Hung Hung Phat   
so first you get empowerments and then you get the practical instructions, how  
to visualize all the stuff..how to recite the mantra etc.   
this is all "mindstuff" but this are just aids to make the mind totally still  
and one pointed....(during the meditaiton your mind naturally is totally  
silent and onepointed..like a fingersnap)   
during the practice and trough the abisheka the mantra is charged with  
energy...so when you recite the mantra then it brings you directly into a very  
open and vast inner realm....the rather rough or glumbsy consiousness of the  
external world is transformed (in an instant) to clear lucid openess and  
limitless space...   
so during the practice I also htought about what ramana has dais to one of his  
students...the student asked him "during self-inquiery I experience an open  
space, some sort of emptiness or nothingness" and ramna answered "who beholds  
this emptiness?"   
so this is the core, and it is also the core in the buddhist teachings I  
recieved....to realize the simple presence, even if the senses are destroyed  
or the mind is totally still (like a still and vast see), there is this  
presence, and that is to be realized as what we really are, because the mind  
is both samsara and nirvana, and the presence Iam talking about is the source  
of the mind and therefor untouched by both ignorance or liberation (it makes  
no difference for this presence if Iam realized or unrealized...it makes a  
difference for my present state of mind). ...   
love

Dear matthias,   
Welcome back with your new posts on mantras of Tibetan   
Buddhism. Mantras are part and parcel of all ancient religions   
and this, as you have correctly observed, is for the chitta-suddhi,   
purification of mind. One thought replaces all other thoughts.   
Mantras are the core of all Upasana.   
Arunachala Siva.
