## secret passage between Arunachaleswara temple and Adi Annamalai temple

Dear friends,   
During Bhagavan's times, a passage was discovered in Adi Annamalai temple  
which was believed to lead to Arunachaleswara temple.   
On Bhagavan's advice, it was immediately closed.   
Can someone share the reason why Bhagavan had asked to do so.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Dear Ananda Sundaram,   
If I remember correctly, that is the secret passage through which gods come  
from   
the sanctum sanctorum of Arunachaleswarar Temple to Adi Annamalai for prayers.   
Sri Bhagavan when asked for an opinion by temple authorities, told them to  
close   
it up, since it might be used by ordinary mortals, which is not the purpose.   
Arunachala Siva.
