## Advent of Saints

**Advent of Saints**   
The ratio of good vs evil seem to remain more or less constant in the world in  
spite of the advent of so many saints and sages. However this ratio is like  
the ratio of young vs old people. At any time the ratio between the young and  
the old may appear to be constant, but if we observe each individual person we  
find that the young becomes old and the old passes away.   
Similarly, at the individual level, the saintÂ’s advent changes those people  
who were as if waiting for him/her. These people (devotees) ride on the waves  
of the saints and get proper understanding of the realm of the spirit which  
would have been impossible without the touch of the saints. The spiritually  
young becomes spiritually matured. All spiritual progress in the world is  
directly or indirectly due to the saints; indirectly since it can happen  
through scriptures or sayings long after the saints have passed away.   
The young will become old. There is no way to prevent this phenomenon. When  
one is willing and persevering and gets the touch of a saint, spiritual  
maturity is as sure to happen.

in the tradition in wich I practice (tibetan buddhism), it is said that  
through meditation alone you will come to a point where spiritual experiences  
will aris eint he mindstream...this is sure to happen one day....but through  
the grace of the guru the spiritual experience will flow into realization...   
this is just possible through the guru...nothing else will provide this.   
and indeed I met two teachers that gave me so much, I dont know what it is but  
I feel gratefull for it...and I know I cannot return it...   
you see this is the seed, in a way and through faith, meditation and devotion  
to the guru it will grow until the point where the nondual realization i  
permanent through day and night..

Dear silentgreen, matthias,   
Nice posts. In Tamil there is a saying, Vitta Kurai and Thotta   
Kurai. The Vitta Kurai is one where a person had done a lot   
of meritorious acts in his previous life and needs only a simple   
push in the present life from a Saint and attains realization.   
This Vitta Kurai people are like gun-powder, they need only a   
spark to fall on the the gun-powder and it explodes!   
The Thotta Kurai is one where a person had merely touched   
(thotta in Tamil) some aspects of meritorious acts and spirituality   
in his previous life and needs a continuous help from a Saint or   
a Guru. He is like a wet log, it needs a lot of fire to dry it first   
and then it should catch fire.   
Saints at different parts of the globe and in different times,   
come to help both these categories. A Grade I student gets   
University First Rank. A Grade II or III student, gets Grade   
I. But Saints help everyone. One only needs to go near them   
and be in their presence with a sincere heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
