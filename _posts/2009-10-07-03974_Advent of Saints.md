## "Maya viva vijrumbatham"  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 06, 2009, 07:17:27 AM  
---  
Sri Sankara says in Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, that the world   
is maya viva vijrumbatham, i.e. the world is created by Maya   
which springs forth from the mind. This Maya is indescribable   
like Brahman. It is in Atma, the Self, along with its branches   
like mindstuff, the mind, ego and the intellect. This Maya weaves   
all the worlds and their activities. It is better experienced than   
to be precisely defined. It springs forth from a seed called the   
mind pregnant with Vasanas.   
Once Narada asked Krishna: "Sir, please explain what is Maya?"   
Krishna said: "Let me see. Now, first let us go for a walk!"   
Krishna and Narada started for a walk, after some distance,   
Krishna told Narada: "I am thirsty. Can you fetch me some   
water?" Narada went to fetch water. On the meadow he saw   
a well. There was standing a beautiful lady. He instantly fell   
in love with her! He went into their hut and asked the lady's father   
to give her hand in marriage. The father agreed. The marriage   
took place. Narada settled down with his wife. They got   
9 children. He assumed the president-ship of the village after   
his fathe-in-law passed away. Soon, there was famine in the   
village. Suddenly huge floods came. In the floods, the children died of  
drowning one by one. The wife also died in the deluge. Narada cried, cried,  
cried, inconsolably.   
Krishna came to Narada. "What man! It is five minutes already. You have not  
yet brought the water? I am dying of thirst."   
Narada found Krishna. He found that all this was Maya, Maha   
Maya, Mother Unnamulai's indescribable sports! Who cannot   
fall prey to it?   
Bheejasyanthari vangukuro jagatitam prang-nirvikalpam puna: Maya kalpita desa kaala kalanaa vaichitriya chitrikrutham;   
Maya viva vijrumbayatyapi maha yogiva svechaya   
 thasmai sri guru-murtaye sri dakshinamurthaye!   
Only a Guru who has snapped the shackles of Maya, can help you to overcome the  
enticing look of Maya!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The magic show in Tiruvananthapuram  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 06, 2009, 07:29:50 AM  
---  
Once during King Marthanda Varma's time, in the erstwhile   
state of Travancore, a magician came and wanted the people   
to see his magic show in Tiruvananthapuram.   
The magician showed a war between devas and asuras (gods   
and demons) on the sky. Several thousands swarmed to see   
the magic show. The gods killed many demons. Their heads   
rolled and fell on the ground. The swords, mazes, bows and   
arrows fell scattered all over the ground. Several gods were   
also killed and their head-less torsos fell on the ground. There   
was a flood of blood and limbs.   
The people started crying. They ran hither and thither. Some   
in the milling crowd fell down and broke their limbs, in the   
stampede. The children cried. The women fainted. The king   
himself fell down from his throne. The magician had a roaring   
laughter.   
This is Maya, Maha Maya. Everyone is a prey to It, excepting   
the Creator, the magician of this universe.   
Maya sakti vilasa kalpita maha-vyamoha samharine   
thasmayai guru murtaye sri dakshinamurtaye!   
 \- Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram of Sri Sankara.   
This Maya can create a great delusion, maha-vyamoham.   
Men may lose their limbs, heads and mind too. The   
destroyer of this Maya is Guru, in whose feet, nothing   
of the kind of delusion will overpower you! He is Siva.   
Siva is the killer of Yama, and under Siva's feet, even   
death cannot approach you. How can Maya trouble you?   
My obeisance to that Sri Dakshinamurthy, who is the destroyer   
of maha-vyaamoham, that is made by the Maya Sakti. If   
one wants to stay unperturbed with Mother Unnamulai's   
Maya, one should surrender to the feet of Father Annamalai!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Advent of Saints  
Author: silentgreen         Date: October 07, 2009, 10:23:54 AM

**Advent of Saints**   
The ratio of good vs evil seem to remain more or less constant in the world in  
spite of the advent of so many saints and sages. However this ratio is like  
the ratio of young vs old people. At any time the ratio between the young and  
the old may appear to be constant, but if we observe each individual person we  
find that the young becomes old and the old passes away.   
Similarly, at the individual level, the saintÂ’s advent changes those people  
who were as if waiting for him/her. These people (devotees) ride on the waves  
of the saints and get proper understanding of the realm of the spirit which  
would have been impossible without the touch of the saints. The spiritually  
young becomes spiritually matured. All spiritual progress in the world is  
directly or indirectly due to the saints; indirectly since it can happen  
through scriptures or sayings long after the saints have passed away.   
The young will become old. There is no way to prevent this phenomenon. When  
one is willing and persevering and gets the touch of a saint, spiritual  
maturity is as sure to happen.

in the tradition in wich I practice (tibetan buddhism), it is said that  
through meditation alone you will come to a point where spiritual experiences  
will aris eint he mindstream...this is sure to happen one day....but through  
the grace of the guru the spiritual experience will flow into realization...   
this is just possible through the guru...nothing else will provide this.   
and indeed I met two teachers that gave me so much, I dont know what it is but  
I feel gratefull for it...and I know I cannot return it...   
you see this is the seed, in a way and through faith, meditation and devotion  
to the guru it will grow until the point where the nondual realization i  
permanent through day and night..

Dear silentgreen, matthias,   
Nice posts. In Tamil there is a saying, Vitta Kurai and Thotta   
Kurai. The Vitta Kurai is one where a person had done a lot   
of meritorious acts in his previous life and needs only a simple   
push in the present life from a Saint and attains realization.   
This Vitta Kurai people are like gun-powder, they need only a   
spark to fall on the the gun-powder and it explodes!   
The Thotta Kurai is one where a person had merely touched   
(thotta in Tamil) some aspects of meritorious acts and spirituality   
in his previous life and needs a continuous help from a Saint or   
a Guru. He is like a wet log, it needs a lot of fire to dry it first   
and then it should catch fire.   
Saints at different parts of the globe and in different times,   
come to help both these categories. A Grade I student gets   
University First Rank. A Grade II or III student, gets Grade   
I. But Saints help everyone. One only needs to go near them   
and be in their presence with a sincere heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
