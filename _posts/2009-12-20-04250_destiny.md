People get failure in material world as well as in spiritual path. If they ask  
guru they say it is your past karma or destiny. When it is our destiny to  
have   
failure, normal life people loose their faith to go forward. Is it their  
destiny to go on work till their end?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
I shall give you Bhagavan Ramana's views. He has answered   
several questions on destiny, posed by different devotees. His   
first teaching was to His Mother, who came to see Him in the Hill.   
He said: "God does everything according to his plans. If a certain   
thing should not happen as per God's will, whatever efforts one   
may put forth it shall not happen. If a certain thing should happen   
according to God's will, then with no efforts or even with negative   
efforts, it shall happen. Hence it is better to be silent."   
There are many such answers given in later years. Once Devaraja   
Mudaliar asked Him: "Even my putting down the hand fan on the   
floor after waving it for sometime, or my taking it up for fanning,   
is it destined?" Bhagavan Ramana said: "Yes. Everything is destiny."   
Then how to overcome miseries and unhappiness and sorrow?   
The answer is to pray God and then surrender to Him fully. Then   
He will take care of the rest. He who has fixed the destiny alone   
can withdraw it. No mantra, tantra, rituals, pacification ceremonies   
for planets and gods would be of any use. Surrender is the only   
way out.   
For a devout bhakta, God thins out the effect of destiny. It is   
as per Saiva Siddhantam. Suppose your head should be cut off,   
in a motor accident, you shall escape only with some minor injuries.   
How about a Jnani? He is God himself. How can destiny touch him?   
He has neither prarabdha, nor sanchita. Agami of course is not there. Hence  
all the three are said to be ineffective in the case of   
a Brahma Jnani. Bhagavan Ramana has said that if a king dies,   
all this three wives become widows simultaneously. Hence even   
prarabdha which is said to occur according to other scriptures,   
is totally denied by Bhagavan Ramana. The scriptures say that   
Prarabdha is like the arrow that has been shot out of the bow,   
and it does not know whether it is hitting a good person or a bad   
person. Hence Prarabdha must go through its motions, according   
to Prarabdha. Bhagavan Ramana has denied it.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
A devotee once asked "Is there destiny? And if what is destined to happen will  
happen is there any use in prayer or effort or should we just remain idle?   
Bhagavan replied: There are only two ways to conquer destiny or be independent  
of it. One is to enquire for whom is this destiny and discover that only the  
ego is bound by destiny and not the Self, and that the ego is non-existent.  
The other way is to kill the ego by completely surrendering to the Lord, by  
realizing ones helplessness and saying all the time: Not I but Thou, oh  
Lord!, and giving up all sense of I and mine and leaving it to the Lord  
to do what he likes with you. Surrender can never be regarded as complete so  
long as the devotee wants this or that from the Lord. True surrender is love  
of God for the sake of love and nothing else, not even for the sake of  
salvation. In other words, complete effacement of the ego is necessary to  
conquer destiny, whether you achieve this effacement through Self-enquiry or  
through bhakti-marga.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

To overcome the destiny as you say there are two ways, One is ask to whom this  
destiny comes, anotherone is complete surrender. To have this complete  
surrender also we need true bhakti. This true bhakti comes from God only. The  
jnani who has true love for God, and have bhakti.surrender these may be  
considered it is their destiny. Unless God's grace is there, true bhakti  
doesnot come. Once in a blue moon the heart melts infront of God not daily.   
I think that is why, Manikka vachakar says, AVAN ARULALE AVAN THAL VANAGI.   
As Nagaraj ji says, we should surrender for our helplessness.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
As Nagaraj clearly put it, there are only two ways to conquer   
the destiny. One is Self Enquiry and the other is Saranagati.   
Many people think that Surrender or Saranagati is easy. It is   
not so. In fact, it is as difficult as Self Enquiry. We are all   
clever in partial surrender, but not total surrender. In fact,   
Bhagavan Ramana describes the bhakta himself as one who   
is always surrendered to Atma. We should try both and succeed.   
Avan aruLale avan thaL vanangi - is a beautiful line from Tiruvachakam of  
Manikkavachagar. But, you know how he   
prayed to Siva's feet. The jackals became horses and then   
the horses became jackals and the king got angry and he   
made the saint to walk on the hot hot Vaigai sand in summer,   
without any footwear and keeping heavy hot bricks on his head!   
Still, he did not deter from his surrender. He says in Anandamalai,   
in Tiruvachakam: You made the jackals to horses and then back to jackals   
You did all this magic, and made the whole city of Madurai   
 owned by Pandya to go mad with that magic   
O the Rare Substance of Tiruperundurai, O the Father at Avinasi,   
O the floods of Pandya kingdom, O the incomprehensible Primordial   
 Light!   
I do not know what to do! Please protect me!   
Arunachala Siva.
