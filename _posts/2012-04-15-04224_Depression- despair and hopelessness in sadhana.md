## The annoying sadhu of Tiru  
Author: Child of Arunachala Date: April 15, 2012, 03:57:49 PM  
---  
I wonder if anyone else has had interaction with this tall, lanky, white-  
haired sadhu in Tiruvannamalai that I find really annoying. He wears an orange  
dhoti and is usually bare chested with a string of rudrakshas around his  
chest. Some times he wears an orange kurta. He speaks very good English and  
Tamil and is often to be seen in the big temple holding court or in the tea  
shop opposite Ramanasramam talking to westerners. If he comes into  
Ramanasramam, it is because he is trailing someone.   
I find him really annoying. He has been trying to strike up a conversation  
with me for atleast a couple of years, he may have been watching me for more.  
When I am bargaining with a shop owner, he appears from no where and butts in.  
He wants my cell phone number. He wants to be my teacher and show me around  
the big temple but I really don't like him and don't want to talk to him but  
he doesn't get it. Short of throwing stones at him, I don't know what else to  
do to him.   
Enquiries at Ramanasramam revealed that he is the son of an honorable ex-  
employee. Somehow this boy (now a elderly man) went wayward and is begging on  
the streets. Did I mention all he seems to be interested in is your money but  
uses spirituality as his vehicle to nab the first time westerner.   
Every time I go to Tiru now, I send up a prayer that I don't have to see this  
person - the tall, lanky, white haired man in orange. I don't know his name  
and I don't want to know. That is how miffed I am at him

Dear Child of Arunachala   
Once at Varanasi, as Swamiji was coming out of the temple of Mother Durga, he  
was surrounded by a large number of chattering monkeys. They seemed to be  
threatening him. Swamiji did not want them to catch hold of him, so he started  
to run away. But the monkeys chased him. An old sannyasin was there, watching  
those monkeys. He called out to Swamiji, **' Stop! Face the brutes!'** Swamiji  
stopped. He turned round and faced the monkeys. At once, they ran away. Many  
years later, Swamiji said: 'If you ever feel afraid of anything, always turn  
round and face it. Never think of running away.'   
(Swamiji was none other than Swami Vivekananda)   
Hope this helped!   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Child of Arunachala,   
I have visited Sri Ramanasramam on a number of occasions during the past 4  
years. I have not met this 'Swami'. I and   
my wife normally converse with Office people, book depot people and some  
personalities whom we know, like Lucy Ma's   
Daughter and a short Sri Lankan lady. With others we normally do not converse.  
Anyway your advice is quite useful for   
keeping in mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
That is a beautiful lesson from Swami Vivekananda, isn't it? I will try to  
imbibe it in my life. Thank you.   
Dear Subramanian Sir,   
Lucy Maa's daughter and the Sri Lankan lady are good people. This guy is a  
mendicant who roams the streets in an orange dhoti. I am sure you will know  
who I am referring to if you see him. He is tall, lanky, dark skinned and  
looks very clean. You can't miss him. He comes to Ramanasramam usually in the  
afternoons and evenings when there are more westerners.   
I was really looking for ways to deal with this man. I find him very  
bothersome. His mind is definitely not on spiritual practices but looks the  
part of an educated sadhu with vibuti, rudraksha and orange robes AND a huge  
watch.   
That is why while I love going to Ramanasramam, I just cant meditate there  
anymore because I have to be vigilant. So now I just meditate in my room.  
Bhagavan is there, Arunachala also comes.   
Regards,   
Child of Arunachala

Dear Child of Arunachala,   
You can think of Old Hall for meditation. It is a place where Sri Bhagavan  
held His court and there were great personalities   
like Muruganar, Kunju Swami, Kavyakanta, T.K. Sundaresa Iyer, N.R.  
Krishnamurti Iyer, Sub Registrar Narayana Iyer,   
Suri Nagamma, Devaraja Mudaliar, and Smt. Kanakamma, and Westerners like  
Chadwick, Arthur Osborne, S.S. Cohen,   
and even Aurobindo's devotees like Kapali Sastri, Dilip Kumar Roy - all have  
sat and listened to Sri Bhagavan's words of   
wisdom. This Hall reverberates with that sublime past.   
The Old Hall is well protected and people like 'Swami' will not be allowed  
inside.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian, Sir   
Thank you. Yes, I like the old meditation hall. BTW, this guy isn't a swami.  
He just wears orange robes and is very clean looking. He looks like one of us.  
So he isn't stopped when he goes into the old meditation hall.   
Someone emailed me just now that his name is **Krishnan**. May be it is. If  
anyone here has a more effective way of dealing with this guy, other than  
throwing stones at him, please let me know. He follows me to stores in the  
big temple area. The moment the shop keepers spot him, they charge me a Rs 1  
or 2 more. Not that I mind giving, just don't want to be forced to give and  
definitely not to this pest.

Dear Child of Ramana,   
The best option would be to check with the Ashram office itself. May be you  
could speak to fellow devotees who are from other country.   
There could be different ways to deal with this, Either speak to him directly  
and sort out the issue, ask him to not disturb you. If he could be spoken  
with, ask him what he wants, provide if you could, else, settle the matter  
with him. If this also does not work, just stop paying any attention to him.  
The lesser you pay attention, the farther he would get, just be careless  
towards him, use the situation to abide as Self. Just be silent at him,  
convincingly, your silence would dismiss him off.   
The other side would be, who knows, we never know who comes in what form, he  
could be hanging around you, perhaps for you to discern some new teaching  
through him.   
Do not worry, Bhagavan is just beside, nothing could happen.   
Conquer with love and wisdom.   
(these are my views, second opinion is sure worth it)   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Nagaraj   
Your suggestions are full of wisdom. I was worried about my own attitude  
towards him, that too in the vicinity of Arunachala. That is why I posted. I  
will abide in the Self and hope he goes away. Afterall Arunachala has a way of  
dealing with bothersome people. Arunachala has always come through for me.   
I feel you have given me the answer to my problem - To abide in the Self and  
not be so much in the world. Thank you.

Child of Arunachala

Nagaraj/Silentgreen/Friends,   
I thought of posting it in the Rough Note Book Thread but then decided that i  
will post it here.This is to emphasize that Prayer and devotional  
singing,chanting the Divine name with Faith and Devotion -all these have  
tremendous potency and cannot be overlooked by any devotee however  
advanced.For the simple, childlike soul,nothing more is needed.Whatever has to  
unfold will happen.   
Quote

> directed upon the very source itself.

Yes indeed.This is the Natural Progression or deepening that Sri Bhagavan has  
expounded in the Upadesa saram.Unfortunately it is misinterpreted by some-as  
if those are preparatory or auxiliary,indirect means- involving subject and  
Object and that only self-enquiry is the perfect Nondual approach and so on  
and so forth.I do not subscribe to this later view.I view it as a progressive  
inward turning of the mind,becoming subtler and subtler as it sheds its Gross  
aspect,until the attention is folded back towards the source of the 'i'  
thought,where the 'i' is disassociated from objects-Like what sri Bhagavan has  
mentioned as tracing the scent of the Master.This Scent is known and yet  
unknown!If it is totally unknown,one cannot seek it and find it;if it is  
totally known one need not seek it in the first place!   
coming to what Nagaraj has mentioned in the above quote regarding singing a  
song and continuin enquiry,this is how Sri Ramakrishna explains it,as usual in  
his inimitable way.An excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> "What Brahman is cannot be described. Speech stops there. In the kirtan the  
> singers at first sing: 'My Nitai dances like a mata hati.' As they become  
> more and more ecstatic, they can hardly utter the whole sentence. They sing  
> only: 'Hati! Hati!' As their mood deepens they sing only: 'Ha! Ha!' At last  
> they cannot sing even that; they become completely unconscious."   
> As the Master spoke these words, he himself became transfixed in samadhi. He  
> was standing.   
> Regaining consciousness of the world, he said, "That which is beyond both  
> kshara and akshara cannot be described."   
> The devotees sat in silence.  
Yes,I agree as silentgreen has rightly mentioned that Contemplating on Sri  
Ramakrishna(his life) is just the right thing to do to imbibe the spirit of  
that simple yet potent Prayer.This is the reason why we chant the Hymns of the  
Great ones.It carries the spirit and power of the Great one who composed it.We  
have Lord Jesus 'Lord's Prayer'.The simpler the Prayer,the easier it is for us  
to tune ourselves.   
Namaskar.

Dear Graham Sir,   
THis refers to your article on self enquiry. Else where I have asked some  
additional clarification and here I am requesting something additional.In the  
article, you have mentioned various stages of self enquiry with particular  
importance given to the retaining of self attention even in the midst of  
different experiences during the practice.   
What happens if in this lifetime we are unable to reach upto the last stage or  
for that matter, what if we just about climb the ladder?Kindly revert on this.   
Elsewhere we have agreed that the Lord always uplifts us and we commence from  
where we lift off?But it would be reassuring if there are some words from  
Bhagavan also on this. Has someone asked Bhagavan about this and has he  
replied on this.   
Thanks,Anand Sundaram.

Dear friends,   
While I would like Graham Sir to respond to this particularly, I would like  
others also to revert.   
In all posts when any member expresses despondency on his method of sadhana or  
lack of progress, members particularly here say dont worry Bhagavan will take  
care.   
This wording of the assurance has always been a bit perplexing for me, since  
Bhagavan is no more in the flesh. I think this is to be understood as the  
supreme Brahman is overseeing our progress and the supreme is none other than  
and no different than the Bhagavan who was in the flesh from 1879 -1950.Or is  
it that, Bhagavan who existed in the flesh from 1879 - 1950 is now bodiless  
but still exists as the Bhagavan of old blessing and guiding all those who  
take his name or remember him - whileat the same time being no different from  
the Supreme Brahman that makes all things move. I will be happy if you can  
revert independently along with of course our beloved Graham Sir as to how  
to understand this statement.   
Thanks,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Graham Sir,   
Thanks for reverting.   
Dear Ravi Sir,   
I view Arunachala as the physical manifestation of the supreme Brahman.   
As far as Bhagavan is concerned, I would like to view him as an avatar of the  
supreme Brahman or Arunachala who wanted to demonstrate the path of self  
enquiry for the benefit of posterity by living and enacting the same as any  
human being.   
Moreover I would like to believe that Bhagavan out of his infinite mercy  
and compassion in some mysterious way still exists within the realms of  
Brahman as a perfected Siddha who raises to emancipation those who turn to him  
and also shows the path of enquiry to souls who are ripe for that.   
Thanks,   
Anand Sundaram.

Anand Sundaram,   
Here is an excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: "Once Rama asked Hanuman, 'How do you look on Me?' And Hanuman replied: 'O  
Rama,as long as I have the feeling of "I", I see that Thou art the whole and I  
am a part; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant. But when, O Rama, I have  
the knowledge of Truth, then I realize that Thou art I and I am Thou.'   
"The relationship of master and servant is the proper one. Since this 'I' must  
remain, let the rascal be God's servant.   
 **Evil of "I"and "mine"**   
"'I' and 'mine' \- these constitute ignorance. 'My house', 'my wealth', 'my  
learning', 'my possessions' \- the attitude that prompts one to say such  
things comes of ignorance. On the contrary, the attitude born of Knowledge is: 'O God, Thou art the Master, and all these things belong to Thee. House,  
family, children, attendants, friends, are Thine.'   
The above teaching wraps up everything about how a devotee views his  
Ishta,Guru, God,Self.Truth is one only.A devotee of Sri Bhagavan following the  
path of self Enquiry or surrender will have the faith that whatever Truth or  
Shakti that manifested as Sri Ramana Bhagavan is Eternal and the  
Presence(sannidhi)of the Guru is Eternal-and that this presence is available  
to all those who open their Heart in Trust, Faith and a spirit of  
surrender.The Name and Form of Bhagavan is inseperable from that presence for  
such a one and he derives all the Guidance and power of the presence by  
worshipping the form and remembering the name.   
A devotee of Shirdi Baba will feel the same thing about sai Baba.A devotee of  
Lord Sri Krishna will say the same thing about Lord Sri Krishna.All this is  
valid,as long as there is genuine devotion.   
This very thing becomes a problem when seized by the mind and its penchant for  
self Gratification,it is turned into fanaticism as Graham had mentioned.   
Quote  
> Having faith in something unknown is difficult to maintain and _sometimes  
> leads to fanaticism_ or failure in the absence of proof  
The Genuine Sadhaka knows that Guru is one and only one-Be it Sai Baba Or  
Ramana Bhagavan or Kanchi Mahaswami.He does not seek to elevate one over the  
other in a narrow sectarian way.It is quite understandable that one form  
appeals to him more than others but this is just on account of his own  
predeliction or disposition.   
I wish to add that the Guru not only points to the Truth but he also gives the  
shakti to tread the path.Ofcourse the devotee has to put in the required self  
effort.   
There is a wonderful chapted called 'Four aids' from Sri Aurobindo's  
'Synthesis of Yoga' which covers all these aspects.You may like to look up  
this post: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=7216.msg32818#msg32818

Though it is now quite late-since the thread began in 2009- I would like to  
express my deep gratitude to Graham. Since I first joined the Forum about 1  
year ago, I have returned to this thread, especially his original post, time  
and again, whenever I have found myself once again in doubt & despair. I am  
sure over the years there will be many others like me who will draw  
reassurance and comfort from this, in what must always ultimately be a lonely  
& often heart-breaking struggle.

Dear partha   
these words carry deep meaning.   
can you kindly open a thread in general discussion on Sadhana, difficulties.  
You seem to be very practical and I may get inspiration from your experience.
