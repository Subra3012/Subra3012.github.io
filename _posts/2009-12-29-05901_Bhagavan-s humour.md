## Bhagavan's humour

Bhagavan had a brilliant sense of humour and laughter was common in the  
ashram.   
It acts as an important release mechanism for tensions that build up in the  
individual pursuit of sadhana and in situations where many people congregate.   
It is also a very good teacher, because through humour it is possible to say  
things that otherwise could not be said without causing offence.

Dear Sri Graham,   
I wish you a very happy New Year 2010, with continued abundance   
of Bhagavan's Grace. I had been at T'malai from 28th Dec. 2009   
to today, 1st Jan 2010, (upto 2.30 PM). Bhagavan's Jayanti was   
celebrated with joy and happiness, with Ekadasa Rudram and other   
songs. And it is the day of Smt. T.R. Kanakkamal's liberation and   
merger in Bhagavan's lotus feet. I was in the Samadhi Hall, at   
around 9 am., when that devotee had just entered the Samadhi Hall   
and within a minute or so, she merged with Bhagavan Ramana. It is   
Smt. Kanakammal, who has written a separate chapter on Bhagavan's   
humour, in one of her reminscences.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Its a sad news at at the same time a good news, that you shared with us. I  
keep reading Smt. Kanakammal's Cherished Memories always, its an outpour of  
her love to he beloved Guru, Sri Ramana Maharshi. And what a perfect ending to  
her body? Its really a great miracle, that she should step inside the Samadhi  
Hall and merge with Sri Ramana Maharshi Himself. I was getting goosebumps as I  
read the news from your post. I was feeling really sad, for a great devotee  
has left this world, more appropriately left the physical memory of her in me.  
But She is ever here, along with Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
She was graced by Nayana Dheeksha from Sri Bhagawan. Its such an extraordinary  
experience to read her experience, right from her young days, when she had an  
intense desire to move to Sri Ramanashramam, how she stayed there, and how she  
had to struggle to convince her father who wanted her to lead a normal life.   
She was so close to Sri Bhagawan and ever is here!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks. I think it was Bhagavan Ramana's best Jayanti Gift to   
that great lady. She had learnt Bhagavan Ramana's works from   
Muruganar directly, by attending classes in the Asramam. She   
had no notes with her. Several years later, she put them into   
2 volume book, in nice simple Tamil, covering the complete works   
of Bhagavan Ramana. The English translation of the first volume   
had been recently published. I do not know whether she had completed  
preparation of Volume 2. Once her parents went to   
Kanchi Sri Chandrasekara (Maha Swami) and told him that she   
preferred Sri Ramanasramam than to Kanchi Math. Mahaswami   
had said: "If she is there or here, what difference does it make?   
Both are one and the same." Then Mahaswami smiled at   
Kanakammal and said: Ekanda Vasam, Swayam baham, Anma   
Vicharam, living alone, cooking for herself and self enquiry!   
She did exactly that and got the prize of liberation on Bhagavan's   
Jayanti Day, 2010.   
Arunachala Siva.
