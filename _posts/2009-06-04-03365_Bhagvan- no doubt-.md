## Bhagvan, no doubt.

I first came across a book of Bhagwan (be as you are) about twenty years ago.   
In that time I have studied a lot of other books and met some teachers.   
Bhagvan is the only one I have never had the slightest doubt about and he is   
the example of a perfect saint for us.

Dear sky person,   
Yes. That is my experience too. I came to know about Him   
about 15 years back. I studied His books, books by His   
devotees and their 'expereinces'. He is very much with   
us today also. I tried other saints and sages. Nobody excepting   
Sankara and Bhagavan Ramana appealed to me to the full   
extent. As Sankara says in Sri Sivananda Lahari: "I was   
going through the husk and found that You only remain   
as a grain, among the dust of chaff."   
Arunachala Siva.
