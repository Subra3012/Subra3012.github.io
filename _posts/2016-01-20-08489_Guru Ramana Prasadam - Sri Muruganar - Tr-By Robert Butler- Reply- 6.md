Verse 380: Within my heart the one pointed thought: Apart from the Self there is for me  
no other protection!   
was kindled and flared up. Then, as all other thoughts died away, unable to  
arise, I merged with   
You as my authentic form.   
Verse 297: The absolute oneness of Brahman stands alone as the greater life of divine  
silence, the life of grace   
that is the direct experience of the knowledge of the real, entirely free from  
from the life of delusion   
that is the mental creation of a mind deluded by desire. Other than through  
the grace of the guru,   
that greater life is impossible to attain.   
Verse 85: Through inner renunciation, free of all desires, except for the lofty desire  
for the flood of divine grace,   
purity arose within my soul, and as my mind, becoming perfectly pure,  
conducted its inquiry, the   
greater life of grace that nothing can mar, the reality of the Self,  
manifested within my heart.   
Verse 172: When I surrendered myself saying: Save for your Holy Holy Feet, there is no  
salvation for me!   
Your grace is my only refuge! with no thought in my mind other than the  
thought of Him, He   
untied me with my own true nature as His very own.   
Verse 275: The Lord bestows upon us the great wealth of meditating upon and worshipping  
the glory of His self   
in thought and speech. The true, authentic consciousness that shines as one  
within the heart when   
we rely upon His grace, and investigate inwardly through the inquiry 'Who am  
I?' is the exalted state   
of Brahman whose nature is impossible to grasp.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
