For some thirty five years I had been visiting Tiruvannamalai solely for Sri  
Ramana and Sri Ramanasramam.   
I came to sit in Sri Ramana's shrine and to absorb Sri Ramana's teachings. I  
paid little attention to the Hill.   
It is true that I had performed many a pradakshina around Arunachala.  
However, I did this, because   
Sri Ramana highly recommended people to do it.   
By luring me, again and again, as I worked on the Sri Ramana book, and by the  
good fortune of having a sister   
whose presence was required, I eventually had Arunachala's darshan. As Sri  
Ramana sang,   
The mountain is mysterious and mysterious in the way it works. It is not just  
an insentient pile of earth and   
rocks. It is Lord Siva, the One Self, standing there in all its glory for  
those who are given eyes to see.   
At times seekers ask the question: 'How does the Sage give instruction? Is it  
from the state of ignorance?   
If this were so, the mind would not have been dissolved, the three fold  
differentiation of the knower,   
knowledge, and the known could not have been merged. So what would the Sage be  
able to give you?   
Where could He lead you? But there is a stage where this question does not  
arise. Is it the body that is   
the obstacle to the Supreme Knowledge? Is there even question of whether the  
body exists or not?   
At a certain level this question is simply not there. On the plane where this  
question arises, one is not in the   
state of pure Being, and one thinks this question can be raised and also  
replied to. But the answer lies where   
there is no such thing as questioning and answering, where there are no  
'others', no divisions - only   
the Self, Sri Ramana, Arunachala.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
