I want to know when King Janak got his enlightenment. before Sita's wedding or  
afterwards. Seeing Sita's suffering how he took it.   
I think Janak met Ashtavakara and got enlightenment before his daughter's  
wedding. Otherwise no father could tolerate to see his daughter's suffering.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
I am not sure. But when He got enlightenment, He was   
already the King of Mithila. When the fellow-sadhus were   
rushing to Mithila, to collect their few clothes and perhaps   
a few cows, when they heard that Mithila was burning,   
Janaka remained in the Guru's ashram, undisturbed. He   
has said: "What if Mithila is burning, I am secure in my   
Atmanubhuti."   
Arunachala Siva.
