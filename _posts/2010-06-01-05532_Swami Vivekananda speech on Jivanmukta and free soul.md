**THE FREE SOUL (Delivered in New York, 1896)**   
 **Philosophy is no joke or talk. It has to be realised; this body will  
vanish, this earth and everything will vanish, this idea that I am the body or  
the mind will for some time vanish, or if the Karma is ended it will  
disappear, never to come back; but if one part of the Karma remains, then as a  
potter 's wheel, after the potter has finished the pot, will sometimes go on  
from the past momentum, so this body, when the delusion has vanished  
altogether, will go on for some time. Again this world will come, men and  
women and animals will come, just as the mirage came the next day**, but not  
with the same force; along with it will come the idea that I know its nature  
now, and it will cause no bondage, no more pain, nor grief, nor misery.  
Whenever anything miserable will come, the mind will be able to say, "I know  
you as hallucination." **When a man has reached that state, he is called  
Jivanmukta, living-free ", free even while living. The aim and end in this  
life for the Jnâna-Yogi is to become this Jivanmukta, "living-free".  
**He is Jivanmukta who can live in this world without being attached.He is  
like the lotus leaves in water, which are never wetted by the water.**   
 **If we have known the Âtman as It is, if we have known that there is nothing  
else but this Atman, that everything else is but a dream, with no existence in  
reality, then this world with its poverties, its miseries, its wickedness, and  
its goodness will cease to disturb us.** If they do not exist, for whom and  
for what shall we take trouble? This is what the Jnana-Yogis teach. Therefore,  
dare to be free, dare to go as far as your thought leads, and dare to carry  
that out in your life. It is very hard to come to Jnâna. It is for the bravest  
and most daring, who dare to smash all idols, not only intellectual, but in  
the senses. This body is not I; it must go. All sorts of curious things may  
come out of this.   
**A man stands up and says, "I am not the body, therefore my headache must be  
cured"; but where is the headache if not in his body? Let a thousand headaches  
and a thousand bodies come and go. What is that to me? I have neither birth  
nor death; father or mother I never had; friends and foes I have none, because  
they are all I. I am my own friend, and I am my own enemy. I am Existence-  
Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.**I am He, I am He. If in a thousand bodies I am  
suffering from fever and other ills, in millions of bodies I am healthy. If in  
a thousand bodies I am starving, in other thousand bodies I am feasting. If in  
thousands of bodies I am suffering misery, in thousands of bodies I am happy.  
Who shall blame whom, who praise whom? Whom to seek, whom to avoid? I seek  
none, nor avoid any, for I am all the universe. I praise myself, I blame  
myself, I suffer for myself, I am happy at my own will, I am free. This is the  
Jnâni, the brave and daring. Let the whole universe tumble down; he smiles and  
says it never existed, it was all a hallucination. He sees the universe tumble  
down. Where was it! Where has it gone!   
In the vulgar form the question becomes, " **How did sin come into this  
world?** " This is the most vulgar and sensuous form of the question, and the  
other is the most philosophic form, but the answer is the same. The same  
question has been asked in various grades and fashions, but in its lower forms  
it finds no solution, because the stories of apples and serpents and women do  
not give the explanation. In that state, the question is childish, and so is  
the answer. But the question has assumed very high proportions now: "How did  
this illusion come?" And the answer is as fine. **The answer is that we cannot  
expect any answer to an impossible question. The very question is impossible  
in terms. You have no right to ask that question. Why? What is perfection?  
That which is beyond time, space, and causation  that is perfect.**   
 **Then you ask how the perfect became imperfect.** In logical language the  
question may be put in this form: "How did that which is beyond causation  
become caused?" You contradict yourself. You first admit it is beyond  
causation, and then ask what causes it. This question can only be asked within  
the limits of causation. As far as time and space and causation extend, so far  
can this question be asked. But beyond that it will be nonsense to ask it,  
because the question is illogical. **Within time, space, and causation it can  
never be answered, and what answer may lie beyond these limits can only be  
known when we have transcended them; therefore the wise will let this question  
rest. When a man is ill, he devotes himself to curing his disease without  
insisting that he must first learn how he came to have it.**

Dear prasanth,   
Nice post. Swami Vivkekanda's Chicago Address was in Bhagavan   
Ramana's house along with Tayumanavar songs and Periya Puranam.   
But He did not read the first one. He even pronounced the name   
Vivekananda, as Vi-ve-kananada! Really speaking He never read   
any thing of any sort. Some Tayumanavar songs He had read.   
But He read Periya Puranam in some details, and prayed to the   
the stone images of 63 Saints in Meenkashi Temple and cried: Let me also become one like these great devotees!   
The desciption of a Jivan Mukta is quite interesting. Bhagavan   
Ramana LIVED the life of a Jivan Mukta in recent times. There is   
no other guru or any Math Heads who lived a life of a Jivan   
Mukta in entirety in recent times.   
Arunachala Siva.
