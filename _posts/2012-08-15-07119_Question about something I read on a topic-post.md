## Question about something I read on a topic/post

Hello,   
I have recently read somebody voice an opinion that nisargadatta maharaj was a  
fake. I have no doubts that Sri ramana maharshi is the real deal, i have faith  
in him and follow his teachings with earnestness, so I am not here to argue  
with anybody, or compare. I would just appreciate an honest opinion on why  
nisargadatta is a fake so i can discontinue having belief that he has reached  
enlightenment.   
Thank you

How do you know that Nisargadatta is fake? Why do you think so? I don't think  
that we must judge people who has given all their life for people and  
educating them. It is just impolite. If you don't believe He is awakened, ok.  
There is no problem with that. But to call Him fake is too bold and harsh.  
First realize who you are then judge and categorize whoever you want, however  
you want. Sri Ramana has never said bad word for anyone. I think that if you  
want to follow Lord Ramana's way, you must first get Him as an example of  
behavior.   
You want someone to justify your believe Sri Nisargadatta is fake because that  
would make your choice of leaving Him easier. But I think it is not necessary.  
If you don't like Him, just leave Him. It is not needed to justify why you are  
doing it. Stop the freaking game of your mind. The mind wants to crash  
everything it doesn't like. Please, brother, do not let it.

Sir,   
Sri Nisarghadatta maharaj propounded greatest discoveries that were never  
revealed in any scriptures. Please read his books by Jean Dunn.   
Secondly even Ramansramam president Ganesan met Nisarghadatta maharaj and had  
very high opinion.   
Almost everyone who visited him came back with un-describable peace.   
Mother Krishna Bai sent few of visistors to her to Sri Nisarghadatta's place.   
Above all, Maharaj did not charge anything unlike modern day advaita  
workshops.   
He did not get anything from foreigners, he lived in his same small house.   
He was affected by worst caner yet he graciously accepted the way of God just  
like other saints.   
I cannot prove his worth to you -- but please dont believe ever that he is a  
fake.   
Ramana Maharshi appeared in a Dutch devoteee's dream and said that he will  
meet a realized person who is living. That Dutch yogi met Sri Nisarghadatta  
maharaj.   
So my earnest request is, stop reading his teachings, for a moment ask Sri  
Nisarghadatta himself to reveal himself. Wait and see the results.

Dear Devotees,   
I also feel and believe that one should not speak slightingly about great  
persons, particularly in a forum where members may be devotees of the slighted  
person. Sri Nisaragadatta is known at large as a very revered Jnani.  
Therefore, whether one believes in His Realisation or not, in my view, is  
immaterial. Yes. it is all mind's escape root. Who sees the defects in others?  
As devotee of Sri Bhagwan, we must concentrate on finding That only. Sri  
Bhagwan teaches that if seer of the defect is known beyond doubt, one finds  
everything perfect. Seer along with the defects are gone.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Hello,   
I am sorry, I may have worded my post wrong. I have read I am that and follow  
nissargadatta's teachings as well as ramana's teaching as I feel they are both  
non duality teachings. I do not believe myself nissargadatta is a fake, and i  
am using the word fake because it is the exact word i read that somebody else  
used. I have no reason to believe nissargadatta is a fake as I have followed  
his teachings with faith until I read another person on this forum call him a  
fake.   
My question is why would this person call nissargadatta a fake without giving  
a reason to justify this statement ? Is there something I do not know about  
him ? Sorry if I may have offended some people but fake is not a word I would  
use either, I am just referring to another post I read.

Dear brother ivac_d,   
you have not offended anyone. We just tried to tell you that call someone fake  
or real is immaterial for jnana. The only thing you must investigate is the  
source of the doubter and the questionner. We are not here to judge you.  
Moreover we are just human as you are, with all our weaknesses and problems.  
We just try to give you advice - the best way we can.   
The problem is that when mind doesn't like something it tries to reject it, to  
destroy it, to humiliate it, to disprove it and so on. That's why some people  
talk such things about other peoples. But Lord Ramana has taught to escape  
such situations and to not lose energy and to give attention to such vain  
talks. The only thing He has adviced us (in different ways) is to find out who  
are we. His teaching is clear and simple but we somehow try to complicate it.  
We all have done what you are doing - trying to disprove some authority and so  
on but from my experience I can tell you that this is both wrong and waste of  
time.   
Best wishes, ramana1359

Thank you very much brothers   
I really appreciate all your honest replies. I realize that I am wasting my  
time and furthering myself from my practices by letting who I am follow this  
chain of thought of disproving this or that. Disproving anything will not  
bring me closer to realization of my true self.   
By understanding all your replies i will no longer allow the mind to ponder  
into such thoughts from now on. And thank you brother ramana1359 with your  
last reply which sparked and helped me understand what everybody else letting  
me know.   
Thanks to everybody again   
Love and peace to all,

Now I got your problem. I have a very good tonic for this.   
You have been following Sri Nisargha's teachings but suddenly something came  
up in internet that has upset you.   
Problem is, the faith was not very perfect from the beginning. So with  
slightest provocation you have started confusing yourself and getting  
tormented by this doubt.   
I also used to get upset whenever somebody calls him a fake. Infact Osho has  
severly criticized him.   
Then I devised this way. It will definitely work.   
Dont start with the teachings of Sri Nisargha for sometime. Please dont  
ignore him also.   
Rather, try to put all your doubts to his lotus feet mentally. Daily offer  
your prayer, worship and remembrance of his name and form. If possible, do  
mentally the cleaning of his feets with sacred water.   
Start with that Guru Bhakthi. If you dont get any respsone or keep on  
getting tormented by doubts, perservere, surredner your doubts and dont  
leave his form until you get that conviction.   
Once you do this, in a month or so, something will start to get stirred into  
yourself. Same teachings, then visist next time with absolute Guru Bhakthi.  
Something will amazingly synch up and catch fire within you.   
That is the secret.   
You know, whenever we approach any saint, our own bad karma will manifest in  
terms like doubts, fake etc.   
The saint will not do anything about the doubts -- whoever comes or not comes  
does not matter to him.   
But if you on your part becomes sincere and still approach him, sooner or  
later, his Heart will melt and pour love.   
So from today -- dont leave him until you get convinced.   
May your good punyas give you enough faith on Him.

Dear ivac,   
I kindly tell this: dont run away from this half the miles. Teacher is  
more important than teaching. Teaching can happen in no time. So having  
associated with a great saint like Nisargha, dont leave in the middle.   
Metnally sort out your assocation with that sage. Everything else will follow  
in due course.

Dear ivac_d,   
What Krishnan says is correct. A perfect Jnani (self realized soul) can be  
understood only by another Jnani. That is why   
Sri Bhagavan said categorically that Seshadri Swamigal was a Brahma Jnani even  
though many considered him eccentric   
or mad.   
Then how do we realize that a person whom we approach is a Jnani? Sri Ramana  
Gita answers this point. If one devotee   
approaches a Jnani, and spend some time with him, he will (1) find  
extraordinary peace within him while in such a Jnani's   
Presence, (2) he will find that his otherwise monkey-like mind, stops  
oscillating for a while in such presence. (3) his intuition   
would say or even hammer his brain that 'here is a person who has experienced  
the Self.'   
Then how come some do not get these experience these while in the presence of  
a Jnani? It is because of his bad karmas,   
or vasanas. These vasanas would jump out in the form of his ego and then  
proclaim that he is a fake or at best he is not   
a Jnani.   
Many people came to the Asramam, even during His bodily life. Some sat in  
front of Sri Bhagavan like a statue. Others went around the Asramam, looked at  
trees, monkeys and peacocks and came way. THEY COULD NOT SIT IN SILENCE IN THE  
OLD HALL.   
And that is the difference.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you very much subramanian.

explained while doing my daily meditation. I really appreciate the advice  
especially that you have experienced my position and have made it through with

Dear Ivac   
You are very humble and very particular in reciprocating everything to  
everybody.   
With such a mind set, please dont mistake me that I am again and again  
insisting -- still, you please increase your devotion and mental contact  
with the sage Sri Nisarghadataa Maharaj.   
I am sure you will get in abundance   
The value of Guru Bhakthi is this -- without even you taking any strain to  
reflect upon the teachings, the teacher's grace will straight penetrate your  
heart and make your mind very pure.   
Even from Hastamalaka disciple to his Master Adhi Shankara, everybody has  
just spent lot of time in glorifying their Guru, thinking of them alone.   
Any Master -- Disciple relation will have a stage like all these doubts. We  
need to cross it by peristent devotion to the teacher.

Dear Ivac   
Everyone has answered you so well. My only humble addition is also to ensure  
we are not faking ourselves in this journey - does not matter who else is fake  
or not. And a point will come where fake and non fake will become equal. Let  
us focus on that supreme point where mental "Adhyaropa" of fake and non fake  
fall apart.

Dear all,   
Those Sri Bhagavan has not mentioned anything about Nisargadatta Maharaj,  
later, Sri V. Ganesan asked several devotees   
to go Nisargadatta Maharaj and spend some time with him. Unless Nisargadatta  
is a true Jnani - Sri Ganesan would not have   
suggested some devotees to go and see him. Perhaps the way in which  
Nisargadatta taught his devotees might have been   
different. I believe he used to ask devotees to put up questions to him, so  
that he might clear them.   
I believe that Nisargadatta Maharaj is a true Jnani and his methods were only  
different from what Sri Bhagavan had   
adopted.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian sir, I believe same about Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,and think  
He is a true sage. Whenever i read His works i feel tremendous peace. For me  
He and Bhagavan Ramana are One. Even the teachings i find very the same,only  
different metods and ways. That is,suerly,my own thinking,and anyone is free
