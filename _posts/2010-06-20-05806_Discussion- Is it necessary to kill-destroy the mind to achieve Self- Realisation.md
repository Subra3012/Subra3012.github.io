**A brief overview of Advaita Vedanta** : #. **The Ultimate Reality** : \- The Absolute Reality (known as Brahman) is non-dual, is the pure subject  
and beyond the reach of words and thoughts, which relate only to objects.   
\- No phenomenal characterizations or predictions can be made of the Brahman  
(neti, neti). In that sense it is attributeless (nirguna).   
\- But being the reality and the source of all phenomenon, it is not an entity  
beyond experience. It is the inner-self (pratyak-atman) of all, the eternal  
subject. It is intuitively cognized, directly and intimately, as the pure  
witness Self (saksi) within by all beings.   
\- Brahman from the emperical point of view is said to have the nature of  
satyam-jnanam-anantam-brahma (absolute existence knowledge infinity) and  
anandam (absolute bliss). Often cit (consciousness) is used in place of jnanam  
(knowledge) and brahman is referred to as sat-chit-ananda.   
#. **The Relative Universe** : \- How the relative universe rises from the absolute, none can say. However  
from the relative point of view it is postulated that an inscrutable veiling-  
projecting Maya power of Brahman, presents to us the relative universe by  
veiling the nature of ultimate reality.   
\- Maya does not infringe the absoluteness of the Brahman. Maya is a fact from  
the emperical point of view but Maya is not Maya to Brahman.   
\- The Maya power arises spontaneously from Brahman without its willing and  
projects the universe. This is like fire radiating heat and light  
spontaneously and not as an act of will.   
\- Due to the Maya power of Brahman, the Brahman appears to be polarized into  
subject and object, within the framework of space, time and causation,  
amenable to change and activity.   
\- When in the waking state, the perceiving subject considers himself as a  
psycho-physical being, subject to changes, the rest of the universe is also  
perceived as an objective physical entity with other psycho-physical beings  
within the framework of space, time and causation.   
\- When in the dream state, the perceiving subject within the dream has a  
dream personality, which is mental in nature, the objective universe and the  
beings in it are also mental within the volatile framework of space, time and  
causation of the dream world.   
\- When in deep sleep state, there is no personality of the perceiving  
subject, the universe is also not perceived as an object.   
\- When in samadhi, one realizes onseself as Atman, there is neither the  
universe, nor its perceiver. Only the non-dual Absolute Brahman remains as  
pure awareness.   
\- The Absolute Brahman causally associated with the totality of the relative  
universe is known as Isvara, the Lord and the ruler of the universe and its  
beings.   
#. **Bondage** : \- The emperical person, being affected by the relative universe with its  
limitations, passes through various types of experiences, undertakes various  
activities to satisfy his desires on account of his sense of limitedness, and  
goes through joys and sorrows, knowledge and ignorance, birth and death etc,  
according to his karma. This is bondage.   
#. **Liberation** : \- In due course, the emperical person becomes aware of the Supreme Self  
(Atman) within him, always calm and unaffected, the eternal witness, and that  
is his true nature. He gives up attachment to his emperical ego and  
personality. With this realization and identification with the Self, the  
emperical personality disintegrates and the soul (jiva) which was only the  
reflection of the Atman in the limited buddhi, disappears into the Supreme  
Self, its source, just as the reflection of the sun in the bowl of water, when  
the bowl is broken, disappears and the sun alone remains in all its glory.  
This is liberation (mukti).   
\- When an embodied person realizes even while living that the whole universe  
and its beings are manifestations of Brahman, the activities of the psycho-  
physical organism, with which his jiva was associated before the rise of  
jnana, now reflect this liberated state, the jiva remaining identified with  
the Witness Atman instead of the body. It is not affected by the universe, and  
his body functions like an actor in a drama. This is called jivanmkti,  
liberation-while-living.   
\- It is the Brahman which appears to us as all the three : Isvara-Jiva-Jagat.  
One cannot eliminate them as one has not created them. But one can transcend  
them by the realization of Atman-Brahman as one's real Self, by giving up the  
emperical personality - just as though one cannot avoid the effect of  
gravitation on earth, one can transcend it by going beyond its reach. The  
universe and Isvara continues to be there for the other jivas.

**A brief overview of Kashmiri Shaivism** : The non-dual Saiva system of Kashmir is known as Trika-Sasana or Trika-Sastra  
because it is a philosophy of the triad: 1\. Siva   
2\. Sakti   
2\. Nara   
or   
1\. Para (highest)   
2\. Parapara (identity in difference)   
3\. Apara (difference)   
The literature of the Trika system of Kashmir falls into three categories: 1\. Agama Sastra: Considered to be revealation by Siva   
2\. Spanda Sastra: Elaborates the principles laid down in the Siva-Sutras.   
3\. Prayabhijna Sastra: Expounds the Trika philosophy by arguments and  
discussions.   
Siva-Sutras is the most important Agama of the Trika system. This was revealed  
to Vasugupta either towards the last part of 8th century or beginning of the  
9th century.   
The following is the philosophical background of the Siva-Sutras.   
#. **The Utimate Reality** : \- The Ultimate Reality, known as Siva (not the Siva with form) is the non-  
relational consciousness and the changeless principle of all changes.   
\- Siva is referred to as prakasa-vimarsamaya. Prakasa is the eternal light of  
consciousness without which nothing can appear. Vimarsa is that aspect of  
Prakasa by which it knows itself. Vimarsa is Sakti, the svabhava (nature) of  
Siva. Vimarsa is the non-relational immediate awareness of I. Vimarsa is the  
Kartrtva Sakti (power of doership) of Siva.   
#. **The Relative Universe** : \- It is the svabhava or the very nature of the Ultimate Reality to manifest.  
Without manifestation, the Ultimate Reality will be like a non-living thing  
like a stone.   
\- The powers of Parama Siva are: 1\. Cit: This is the power of Self revealation, the changeless principle of  
all changes. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Siva.   
2\. Ananda or Absolute Bliss. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Sakti.   
Cit and Ananda are the very svarupa or nature of Parama Siva. The rest may be  
considered to be his saktis.   
3\. Iccha or Will: In this aspect the Supreme is known as Sadasiva or  
Sadakhya.   
4\. Jnana or Knowledge: In this aspect the Supreme is known as Ishvara.   
5\. Kriya or the power of assuming any or every form: In this aspect the  
Supreme is known as Sadvidya or Suddha Vidya.   
\- The universe is the unmesa (opening out) or prasara (expansion) of the  
Supreme as Sakti.   
The following appears in the course of manifestation.   
\- Tattvas of the Universal Experience: 1\. Siva tattva: It is the initial creative movement (prathama spanda) of  
Parama Siva.   
2\. Sakti tattva: Consciousness is polarized into I (Aham) and This (Idam),  
Subject and Object.   
3\. Sadasiva or Sadakhya Tattva: The will (Iccha) to affirm the This (Idam)  
side of the universal experience. The experience is still hazy (asphuta). At  
this stage, Iccha (Will) is predominant.   
4\. Isvara or Aisvarya tattva: The This (Idam) side of the universal  
experience becomes a little more defined (sphuta). At this stage, jnana or  
knowledge is predominant.   
5\. Sadvidya or Suddhavidya tattva: The I (Aham) and the This (Idam) side of  
the univeral experience are equally balanced. At this stage, kriya sakti is  
predominant.   
Upto this stage of manifestation, the svarupa or the real nature of the divine  
is still not veiled. Hence it is called pure order (suddhadhva).   
\- Tattvas of the Limited Individual Experience: Maya tattva: Now begins the play of Maya tattva. From this stage the ideal  
nature of the divine is veiled. Hence it is called impure order (asuddhadva).   
The products of the Maya are the five coverings: 1\. Kala (kalaa): This reduces the universal authorship (sarvakartratva) of  
the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of  
authorship or efficacy.   
2\. Vidya: This reduces the omniscience (sarvajnatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of knowledge.   
3\. Raga: This reduces the all-satisfaction (purnatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about desire for things.   
4\. Kala (kaala): This reduces the eternity (nityatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of time (past, present  
and future).   
5\. Niyati: This reduces the freedom (svatantrata) and pervasiveness  
(vyapakatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in  
respect of cause, space and form.   
\- Tattvas of the Limited Individual: 1\. Purusa: Siva through Mayasakti limits His universal knowledge and power  
and becomes purusa or individual subject. Purusa is also known as anu.   
2\. Prakrti: Prakrti is the objective manifestation of Siva. Each purusa has a  
different prakrti.   
Prakrti has three gunas: 1\. Sattva (principle of brightness and lightness)   
2\. Rajas (principle of activity)   
3\. Tamas (principle of darkness or inertia)   
\- Tattvas of the Mental Operation: Prakrti differentiates into antahkarana (the psychic apparatus), indriyas  
(senses) and bhutas (matter).   
The Antahkarana consists of the tattvas - Buddhi, Ahamkara and Manas.   
\- Tattvas of the Sensible Experience: All the tattvas of the sensible experience are the products of ahamkara.   
1\. The five powers of sense-perception (jnanendriyas or buddhindriyas) are: (1) Smelling (ghranendriya)   
(2) Tasting (rasanendriya)   
(3) Seeing (caksurindriya)   
(4) Feeling by touch (sparsendriya)   
(5) Hearing (sravanendriya)   
2\. The five powers of actions (karmendriyas) are: (1) Power of speaking (vagindriya)   
(2) Power of handling (hastendriya)   
(3) Power of locomotion (padendriya)   
(4) Power of excreting (payvindriya)   
(5) Power of sexual action and restfulness (upasthendriya)   
3\. The five tanmatras or the primary elements of perception: (1) Sound-as-such (sabda-tanmatra)   
(2) Touch-as-such (sparsa-tanmatra)   
(3) Colour-as-such (rupa-tanmatra)   
(4) Flavour-as-such (rasa-tanmatra)   
(5) Odour-as-such (gandha-tanmatra)   
\- Tattvas of Materiality: The five gross elements or panca-mahabhutas are the product of the five  
tanmatras.   
They are: 1\. Akasa is produced from sabda-tanmatra   
2\. Vayu is produced from sparsa-tanmatra   
3\. Teja (Agni) is produced from rupa-tanmatra   
4\. Apas is produced from rasa-tanmatra   
5\. Prithivi is produced from gandha-tanmatra   
The Individual Self (Jiva): \- Caitanya or Siva forms the very core of the being of every individual. It  
is his real Self.   
\- Physical body (Sthula Sarira): The physical aspect of the individual  
consists of panca mahabhutas. There is also a prana sakti working in him. It  
is by this prana sakti that he is sustained and maintained.   
\- Subtle body (Suksma-Sarira): The antahkarana consisting of manas, buddhi  
and ahamkara together with the five tanmatras form a group of eight, known as  
puryastaka. This forms the subtle body in which the soul leaves the body at  
the time of death.   
\- Kundalini: In each individual, there is a kundalini, which is a form of  
sakti and lies dormant at the base of the spine.   
\- Each individual normally experiences the three states of waking, dreaming  
and deep sleep. Apart from that, there is a fourth state of consciousness  
known as turiya. This is the consciousness of Siva and is pure cidananda.   
#. **Bondage** : The bondage of the individual is due to: \- Innate ignorance or anava mala, due to which Universal Consciousness is  
reduced to an "anu" or a limited creature. It comes about by the limitation of  
the Iccha sakti of the Supreme.   
\- Mayiya mala is the limited condition brought about by Maya. It brings about  
the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of  
the body etc (bhinna vedya pratha). This comes about by the limitation of  
jnana sakti of the Supreme.   
\- Karma mala is the limiting condition brought about by the vasanas or  
residual traces of actions done under the influence of desire. The force of  
these vasanas carries the jiva from one life to another.   
#. **Liberation** : \- Liberation means the recognition (pratyabhijna) of one's true nature which  
means the original, innate pure I-consciousness.   
\- The highest attainment however is that of Siva Consciousness in which the  
entire universe appears as I or Siva. This comes about by Saktipata - the  
descent of Divine Sakti or anugraha (Divine Grace).

Dear silentgreen,   
I am thankful to you for this excellent post, one of those of rare   
excellence that appear in this Forum. In fact, Saiva Siddhantam,   
of South India borrows from Kashmiri Savism and Advaitam. When   
I had been to Tiruvannamalai for 2 days on 19th and 20th, I was   
speaking to Sri J.Jayaraman of the Centenary Library, in the afternoon. He  
said that Saiva Siddantam, Kashmiri Saivism, Veera   
Savism of Karnataka, all borrow the ideas only from advaitam and the  
malaparibagam and iruvinai oppu (i.e. the cleaning of the three   
malas, impurities, ego, kanma (karma) and maya and treating   
the dyads (iru vinai) as same by the sadhaka are the connecting threads for  
these with Advaitam. Both Sri Lalita Sahasranamam and   
Sri Soundarya Lahari of Sri Sankara, touch these aspects. That is why, it is  
said of Sri Sankara that he was an advaiti in heart but   
sakta or saiva siddhanti in practice. Ozhivil Odukkam (Staying   
in the Remains) of Kannudaiya VaLLalar (which Bhagavan has   
quoted in His conversations and also in some of His works) also   
contains these aspects of Saiva Siddhantam/Kashimiri Saivism   
with the ultimate of aim of sadhaka to attain the non dual   
consciousness.   
While Jnana Sambandhar, Tirunavukkarasar and Sundaramurty, leans heavily  
towards Saiva Siddhantam, Saint Manikkavachagar leans heavily towards  
advaitam. Incidentally, one of the theories about Saint Manikkavachagar is  
that he came from North India after throughly understanding various aspects of  
Saivism and then wrote his two works (Tiruvachakam and Tirukovaiyar) with  
accent towards Advaitam. (The Age of Saint Manikkavachagar, by Swami Marai  
Malai AdigaL).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Saiva Siddhantham tells Sivam means Pasupathi. All jivas all are pasu and Siva  
i.e. shiva is pathi. All jivas should reach pathi. means advaitam is not it.  
THEY SAY ERANDARA KLAPPADHU. The same thing Manikkavachkar says and He  
attained in the same way in Chidambaram. I have not studied Thevaram fully.  
Rarely I have a chance of hearing the lectures in the temple.   
Thrumoolar's story was posted by our Subramaniyan ji long time ago. He comes  
under Siddhar lineage. All siddhas are like sufis with medical knowledge. Some  
siddhas do some miracles for the sake of man kind. All their poems talk about  
Almighty, sivam and advaitam. They never follow rituals. In tamil nadu many  
people follow siddhas system.   
Generally people in south say all siddhas are living in Thruvannamalai. Many  
people say during giri valam they can be blessed by siddhas who are present in  
sushma roopam.

**Philosophy of Guru Gorakshanath** : #. **Yoga and Philosophy** : \- The Absolute is variously conceived by various thinkers and they refute  
each other's views. The Absolute Truth, which is the Soul of the universe and  
the Soul of every individual being, unveils its true character to the  
innermost illumined consciousness of a perfect Yogi in the deepest supra-  
intellectual transcendent state of _Samadhi_.   
\- When a Yogi returns from the illumined state of Samadhi to the normal plane  
of phenomenal experience, the deep impression of his Samadhi experience  
exercises a wonderful enlightening influence upon his normal mind and  
intellect and behaviour. The enlightened Yogis become free from all kinds of  
dogmatism and bigotry and narrow outlook. They look upon all men and all  
affairs of the world from a spiritual point of view and live in the world as  
embodiments of the highest wisdom and universal love and compassion.   
\- Gorakhnath was an enlightened Mahayogi, and not a philosopher in the  
commonly accepted meaning of the term. He did not attach any primary  
importance to metaphysical speculations and controversies as a means to the  
realisation of the Ultimate Truth. The ultimate basis of his   
philosophy was his and other enlightened yogis' supramental and supra-  
intellectual experience in the highest _samadhi_ state.   
#. **Ultimate Reality** : \- An enlightened Mahayogi does not require any conception for being sure of  
the validity of his transcendent experience. But he cannot but take the help  
of intellectual conception to explain his experience to others.   
\- Gorakhnath asserts that from the view-point of transcendent experience, in  
which the Absolute Truth reveals Itself in Its perfect self-shining nature and  
the individual consciousness is wholly identified with It, there is no  
question of the origination of the cosmic order with the plurality of  
individual existences, since they are all unified in Its transcendent nature.  
Still for the satisfaction of the rational demand of the people of the normal  
planes of phenomenal experience, this world-process must have to be accounted  
for from the nature of the Absolute Reality, and accordingly an adequate  
intellectual conception of the Absolute has to be formed.   
\- Gorakshanath conceives the Ultimate Reality accordingly as _Para-Sambit_  
with _Nija-Sakti_ ; Absolute Consciousness or Absolute Spirit eternally  
possessed of infinite unique Power for self-expression in the form of a  
boundless phenomenal cosmic order evolving countless orders of finite and  
transitory existences in time and space and also harmonising them into one  
whole.   
#. **How the world originates** : \- The same Absolute Reality viewed as the transcendent self-shining self-  
perfect differenceless and changeless Spirit is _Siva_, and as revealing and  
enjoying Himself freely and eternally in an ever-changing diversified  
phenomenal cosmic order is _Sakti_.   
\- In the ultimate _samadhi_ -Experience in which the cosmic plurality is  
merged in absolute unity He is realised in His transcendent aspect as _Siva_,   
and in the enlightened phenomenal experience in which the cosmic plurality  
appears as an objective reality He is realised in His self-manifesting dynamic  
aspect as _Sakti_. The two aspects are in eternal union.   
\- _Shakti_ is _Sat-Cid-Ananda-mayee Mahasakti_, i.e. self-manifesting self-  
diversifying all-harmonising all-unifying ever-active Dynamic _Sat-Cid-  
Ananda_. The cosmic system is conceived, not as _Cid-Vivarta_, but as _Cid-  
Vilasa_. The Sakti is conceived, not as _avaranavikshepatmika_, but as  
_Prakasa-Vimarsatmika_.   
\- Gorakhnath and his school teach the truth-seekers to appreciate the world  
as _Cid-Vilasa_, as _Saundarya-Lahari_, as _Ananda-Lahari_, and not to  
renounce it out of disgust or to think of it as an evil. Renunciation has to  
be practised for the purpose of the realisation of the Ideal of Absolute  
Sivahood in his Divine World.   
\- Gorakhnath and his school are upholders of _Sat-Karya-Vada_. They  
accordingly hold that before creation the whole world of effects exists in an  
absolutely unmanifested and undifferentiated state in the nature of the Unique  
Power of Siva and that destruction or dissolution consists in the merging of  
all the diversities in the absolute unity of the same Power (Sakti).   
\- The temporal process of creation and dissolution, of evolution and  
involution, has no absolute beginning or end in time.   
\- The self-unfoldment of Divine _Sakti_ is perfectly free and delightful.  
_Sakti 's_ self-unfoldment is described as through five stages, _Nija, Para,  
Apara, Sukshma, Kundalini_.   
\- The gradual self-unfoldment of _Sakti_ within the spiritual transcendent  
nature of the Absolute Spirit, _Siva_, gives birth to the Supreme Spiritual  
Body of _Siva_, called _Parapinda_. The birth of _Parapinda_ means the self-  
manifestation of the Absolute Spirit as the Supreme Individual _Parama  
Purusha_ with the full consciousness of all His eternal infinite glorious  
powers and attributes. The Supra-personal Spirit becomes a perfectly self-  
conscious Personality, _Brahma_ becomes _Iswara_.   
\- The whole universe is conceived by him (Gorakshanath) as one organism  
consisting of countless orders of organisms, one _Samasti-Pinda_ consisting of  
innumerable _Vyasti-Pindas_. This universe is the self-embodiment of the  
Absolute Spirit, _Siva_, by virtue of the Gradual selfunfoldment of His  
_Sakti_.   
\- Gorakhnath describes the _Para-Pinda_ (also known as _Anadi-Pinda_ as well  
as _Adi-Pinda_ ) of Siva as consisting of five forms of spiritual  
consciousness, all shining at the same time without overshadowing each other  
in His all comprehensive Divine consciousness; viz. _Aparamparam, Paramapadam,  
Sunyam, Niranjanam, Paramatma_. _Anadi-Pinda_ is described as having the  
characters of _Paramananda, Prabodha, Cid-udaya, Prakasa, Sohambhava_.   
\- _Siva_ as _Adya-Pinda_, the Cosmic _Purusha_, evolves from within  
Himself, through the further self-unfoldment of His _Sakti_, a Physical  
Cosmic Body, extending in space and changing in time, and makes it an integral  
part of His all-comprehending and all-enjoying Self-Consciousness. The  
universe, which was ideally real in the nature of _Adya-Pinda_, becomes  
physically and objectively real as the Cosmic Body of Siva, and this Body is  
called _Maha-Sakara-Pinda_. Siva with His infinite and eternal _Maha-Sakti_ is  
seen by a Mahayogi as immanent in and revealing Himself through all the  
diversities of this physical order. A Mahayogi looks upon and loves this world  
as the sacred Divine Body.   
\- From _Adya-Pinda_ evolves _Maha-Akasa_, from _Maha-Akasa_ evolves _Maha-  
Vayu_, from _Maha-Vayu_ evolves _Maha Tejas_, from _Maha-Tejas_ evolves  
_Maha-Salila_, from _Maha Salila_, _Maha-Prithwi_. These five Tattwas (Basic  
Elements) are gradual stages of self-unfoldment of the Divine _Sakti_ in more   
and more complex physical forms and they are all organised by the same _Sakti_  
into an unlimited and ever-continuous physical embodiment of _Siva_. To  
Gorakhnath and the Siddha-Yogis, this Physical Cosmic Body is the grossest and  
most complicated and diversified form of free self-manifestation of the  
Absolute Spirit through the gradual self-unfoldment of His infinite and  
eternal Spiritual Power, and hence it is essentially a spiritual entity.   
\- In relation to this Cosmic Order the Supreme Spirit reveals Himself  
principally in the forms of eight Divine Personalities, which are called  
_Ashta-Murti_ of _Maha-Sakara-Pinda_ viz. _Siva, Bhairava, Srikantha,  
SadaSiva, Iswara, Rudra, Vishnu and Brahma_.   
\- In the Cosmic Body of Siva various orders of phenomenal existences are  
gradually evolved, and these are conceived as distinct interrelated worlds or  
_Lokas_.   
1\. First, there is the world of material bodies and physical forces, governed  
by what are known as natural laws. This is _Jada-Jagat_.   
2\. Secondly, there is the world of Life and Vital Forces, governed by  
biological laws. This is _Prana-Jagat_. Life and vital forces are embodied  
with and manifested through material bodies, but life transcends matter and  
exerts regulative influence upon its phenomena.   
3\. Thirdly, there is the world of Mind, _Mano-Jagat_. All phenomena of  
empirical consciousness are expressions of mind. Mental phenomena are  
manifested through living physical bodies, but Mind transcends Matter and Life  
and uses them as its instruments.   
4\. Fourthly, there is the world of Reason or Intelligence, _Buddhi_. Buddhi  
is higher than Mind, and it is manifested in the acts of discriminating  
between valid and invalid knowledge, correct and incorrect thought, and in the  
urge for the attainment of truth. Buddhi exercises a regulative and  
enlightening influence upon Mind. Cosmic Buddhi with Cosmic Manas and Cosmic  
Prana is all-pervading.   
5\. Fifthly, there is a still higher world, the world of Moral Consciousness,  
the world of _Dharma_. Dharma is revealed in the form of some Ideal of  
goodness or righteousness or moral perfection, having the inherent claim to  
regulate and elevate all natural phenomena of matter and life and mind and  
reason towards the Ideal.   
6\. Sixthly, there is the world of _Rasa_, Aesthetic Order. This is specially  
revealed to the Aesthetic Consciousness of man, to which the whole universe is  
a universe of Beauty.   
7\. Seventhly, there is the world of Bliss, _Ananda_. Ananda is the real and  
eternal nature of the Supreme Spirit and it underlies all self manifestations  
of the Spirit.   
To different orders of phenomenal consciousnesses different orders of  
existences are revealed. The infinite richness of Maha-Sakara-Pinda is  
unfathomable. Every world has _adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhoutika_  
aspects.   
\- The plane of _Brahma_ is the lowest and grossest of all and is most closely  
related to the gross world of our sensuous experience. Gorakhnath traces the  
evolution of the individual existences and consciousnesses of this world from  
the Conscious Will ( _Avalokana_ ) of Brahma. This Conscious Will is  
manifested in the form of _Prakriti-Pinda_, from which all individual bodies  
( _Vyasti-Pindas_ ) are evolved. Every individual body is a particularised  
manifestation of _Prakriti-Pinda_ and ultimately of the Cosmic Body of Siva.   
#. **The human body** : \- The human body is realised as an epitome of the entire Cosmic Body of  
_Siva_. It is in and through the human body that the Divine _Sakti_, Who in  
the process of cosmic self-manifestation comes down from the highest  
transcendent spiritual plane of absolute unity and bliss step by step to the  
lowest phenomenal material plane of endless diversities and imperfections,  
ascends again by means of self-conscious processes of _Yoga and Jnana and  
Bhakti_ to the transcendent spiritual plane and becomes perfectly and  
blissfully united with the Supreme Spirit, _Siva_. Man with his developed  
individuality can experience _Siva_ as his own true Soul as well as the true  
Soul of the universe.   
\- From the standpoint of yogtc discipline, Gorakhnath conceives   
the human body as consisting of: 1\. The gross material body called _Bhuta-Pinda_ : The Bhuta-Pinda is constituted of the five gross physical elements,  
purposefully organised by the Creative Will of Brahma with life-power and  
mind-power immanent in the organism and regulating teleologically the  
functions of its various organs.   
2\. The mental body described as _Antaha-Karana-pancaka_ : The individual minds are individualised self-manifestations of the Cosmic Mind  
in relation to and apparent dependence upon individual living bodies. Every  
individual human mind is manifested in five forms according to functions, viz.  
_Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara, Chitta and Caitanya_.   
3\. _Kula-pancaka_ : Kula is here interpreted by Gorakhnath as the forces which exercise their  
directive influence from behind the scene upon the psychophysical phenomena  
and give special inclinations and aptitudes to them It is conceived as of five  
forms, viz. _Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Kala and Jeeva_.   
4\. _Vyaktipancaka_ : Vyakti pancaka refer to the five forms of self-expression of the individual  
mind and they are classified as _Iccha, Kriya, Maya, Prakriti and Vak_. The  
forms of Vak are _Para, Pasyanti, Madhyama, Vaikhari and Matrika_.   
5\. _Pratyaksha_ : By pratyaksha-Karana Gorakhnath indicates the efficient and material causes  
which practically contribute to the maintenance and development and also  
renewal of the indvidual body. He enumerates then as, _Kama, Karma, Candra,  
Surya and Agni_.   
6\. _Nadi-samsthana_ : The knowledge of Nadi-Samsthana or the nervous system is of great importance  
to yogis. Of countless Nadis, ten are specially mentioned. Of these, three are  
highly important, viz. _Ida, Pingala and Sushumna_. Sushumna is the most  
important from yogic view-point.   
7\. _Dasa-Vayu_ : Vayu or Prana-Sakti is essentially one, but it is conceived as tenfold,  
according to different functions it performs in different parts of the living  
organism. Of the tenfold Vayu, _Prana and Apana_ are of special importance for  
yogic discipline.   
#. **The esoteric aspects of human body** : \- For the purpose of attaining true enlightenment about the inner nature of  
the sacred human body, Gorakhnath regards it essential to acquire insight into  
nine _cakras_, sixteen _adharas_, three _lakshyas_, five _vyomans_.   
\- The nine _cakras_ are conceived as different stations in the central  
Sushumna-Nadi, which is called _Brahma-Marga_. These are centres of psycho-  
vital forces and indicate different planes of esoteric experience in the path  
of yogic discipline. Cakras are enumerated by Gorakhnath somewhere as nine and  
somewhere as seven. The _Kundalini Sakti_, the Supreme Divine Power, lies  
sleeping like a coiled serpent in the lowest _Muladhara Cakra_ of every human  
body, becomes awakened with the awakenment of the spiritual consciousness of  
every individual, rises step by step through yogic discipline to higher and  
higher Cakras (higher and higher planes of spiritual illumination), blesses  
individual consciousness with various kinds of occult experiences and  
miraculous powers in the particular Cakras, and finally ascends to the highest  
Cakra, the plane of the perfect blissful union of Sakti with Siva or Brahma,  
in which the individual consciousness becomes absolutely united with Universal  
Consciousness, the Absolute _Sat-Cid-ananda_.   
\- After describing the Cakras, Gorakhnath describes what he calls _Adharas_  
and for the students of Yoga he enumerates them as sixteen. By Adharas he  
refers to the principal seats of the vital and psychical functions, which have  
to be brought under control and then transcended by means of appropriate  
methods of yogic discipline.   
\- Having given lessons on the sixteen Adharas, Gorakhnath imparts instruction  
on the three kinds of _Lakshyas_, internal and external and non-located.  
Lakshya means an object upon which a yogi should fix his attention temporarily  
for practising concentration of psychovital energy with the ultimate view of  
elevating it to the highest spiritual plane.   
\- Lastly, Gorakhnath gives lessons on _Vyoma_ or _Akasa_ or _Sunya_, which,  
though really one, he enumerates as five for the sake of the practice of  
concentration.

\-- _continued from previous post (Philosophy of Guru Gorakshanath)_. ...   
#. **Individual Soul** : \- The individual soul and the individual body are both phenomenal self-  
manifestations of the transcendent Supreme Spirit. The soul is evidently a  
spiritual manifestation, and the body is a physical manifestation.   
\- The soul is distinguished not only from the physical body, but also from  
life, mind, ego, intellect, moral and aesthetic consciousness, and even  
spiritual consciousness. It is self-luminous witness to them, the innermost  
dynamic centre of all their operations, and it realises and enjoys itself in  
and through them.   
\- The individual soul is ultimately one with Siva, the Supreme Spirit, Who in  
His phenomenal cosmic play freely enjoys Himself as the plurality of  
individual souls in relation to the various orders of individual bodies.   
\- The souls are not really touched by the joys and sorrows and bondages and  
limitations and changes of the respective individual bodies. So long as  
_Avidya_ or Ignorance prevails over the phenomenal consciousness, these are  
falsely attributed to the souls.   
#. **Liberation** : \- As a yogi draws upward in a systematic way his psycho-vital energy to  
higher and higher **adharas** and **cakras** and concentrates his  
consciousness upon deeper truths unveiled therein, the individual body is  
gradually realised as liberated from the grossness and impurity and spatio-  
temporal limitations and imperfections of its normal material nature and hence  
as a true spiritual entity. When the consciousness is adequately refined and  
illumined, the whole is experienced in every part, the entire cosmic system is  
experienced in every individual body, Maha-Sakara-Pinda is realised in Vyasti-  
Pinda. This realisation of the Cosmic Body in the individual body is called by  
Gorakhnath the true knowledge of the body ( **Pinda-Sambitti** ).   
\- The realisation of **Atma** or the true Self is conceived as the real  
nature of transcendent experience and the essential nature of **Moksha**. The  
perfect realisation of Sivahood or Brahmahood by the individual soul through  
yoga is the Supreme Ideal.

## Re:[8]Prakasha and Vimarsha  
Author: silentgreen         Date: August 03, 2010, 02:00:20 PM  
---  
**Prakasha and Vimarsha**   
The first aspect of Absolute Consciousness is **Prakasha**. _Prakasha_ is the  
Light of Consciousness, the pure luminosity, the unchanging ground and essence  
of everything that appears. Everything appears as their own specific nature,  
but it is made apparent by the Light of Consciousness, and it has the Light of  
Consciousness as their source.   
The universe is nothing but the shining of the Light of Consciousness within  
itself. This is an important statement, as nothing exists outside of it.  
Consciousness becomes manifest in the radiant vibration of this Light.  
Although shining as all things, and creating diversity, there is no division  
within itself. A created object just has a form it assumes, and is not a  
separate entity.   
The second aspect of Absolute Consciousness is **Vimarsha**, self-awareness,  
or the act of reflective awareness. In an entity, thought-constructs obscure  
the light of the subjects' immediate perception. Thus its awareness shifts  
from pure consciousness to objective consciousness. Thus we experience the  
objective world. it is an awareness of the images that appear within the  
mirror of Light.   
Consciousness must reflect back on itself to know itself and what appears  
within it. _Vimarsha_, or self-awareness, is the power of consciousness by  
virtue of which it can understand or perceive itself, and examine the events  
that occur within it. Through this awareness, the Light knows itself to be the  
sole reality and so rests in itself. It enjoys perfect freedom and it is  
satisfied in the knowledge that it is all that exists, be it subject, object  
or means of knowledge.   
We often talk here in terms of universal consciousness, but the same holds  
true for individual I-consciousness ( _Aham_ ), which is formed by the powers  
of the Absolute. By contemplating its own nature, consciousness assumes the  
form of all the planes of existence from the subtlest to the most gross. The  
power of reflection is thus the inherent creative freedom of the Light of  
Consciousness to either turn in on itself introspectively and be free of its  
outer forms, or move out of itself to view its outer manifestations. In  
harmony with the oscillation (Spanda) of awareness between these two  
polarities, the universe of manifestation is incessantly renewed and is the  
essence of the vitality of its pulsation.   
Individual and universal consciousness are not two separate things, they are  
one. The same process operates in both. The only difference between them is  
that in the case of individual consciousness, these processes are restricted  
or limited representations of the maximally expanded operation of universal  
consciousness.

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
That shows how much humble and simple person you are sir.   
Humility is very much required in our sadhana and we all are part of  
bhagavan's family and one and the same.   
Indeed main purpose of this forum i feel is to help us to iradicate ignorance

Its called Sangha. In Buddhism.   
A Community where people help each other.   
So in such a community if there are two people who are both in the path,   
if one of them is making a mistake, the other can point it out to him and  
correct.   
since both are trying to learn, the other person quickly picks it up and  
corrects himself.   
so when someone shows ego, the other quickly corrects and vice versa.   
And thus, following the Path, both get liberated.   
Physically they help each other. Intellectually they help each other and most  
importantly they help each other purify their minds.   
Sangam Sharanam gachami. .. They sing.   
We call it sat sangh.... I consider Ramana also as a part of this group.   
He sits silent, but perhaps responds through others at places.   
Love!

Kannappa offered one eye to Shiva. Shiva's 2nd eye also started bleeding.Is it  
a test for Kannappa whether he offers his 2nd eye to Him. It means God wants  
complete deattachment from body and mind.   
He gives everything to man and takes back one by one slowly. When man becomes  
old, first his heir becomes white then eye, teeth, ears at last his taste.  
Still man's mind does not to surrender.   
Those are so lucky who gets this awakening.

Saint Kannappar was called Thinnan by his parents. He came from   
the forest hunters' family. Thinnan means one who is strong. He   
was also called Kannan, because he had beautiful eyes. The eyes   
were giving him self pride and it was the ego. So Siva wanted to   
test his ego. So, through that drama in Sri Kalahasti, He wanted   
Thinnan's eyes. This is god's play to eradicate the ego. The egoless state  
is liberation.   
In one more story of Periya Puranam, Siva wanted the long lushy   
black hairs of a devotee's daugther. Mind you, this girl was to be   
married next day! The daughter and the father agreed. Her head   
was tonsured and the long hairs were given to Siva who came as a bhairva  
sannyasi, who wanted to make his sacred thread out of this hairs! As soon as  
the daughter gave the hair, with the consent of her would be bridegroom (he  
was also a Siva devotee), Siva appeared before them. The hairs grew in no  
time and she got married.   
The conquest of the devotee's most desired possession is the sport of Siva.  
This is snapping of the ego. In Arunachala Puranam,   
again a bhairava sannyasi wanted a harlot for the night, as he used to have  
sex only once in a year. The king sent word for the harlots   
but none were available for the evening. The king was in a state of fix. The  
queen offered herself to go to bed with the sannyasi!   
When the sannyasi entered the room and sat on the bed, and when   
the queen approached him, Siva became a child. The childless   
royal couple got a child for them. Even today Annamalaiyar does   
annual death ceremonies for this couple and there is a function for this.   
{My wife read this story first, she exclaimed: Siva is the most   
horrendous rascal....}   
Incidentally, what prasanth wrote about the ego nature of Kannappa   
from Muruganar's song is correct. The first paragraph is that story.   
Arunachala Siva.
