Why O is O, 1 is 1, 2 is 2 etc.,?   
These numbers are called Arabic algorithms. Roman algorithms   
which came later is 0, I, II, III, IV, V etc.,   
Arabians fixed the forms of these numbers with some hidden   
principles.   
I want mathematical wizards in the Forum to respond.

I heard indians are the first people who invented numbers. Especially 0.  
Sometimes I will the 0 has many meanings apart from mathematics.   
In day to day life if a person does not have common sense others say he is  
zero. means he does not has sense.   
On the other hand in spiritual field it is called sunyam and some people  
practice for this sunyata.   
But for me the same zero looks like a complete one. i.e. purnam., From, this  
purnam only all starts and we have to come to the end ( purnam) i,e,   
completion. All planets look like zero means it is a complete one. If you  
start from a bindu and try to join the bindu we reach where we started. The  
joining is looks like a journey.   
The bindu also has great meaning in our hindu culture. Lalitha thripurasundari  
is called bindu vasini, in sri vidya cult. From Her i.e. from bindu jivas are  
taking journey and if jivas are careful to join the bindu i.e. Goddess then we  
become purnam. There are so many meanings hidden in this zero.
