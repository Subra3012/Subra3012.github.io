**Six Lessons On Raja-Yoga   
Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses  
God alone is our goal. Failing to reach God, we die.   
Three things are necessary to the student who wishes to succeed.   
**First. Give up all ideas of enjoyment in this world and the next, care only  
for God and Truth.** We are here to know truth, not for enjoyment. Leave that  
to brutes who enjoy as we never can. Man is a thinking being and must struggle  
on until he conquers death, until he sees the light. He must not spend himself  
in vain talking that bears no fruit. Worship of society and popular opinion is  
idolatry. **The soul has no sex, no country, no place, no time.**   
Second. Intense desire to know Truth and God. Be eager for them, long for  
them, as a drowning man longs for breath. Want only God, take nothing else,  
let not "seeming" cheat you any longer. Turn from all and seek only God.   
Third. The six trainings: First -- restraining the mind from going outward.  
Second -- restraining the senses. Third -- turning the mind inward. Fourth --  
suffering everything without murmuring. Fifth -- fastening the mind to one  
idea. Take the subject before you and think it out; never leave it. Do not  
count time. Sixth -- think constantly of your real nature. Get rid of  
superstition. Do not hypnotise yourself into a belief in your own inferiority.  
Day and night tell yourself what you really are, until you realise (actually  
realise) your oneness with God.   
Without these disciplines, no results can be gained.   
We have to go beyond sense limit and transcend even reason, and we have the  
power to do this.   
 **Ignorance, fickleness, jealousy, laziness, and excessive attachment are the  
great enemies to success in Yoga practice.** The three great requisites are: First. Purity, physical and mental; all uncleanness, all that would draw the  
mind down, must be abandoned.   
Second. Patience: At first there will be wonderful manifestations, but they  
will all cease. This is the hardest period, but hold fast; in the end the gain  
is sure if you have patience.   
Third. Perseverance: Persevere through thick and thin, through health and  
sickness, never miss a day in practice.   
 **Talk as little as possible.**   
Keep your thoughts on virtue; what we think we tend to become.   
This Yoga is known as the eightfold Yoga, because it is divided into eight  
principal parts. These are: First -- Yama. This is most important and has to govern the whole life; it has  
five divisions:  _1st. Not injuring any being by thought, word, or deed.   
2nd. Non - covetousness in thought, word, or deed.   
3rd. Perfect chastity in thought, word, or deed.   
4th. Perfect truthfulness in thought, word, or deed.   
5th. Non - receiving of gifts. _   
Second -- Niyama. The bodily care, bathing daily, dietary, etc.   
Third -- Asana, posture. Hips, shoulders, and head must be held straight,  
leaving the spine free.   
Fourth -- pranayama, restraining the breath (in order to get control of the  
Prana or vital force).   
Fifth -- Pratyahara, turning the mind inward and restraining it from going  
outward, revolving the matter in the mind in order to understand it.   
Sixth -- Dharana, concentration on one subject.   
Seventh -- Dhyana, meditation.   
Eighth -- Samadhi, illumination, the aim of all our efforts.   
Pranayama has three parts: 1st. Puraka -- inhaling.   
2nd. Kumbhaka -- restraining.   
3rd. Rechaka -- exhaling.   
Before we can control the mind we must study it.   
We have to seize this unstable mind and drag it from its wanderings and fix it  
on one idea. Over and over again this must be done. By power of will we must  
get hold of the mind and make it stop and reflect upon the glory of God.   
 **The easiest way to get hold of the mind is to sit quiet and let it drift  
where it will for a while. Hold fast to the idea, "I am the witness watching  
my mind drifting. The mind is not I." Then see it think as if it were a thing  
entirely apart from yourself. Identify yourself with God, never with matter or  
with the mind.**   
Picture the mind as a calm lake stretched before you and the thoughts that  
come and go as bubbles rising and breaking on its surface. Make no effort to  
control the thoughts, but watch them and follow them in imagination as they  
float away. This will gradually lessen the circles. For the mind ranges over  
wide circles of thought and those circles widen out into ever - increasing  
circles, as in a pond when we throw a stone into it. We want to reverse the  
process and starting with a huge circle make it narrower until at last we can  
fix the mind on one point and make it stay there. Hold to the idea, "I am not  
the mind, I see that I am thinking, I am watching my mind act", and each day  
the identification of yourself with thought and feeling will grow less, until  
at last you can entirely separate yourself from the mind and actually know it  
to be apart from yourself.   
When this is done, the mind is your servant to control as you will. The first  
stage of being a Yogi is to go beyond the senses. When the mind is conquered,  
he has reached the highest stage.   
The body is the objective view of what we call mind (subjective). We, the  
Self, are beyond both body and mind; we are "Atman", the eternal, unchangeable  
witness. The body is crystallised thought.   
Do not let the thoughts grasp you; stand aside, and they will die away.   
 **Follow these holy thoughts; go with them; and when they melt away, you will  
find the feet of the Omnipotent God. This is the superconscious state; when  
the idea melts, follow it and melt with it.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda on Raja Yoga

On Raja-Yoga   
Volume 6, Notes Of Class Talks And Lectures   
The first stage of Yoga is Yama.   
To master Yama five things are necessary:  **1) Non - injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.   
2) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed.   
3) Non - covetousness in thought, word, and deed.   
4) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.   
5) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.**   
Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it. Then comes  
Asana, or posture, of a devotee. The seat must be firm, the head, ribs, and  
body in a straight line, erect. Say to yourself that you are firmly seated,  
and that nothing can move you. Then mention the perfection of the body, bit by  
bit, from head to foot. Think of it as being clear as crystal, and as a  
perfect vessel to sail over the sea of life.   
Pray to God and to all the prophets and saviors of the world and holy spirits  
in the universe to help you.   
Then for half an hour practice Pranayama or the suspending, restraining, and  
controlling of the breath, mentally repeating the word Om as you inhale and  
exhale the breath. Words charged with spirit have wonderful power.   
The other stages of Yoga are: (1) Pratyahara or the restraint of the organs of  
sense   
from all outward things, and directing them entirely to mental impressions;  
(2) Dharana or steadfast concentration; (3) Dhyana or meditation; (4) Samadhi  
or abstract meditation. It is the highest and last stage of Yoga. Samadhi is  
perfect absorption of thought into the Supreme Spirit, when one realises, "I  
and my Father are one."   
Do one thing at a time and while doing it put your whole soul into it to the  
exclusion of all else.

Q: Why did the All-merciful God create pain in this world?

never attempt to attain salvation if there had not been any pain in this

Q: How can I know whether I have purity of mind or not?   
A: If you have Vairagya (dispassion or indifference to sensual enjoyments),  
that is a sign of Chitta Suddhi or purity of mind. No sensual desires or  
Vasanas will arise in the mind.   
Q: What is the purpose of God creating the world?   
A: This is a transcendental question or Atiprasna. You will know the purpose  
when you attain Self-realisation or Brahma Jnana. The finite mind that is  
conditioned in time, space and causation cannot get an answer to a question  
that relates to transcendental matters.   
Q: What is the use of repeating the Mantra again and again?   
A: It gives force. It intensifies the spiritual Samskaras.   
Q: When I concentrate, so many thoughts arise in my mind. How can I avoid  
them? Can I suppress them?   
A: Do not try to suppress them with force. The thoughts will manifest with  
redoubled force. They will rise up frequently also. You will tax your will and  
waste your energy. Be a silent witness of these thoughts. Say unto yourself: "I have no concern with these thoughts." Be indifferent. All useless worldly  
thoughts will die by themselves.   
Q: How to prevent bad dreams?   
A: Study any religious book. Meditate for half an hour just before retiring to  
bed. You will have no bad dreams.   
Q: What are the signs of a person who has no Ahamkara or egoism?   
A: He will not identify himself with his body. He will be free from pride,  
likes, dislikes, jealousy, anger and hypocrisy.   
Q: Why does evil exist in the world?   
A: Change the angle of vision or Drishti. All evils will disappear. Evil is  
negative good. Evil exists to glorify good. It has a raison d'etre, reason for  
its existence. Evil and good are relative terms. What is good at one time is  
evil at another time. What is good for one is evil for another. Understand  
this and become wise. Behold the one Atman in all forms and beings. Evil and  
good are mental creations. Transmute evil into good by Atma-Drishti. There is  
good in evil also.   
Q: How to lead the life of unity?   
A: This is attained by service, charity, sharing what you have with others,  
cultivating cosmic love and realising the one Atman seated in the hearts of  
all, through constant Brahmachintana or meditation on Atman.

## Reply to Marjan's Personal Message  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 31, 2008, 03:01:19 PM

Dear Marjan, Bhagavad Gita commentary by A.C. Prabhupada,   
the founder of ISKCON movement is a Krishana-advaiti. That is,   
he believes in One without a second, but that One is Krishna!   
This where the trouble starts. When Sankara said that there is One   
without a second, Sri Ramanuja said that the One is Narayana and   
Sri Madhva that the One is Krishna. Saiva Siddhantis say that the One   
is Siva. This is how Philosophy gave in to Religion.   
So, in Atharva Veda and Gopala Tapani Upanishad, the Brahman is   
called as Krishna. Prabhupada said the same thing.   
But what is there in a name, Marjan? The rose is always a rose,   
in whatever name you call it. Names and forms do differ, but the Self   
remains the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 ISKCON does not really appreciate calling Krishna as the one.   
To them Krishna is different from Ganesha, Hanuman, Kali or Siva. So one who  
worships one of these other deities is supposed to be not on the correct way.   
And they believe that Advaita is wrong sankara was, they believe, siva  
trying to cheat us all by preaching advaita and not preaching dvaita /  
vishishta advaita.   
I have some friends who follow ISKCON!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, if Krishna is different from Ganesa, Siva,   
Uma and Skanda, then Krishna is not One without a   
second. If there is more than one, why not someone   
else going for the second or third or fourth? This is   
where Philosophy was interpreted as religion and   
then the whole lot of trouble started.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Vaishnavaites do not have a separate concept   
of Ganesa. They have got a deity called Thumbikkai Azhwar,   
who is the foremost devotee of Narayana, a devotee with   
a trunk like elephant! Do not laugh. In Srirangam, Tamil   
Nadu, you can see a sculpture of him!   
Arunachala Siva.
