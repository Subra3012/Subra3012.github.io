Dear Marjan, Bhagavad Gita commentary by A.C. Prabhupada,   
the founder of ISKCON movement is a Krishana-advaiti. That is,   
he believes in One without a second, but that One is Krishna!   
This where the trouble starts. When Sankara said that there is One   
without a second, Sri Ramanuja said that the One is Narayana and   
Sri Madhva that the One is Krishna. Saiva Siddhantis say that the One   
is Siva. This is how Philosophy gave in to Religion.   
So, in Atharva Veda and Gopala Tapani Upanishad, the Brahman is   
called as Krishna. Prabhupada said the same thing.   
But what is there in a name, Marjan? The rose is always a rose,   
in whatever name you call it. Names and forms do differ, but the Self   
remains the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 ISKCON does not really appreciate calling Krishna as the one.   
To them Krishna is different from Ganesha, Hanuman, Kali or Siva. So one who  
worships one of these other deities is supposed to be not on the correct way.   
And they believe that Advaita is wrong sankara was, they believe, siva  
trying to cheat us all by preaching advaita and not preaching dvaita /  
vishishta advaita.   
I have some friends who follow ISKCON!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, if Krishna is different from Ganesa, Siva,   
Uma and Skanda, then Krishna is not One without a   
second. If there is more than one, why not someone   
else going for the second or third or fourth? This is   
where Philosophy was interpreted as religion and   
then the whole lot of trouble started.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Vaishnavaites do not have a separate concept   
of Ganesa. They have got a deity called Thumbikkai Azhwar,   
who is the foremost devotee of Narayana, a devotee with   
a trunk like elephant! Do not laugh. In Srirangam, Tamil   
Nadu, you can see a sculpture of him!   
Arunachala Siva.
