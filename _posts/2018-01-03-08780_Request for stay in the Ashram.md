Hello!   
I have been requesting for a visit to the ashram but I have been declined  
twice! The second time, it almost sounded rude! Please help me! I want to  
visit the ashram. I am from Bangalore, India.   
Can anyone help me? Any date is fine with me. Thanks!

You can visit Ramanasramam any day you wish as convenient to you.I would  
suggest Adhithi Ashram for accomodation.

Anyone can visit the Ashram but for stay you need to get a prior written  
permission. If you get a negative reply them it means you need to apply  
again at some other time. Right now it is peak season for the Ashram and it  
will be like this till Mid March. Try requesting a date in later part of  
March.
