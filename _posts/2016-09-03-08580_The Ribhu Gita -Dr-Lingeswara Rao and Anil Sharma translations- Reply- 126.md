Chapter 14: 1. Ribhu: Hearken! All is Brahman alone. This is the truth, verily the truth in the name of   
Siva. In the certitude of the Self, O chief of the Yogis, there is no other  
even in the least.   
2. The unreality is infinitesimal. All this is infinitesimal for sure. The body too is infinitesimal   
for sure. The body too is infinitesimal. There is no other even the least.   
3\. All is only the Self, the pure Self. All is consciousness alone without a  
second; the eternal,   
pure taint-less Self. There is no other even in the least.   
4\. If the Self is thought of as infinitesimal, all is not even an atom.  
Absence of thought is only an atom.   
There is no other even in the least.   
5. Thought is only consciousness. Consciousness is the paramount state. Bliss is the supreme   
measure. This, which is visible is nothing at all.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
