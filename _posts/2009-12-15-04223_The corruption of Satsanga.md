## The corruption of Satsanga  
Author: Graham              Date: December 15, 2009, 01:28:19 AM

The real meaning of Satsang is 'association with the Wise', preferably the  
Self-realised Sages (Jnani's) who speak only of God and fully practice dharma  
(righteousness), though Sages who are not yet Self-realised, but live  
according to the rules of dharma are also considered to be Wise. Association  
with the wise is said to be the root-cause of all that is good.   
Jnani's are dharma personified, they NEVER stray from it, even for a split  
second. They are identical with God and nothing is beyond them. They know the  
world to be an illusion and have little or no interest in it. They do not seek  
to accumulate wealth or property, they are not interested in fame or acquiring  
followers. They do not advertise nor entice others to advertise for them - God  
does not need to advertise, He is the soul of everything.   
Just before Bhagavan left the body, Chadwick and others approached Him and  
asked Him how they could repay Him, should they write books, tell the world  
about Him, etc. He replied " **Put my teachings into practice** ".   
Today the word 'satsang' is widely used to promote what can only be described  
as talking-shops (the opposite of satsang), where self-appointed gurus  
pontificate about subjects they know little or nothing about, manufacture  
their own poisoned theories, indulge in cheap psychology and pursue their  
vices. They also expect you to pay for all of this in every possible way.   
It is also widely used for meditation sessions, but this is not true satsang  
by any stretch of the imagination.   
The primary requisite for those seeking self-realisation is the ability to  
discriminate between that which is useful and that which is useless/harmful in  
the search. Becoming attached to the wrong person or group can do immeasurable  
harm, not only in life in general, but can also disturb and even destroy  
budding faith; it is therefore imperative that caution is exercised in every  
possible way.   
You must carefully weigh up everything that you see and hear. Clear teachings  
are available from the publications of Sri Ramanasramam and ancient scriptures  
such as - Tripura Rahasya, The Srimad Bhagavata, Advaita Bodha Deepika, Yoga  
Vasistha Sara, The Bhagavad Gita, Ribhu Gita, etc. If what you hear is  
contrary in any way to the essence of these works, then do not return.   
People were attracted to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi by his purity and  
simplicity. Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong. But also bear in mind that it is fairly  
easy to fake the outer appearance of a jnani, but it is impossible to fake the  
ananda (peace) or power that was experienced in his presence.   
In the late 1990's I saw a website that listed all of the 'known' Jnani's and  
their so-called 'lineage'. It started with Ramana Maharshi who apparently  
transferred Self-realisation to H.W.L. Poonja, who in turn (if I remember  
correctly) tranferred it to 300+ others with lots more to follow. We all fell  
on the floor with laughter upon reading this. .... what is there to transfer  
and from whom to whom? If it can be transferred then it was not there in the  
first place, is not permanent and not worth the effort.   
Unfortunately they have not gone away, Tiruvannamalai is plastered with  
posters advertising these people during the winter months.   
God, Guru and Self are one and the same. True satsang is therefore association  
with the Self and that does not require anyone else.

Initially when i came across advaita vedanta, my search continued even after  
reading Ramana's works. In time, and also in comparing other teachers to  
Bhagavan, i was drawn back into his teaching. Most others simply do not  
compare. "Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong." This is the best advice i have heard in  
regards to finding a realized teacher.

Dear Adam,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan is the yardstick for measurement of other teachers. I find  
most of them do not even come up to His waist. A few months back, I came  
across an advertisement in news paper.   
"Self Realization in two days. Join immediately." I could not help   
laughing. I am also sympathizing with the people who rush for   
such courses.

Today's Gurus are no doubt Good speakers but there is less Dharma in their own  
day to day life but then again it comes back to people i.e how many people  
live Dharmic life ? Gurus emerge only from those set of people.

Association of the wise is highly recommended by almost every spiritual source  
I've read. The problem is here in the West where is it to be found?   
I don't know how good an idea it is to attend just anything that calls itself  
"Satsang". And even beyond that I had thought of attending,say, a Greek  
Orthodox mass just to be silent and in the company of more spiritually minded  
people rather than worldly people, but that was unsuccessful on many levels. I  
live near Portland Oregon in the US and it has many MANY eastern spiritual  
groups to choose from, even relatively smaller groups (for here) like Meher  
Baba or Radha Soami, but there is no group for Ramana which strikes me as odd.  
Anyway, I would be curious as to any advice on "keeping the company of the  
wise" in the western world. It is very difficult.

Nisargadatta addresses this in I AM THAT, the question and answer format is  
informative and speaks on many levels. If I remember right, He says as long  
as the devotee is earnest, the devotee may find another guru which can be like  
a mile marker who points the way. There are other examples also--devotees not  
earnest enough, moving from one guru to another, etc., to make one blanket  
statement for all seems to be foolhardy, although Reality is One, mankind is  
varied, along with the needs.

I just came back here to mention that I did discover there is one closer to  
me. I had recently done a massive google search looking for places close by  
for possible satsang, but the keywords I used were "satsang", "Hinduism",  
"Advaita" and so on. But once I used the exact term "Chinmaya mission" I found  
there was one (60 miles away, but definitely closer than Chicago!) ;-)   
Anyway, thanks again.

I've similar sentiments also Graham. I've at times wandered out to see  
"teachers".....the pain of it!   
Some were blatantly feeding their egoic desires, others weren't aware that  
their ego continued to run the show. None radiated the perfection of Maharshi.   
Darshan of the Supreme can be had by keeping the outward-rushing mind fixed  
within.

Dear James   
I disagree with you. Your wander will lead you to a realized jnani sooner or  
later. Go ahead and take the pains to search a teacher. Ask all whom you  
encounter. Knock the doors. one door will open for the dawn of light.   
But keep one thing in mind and strike out as a rule of thumb before even  
visiting this particular group -- who charges money for satsang, who offers  
re-treat, who offers workshops (paid workshops). And again who offers 'no  
practice', who offers instant enlightenment experience by way of  
advertisement.   
But leaving aside the above, you have to search all other teachers.   
From my own experience, let me tell this, realization is the result of grace  
of a teacher than anything else.   
If your search did not yield a teacher in this life, it will give you enough  
punyas that will be continuing in the next life to meet your Guru.   
I am talking about Guru in flesh and blood.   
You can conduct this search even while keeping your self enquiry and faith in  
Bhagavan Ramana firm. there is no conflict here.   
Our Atma Guru, the Guru of all Gurus, Bhagavan Sri Ramana and Arunachala will  
definitely be the guiding inner light in this search. And the time spent in  
Maharish's ashram, in and around Arunachala will definitely be the equivalent  
of a living teacher even now. So obviously another option is, to abandon the  
search and stick to Ramana alone. that will also definitely work but a bit  
more hard work is needed. Because the requisite power comes from formless Self  
which is Arunachala Ramana.

Yes. 'The last thought' is the key to the issue. This is what Chadwick also

Nagaraj/Silentgreen/Friends,   
I thought of posting it in the Rough Note Book Thread but then decided that i  
will post it here.This is to emphasize that Prayer and devotional  
singing,chanting the Divine name with Faith and Devotion -all these have  
tremendous potency and cannot be overlooked by any devotee however  
advanced.For the simple, childlike soul,nothing more is needed.Whatever has to  
unfold will happen.   
Quote

> directed upon the very source itself.

Yes indeed.This is the Natural Progression or deepening that Sri Bhagavan has  
expounded in the Upadesa saram.Unfortunately it is misinterpreted by some-as  
if those are preparatory or auxiliary,indirect means- involving subject and  
Object and that only self-enquiry is the perfect Nondual approach and so on  
and so forth.I do not subscribe to this later view.I view it as a progressive  
inward turning of the mind,becoming subtler and subtler as it sheds its Gross  
aspect,until the attention is folded back towards the source of the 'i'  
thought,where the 'i' is disassociated from objects-Like what sri Bhagavan has  
mentioned as tracing the scent of the Master.This Scent is known and yet  
unknown!If it is totally unknown,one cannot seek it and find it;if it is  
totally known one need not seek it in the first place!   
coming to what Nagaraj has mentioned in the above quote regarding singing a  
song and continuin enquiry,this is how Sri Ramakrishna explains it,as usual in  
his inimitable way.An excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> "What Brahman is cannot be described. Speech stops there. In the kirtan the  
> singers at first sing: 'My Nitai dances like a mata hati.' As they become  
> more and more ecstatic, they can hardly utter the whole sentence. They sing  
> only: 'Hati! Hati!' As their mood deepens they sing only: 'Ha! Ha!' At last  
> they cannot sing even that; they become completely unconscious."   
> As the Master spoke these words, he himself became transfixed in samadhi. He  
> was standing.   
> Regaining consciousness of the world, he said, "That which is beyond both  
> kshara and akshara cannot be described."   
> The devotees sat in silence.  
Yes,I agree as silentgreen has rightly mentioned that Contemplating on Sri  
Ramakrishna(his life) is just the right thing to do to imbibe the spirit of  
that simple yet potent Prayer.This is the reason why we chant the Hymns of the  
Great ones.It carries the spirit and power of the Great one who composed it.We  
have Lord Jesus 'Lord's Prayer'.The simpler the Prayer,the easier it is for us  
to tune ourselves.   
Namaskar.

Dear Graham Sir,   
THis refers to your article on self enquiry. Else where I have asked some  
additional clarification and here I am requesting something additional.In the  
article, you have mentioned various stages of self enquiry with particular  
importance given to the retaining of self attention even in the midst of  
different experiences during the practice.   
What happens if in this lifetime we are unable to reach upto the last stage or  
for that matter, what if we just about climb the ladder?Kindly revert on this.   
Elsewhere we have agreed that the Lord always uplifts us and we commence from  
where we lift off?But it would be reassuring if there are some words from  
Bhagavan also on this. Has someone asked Bhagavan about this and has he  
replied on this.   
Thanks,Anand Sundaram.

Dear friends,   
While I would like Graham Sir to respond to this particularly, I would like  
others also to revert.   
In all posts when any member expresses despondency on his method of sadhana or  
lack of progress, members particularly here say dont worry Bhagavan will take  
care.   
This wording of the assurance has always been a bit perplexing for me, since  
Bhagavan is no more in the flesh. I think this is to be understood as the  
supreme Brahman is overseeing our progress and the supreme is none other than  
and no different than the Bhagavan who was in the flesh from 1879 -1950.Or is  
it that, Bhagavan who existed in the flesh from 1879 - 1950 is now bodiless  
but still exists as the Bhagavan of old blessing and guiding all those who  
take his name or remember him - whileat the same time being no different from  
the Supreme Brahman that makes all things move. I will be happy if you can  
revert independently along with of course our beloved Graham Sir as to how  
to understand this statement.   
Thanks,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Graham Sir,   
Thanks for reverting.   
Dear Ravi Sir,   
I view Arunachala as the physical manifestation of the supreme Brahman.   
As far as Bhagavan is concerned, I would like to view him as an avatar of the  
supreme Brahman or Arunachala who wanted to demonstrate the path of self  
enquiry for the benefit of posterity by living and enacting the same as any  
human being.   
Moreover I would like to believe that Bhagavan out of his infinite mercy  
and compassion in some mysterious way still exists within the realms of  
Brahman as a perfected Siddha who raises to emancipation those who turn to him  
and also shows the path of enquiry to souls who are ripe for that.   
Thanks,   
Anand Sundaram.

Anand Sundaram,   
Here is an excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: "Once Rama asked Hanuman, 'How do you look on Me?' And Hanuman replied: 'O  
Rama,as long as I have the feeling of "I", I see that Thou art the whole and I  
am a part; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant. But when, O Rama, I have  
the knowledge of Truth, then I realize that Thou art I and I am Thou.'   
"The relationship of master and servant is the proper one. Since this 'I' must  
remain, let the rascal be God's servant.   
 **Evil of "I"and "mine"**   
"'I' and 'mine' \- these constitute ignorance. 'My house', 'my wealth', 'my  
learning', 'my possessions' \- the attitude that prompts one to say such  
things comes of ignorance. On the contrary, the attitude born of Knowledge is: 'O God, Thou art the Master, and all these things belong to Thee. House,  
family, children, attendants, friends, are Thine.'   
The above teaching wraps up everything about how a devotee views his  
Ishta,Guru, God,Self.Truth is one only.A devotee of Sri Bhagavan following the  
path of self Enquiry or surrender will have the faith that whatever Truth or  
Shakti that manifested as Sri Ramana Bhagavan is Eternal and the  
Presence(sannidhi)of the Guru is Eternal-and that this presence is available  
to all those who open their Heart in Trust, Faith and a spirit of  
surrender.The Name and Form of Bhagavan is inseperable from that presence for  
such a one and he derives all the Guidance and power of the presence by  
worshipping the form and remembering the name.   
A devotee of Shirdi Baba will feel the same thing about sai Baba.A devotee of  
Lord Sri Krishna will say the same thing about Lord Sri Krishna.All this is  
valid,as long as there is genuine devotion.   
This very thing becomes a problem when seized by the mind and its penchant for  
self Gratification,it is turned into fanaticism as Graham had mentioned.   
Quote  
> Having faith in something unknown is difficult to maintain and _sometimes  
> leads to fanaticism_ or failure in the absence of proof  
The Genuine Sadhaka knows that Guru is one and only one-Be it Sai Baba Or  
Ramana Bhagavan or Kanchi Mahaswami.He does not seek to elevate one over the  
other in a narrow sectarian way.It is quite understandable that one form  
appeals to him more than others but this is just on account of his own  
predeliction or disposition.   
I wish to add that the Guru not only points to the Truth but he also gives the  
shakti to tread the path.Ofcourse the devotee has to put in the required self  
effort.   
There is a wonderful chapted called 'Four aids' from Sri Aurobindo's  
'Synthesis of Yoga' which covers all these aspects.You may like to look up  
this post: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=7216.msg32818#msg32818

Though it is now quite late-since the thread began in 2009- I would like to  
express my deep gratitude to Graham. Since I first joined the Forum about 1  
year ago, I have returned to this thread, especially his original post, time

sure over the years there will be many others like me who will draw  
reassurance and comfort from this, in what must always ultimately be a lonely

Initially when i came across advaita vedanta, my search continued even after  
reading Ramana's works. In time, and also in comparing other teachers to  
Bhagavan, i was drawn back into his teaching. Most others simply do not  
compare. "Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong." This is the best advice i have heard in  
regards to finding a realized teacher.

Dear Adam,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan is the yardstick for measurement of other teachers. I find  
most of them do not even come up to His waist. A few months back, I came  
across an advertisement in news paper.   
"Self Realization in two days. Join immediately." I could not help   
laughing. I am also sympathizing with the people who rush for   
such courses.

Today's Gurus are no doubt Good speakers but there is less Dharma in their own

Association of the wise is highly recommended by almost every spiritual source  
I've read. The problem is here in the West where is it to be found?   
I don't know how good an idea it is to attend just anything that calls itself  
"Satsang". And even beyond that I had thought of attending,say, a Greek  
Orthodox mass just to be silent and in the company of more spiritually minded  
people rather than worldly people, but that was unsuccessful on many levels. I  
live near Portland Oregon in the US and it has many MANY eastern spiritual  
groups to choose from, even relatively smaller groups (for here) like Meher  
Baba or Radha Soami, but there is no group for Ramana which strikes me as odd.  
Anyway, I would be curious as to any advice on "keeping the company of the  
wise" in the western world. It is very difficult.

Thank you Latha, but I am in Portland Oregon, so a little far away for a drive  
to Chicago.

Nisargadatta addresses this in I AM THAT, the question and answer format is  
informative and speaks on many levels. If I remember right, He says as long  
as the devotee is earnest, the devotee may find another guru which can be like  
a mile marker who points the way. There are other examples also--devotees not  
earnest enough, moving from one guru to another, etc., to make one blanket  
statement for all seems to be foolhardy, although Reality is One, mankind is  
varied, along with the needs.

I just came back here to mention that I did discover there is one closer to  
me. I had recently done a massive google search looking for places close by  
for possible satsang, but the keywords I used were "satsang", "Hinduism",  
"Advaita" and so on. But once I used the exact term "Chinmaya mission" I found  
there was one (60 miles away, but definitely closer than Chicago!) ;-)   
Anyway, thanks again.
