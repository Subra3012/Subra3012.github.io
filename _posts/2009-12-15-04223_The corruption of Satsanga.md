## The corruption of Satsanga

The real meaning of Satsang is 'association with the Wise', preferably the  
Self-realised Sages (Jnani's) who speak only of God and fully practice dharma  
(righteousness), though Sages who are not yet Self-realised, but live  
according to the rules of dharma are also considered to be Wise. Association  
with the wise is said to be the root-cause of all that is good.   
Jnani's are dharma personified, they NEVER stray from it, even for a split  
second. They are identical with God and nothing is beyond them. They know the  
world to be an illusion and have little or no interest in it. They do not seek  
to accumulate wealth or property, they are not interested in fame or acquiring  
followers. They do not advertise nor entice others to advertise for them - God  
does not need to advertise, He is the soul of everything.   
Just before Bhagavan left the body, Chadwick and others approached Him and  
asked Him how they could repay Him, should they write books, tell the world  
about Him, etc. He replied " **Put my teachings into practice** ".   
Today the word 'satsang' is widely used to promote what can only be described  
as talking-shops (the opposite of satsang), where self-appointed gurus  
pontificate about subjects they know little or nothing about, manufacture  
their own poisoned theories, indulge in cheap psychology and pursue their  
vices. They also expect you to pay for all of this in every possible way.   
It is also widely used for meditation sessions, but this is not true satsang  
by any stretch of the imagination.   
The primary requisite for those seeking self-realisation is the ability to  
discriminate between that which is useful and that which is useless/harmful in  
the search. Becoming attached to the wrong person or group can do immeasurable  
harm, not only in life in general, but can also disturb and even destroy  
budding faith; it is therefore imperative that caution is exercised in every  
possible way.   
You must carefully weigh up everything that you see and hear. Clear teachings  
are available from the publications of Sri Ramanasramam and ancient scriptures  
such as - Tripura Rahasya, The Srimad Bhagavata, Advaita Bodha Deepika, Yoga  
Vasistha Sara, The Bhagavad Gita, Ribhu Gita, etc. If what you hear is  
contrary in any way to the essence of these works, then do not return.   
People were attracted to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi by his purity and  
simplicity. Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong. But also bear in mind that it is fairly  
easy to fake the outer appearance of a jnani, but it is impossible to fake the  
ananda (peace) or power that was experienced in his presence.   
In the late 1990's I saw a website that listed all of the 'known' Jnani's and  
their so-called 'lineage'. It started with Ramana Maharshi who apparently  
transferred Self-realisation to H.W.L. Poonja, who in turn (if I remember  
correctly) tranferred it to 300+ others with lots more to follow. We all fell  
on the floor with laughter upon reading this. .... what is there to transfer  
and from whom to whom? If it can be transferred then it was not there in the  
first place, is not permanent and not worth the effort.   
Unfortunately they have not gone away, Tiruvannamalai is plastered with  
posters advertising these people during the winter months.   
God, Guru and Self are one and the same. True satsang is therefore association  
with the Self and that does not require anyone else.

Initially when i came across advaita vedanta, my search continued even after  
reading Ramana's works. In time, and also in comparing other teachers to  
Bhagavan, i was drawn back into his teaching. Most others simply do not  
compare. "Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong." This is the best advice i have heard in  
regards to finding a realized teacher.

Dear Adam,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan is the yardstick for measurement of other teachers. I find  
most of them do not even come up to His waist. A few months back, I came  
across an advertisement in news paper.   
"Self Realization in two days. Join immediately." I could not help   
laughing. I am also sympathizing with the people who rush for   
such courses.   
Arunachala Siva.
