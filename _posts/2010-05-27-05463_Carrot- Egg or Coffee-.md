A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things  
were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted  
to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem  
was solved a new one arose.   
Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the  
first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs and the last she  
placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word.   
In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out  
and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  
Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her  
daughter, she asked, "Tell me what do you see?"   
"Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.   
She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted  
that they got soft.She then asked her to take an egg and break it.   
After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.   
Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted  
its rich aroma. The daughter then asked. "What's the point, mother?"   
Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity--  
boiling water--but each reacted differently.   
The carrot went in strong, hard and unrelenting. However after being subjected  
to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile.  
Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after sitting  
through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.   
The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling  
water they had changed the water.   
"Which are you?" she asked her daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door,  
how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?"   
Think of this: Which am I?   
Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and  
become soft and lose my strength?   
Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat?  
Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship  
or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?   
Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a  
stiff spirit and a hardened heart?   
Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the  
very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases  
the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their  
worst, you get better and change the situation around you.   
When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to  
another level?   
 **How do you handle Adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?   
Don't tell GOD how big your storm is. Tell the storm how big your GOD is!**

Dear prasanth,   
Dwell in the flame of sorrow. The end will be wonderful. Do not   
grudge about adversities. Once there was a priest of Mathrubhuteswara Temple  
in the Asramam. His legs had some   
serious problem. And he could not move out of his bed. But he   
never grieved for it. Sri Ganesan went to see him. He said: "Mama (Uncle), You kaal (leg) has become like this. What a pity!"   
The priest replied: Ganesa! I am not worried, why are you worried?   
Only kaal (means also, one quarter) is bad but mukkaal (three quarters, mind  
and thoughts and meditation) is good. I am thankful to Bhagavan Ramana for  
this grace." This is the best form of surrender.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well said Subramanian Garu.   
Kamakshi,the daughter of the famous compiler of Talks, Munagala Venkatramaiah  
health deteriorated and she was diagonized to have bone cancer. On seeing her  
condition Sri V. Sundara Ramanan of the Asramam said with flowing tears: "O  
Auntie! why has Bhagavan let you down like this?" Eyes flashing and with  
sudden energy flowing Kamakshi responded: "How dare you say Bhagavan has at  
any time failed to take care of me?" She passed away after sometime.
