Narayana or Vishnu is always quite serene. His job is to sustain   
the universe. He takes care of the entire universe, its animate and   
inanimate objects/beings. Why then there is misery, pain and disease? He  
does not cause these things at all. These things   
happen due to one's prarabdha. Right from the jiva is formed in   
the womb, prarabdha starts. That is why, some babies are born   
dumb, deaf, or blind. Bhagavan Ramana says that Jiva or Sukshma   
Sarira is carrying the mind and prana from the previous birth and takes the  
present birth. The mind is embedded with vasanas. These vasanas create  
prarabdha. He is blue in color, like the Pure Space. Like the Pure Space  
contains all the universe with its living and non living beings, He carries  
them all. Mother Uma, Siva's   
consort is also blue in color. She is the brother of Vishnu. He is the  
darling of Lakshmi. He keeps her ever on his chest. He is attained by the  
dhyana of yogis, who had done their chitta suddhi. He by this dhyana confers  
such yogis the great misery of again getting a birth, or samsara. He is the  
Master of all the universes.   
There is one more sloka, which says that all the prayers to all gods finally  
reach Kesava. Like all the rivers reach their destination only the ocean.   
Incidentally, the Tiruvannamalai Big Temple of Arunachaleswara   
is owned by Vishnu! The land and building rights are still with   
Vishnu, called Sri Venugopala Swami, as per ancient records.   
One can see his metal icon behind Arunachaleswara inner portal behind the  
Lingam, just opposite to Lingodbhava murthi.   
Arunachala Siva.**

It might be that a Vishnu temple was there where Arunachaleswara temple is  
located now.   
It is also said that Tirumala temple resembles a Shakti temple in many  
respects.   
Adi Shankaracharya is said to have installed a Dhana Akarshana Yantra there  
which might be a reason why the temple attracts so much wealth.

Dear silentgreen,   
Your surmise about Tirupati Temple might be true. Some old   
Tamizh books say that Venkateswara was earlier Devi, with long   
tresses of hair [which is now hidden with a huge headgear] and   
she had three eyes. The eye on forehead is hidden by the thick   
Trisuranam. God only knows.   
Saint Arunagiri Natha sings in his Tirupugazh that Venkatgiri is   
actually a Murugan Temple.   
In Panduranga's Temple, in Pandaripuram, on the crown of Panduranga, there is  
a small Siva linga!   
"There are such stuff in heaven and earth, O Horatio, that you   
may not even dream of...." Shakespeare.

Dear silentgreen,   
This is a tricky sloka. This is also used to pray to Lord Ganesa.   
When Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni had darshan of Sri Bhagavan   
for the first time, in Virupaksha Cave, he said this sloke and   
held Sri Bhagavan's right leg with his right hand and left leg   
with his left hand, i.e. keeping his hands crossed.   
When one Padmanabha Swami who was with Muni asked him how he could recite  
sloka of Ganapati to Sri Bhagavan, Kavyakanta   
Ganapati, with his erudite knowledge in Sanskrit said: Suklambaradharam - one who wears white coupina,   
Vishnum - one who knows everything,   
Sasivarnam - one who is like the moon, bright,   
Chaturbhujam - one who has destroyed his mind, senses, pride and thoughts  
[four],   
Prasanna Vadhanam - one who has got peaceful countenance ever.   
When Sri Bhagavan Ramana listened to this explanation, He smiled at Kavyakanta  
Ganapati Muni!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Very nice passage and good description. Ganapati Muni was such a great Pundit  
but humble. Pundits of much less knowledge gets puffed up with ego. The works  
of Ganapati Muni on Devi are revered and acclaimed. The knowledge of Ganapati  
Muni increased his yearning instead of covering it up.

Dear silentgreen,   
Ganapati Muni announced that he would stage his reading of   
Uma Sahasram, at the Arunachaleswarar Temple, on a particular   
day. He could complete only 800 slokas. The last 200 were   
yet to be written. It was already 8 PM on the previous night.   
He was in Pachaiamman Kovil, along with his disciples and Sri   
Bhagavan. Words were not flowing. The four disciples were   
ready to take down. But nothing flowed further. He sat in front   
of Sri Bhagavan, with a silent prayer. Sri Bhagavan looked at   
him intently with all grace. Soon, the words started flowing.   
The remaining 200 hundred verses were completed before 12 midnight. As the  
last sloka was dictated and written down by   
a disciple, Sri Bhagavan who was looking at him all along, asked   
Ganapati Muni: "Nayana, has everything been taken down?"   
Ganapati Muni realized that those verses were actually said by   
Sri Bhagavan through him as medium. He shed tears and prostrated before Him.   
Later, when Ganapati Muni revised some verses [after the stage   
reading in the Temple], he did not make any alterations in the   
last 200 verses. Who am I to change Bhagavan's words? he said.   
I think this Uma Sahasram was lost once completely and Ganapati   
Muni re-wrote them out of his memory! I think, in the Complete   
Works of Ganapati Muni, which have been published recently,   
this Uma Sahasram finds a place.   
Arunachala Siva.

Name of Rama, Rama Naama, is the most sublime mantra for   
attaining liberation. Once a devotee asked Sri Bhagavan that   
he had been chanting Rama Japa and whether he should shift   
to Ramana Japa. Sri Bhagavan said: "Why? Is there any   
difference between the two. Please continue Rama Japa."   
Sri B.V. Narasimhaswami in his Self Realization describes 16   
qualities of Rama which are also there in Sri Bhagavan.   
The puranic story that in Kasi, Viswanatha tells the Rama Naama   
there when persons are dying. He tells them into their right ears.

**The world is a dream**   
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The  
fisherman, to be sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to  
those who live in the world? Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who  
could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an  
office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life  
there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street?  
Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as before. Even  
after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live in  
the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were  
living as householders.   
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"   
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."   
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing  
him, the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father.  
Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are  
even.'   
During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night  
on the formless God. _Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize  
God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without  
form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted_. Sambhu Mallick used  
to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a  
friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you  
come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set  
out repeating the name of God! What danger can befall me?' _Through faith  
alone one attains everything._ I used to say, 'I shall take all this to be  
true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden  
talks to me.' What I would think of would   
invariably come to pass."

M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that  
only superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with  
actual events. Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"   
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the  
name of God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would  
invariably come to pass.(To Manilal) _But you must remember, unless one is  
guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith._ Bony people, the  
hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot  
easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?"   
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and  
some other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The  
Master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine  
Mother. There was complete silence.   
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered  
the room and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit  
down. The Master had known her for many years. In her younger days she had  
lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he  
began to converse with her.   
MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy  
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"   
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"   
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"   
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place,  
and my name is inscribed there on a slab."   
MASTER: "Indeed!"   
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."   
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"   
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him,  
touching his feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up  
and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer  
of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed with the holy water the  
spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were amazed to see  
this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead.   
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should  
salute me from a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment,  
the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a few songs."

The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight   
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet.. . .

**Tuesday, June 5, 1883**   
Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at  
Dakshineswar. M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a  
week-day there were only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered  
there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays.   
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his  
experiences during his God-intoxicated state.   
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat  
my meals here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at  
Baranagore or at Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just  
sit down there without saying a word. If the members of the household asked me  
why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to eat.' _Now and then I  
would go, uninvited of course_, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to  
the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the  
Choudhurys' house.   
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: _'  
Devendra chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?_'  
Mathur Babu was a very proud man. _How could one expect him to go to another  
man 's house uninvited? _ At first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right.  
Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.'   
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar  
near the bridge. _He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding  
me insistent, he took me to Dina 's house in a carriage. It was a small  
place_. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage embarrassed the inmates.  
We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with the  
sacred thread. _The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina  
to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really a  
distressing situation_. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never  
listen to you again.' I laughed.

"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the  
sadhus and invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When  
I sat down for the meal, several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt  
like leaving them and sitting alone. I wondered why they should bother about  
all that. The sadhus took their seats. I began to eat before they had started.  
I heard several of them remark, 'Oh! What sort of man   
is this?' "   
 **Parable of the farmer**   
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the  
steps of his verandah. Hazra, Rakhal, and M. were near him. _Hazra had the  
attitude of a Vedantist: "I am He."_   
MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the  
farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son  
was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the  
boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the  
wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he hasn't even  
one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you  
know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and the  
father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as virtuous.  
They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts.  
Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those  
seven children or this one boy.'   
_To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the dream state. "God  
alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will."_

**Law of karma**   
HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the  
sadhu of Bhukailas. How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They  
had found him in   
samadhi. First they buried him, then they put him under water, and then they  
branded him with a hot iron. Thus they brought him back to consciousness of  
the world. But in the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures. _He  
undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the  
will of God. "_   
MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of  
that holy man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The  
kavirajs prepare   
makaradhvaja in a bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the  
fire. The gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other  
ingredients, and the medicine is made. Then the physicians break the bottle  
carefully and take out the medicine. _When the medicine is made, what  
difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or broken? So people  
think that the holy man was killed. But perhaps his inner stuff had been made.  
After the realization of God, what difference does it make whether the body  
lives or dies?_ "

**Different kinds of samadhi**   
"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My  
own spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of  
Hrishikesh. Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as  
though it were the creeping of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of  
a monkey jumping from one branch to another. Again, sometimes it feels like a  
fish swimming in water. Only he who experiences it knows what it is like. _In  
samadhi one forgets the world. When the mind comes down a little, I say to the  
Divine Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I want to talk to people._'   
"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness  
after attaining samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual  
discipline; but they do not come back. But when God Himself is born as a man,  
as an Incarnation, holding in His hand the key to others' liberation, then for  
the welfare of humanity the Incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness  
of the world."   
M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's  
liberation?"   
HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an  
Incarnation of God exists or not?"   
It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness  
enveloped the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the  
temple garden. The black sky was reflected in the waters of the Ganges.

**The world is a dream**   
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The  
fisherman, to be sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to  
those who live in the world? Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who  
could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an  
office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life  
there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street?  
Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as before. Even  
after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live in  
the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were  
living as householders.   
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"   
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."   
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing  
him, the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father.  
Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are  
even.'   
During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night  
on the formless God. _Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize  
God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without  
form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted_. Sambhu Mallick used  
to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a  
friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you  
come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set  
out repeating the name of God! What danger can befall me?' _Through faith  
alone one attains everything._ I used to say, 'I shall take all this to be  
true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden  
talks to me.' What I would think of would   
invariably come to pass."

M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that  
only superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with  
actual events. Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"   
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the  
name of God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would  
invariably come to pass.(To Manilal) _But you must remember, unless one is  
guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith._ Bony people, the  
hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot  
easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?"   
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and  
some other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The  
Master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine  
Mother. There was complete silence.   
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered  
the room and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit  
down. The Master had known her for many years. In her younger days she had  
lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he  
began to converse with her.   
MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy  
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"   
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"   
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"   
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place,  
and my name is inscribed there on a slab."   
MASTER: "Indeed!"   
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."   
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"   
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him,  
touching his feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up  
and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer  
of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed with the holy water the  
spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were amazed to see  
this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead.   
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should  
salute me from a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment,  
the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a few songs."

The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight   
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet.. . .   
Then he sang: High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite,   
When came a gust of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth..   
..   
Again: Dwell, O mind, within yourself;   
Enter no other's home.   
If you but seek there, you will find   
All you are searching for.   
God, the true Philosopher's Stone,   
Who answers every prayer,   
Lies hidden deep within your heart,   
The richest gem of all.   
How many pearls and precious stones   
Are scattered all about   
The outer court that lies before   
The chamber of your heart!

**Tuesday, June 5, 1883**   
Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at  
Dakshineswar. M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a  
week-day there were only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered  
there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays.   
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his  
experiences during his God-intoxicated state.   
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat  
my meals here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at  
Baranagore or at Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just  
sit down there without saying a word. If the members of the household asked me  
why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to eat.' _Now and then I  
would go, uninvited of course_, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to  
the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the  
Choudhurys' house.   
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: _'  
Devendra chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?_'  
Mathur Babu was a very proud man. _How could one expect him to go to another  
man 's house uninvited? _ At first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right.  
Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.'   
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar  
near the bridge. _He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding  
me insistent, he took me to Dina 's house in a carriage. It was a small  
place_. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage embarrassed the inmates.  
We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with the  
sacred thread. _The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina  
to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really a  
distressing situation_. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never  
listen to you again.' I laughed.

the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.

in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the  
farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son  
was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the

Those who have got initiated in Sri Vidya, the rituals prescribed by the guru  
must be adhered to, even if they are not understood by the intellect. The  
rituals have come down from traditions and the entire blessings of the  
tradition backs the devotee. If the devotee finds it difficult to perform them  
due to time etc, he should contact his guru and ask for advice.   
In general physical rituals are very helpful in cultivating devotion to God.  
The body is not crowded by thoughts like the mind and can serve God faithfully  
like a dog. The merit gained by that serving percolates back to the mind and  
makes it devotional.

 _**Oh! I don 't know the Mantra, the Yantra, or the Eulogies. I don't  
even know how to invoke You, how to meditate on You, and even the speech  
behind Your eulogies. I don't know the postures [in which to say eulogies],  
and I don't know how to wail. [But] O Mother! I know that following You  
absolves the biggest distresses.1   
The offerings â which were due to the lack of knowledge of methodology, by  
the lack of resources, by indolence, or due to the lack of strength for  
submission â fallen [by me] on Your dual-feet, forgive all those mistakes, O  
Mother! O Shiva, Who absolves everyone! Because a son can become bad or  
ignorant about his duties as an offspring, but the Mother always remains a  
Mother.2   
O Mother! There are many sons of Yours on this earth and they are gentle.  
Amidst them, I am Your son, who is extremely libidinous. I have the feelings  
of possession, and I have no compassion within me. But I am Yours, O Shiva! A  
son can become bad or ignorant about his duties as an offspring, but the  
Mother always remains a Mother.3   
O Mother! O Mother of the world! Your feet has not been engaged upon [by me]  
and, even more so, Your feet has not been submitted with offerings by me. Even  
then, You shower immaculate benevolence on me. Because a son can become bad or  
ignorant about his duties as an offspring, but the Mother always remains a  
Mother.4**_   
 _ **At an age of more than eighty-five yearsÂ¹, by me, who lacks the prowess  
to perform various rituals, the Devas have been left along. O Mother of  
Lambodar (Parvati)! Now, in this situation, if Your benevolence does not  
happens on me, then, I, the unsupported one, will take whose refuge?5   
O Aparna! A dog-eater (Chandala) becomes a talkative person with honey-like  
sweet words coming out from the tongue; and a poor man roams fearlessly for  
long time in golden riches, when the chants of Your name fall [seat] inside  
the ear of anyone. O Mother! Then, in that case, who can know the achievements  
due to continuous chants of Your name based on the appropriate rules?6   
Kapali, Who has ashes from the burnt corpses on body, Who has the directions  
as clothes (cloth-less), Who has thick tress-locks, Who has a garland of king  
of snake in neck, Who is known as Pashupati, and Who is the ruler of ghosts,  
attains the position of poison-destroyer and Lord of the world. O Bhavani!  
This is just a result of addition of You as His consort.7   
I don't have the desire to attain Moksha, neither I have the desire to attain  
luxuries and resplendence in the world. I don't have expectations of sciences,  
and O the Moon-faced Goddess! I don't even desire for luxuries and comfort. O  
Mother! Thus, I beg You, that whenever I am born, give me the chanting of  
these names to me â Mridani, Rudrani, Shiv, Bhavani.8   
O Shyama! You are not revered by me, using methods or various prescriptions. I  
didn't do anything beyond the rough-thinking and speech. But even then, if You  
keep me, the destitute and orphan, in benevolence, then it suits You; since  
You indeed are beyond everything, O Mother!.9   
O Durga, Who is the abode of ocean of mercy! When I remember You in  
troublesome situations, don't think it is stupidity. It is because when a  
child is hungry, the child only remembers the Mother.10   
O Mother of the world! You are full of benevolence for me; [but] what is the  
surprise in this? [Because] Even when a son is full of faults, the Mother does  
not ignores or disowns the child.11   
O Mahadevi! There is no fallen one like me, and there is indeed no absolver of  
sins like You. Knowing this, You do what You think as appropriate.12**_

**Different manifestations of Kali**   
KESHAB (with a smile): "Describe to us, sir, in how many ways Kali, the Divine  
Mother, sports in this world."   
MASTER (with a smile): "Oh, She plays in different ways. It is She alone who  
is known as Maha-Kali, Nitya-Kali, Smasana-Kali, Raksha-Kali, and Syama-Kali.  
Maha-Kali and Nitya-Kali are mentioned in the Tantra philosophy. When there  
were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth  
and when darkness was enveloped in darkness, then the Mother, the Formless  
One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, the Absolute.   
"Syama-Kali has a somewhat tender aspect and is worshipped in the Hindu  
households. She is the Dispenser of boons and the Dispeller of fear. People  
worship Raksha Kali, the Protectress, in times of epidemic, famine,  
earthquake, drought, and flood. Smasana-Kali is the embodiment of the power of  
destruction. She resides in the cremation ground, surrounded by corpses,  
jackals, and terrible female spirits. From Her mouth flows a stream of blood,  
from Her neck hangs a garland of human heads, and around Her waist is a girdle  
made of human hands.   
 **Beginning of a cycle**   
"After the destruction of the universe, at the end of a great cycle, the  
Divine Mother garners the seeds for the next creation. She is like the elderly  
mistress of the house, who has a hotchpotch-pot in which she keeps different  
articles for household use. (All laugh.)   
"Oh, yes! Housewives have pots like that, where they keep 'sea-foam', blue  
pills, small bundles of seeds of cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd, and so on. They  
take them out when they want them. In the same way, after the destruction of  
the universe, my Divine Mother, the Embodiment of Brahman, gathers together  
the seeds for the next creation. After the creation the Primal Power dwells in  
the universe itself. She brings forth this phenomenal world and then pervades  
it. In the Vedas creation is likened to the spider and its web. The spider  
brings the web out of itself and then remains in it. God is the container of  
the universe and also what is contained in it.   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

Sri Ramakrishna began his midday meal with the devotees. It was about one  
o'clock. A devotee sang in the courtyard below: Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep In the lotus of the  
Muladhara!   
Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother: Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head,   
Where mighty Siva has His dwelling;   
Swiftly pierce the six lotuses   
And take away my grief, O Essence of Consciousness!   
Hearing the song, Sri Ramakrishna went into samadhi; his whole body became  
still, and his hand remained touching the plate of food. He could eat no more.  
After a long time his mind came down partially to the plane of the sense  
world, and he said, "I want to go downstairs." A devotee led him down very  
carefully. Still in an abstracted mood, he sat near the singer. The song had  
ended. The Master said to him very humbly, "Sir, I want to hear the chanting  
of the Mother's name again."   
The musician sang: Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep In the lotus of the  
Muladhara!. . .   
The Master again went into ecstasy.

**Maa Durga**   
One day the disciple: d: As instructed I have made two lists in preparation for Durga Puja: one for  
thoughts inside "I" and the other for the thoughts outside "I".   
cguru: What are those thoughts?   
d: Inside "I": fear of survival, feeling of confinement, sorrow in moving  
from small to small, sort of emptiness;   
Outside "I": the Himalayas, the vast Sky, the Dawn, Divine Mother.   
cguru: Good. Make the second list bigger.   
d: ok, but still I am wondering, what is the relationship between these lists  
and Durga Puja.   
cguru: Because Durga Puja will happen in the boundary of these lists. Great  
fight will take place to move from the first to the second list, and there is  
an opportunity that we will leave behind some of the first list and place our  
foot on the second list.   
Jai Durga

**Maa Durga**   
The Master sang: If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name,   
How canst Thou then, O Blessed One,   
Withhold from me deliverance,   
Wretched though I may be?   
I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,   
Or slain a woman or a cow,   
Or even caused a brahmin's death;   
But, though it all be true,   
Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;   
For through the power of Thy sweet name   
My wretched soul may still aspire   
Even to Brahmanhood.   
From Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

To my Divine Mother I prayed only for pure love. I offered flowers at Her  
Lotus Feet and prayed to Her: 'Mother, here is Thy virtue, here is Thy vice.  
Take them both and grant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy knowledge,  
here is Thy ignorance. Take them both and grant me only pure love for Thee.  
Here is Thy purity, here is Thy impurity. Take them both, Mother, and grant me  
only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy dharma, here is Thy adharma. Take them  
both, Mother, and grant me only pure love for Thee.'   
(To the Brahmo devotees) "Now listen to a song by Ramprasad: Come, let us go for a walk, O mind, to Kali, the Wish-fulfilling Tree, And  
there beneath It gather the four fruits of life.   
Of your two wives, Dispassion and Worldliness,   
Bring alone Dispassion only, on your way to the Tree,   
And ask her son Discrimination about the Truth.   
When will you learn to lie, O mind, in the abode of Blessedness, With  
Cleanliness and Defilement on either side of you?   
Only when you have found the way   
To keep these wives contentedly under a single roof,   
Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama.   
Ego and Ignorance, your parents, instantly banish from your sight; And should  
Delusion seek to drag you to its hole,   
Manfully cling to the pillar of Patience.   
Tie to the post of Unconcern the goats of Vice and Virtue,   
Killing them with the sword of Knowledge if they rebel.   
With the children of Worldliness, your first wife, plead from a goodly  
distance, And, if they will not listen, drown them in Wisdom's sea.   
Says Ramprasad: If you do as I say,   
You can submit a good account, O mind, to the King of Death,   
And I shall be well pleased with you and call you my darling.

**Maa Durga**   
One of the manifestation of Goddess Parvati is Devi Shakambari, probably one  
of the most compassionate face of a manifestation.   
The story goes about demon Durgama who did penance meditating on Brahma and  
got the Vedas under his control as a boon.   
Consequently the Brahmins forgot all vedic rituals. Due to this the devas  
could not get the havis and became weak. The asuras conquered them and threw  
them out of the heaven.   
The absence of vedic homas resulted in absence of rains on earth and made all  
water bodies dry. A great draught ensued which killed so many people (and  
animals) that dead bodies piled up and there was no one to cremate.   
The brahmins went to the foothills of the Himalayas and started meditating on  
the Divine Mother without taking any food. After many days of austerities and  
intense prayer, Devi Shakambari appeared before them.   
She was **अ नंताक्षिमयं रूपं** (Ananta Akshimayam Rupam),   
i.e. with innumerable eyes.   
This reminds of Purusha Sukta, Sahasra Shira and Sahasra Aksa, innumerable  
heads and innumerable eyes.   
Here Devi appeared with innumerable eyes, as if to convey that She is the  
witness of everything, She knows the joy of everyone as well as the suffering  
of everyone.   
Jai Durga

**_You Raise Me Up   
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary,   
When troubles come and my heart burdened be,

Until you come and sit awhile with me.   
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,   
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,   
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,

There is no life - no life without its hunger,   
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly,

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,   
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,   
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,   
You raise me up..To more than I can be.

**_Worthy is (gr. Άξιον εστίν, stsl. Worthy EST) is a liturgical Russian chant  
in Orthodox Christianity.   
According to tradition,it was writen during the patriarch Nicholas Hrisoverga  
(983-996). One night a monk was reading the canon of the Madonna and sang,  
ČestnjejÅ¡uju song in cell of Pantocrator Monastery now called "Worthy is".  
The old man went to his room. Suddenly a man appeared at the church and began  
to sing: Worthy is. This song was so far unknown in the church. Unknown Monk  
heard the song, he was all excited, because of the content, but also because  
of beautiful chanting. "We like singing," said the stranger monk. He wanted to  
have the song written and issued a single plate on which the alien finger  
wrote the song as per wax. Then he disappeared. Christians believe that the  
stranger was the Archangel Gabriel. The panel is transferred to  
Constantinople. The song "Is worthy" is still used in the church service.   
Dostojno jest   
Dostojno je uistinu   
Da BlaÅ¾enom zovemo Tebe, Bogorodicu,   
Uvek BlaÅ¾enu i Svebesprekornu i Mater Boga naÅ¡ega   
Časniju od Heruvima i neuporedivo slavniju od Serafima   
Tebe Å¡to Boga Reč neporočno rodi   
Uistinu Bogorodicu veličamo   
Worthy is   
Worthy is truly   
Blessed to call you, Madonna,   
Always Blessed and Seamlessly Mother of our God   
Venerable of Cherubims and incomparably Great of Seraphim   
The word of God which you from purity born   
Indeed Madonna we Glorify!   
Beautiful...

**Maa Durga**   
The form of Devi Shakambari was resplendent like million suns and She was a  
nectar of compassion. Seeing the pitiable condition of the people in the world  
dying of hunger and thirst in the mighty draught, Her innumerable eyes filled  
with tears. The tears flowed down from Her eyes in thousands of streams for  
nine nights continuously. This produced water on the dry earth and took it out  
of the draught.   
Later the devas and brahmins said: Who else is there who will cry looking at  
the distress of even the fallen, apart from Supreme Mother Goddess Satakshi?   
Jai Durga

ThAyumanavar's hymns to the Divine mother are some of the finest ever.In this  
verse 5 of Malai vaLar kAdhali peN _uma-the Lover damsel who grew up in the  
mountain_ -he says that the Divine Mother having given birth to the  
universe,yet is a virgin.He composed this set of verses after visiting  
kanyakumari in cape comorin,South india.   
Here is the verse 5,which has a sweet mantric feel about it,as he refers to  
the way devotees chant her name: பூரணி புராதனி சுமங்கலை சுதந்தரி   
 புராந்தகி த்ரியம்பகிஎழில்   
 புங்கவி விளங்குசிவ சங்கரி சகஸ்ரதள   
 புஷ்பமிசை வீற்றிருக்கும்   
நாரணி மனாதீத நாயகி குணாதீத   
 நாதாந்த சத்திஎன்றுன்   
 நாமமே உச்சரித் திடுமடியர் நாமமே   
 நானுச்ச ரிக்கவசமோ   
ஆரணி சடைக்கடவுள் ஆரணி எனப்புகழ   
 அகிலாண்ட கோடிஈன்ற   
 அன்னையே பின்னையுங் கன்னியென மறைபேசும்   
 ஆனந்த ரூபமயிலே   
வாரணியும் இருகொங்கை மாதர்மகிழ் கங்கைபுகழ்   
 வளமருவு தேவைஅரசே   
 வரைரா சனுக்கிருகண் மணியாய் உதித்தமலை   
 வளர்காத லிப்பெண்உமையே.   
Oh Perfection (Poorani)!Ancient one (PurAdhani)!Auspicious  
one(Sumangali)!Autonomous one(Swatantri)!Destroyer of Triune Cities  
(Purantaki)!   
Triple Eyed one!Lovely Goddess (ezhil Pungavi)!Sankari,spouse of  
Siva!NArani,seated On the thousand petalled lotus (in cranium)!   
Godess transcending mind!Shakti transcending attributes and sound -   
Chant thus devotees-your name;That Name,Am I fit to chant?   
Praised art Thou as Arani By Him who weareth the Ar (Athi or Konrai) blossom.   
Oh Mother that gave birth to universes Vast,   
Yet spoken of in the Vedas as a Virgin,the Blissful one comely as a peacock!   
Born as 'apple of the eye' to the Mountain King,where the corset breasted  
damsels Rejoice (bathing)in the renowned Ganges!   
 _Oh uma!the Beloved Damsel who grew up in the Mountain_ !(himalayAs)

**Maa Durga**   
The Devas praised Devi Shakambari as:  **न मो माहेश्वरि शिवे पञ्चकोशान्तरस्थिते**   
Namo Maheshwari Shive Panchakosa Antara Sthite,   
which means the auspicious Maheswari Who resides in the interior of the five  
koshas.   
Actual sadhana is very very deep and cannot be captured by superficial  
statements like "we are already realised" etc. One who is able to penetrate  
the five koshas can only come face to face with the core God Consciousness.   
 **च ेतसा निर्विकल्पेन यां ध्यायंति मुनीश्वराः**   
Cetasa Nirvikalpena Yam Dhayanti Munishwara,   
which means the One Who is the Nirvikalpa Consciousness (Consciousness without  
Vikalpa or change) and Who is meditated upon by the great sages.   
The great Puranas on one hand shows the way to worship the form of God and on  
the other hand points to the deeper God Consciousness.   
Durga also means Durgama, Who is very very difficult to reach internally.   
Jai Durga

"'O Mother! O Blissful One! Reveal Thyself to me. Thou must!'   
'O Lord of the lowly! O Lord of the universe!

I have no devotion. I know nothing. Thou must be   
gracious and reveal Thyself to me.' "
