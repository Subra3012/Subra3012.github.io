Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Even though I have been to Pamban swaigal temple, I do not read all His poem.  
They say He wrote 6666 songs. At firtst time I have come to know about the  
Panchamirta songs from your post when you had a power cut. Yesterday I went to  
temple, for my surprise it is His 80th gurupuja day. So there was a speech on  
this particular panchamirta songs and some little ones were performing  
bharatnatyam for these 5 songs. The songs are like thrupugazh with lots of  
chanda.   
The gentelman was explaining beautifully. He gave lots of information. I want  
to tell one thing here. He said in Chidambaram, there is one street called  
Venkaiman street. There only Siva came like a old brahmin man and signed  
Thruchitrambalam for Mannikkavachakar's Thruvachakam.He said many people go  
to Chidambaram but no body visit this street. It is the first time I heard  
about this.   
If any body has visited this street.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Very nice. Today my wife has gone to one Murugan temple,   
in Koramangala, in Bangalore to attend a bhajan where they   
are going to sing Paripurna Panchamirta Varnam between   
4 and 6 pm in different batches! In Bangalore, they celebrate   
the Guru Pooja of Pamban Swamigal today. He attained   
Maha Nirvana on Vaikasi [solar calendar], Krishna Paksha   
Panchami, where the star Sravana coincides today, as it   
was on his Maha Nirvana Day.   
Pamban Swamigal is as erudite as Arunagiri Natha. He   
wrote: 1\. 5 Songs of Panchamirta Varnam, describing abhisheka   
to Muruga, with milk, curd, sugar, ghee and honey. I am   
reading the meanings of these five songs. They are quite   
picturous. While singing also, these songs have got power   
of music.   
2\. Sri Kumara Stavam, about 48 names of Skanda, each   
denoting a separate aspect of Muruga.   
3\. Pahai Kadithal - Song for vanquishing enemies.   
4\. Nava Deva Malai - 9 songs for the commanders of   
Skandar's army. Like Veerabhagu etc.,   
5\. Sastra Bandham - This is just one song, of 55 letters where every letter  
when read from beginning to end and end to beginning are same! Barring a few  
letters in between. It is supposed to be written on silver or golden Spear,  
Vel and puja should be made!   
6\. Mayura Bandham. Contains 100 letters ALL short consonants, alpa prana in  
Sanskrit, kuril in Tamil. This has to be written   
on a silver or gold drawing of Peacock and should be prayed!   
This Siddha is a terrible word-player.   
The last song of Panchamirta Varnam describes who are   
all dancing with Skanda, after the war. I would very much   
like to translate and give the meaning at least. It is quite   
tough. Let me try. About 40 gods are dancing!   
The street which you mentioned in Chidambaram, I have   
not visited. But I shall keep in mind. Thanks.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the post. Few days back I wrote about the Shanmukha kavacham the  
man who was in problem asked by his friend to chant and he did. As the result   
he became out of the danger and proved that he was not guilty. As my daily  
routine, when I chanted this kavacham, I found that day was vaisaki visakam.   
Normally I do not read this kavacham daily basis. When I realised I thanked to  
Murugan for giving the book infront of me that day. I prayed for my daughte's   
official problem. It was His grace she herself rang up saying did I pray for  
her coz. everything went off well. So I thought why not chant another 5 days,  
(so it becomes 6 days.) I finished 6 days. Perday it takes 1 hour for 6 times.  
It was His will. I did. Really it is a miracle. My daughter's problem is  
solved now.   
So I thought it is better to go to samadhi and I found about His guru puja.  
From the speech (chorpozhivu) the gentelman told He was a ASU KAVI. means as  
they got enlighted their words all have life. And He spoke about Gukai  
Namasivayar from Thruvanamalai. It was a order of Unnamulai ammai to visit  
Chidambaram.Gukai Namasivayar obeyed for the divine will but He told whenever  
He felt hungry, she should come to serve the food. Unnamulai ammai also   
accepted. On the way to Chidambaram, He sang one padhigam, as He was hungry.  
Immedietly Unnamulai served food. Because He was asu kavi. Appar, janasambar  
are also asu kavikal. It was Murugan's krupa, I had a nice evening.The  
Panchamirta songs are sung by Thrichi Loganathan's son. His pronounsiation is  
very clear. The temple is built by His devotees only. They have written  
swamigal's words. He prays to Murugan, ENNAI THALINALUM THALLU ANAL ENNAI  
NAMBI VARUM ADIYARKALAI THALLADHE. what a unconditional love for His devotees.  
I always think, I do not have that much bhakthi to talk to God, at least if I  
tell swamigal He may request God for me.

Thanks for the information, Subramanian.R   
Palakottu \- Just behind Mother's Temple. There is a small   
gate to enter the bushy forest area. After about 100 metres,   
you can see some cottages. This is where Annamalai Swami,   
Chadwick and other great men stayed. There is a Samadhi   
for Annamalai Swami.   
Guru Murtham - This is in Vetta Valam Road, about 3kms   
from Asramam inside the town. There is a Samadhi for   
Guru Jnana Desikar, with a Siva Lingam. Here Bhagavan   
and a few others stayed for 6 months, when there was   
no water in Virupakshi Cave area. There is a small temple,   
which is often closed. You have to check up with nearby   
houses. In one of the houses, there is a key, they will   
come and open the shrine. You can take some camphor   
and light it there. You may pay some amount for the house   
people since they invariably buy oil for the lamp.   
Isanya Math - This is on Giri Valam, main road. Towards   
the end, you have to take a deviation for about 200 mts.   
and you can see Isanya Desikar Math, which is managed   
by Kovilur Math. The trust member stays in the adjacent   
house, where there is a Veda Patasala. Here is where   
Isanya Jnana Desikar attained Samadhi. Bhagavan Ramana   
went for lunch one day, on the compulsion of the then Kovilur   
Math Head, who took him in a bullock cart, literally lifting   
Bhagavan up! Bhagavan Ramana went there, had a lunch   
and gave a small extempore discourse to students on Bhagavad Gita. He was  
hardly 25 at that time.   
Arunachala Siva.

I though putting this information in this thread will more useful for people  
seeking for a stay in the Ashram and thereby to visit these places where  
Bhagavan Ramana once visited and stayed.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
There are about 10 places all in Tiruvannamalai where   
Bhagavan Ramana stayed between a few hours to many   
days. These are apart from Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam. There is a  
small old Tamil book, with   
back ground stories about each place and the rough   
period during which Bhagavan Ramana stayed. Bhagavan   
never left Tiruvannamalai for 54 years! So all these places   
are either in town or in the Hill. I shall soon write about   
each one of them, Bhagavan willing.   
Arunachala Siva.

One more thing i forgot to mention of my journey to ashram,   
As the time was very short and not leave(office) i had to rush here and there  
and honestly, honestly speaking 'the food in the ashram' was all i could get.  
Next time I'm planing a three day visit exclusive to T.Malai and Ashram only.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
A three or four day visit makes you feel relaxed. You may   
visit the Big Temple [ 2 to 3 hours], sit in the Old Hall,   
[1/2 hour two or three times], attend to Parayana in the   
Samadhi Hall [ 1 hour, two days], visit Matrubhuteswara   
Temple [see Sri Dakshinamoorthy and Nataraja there relaxedly],   
visit Palakottu etc., [ 2 hours], Giri Pradakshina [ 4 to 5 hours],   
and Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam [ 3 hours between   
themselves], browse in the book shop [ 1hour]. You can   
plan these things with proper spacing.   
Arunachala Siva.
