The master said, "My child, if you desire after God, God shall come to you."  
The disciple did not understand his master fully. One day both went to bathe  
in a river, and the master said, "Plunge in", and the boy did so. In a moment  
the master was upon him, holding him down. He would not let the boy come up.  
When the boy struggled and was exhausted, he let him go. **" Yes, my child,  
how did you feel there;" "Oh, the desire for a breath of air!" "Do you have  
that kind of desire for God?" "No, sir." "Have that kind of desire for God and  
you shall have God."   
-Swami Vivekananda.   
(Notes from a lecture 'Sadhanas or preparations for higher life')**

Once in David Godman's blog, there were some heated discussions   
as to desiring the Self can be had by a seeker, since all desires   
are to be overcome. Eventually, Godman gave the verdict stating   
that desiring the Self is only the desire, a seeker could have according to  
Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
