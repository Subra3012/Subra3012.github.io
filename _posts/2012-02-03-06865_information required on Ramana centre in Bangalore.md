## The future of God and science By Deepak Chopra

Guest editor Deepak Chopra on why God's future depends upon science, and vice  
versa - and why sages and scientists should meet.   
Which is more important in shaping your future, science or spirituality? For  
some this may sound like an empty question. Science has shaped our age;  
religion is a declining force in the West, as it has been for decades. A clock  
could be placed behind every pulpit, ticking off the thousands of people who  
leave organised faith behind, every hour of the day. But there is a growing  
movement that is repairing the rift between science and religion. It has  
nothing to do with the noisy band of atheists who continue to foment discord  
between faith and reason. Rather, science has reached a point where certain  
basic mysteries cannot be solved without resorting to the one thing that  
spirituality has always specialised in: consciousness.   
Science is dominated by materialism, a worldview that traces all activity,  
including our imagination and creativity, to physical processes in the brain,  
and these processes are either chemically determined or random, depending on  
which strain of materialism you confront. Spirituality, which is much broader  
than religion, is based on the assumption that a transcendent reality exists  
beyond the physical world. This is the domain of higher consciousness, or if  
you are conventionally minded, the home of the soul and God.   
To find a common ground could be difficult but one can try. The annual Sages  
and Scientists Symposium organised by the Chopra Foundation seeks to do just  
that by bringing together philosophers and scientists who are sympathetic with  
the search for a single reality that embraces science and wisdom. The  
worldwide financial meltdown is matched by a cultural pandemic of confusion  
and a desperate search for deeper values. A groundswell of knowledge and  
insight has been building. Its shared message is this: There is something  
else, a dimension of reality beyond the material world. Beyond us, but in our  
midst.   
Scientists who are willing to venture into speculative thinking, joined by  
sages from the world's wisdom traditions, who are willing to look beyond  
arguments about God, face the same primal questions. Where did the universe  
come from? What preceded the Big Bang, before there was either "where" or  
"when"? A century after the quantum revolution in Physics, science has to face  
up to the vanishing act that the physical universe pulled, as matter and  
energy were both seen to emerge from a timeless state that is either an empty  
void (which no one accepts) or a field of infinite possibilities, a veritable  
womb of creation (which almost everyone is beginning to accept, however  
offended science may be by learning that the world's ancient sages and  
spiritual teachers knew about this timeless domain long before Physics arrived  
with its exact measuring devices).   
The reason that your future and mine depends on the settling of these  
questions isn't what you might think. Science can proceed perfectly well in  
everyday affairs without thinking about "metaphysics," as materialists like to  
call spirituality. For its part, spirituality can keep appealing to  
individuals, one at a time as they arrive at personal crises, revelations, and  
awakenings. But what will be shortchanged is reality. Ultimately, worldviews  
are secondary. If X believes in Buddha and Y in thermodynamics, their two  
worlds can sit uneasily next to each other or simply not interact. But reality  
is a shared concern. It's also a topic we can't afford to leave to  
specialists. Where the cosmos came from means a great deal, because the answer  
will tell you where the human mind came from, and where it's going.   
Is the universe conscious? If so, then our minds are embedded in the cosmic  
mind. Is the universe evolving? If so, that casts human evolution in a new  
light, along with the origin of life. These are not specialist questions. They  
go to the heart of the human condition.   
Our intention is not to pigeonhole anyone as sage or scientist or to join a  
camp for ideological reasons. There is a struggle going on between science and  
spirituality that will shape everyone's future, and if we each decide to join  
in, a blending may occur with magical consequences. What could be more  
fascinating? Together a complete engagement of the human faculties promises a  
more powerful and realistic basis for humanity's next evolutionary leap. The  
third international symposium of sages and scientists will be held at La Costa  
Resort & Spa, Carlsbad, California, March 3-5, 2012.

## Topic: Sati & Pativrata

Why had widows to be burnt with their husbands in India?   
Is the idea that a woman exists solely to serve her husband really found in  
the Vedas?   
What did Bhagavan say about these subjects?

Dear Jyoti,   
How come you understand everything incorrectly? The widowed wives voluntarily  
entered the funeral pyre since they   
believed that it would give them salvation. But in course of time, when they  
were unwilling also and had desire to live,   
they were forced to jump into the pyre. This is where the trouble started.  
However all these things are things of past.   
Nowadays no wife after widowhood jumps into pyre. Either they live a spartan  
life and complete their life in the world   
or if they are young, they remarry as in West. If there are children, they  
concentrated on rearing up the children.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sriswaroop,   
I agree with you. Some of these practices were adopted in the ancient times  
with a purpose. But in course of time, the original   
purpose is lost. Because the world is deteriorating. The temple priests who  
are brahmins are smoking cigarettes and are eating   
in non vegetarian food. Some Jesuit fathers have been caught up in the act of  
homosexuality. Recently one Swami N. was videoed   
having sex with a woman.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sreeswaroop,   
Firstly, the priests of the temple should be employed in full time basis with  
a decent salary. Now that the   
government has taken over the temple administration, they should see to it  
that these priests are decently   
paid and on the condition that they should not do any other work, excepting  
teaching Vedas and Upanishads   
and other scriptures to willing students, when there is no temple work.   
Secondly, regarding appointments, the so called secular policy should not come  
in the way of appointments.   
Brahmins alone are qualified for the work and they alone should be appointed.  
But even these brahmins should\   
have good character and conduct. Can you see any administration of mosques or   
Walf Boards managed by non-Moslems? Why only for Hindu temples?   
Secondly, due to first and second, they will naturally not indulge in eating  
other than vegetarian food and resort to   
smoking or drinking. Traditionally chewing pan and betal nuts by householders  
are not prohibited. No tobacco please.   
So when priests are householders, they do these pan chewing in their homes and  
not inside or outside temples.   
When I say the world is deteriorating, I only discreetly pointed our egos  
have deteriorated due to vasanas and also   
the desire causing objects spreading all over the world.   
Arunachala Sivas.

Dear Sreeswaroop,   
I agree with your views. Proper selection, scrutinizing the applicant's  
qualifications, his knowledge in temple rituals are all   
necessary. We follow this rule in IIT and IIM selection but not in the case  
of priests!   
Narayana Guru was an exceptional case. He met Sri Bhagavan only once in  
Skandasramam. Narayana Guru was well versed   
in Sanskrit and Vedanta. He was never against brahmins but only again  
brahmins' oligarchy to control others. He had seen   
Sri Bhagavan and was immediately attracted by His state of supreme Brahman.  
Sri Bhagavan never asked him: Wherefrom   
are you coming? Where are you going from here? What is your name? What is your  
caste? What work do you do? etc.,   
Because Sri Bhagavan never considered any body / anything other than Brahman.   
Narayana Guru wrote Nirvritti Panchakam in Skandasramam itself and also wrote  
Municharya Panchakam after   
returning to Varkala.   
He is a great saint. His 155th anniversary was recently celebrated.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear krishnan,   
Mekhri Circle center was earlier the temple as well as discourse and  
discussion center. Now there is only temple puja there.   
The discussion, conference and discourse center is shifted to Post Office  
Road, Sanjay Nagar, Hebbal, almost on the northern   
end of Bangalore City.   
Arunachala Siva.
