Hi Friends,   
Upadesha Saram is a very important text of instructions for spiritual seekers.  
There is a detailed explanation as to how a person can find liberation and the  
various methods adopted by different people are discussed in detailed in the  
text. The importance of the text is known to the entire spiritual community.   
This is an attempt to discuss Upadesha Saram and how we can live it out. Ill  
try to stick to the opinion of Sri Ramana here, in any matter as otherwise i  
would be deviating and bringing out unintended meaning to the text. Please do  
keep me informed if i ever deviate. Also, this is an attempt to meditate on  
these teachings. So we need not hurry with the verses. We shall see them one  
by one, slowly and giving enough time for each verse.   
Lets together study this text in as much detail as possible and also meditate  
on Sri Ramana as the Self within. Since all of us here are Ramana devotees,  
lets all together discuss our practises and systematically explore the text.   
Love!

Dear Srk Udai,   
 Today is an ausicious day of kartika pournima.When i have seen your post i felt it as a spiritual gift from siva through you.   
You are the right person to do that because you have proper understanding of  
it already and you are having grip in sanskrit and English which are essential   
to present the subject in this forum.I request you to give literal meaning of  
each word before proceeding to comment on each verse.   
It will be much more interesting if people like Subramanian and Ramanaduli  
participate in the commentary simultaneously with you.   
I sincerely feel that this is a great contribution from you to Ramana devotees  
like me.Thank you.

Quote  
Verse1: kartur agyaya prapyathe phalam. karma kim param? karma tat jadam.   
kartur: The ordainer of results. God.   
agyaya: as per His orders.   
prapyathe phalam: The results are obtained.   
karma : the actions   
kim param : Are they supreme ? [Meaning is the law of karma the ultimate ? Who  
is the one who makes it happen then? ]   
karma tat jadam: Actions are jadam, dead lifeless entities.   
Maya is to think that through our karma we control the results. Yoga Vasishta  
explains this beautifully and the word it uses is: kakataliyam [Chance]. The  
example it gives is: There is a crow sitting on the branch of a tree which  
flew and a coconut fell... These are two unreleated events and people try to  
see some meaning in it by associating some rules of karma to it. It is just  
chance.   
The wonder is Maya keeps us under the illusion that through karma we have  
control over the results. This is an illusion. Maya makes it appear as if "if  
you work u get results". "if you do this u will get that" etc. .. As if we  
have what is called Free Will. But the Ego itself being a mere mirage... who  
is there to have the free will?   
Sri Krishna says in BG: Karmani eva adhikarah the, ma phaleshu kadachana. [u  
have right for the action, not for the result] he clearly states a fact of  
life. a simple law abt which no one can do anything. that we have control over  
the action but results are not under our control is simply a law. Whether one  
understands it or not, it is true. For example if i do not understand  
Gravitation, ill still fall if i jump from a building. Even so, whether i  
understand or not, result is not in my hands.   
Our thinking that karma controls result is maya. To control result, is karma  
an entity with life? What does it control when it itself is a dead entity. Sri  
Ramana says : As per God results are Got. Karma is not supreme, it is just  
jada, dead entity.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
Thank you for the encouragement. Lets present all our views [plz also correct  
me if u feel i am wrong] and include all our experiences.   
Just to make it more interesting i am not going to argue in this post. i  
will only present my view, and not pick up anyone's view and argue on it. That  
is to make sure, we stick to Ramana's teachings and not personal views.   
Love!

thank your for this post a very inspired idea   
I just pic up my german translation of the first verse....   
for me this verse is to be read (like any other verse of bhagavan) with the  
totality of the self, the hidden aspects of it, the obvious, the unchangeble  
heart..all I can offer to his words should be offered..   
what also is wonderfull about upadesa saram is that all verses always point to  
the highest,... always...   
he underlines very strong that action is a dead entity, this is the core for  
me....how do I understand it?   
for me this verse tries to wake me up to the fact that all my doing  
(everything I do) is dead and without substance of its own, no deeper meaning  
or nothing to gain from it, so I think in this verse it is about renouncung  
actions of any sort, and about surrender to the one who is the great doer...   
it is about a first glimpse that what I do is just a lifeless activity, that  
is not myself and has nothing to do with myself....   
it is like he says: please forget the actions, forget the activites you are  
identified with and realxe into the truth   
so this verse is about the activity of the ego first and also has the hint how  
we should overcome this: in simply seeing who is the doer and who is not the  
doer...

Dear Srk Udai,   
 I am presenting my point of view of ths first sloka.Feel free to comment ifyou differ.It is not a problem for me.   
Meaning of the first verse:Action is insentient.Action is not the ultimate  
reality so action per se has no ability to confer the fruit of action.   
Fruit of action occurs according to the whim of the ultimate reality which is  
usually called God.   
Comment:Bhagawan explains in the first verse itself why individual being  
performing the action is not the doer.So he is questioning the   
idea of doership in the first verse itself.If one understands the lie of  
doership the spiritual journey is over because without that lie of doership   
there is no existence to the thesis of ego.Action and doership are born out of  
self ignorance,self ignorance is insentient so all actions born out of concept  
of doership are insentient.Performer of the work is not the doer so the fruit  
of action is not in his hands.In the phenomenal reality   
Volition(Ichha Sakti),knowledge to perform the action(Jnana Sakti),energy to  
perform the action(Kriya Sakti) belongs to the ultimate reality   
but we superimpose those qualities on us resulting in doership(Kartrutva) and  
enjoyership(Bhoktrutva) anomalies.Action has no ability to confer the   
bliss which is not of this world.So action is not the ultimate reality.

Dear Srkudai ji   
First of all I would like to thank you very much for bringing this Upadesha  
saram. I do not have this book. Anyway, I have been thinking to ask this forum  
members to post some systems which we can observe in our day to day life and  
can proceed to our goal. I think my wishes are granted by Bhagavan. It is  
coming through you. And do not think, that you are doing arguments. This forum  
is open to all true seekers only. You are explaining very well. Especially I  
learnt more about my mind. When you and Raju ji were discussing, I learnt  
quite lot. You both were not arguing instead were discussing.It is like a  
sadas.During Adi sankara period also it was happening and even in presence of  
Bhagavan also it happened. When two learned will discuss others are geting moe  
benifited. So I welcome your views and discussions.   
Thanking you,   
Ramanaduli

Dear Srkudai ji.   
It is fine we do not have control on results. But we have to do the karma. In  
my last posts, I wrote we should do all spiritual aids. Are they also karmas.?  
If I do not have the doership sense is not it good? In the same way, doing  
atma vichara, we should not think the result? Please explain me

Dear Friends,   
 Let us continue discussing with the same verse for some more time.   
I am waiting for Subramanian ji's presentation on the same verse.   
It would be nice if we can add small stories from Ramana/Ramakrishna or some  
Saint's life which illustrate this understanding very clearly. And this is  
something Subramanian ji can do with ease and a mark of expertise.   
Raju and matthias : wonderful explanations. Please keep adding more.   
ramanaduli: Please add your explanations also. We are as eager to learn from  
your understanding as you are in learning from our explanations.   
All comments were so exceptional! I just dont have words to describe how  
wonderfully this topic is proceeding.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and others,   
I am giving my view on the actions per se, not the doership.   
Actions can be classified into four types. There could be other   
classifications too.   
Good acts produce Good results. But here it does not stop, it   
further produces anything good or bad. It is like stereochemistry   
of alkaloids and terpenes, complex organic chemical products,   
which produce innumerable chains of other compounds. Take   
Ravana. He did good acts of Siva tapas. He got kingship of Lanka.   
But this good result did not stop here. He abducted Sita and got into   
trouble. So the results are ad naseum spreading. Hence the good   
acts, "kartur" is Jada. Only God to decide. It is God who decides as the  
Master. One more funny example here. Lakshmana Sarma, WHO,   
who wrote his commentary on Sad Darsanam, was a naturopathist.   
He prescribed 21 days fast for a young boy who was deaf. He was   
confident of curing him but the boy instead of getting cured, died   
of starvation!   
Good acts bad produce bad results. I shout at my son for smoking.   
He stops smoking, but later I come to know that he smokes stealthily   
without any one's knowledge. Good acts produce bad results!   
Bad acts produce good results. The permissive sex in society caused   
AIDS, and the permissiveness somewhat stopped. Now, if medicine is found for  
AIDS, it may be a good result. But that medicine, would re-start the  
permissive sex, because of the safety it assures!   
Bad acts produce bad results. There are innumerable examples.   
Not reading well, the student fails in examination. But the same   
student, will divert his attention from studies and will become a great   
painter or a cinema actor! Bill Gates was a school drop out. Today,   
he is the richest man on the globe. Most of the Hindi and Tamil cinema   
actors were school drop outs.   
So the acts and fruits are not predictable. The concept of sin and   
heavan, hell etc., are all not predictable. Only God should decide   
what should be the fruit and not actions per se.   
Karmam payan taral, kartanadhu anaiayaal,   
Karmam kaduvuluo undhipara, karmam Jadamathal undhipara.   
(The Tamil version is for those Tamil knowing people, who do not have the  
book.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Given that karma cannot control results. Maya makes it appear as if the  
results are got as per karma. Maya is known to make the impossible possible.   
The best way to understand is... as in a dream. We all had dreams and in our  
dreams we thought that there was a relation between the action and the result.  
The truth however is totally different.   
There is an entity similar to Maya, in dream also, which makes sure a person  
does not wake up from the dream. It is a dream controller -- which tries to  
keep the person in dream. For example if an event that is totally unacceptable  
to a person happens, the person may break out of the dream... so this dream  
controller makes sure that the dream is not broken by adding a little spice to  
the events that happen.   
Maya does a similar thing in our day to day life. It makes things appear as if  
in total order. it makes things appear as if real.   
Now... the question like: Will i pass an exam without writing it ?   
Maya will make sure you will not pass the exam. .. that is the law of maya. if  
someone is passing an exam without writing it, then the person will clearly  
see that he is not the doer [as Raju ji explained] and get liberated. This  
does not happen. That is law. Otherwise where is creation?   
So, it is bound to appear as if totally controlled by actions. And caught in  
this idea, we try to "ACT" and correct things.   
Now comes the question: If results are not due to action, is there any use in  
spiritual actions? Well, the play of Maya is so designed that someone who  
surrenders to God finds a release. And someone who knows himself finds the  
release. If there are no clues to go out of the web of maya, then it would not  
be a game. it would be a sad fate.   
So prayer, meditation etc are very useful. We shall see as we study this text  
what kind of actions are useful.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
I gave the example of Lakshmana Sarma's naturopathy adventure.   
Major Chadwick, I already wrote about it, had written an English   
translation of Complete Works of Bhagavan Ramana, and was almost   
ready to have it approved by Bhagavan Ramana and published. On   
the last day, he found that plans were already afoot to publish Osborne's   
translation. He simply submitted the manuscript to Bhagavan Ramana,   
and continued his self enquiry, without any further emotions. Good   
acts producing bad results or no results.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
 When Sun shines the lotus blooms.Then who is responsible for this blooming.Blooming is happening occuring in the presence of Sun light.   
So neither the Sun nor the lotus are the doers of this happening.It is a  
natural law that lotus blooms in Sun light.It is in the nature of things.   
But mind tries to conceptualise natural events in it's language and says  
either Sun is the doer or lotus is the doer.If we closely scrutinise this  
logic   
it will be found that there is no doer at all,things happen as naturally as  
they should be.Mind always tries to translate the things that which it   
does not know into it's language of known by conceptualising.Concept has no  
substance in it and reality asserts itself.Bhagawan is telling   
what is real in the sphere of action and the limitations of action in this  
first verse and the futility of doing actions thinking that they yield results   
according to their expectation and wish.
