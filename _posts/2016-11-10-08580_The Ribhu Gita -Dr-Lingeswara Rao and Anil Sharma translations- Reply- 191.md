39. All is illusory. There is no doubt of this. All is only consciousness indeed.   
If the existence of cause is real, the effect will also occur.   
40. If non existence be, I am without non existence. Brahman alone am I, the refuge.   
All this is only endless sorrow. The undiminishing is unending bliss.   
41\. Life is endless and non stop struggle. Everything is total impurity. The  
beyond   
is endless purity.   
42\. Exceedingly evil is imagination. I am totally pure. Blemish is ever  
endless.   
Goodness is ever endless.   
43. Fairness is ever endless. Impurity is ever endless. I am ever endless. This is   
ever endless.   
44. Brahman is ever endless. The world is ever endless. There is no fear by what   
has been uttered so far. There is not the slightest difference as 'I'.   
45\. Real and unreal too are naught. Sentences that are considered as real and  
unreal   
too are non existent. They are non existent. There is no doubt of this -  
Brahman alone am I. There is no doubt of this.   
46. Cause and effect are all non existent. There is no doubt of this. So it is with doer, enjoyer and action; there is nothing to be enjoyed nor there is any contentment   
of enjoyment.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
