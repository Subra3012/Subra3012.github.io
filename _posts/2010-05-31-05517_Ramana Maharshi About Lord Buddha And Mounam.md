Disciple: Research on God has been going on from time immemorial. Has the  
final word been said?   
Maharshi: (Keeps silence for some time.)   
Disciple: (Puzzled) Should I consider Sri Bhagavan's silence as the reply to  
my question?   
Maharshi: **Yes. Mouna is Isvara-svarupa.Hence the text: "The Truth of Supreme  
Brahman proclaimed through Silent Eloquence."**   
 **Disciple: Buddha is said to have ignored such inquiries about God.   
Maharshi: And for this reason was called a sunyavadin (nihilist). In fact  
Buddha concerned himself more with directing the seeker to realize Bliss here  
and now that with academic discussion about God, etc.**   
(From Maharshi's Gospel, published by Sri Ramanasramam and available for  
download from http://www.ramana-maharshi.org/ )

Dear prasanth,   
Silence was itself Bhagavan Ramana's teachings. By reading   
Talks, Day by Day and Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, we   
tend to think that Bhagavan Ramana was always talking to   
visitors and devotees. It is not so. For His 54 years of life,   
He talked only as found in these books. Here again, Letters   
and Day by Day are having some repetitions. So Bhagavan   
Ramana's life is more on silence than on talks. For the first   
two or three years, He never talked even a word.   
Someone said that if one keeps record of all we talk in such   
50 plus years of lives, the books written from the records   
will fill up this entire world. Most of us are suffering from   
lingual diarrohea.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear sirs   
in the pali kanon there is one speech of the buddha, where two devotees of  
brahman seek him out to help them realize that brahman because their teachers  
are both telling different ways...   
the buddha shows them how their teachers are fake, because their heart and  
mind is not the same as that of brahman.   
and finally gives them a teaching on how to realize brahman...   
so like bhagawan he teached in a way that all seekers of every path can have  
maximum benefit..   
so I consider both the same in realisation, both are jnanis or buddhas  
whatever word fits better   
much love   
matthias
