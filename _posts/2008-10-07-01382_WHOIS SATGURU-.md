## when "I" ness starts in our system

Dear sir   
When do the "I" ness i.e. ego the false "I" starts in the system. I forgot  
mine. Now when I see in babies. at the age of 2 they are starting to feel. At  
2 they say this is my doll. She is my mom. Till that time they are pure  
without any stain. That is why we say children and Gods are same.   
This false "I" grows like any thing.It helps for survival in the maya jagat.  
The false "I" grows till it gets self realisation.   
But those who born brahma jnani this false "I" never grow. Am I correct.   
Ramanadli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 False "I"starts with identity with the body.It never gets self realisation.When the identity to the body and mind is nullified   
forever Self reveals spontaneously.This is the so called "self realisation".

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, the 'I' ness starts the moment   
you identify yourself as the body. In the morning as you wake up,   
you become aware of your body, which was absent during the sleep,   
and with that the 'I'ness, the false ego starts its game.   
Arunachala Siva.

It is the Sadguru who recognises a ripe soul and prepare him for self-  
realisation.Many feel that they can choose Sadguru but it is not possible.

Dear Raju,   
 No sir, it is not like that. Sadguru does not chose "ripe" souls !   
A person who has clarity can clearly find a right sadguru. People often say  
that Sadguru shall come when you are ripe no he does not. When we are  
ripe, we start searching and if we are sincere enough we find one!   
Love!   
Silence

In those days, the people whether ripined or not Bhagavan was atractng like  
magnet and He pushed them for self realisation. Many people did not ask Him  
any questions still they got benifited. It is all His compassion. He Himself  
is God.God came to take His children in Jnana Marga.Without His physical form  
we are drawn to Him. Just imagine if we see Him with our physical eyes His  
physical form. He is the embodiment of Shiva Himself.

Dear Ramanaduli, You are correct. Bhagavan says in Akshara   
Mana Malai, 'Nokkiye karudhi Mey Thakkiye, pakkuvam aakiye...   
Bhagavan a) looks, b) thinks about and c) gives diksha.   
In this process, He 'cooks' (Pakkuvam akiye....)the souls. Even   
if they are not ripe, they are cooked!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Do not feel ever disheartened. He "thinks" about who "think" of Him.   
This "mano diksha" is ever available, even after His Maha Nirvana.   
One day, you will sing: "Enna punniya seithen, Ramana, indha   
ramana duli, un arulai pera..." Again Manikkavachakar! He says   
in Kovil Tirup Padigam, Decad on Kovil, Chidambaram,   
O Siva, you have given me and taken this poor me!   
Who is cleverer in the two?   
I got from you limitless Bliss,   
What have you got from this lowly me?   
O my Siva, you have taken my Heart as your Temple, but live in   
 Tirupperundurai,   
O my father, you have taken my lowly body as your abode,   
What can gift can I give you in exchange?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramani ji   
I am very happy to know there is another dhiksha that is mono dhiksha. These  
replies are giving courage and guidence   
to do further. Once again I thank you, srkudhai and Dr. Raju ji. Bhagavan  
gives very tough test paper everyday. With His grace only I could overcome all  
the obstecles without loosing my awarness. Bhagavan took avatar like  
Dhakshnamoorthy   
He IS available to all the beings. Those who got their realisation were all  
fully dried sticks so as soon as the Jnanan agani   
Fell on'" it got burned. In my case I am still like a wet wood. The stick  
which I use' Pinam chudm kazhli', it gets burned so fast. leaving my thoughts   
If everything goes smoothly I feel I am with my SELF. Once I get problem, I  
will loose "self".   
NEE ENNAI THADDUTHU AATKONADA POTHINUM   
 NAN UNNAICHIKENA PIDHUM ENN ENNUL EZHLUNDHU ARULAVILLAI O RAMANA.

Dear Ramanduli, Bhagavan Ramana's life was the personification   
of silence and Sri Dakshinamoorthy. He taught as was done by   
the Adi Guru, in silence. Mouna vaakya... The sincere seekers   
understood the Self, Para Brahma Tattvam.... They had all their   
doubts cleared without asking for any clarification. Sishyashtu   
Chinna samsaya.....Dakshina also means in Sanskrit, the right side.   
Bhagavan always sat with His chin turned slightly towards right.   
If one stays in the South, and sees the Guru, who is the Spiritual   
North Pole, who is seeing the Southern direction, (dakshinam), and looks   
at Him and then on one's right, one will see the East. The East is where the  
Sun rises. The Sun of Knowledge can be experienced if you turn towards the  
north and then look at your rigtht side.   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan, one is: Sri Dakshinabhi mukayai Namah: Arunachala Siva.
