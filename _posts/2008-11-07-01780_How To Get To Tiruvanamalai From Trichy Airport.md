Dear Janet,   
From Tiruchirappalli airport, Sri Ramanasram, is about 200 to   
250 kms and it would take a cab about five hours, taking into   
account the conditions of Indian roads. If you know Tamil,   
talk to the cab driver in Tamil and he will cheat you less. The   
cabs should be available from the airport itself. Or come out of the   
airport thorugh a local cab and reach the cab stations which are   
lining up in different parts of the city. It will cost you about   
Indian Rupees 1500 to reach Tiruvannamalai.

Dear Mr Subramanian,   
Thank you very much for your reply. I dont speak tamil. Do some cab drivers  
speak english?   
I will be travelling in a group of five. Can the local cab accommodate five

Dear Janet,   
Yes. Local city cabs and cabs for long distance can accommodate   
five persons, excluding the driver. You have to speak English,   
there is no other go. But beware of excess fare. Travel in the   
day time.

My suggestions could be, if you travelling to India particular to visit the  
Thiruvanamalai, or bypassing India and make quick visit to the holy place. You  
have an options   
1) Get down in Bangalore, India and catch a KSRTC bus(A/c) to Thiruvanamalai  
that will cost you around Rs 500 it will take to nearly four hours to reach  
there.   
2) If possible take flight to Pondicherry and take a bus to Thiruvanamalai  
that will reach you sooner
