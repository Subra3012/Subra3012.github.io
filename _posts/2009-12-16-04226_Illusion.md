A master said to his disciple: By beloved disciple, this whole world is an  
illusion; use the stick of your discrimination and destroy this illusion; then  
you are free.   
The disciple became pensive and then asked the master: Master, are you telling  
the truth? Is this whole world really an illusion?   
The master replied: Have no doubt about it. Whatever you see is an illusion.  
Use your stick of discrimination and destroy this illusion. Be free.   
The disciple took a stick and said: This is my stick of discrimination. Now  
let me first destroy the illusion I see before me.   
The master sensed the intention of the disciple, quickly got up and fled.

The illusion of the reluctant Messiah!   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said: Practice Advaita, but not with   
your Guru till you realize that you and the Guru are one without a   
second.   
Arunachala Siva.

The story continues: The master went to another disciple and said: My beloved disciple, this whole  
world is an illusion; use the stick of your discrimination and destroy this  
illusion; then you are free.   
The disciple became thoughful and then said: So is there no reality anywhere?   
master: Brahman is real and the world is an illusion. So says the saints and  
the scriptures.   
disciple: Did the saints live in this world?   
master: yes.   
disciple: Then the saints are also illusions. Then whatever they said are also  
illusions; and since the scriptures are sayings of the saints, the scriptures  
too are illusions. How can we depend on the sayings of dream characters? When  
we have dreams do we rely on what the dream characters say and take any  
action?   
The master smiled, got up and left.

I'll continue the story. ..   
A few days passed, the disciple became a householder and was living a happy  
family life. .. and then once the things started going bad. .. everything  
started slipping. .. the house, his kith and kin. .. everything. ..   
unable to bear the terrible pain he started crying. .. he cried a lot. .. and  
then suddenly remembered his Guru's words. .. its a dream!   
and Lo! He was out of it!!   
Incidentally, something like this happened to me in dream. ..   
i was dreaming when some voice shouted : This is only a Dream   
and i woke up.   
if instead i argued "Sir, this voice is also in dream. ... ", then i would  
continue in the dream.   
Though a part of the dream. .. that statement "This is a Dream" is the only  
statement that can wake up the dreamer. Even if not completely understood. ..  
even the memory of it can save some day!   
Love!   
Silence

world is an illusion; use the stick of your discrimination and destroy this  
illusion; then you are free.   
The disciple said: So all the saints and scriptures of the world are also  
illusions?   
Now we are in this world and you say the world is an illusion.   
If that is true, then when we wake up we will obviously find the world to be  
an illusion. Then does it mean the saints and the scriptures are eternally  
false?   
The master smiled, got up and left.

But I think that the saint who got the dream of Bhagavan will not say that  
Bhagavan is only a dream entity. He has a reality and he can also appear in  
dream. We also sometimes get dreams of family members. Based on a dream the  
husband does not normally tell the wife: "yesterday, I say you in a dream, so  
from today goodbye".

world is an illusion; use the stick of your discrimination and destroy this  
illusion; then you are free.   
The disciple said: Then is there no reality anywhere?   
master: Brahman is real and the world is illusory, so says the saints and the  
scriptures.   
disciple: If what you say is true, then master, you being in this world is  
giving indications of the reality. Then within the dream world itself I am  
finding indications of the truth. Then what type of illusion is it which gives  
indications of the truth within it? If indications of the truth is there, then  
truth must be very near, behind the indications of truth. So I do not know how  
one can say that the world is full illusion. It seems to me that it is more  
appropriate to say it is part illusion with pointers to truth within it.   
The master smiled, got up and left.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. Seeing Bhagavan in dream, gives happiness in the dream.   
This happiness continues even after waking up. That is the real   
purpose and goal. Whereas nightmares cause tremendous sorrow   
and fear even after waking up.   
Arunachala Siva.
