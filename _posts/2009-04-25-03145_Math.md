Dear karthikeyan. M   
Apart from Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam Math, which speaks of   
Advaita of Sankara, (it was established around 7th century AD),   
there are several Saiva Siddhanta Maths, which are even older   
than Kanchi Math. These were started some time in 3rd Century   
AD, after Tiru Jnana Sambandha's birth. Some of these Maths   
are: 1\. TirupanandaL Kasi Math, in TirupanandaL near Thanjavur.   
2\. Dharmapura Adheena Math, in Dharmapuram, near Vaitheeswaran Kovil.   
3\. Tiru Jnana Sambandhar Math in Madurai.   
4\. Kovilur Math, in Kovilur near Karaikudi.   
Apart from these, there is one Andvan Swamigal Math in Sri Rangam,   
after the faith of Sri Ramanuja. There is Tirukovilur Math, started   
by Swami Jnanandha Giri, who spread the Nama Sankirtan concept.   
There is of course, Sri Ramakrishna Math, in Chennai with its many   
branches.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the post.   
This was the information I was looking for.   
Are there any older math since the time of Aalavandhan, Was Aalavandhan  
guarding a math, if then Ramanuja took over the Aalavandhan's duties to guard  
Vaishnava faith. Was he guarding only vishnu faith at srirangam or a math.   
How old is Andvan Swamigal Math in Sri Rangam. What is Nama Sankirtan Concept  
spread by Swami Jnanandha Giri.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Alavandan is one of the many gurus of Sri Ramanuja. Ramanuja   
came to Alavandan, after studying Advaita from one Yamunacharya.   
He found qualified non dualism thereafter where the philosophy got   
mingled with religion. He said in qualified non dualism also includes   
primordiality of Narayana. Both were religious gurus and also the   
guardians of the Math.   
Nama Sankirtan is where the utterance of Nama ie name of the god will itself  
give you liberation. All bhakti schools like Maharashtra bhakti saints like  
Eknath, Namadev, Thukaram and others had this conviction and they did only  
that.   
Arunachala Siva.

So far the story i read from the Ramakrishna Math Book was Sri Ramanuja's  
first guru was the great devotee of Varadharaja Perumal Temple, by the name of  
Kanchipura (a near exact/similar name).   
And Yamunacharya is nothing but Alavandan himself, but why should Yamunacharya  
teach Advaita philosophy.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
From what I have read, I still believe Yamunacharya was the   
Advaita guru who first 'advised' Ramanuja. But there are   
different versions about Ramanuja's life. Neverthelss, he   
was taught Advaita. But somehow, Ramanuja was not convinced   
about non-dual brahman. He perhaps liked nishkamya-karma and   
bhakti as more suitable to him. He modified non dualism, as   
qualified nondualism, where he said that the disembodied souls,   
who are meritorious, go to Vaikunta and do karma (like fanning   
Narayana and placing flowers at his feet) and bhakti (singing   
melodious songs) to him. Here, all these souls take celestial   
bodies for the purpose. At the end of the aeons, they all merge with Brahman  
i.e Naryana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the post, a little bit information obtain from the internet   
\   
Yamunacharya or Alavandar was a vishistadvaita philosopher in Srirangam.  
Ramanuja, one of the leaders of the srivaishnava school sought to be his  
disciple. He was born in early 10th century CE and was the grandson of a  
brahmin, Nathamuni. Nathamuni was a famed yogi who collected to the works of  
Tamil alvars. He grew up learning Vedic texts from Rama Misra also known as  
Manakkal Nambi and was skilled in mimansa. Sirvaishnavite legend relates this  
story--As a teenager he challenged the royal priest Akkiyalvan of the Pandya  
king (the name of the king is disputed). Akkiyalvan, when he saw the age of  
the youth, asked sarcastically "alavandara?" meaning "has he come to rule  
me?". He defeated Akkiyalvan by proving through the accepted rules of logic  
that Akkiyalvan's mother was barren, the king was not righteous and the queen  
unchaste. The king and queen, impressed that the boy has understood the  
shortcomings of logic, adopted him. In other versions of the legend, he is  
given half the kingdom. There is no historical record to show his reign so it  
is possible that this happened in a smaller village rather than the kingdom of  
Pandya.[1] After years of rule, Mannakal Nambi tricked him into visiting the  
temple of Ranganatha. There, he had an epiphany and gave up the material  
duties of a king and became a sanyasin embracing saranagati. He composed the  
chatushloki and Strotra Ratna at that spot. Mannakal Nambi handed over the  
reins of Natha Muni's school including the collected Divya Prabandha and  
renamed him Yamuna Muni or Yamunacharya. As he grew older, he was perturbed  
that he could not finish the tasks he had set for himself and asked Ramanuja  
to visit him. Unfortunately, he died before he could talk with Ramanuja.  
Srivaishnavite devotees say that his corpse had curled three fingers and when  
Ramanuja saw these, he understood the tasks and promised to finish them  
whereupon the fingers straightened.   
* The name of Parasara, should be commemorated on the earth by giving it to a person worthy to bear it.   
* Compose a commentary on Tiruvaymozhi of Nammalvar the most prolific of Alvars   
* Compose a commentary on Upanishads, Vedanta Sutras and Bhagavad Gita   
\   
I'm sorry but i want to know, how old is Andvan Swamigal Math in Sri Rangam  
are there any older maths since the time of Alvars.   
Are there any maths in Kanchipuram   
Thanks
