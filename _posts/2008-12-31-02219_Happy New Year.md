## Sakti Nayanar (One of the 63 Siva Saints)  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 26, 2008, 06:10:51 AM  
---  
Sakti Nayanar hailed from an agricultural family in a town called   
Virinjiyur, where river Kaveri was flowing. He had a great devotion   
to Siva and was constantly chanting Siva's names and visiting the   
temple everyday. He was known for his truthfulness and mad   
courage. That is why he was called Sakti (Power) Nayanar. He   
always carried a pair of tongs and sharp knife in his upper towel.   
When he saw a ruffian who spoke ill of either Siva or a Siva devotee,   
he would catch hold of that ruffian, pulled out his tongue with his   
pair of tongs and cut the tongue! The ruffians from the town or from   
outside town were afraid to go near Siva temple and the Siva devotees.   
In due course, with full devotion and surrender to Siva, he merged   
in His Effulgence!

## Tayumanavar Songs

I shall post on another two verses from Paya Puli, the Rushing Tiger,   
from Tayumanavar.   
All the six religions are like six rivers   
And they have to merge into you, the Ocean.   
You are the boundless ocean of Bliss, large and immeasurable,   
I shall be swiming in that Ocean of Siva-nanda.   
You also stay as the Essence in the hearts of devotees with   
 great penance,   
And spread all over the hundred crores of worlds in the universe!   
When I walk, when I run, when I stand still,   
When I remain in bed without any activity and thought,   
My heart will remain without move,   
And my mind will be dead in your Poorna,   
Let me sleep in the great dam of Sivananda,   
And sleep in you ever and ever till I merge in you.   
(Source: Tayumanavar Songs. Tamil Verses. Sri Ramakrishna   
Taponvanam, Tiru paraithurai, near Tiruchirapalli. Translation   
and Prose rendering, my own.)

One spring, the 'haiku' poet Bosho decided to take a trip to see   
the flowers in a certain place famed for its scenery. Along the way,   
he heard of a poor peasant girl noted for her devotion to her parents,   
Intrigued, Bosho went looking for the girl. When he found her, he   
gave all the money he had brought for his travel expenses. Then   
he returned home without having seen the flowers.   
He said: "This year I have seen something better than flowers!"

Zen Master Man-an wrote to a lay student of Zen: "If you want to   
quickly attain mastery of all truths and be independent in all events,   
there is nothing better than concentration in activity. That is why   
it is said that the students of mysterious working on the Way should   
sit in the midst of the world."   
"The third patriarch of Zen said, 'If you want to head for the Way of   
Unity, do not be averse to the objects of the six senses.' This does   
not mean that you should indulge in the objects of the six senses;   
it means that you should keep right mindfulness continuous, neither   
grasping nor rejecting the objects of the six senses in the course of   
everyday life, like a duck going into the water without its feathers   
getting wet."   
"If, in contrast, you despise the objects of the six senses and try to   
avoid them, you fall into escapist tendencies and never fulfill the   
Way of Buddhahood. If you clearly, see the essence, then the   
objects of the six senses are themselves meditation, sensual desires   
are themselves the Way of Unity, and all things are manifestations   
of Reality. Entering into the great Zen stability undivided by   
movement and stillnesss, body and mind are both freed and eased."

Ishida Baigan was a founder of Shingaku Mind Studies, a lay   
movement inspired by Zen Buddhism. Up until the time he   
was fifty years old, it is said, displeasure used to shows on Baigan's   
face whenever something offended him. After the age of fifty,   
however, he never evinced any sign of pleasure or displeasure.   
When he reached the age of sixty, he said: "Now I have attained ease!"   
Once someone asked him, "Are mind and essence different?"   
Baigan replied: "Mind includes both essence and senses, it has   
movement and stillness, substance and function. Essence is   
the substance, which is tranquil, mind, which moves, is the function.   
Speaking of mind in terms of essence, it resembles essence in a way,   
the substance of mind is un-minding until it is disturbed, essence is   
also un-minding. Mind is the realm of energy, essence is the realm   
of noumenon. Just as the moon is reflected in a tiny drop of dew,   
noumenon is inwardly present in all things, even though it is invisible!"

Zen Master Tenkei used to admonish his followers: You should be genuine in all things. Nothing that is genuine in the   
world, is not genuine in Buddhism. And nothing that is not genuine   
in Buddhism is genuine in the world.   
He would also say: See with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Nothing in the world is   
hidden. What would you have me say?

There was a certain merchant who was deeply impressssed by the   
lifty virtue of the Zen Master Hakuin. He used to present the monk   
with gifts of money and goods from time to time.   
As it happened, the daugher of he merchant had a love affair with   
a family servant, resulting in birth of a child. When the irate merchant   
demanded an explanation, his daughter said that she had been   
impregnated by the monk Hakuin.   
The merchant became furious. "To think that I gave alms to an   
evil shavepate like that for ten years!" He shouted. Picking the   
baby up in his arms, the merchant took it right over to Hakuin.   
Leaving the baby in the Zen Master's lap, the merchant gave him   
a tongue-lashing and left in a huff.   
Hakuin did not argue. He began to take care of the baby as it were   
his own. People who saw him also believed that she had fathered   
the child.   
One winter day, when Hakuin was out beggiing for alms from   
house to house in the falling snow, carrying the infant with him   
as he went, the merchant's daughter saw them and was filled   
with remorse. In tears, she went to her father and confessed   
the truth.   
Mortified, the merchant was totally at a loss. He rushed over to   
throw himself to the ground at the feet of Zen Master Hakuin,   
begging his forgiveness.   
Hakuin simply smiled and asked: "Has this child, another father?"

Goshu came to Zen Master Yui-e and said: I have been studying Zen for many years, but have not succeeded.   
Please give me some guidance.   
Yui-e said: There is not secret trick to Zen study. It is just a matter of freedom   
from birth and death.   
Goshu further asked: How does one pass through birth and death to freedom?   
Raising his voice, Yue-i said: Your every passing thought is birth and death. Thoughtlessness   
is freedom.   
At these words Goshu went into ecstasy, feeling as if he had put   
down a heavy burden.

## Miracles Do Happen  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 27, 2008, 03:24:50 PM

Desuramma alias Akhilandamma, who was serving food for Bhagavan   
Ramana, was in due course, desiring to take up 'sannyasa' by wearing   
ochre robes. She wanted to have inititation by Bhagavan Ramana, by   
one of the three methods mentioned in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai,   
that is either by 'look', 'touch' or through His thought. She narrated   
her intention to Chinnaswami, who said that it would be difficult to   
persuade Bhagavan Ramana in the matter, since He did not initiate   
anyone and further, even if He took an exception, many others like   
Echammal and Kamakshi Ammal would also desire to have initiations   
by Him.   
Akhilandamma kept quiet for a few months but she was eager to embrace   
sannyasa with initiation by Bhagavan Ramana. One day she had a dream   
where Bhagavan Ramana gave her vibhuti. She took this dream as a   
good omen, and then made the white sari into an ochre sari by dipping it   
in the red dye, dried up the sari and kept it in a vessel, closed it with a   
leaf and went to the Asramam next morning. She was scared as to how to go  
about further. She merely kept the vessel in the presence of Bhagavan Ramana  
and was waiting with bated breath. Bhagavan Ramana knew   
everything even without words. He came to the Hall, opened the vessel   
and looked at the robes, as if there was some food, and then looked at  
Akhilandamma. No one knew the implication. The eyes that burnt Tripura   
and also the karmas of devotees, the eyes of Siva-Ramana gave her   
inititation. Akhilandamma rushed back to her home and came back   
to the Hall in the new attire!

Once Zen Master Tenkei, was formally invited to become the teaching   
abbot of a certain monastery. He refused, saying: "Decadance has been   
increasing for a long time. Since the basis of teaching has been lost,   
how can anyone appear in the world as a teacher? So no more about it."   
The emissary bringing the invitation responded. "The congregation at   
the monastery only invites you to borrow you for the sake of the   
Great Teaching. Who would say that it is heteredox?"   
And he kept begging the Zen Master so insistently that Tenkei fianlly   
assented.   
The following year, however, Tenkei withdrew from the monastery   
on account of a certain incident. He said in a poem: Coming was fine, going is fine too;   
Flowing water, a floating cloud -- an individual mendicant.   
Why be led by the nose by the other people?   
Going along with circumstances, today I am leaping again!

Chosha used to come to participate in the special annual intensive   
meditation session with Zen Master Hakuin, every single year.   
Yet he never attained anything.   
Finally one year Hakiun said to him at the conclusion of the session.   
You come here every year, just like a duck diving into water when   
it is cold. You are making a long journey in vain, without gaining   
half a bit of empowerment. I cannot imagine how many straw   
sandals you have worn out over the years making this trip. I have   
no use for idlers like you around here. So, do not come anymore!   
Deeply stirred, Chosha thought to himself: Am I not a man? If   
I do not penetrate through to realization this time, I will never   
return home alive. I will concentrate on meditation until I die.   
Setting himself a limit of seven days, Chosha went to sit in a fishnet   
by the seashore. But even after seven days of sitting in meditation,   
without eating or sleeping, Chosha was still at a loss. There was   
nothing for him to do but drown himself into the ocean.   
Removing his shoes in the traditional manner of a suicide rite,   
Chosha stood in the waves. At that moment, seeing the shimmering   
ocean and the rising sun merging into crimson radiance, all at   
once he became completely empty and greatly awakened!

poems is not available today.   
Once a beautful young lady was looking at the picture of a skull   
on the canvas in an art festival. Yuren then wrote: Now you surely   
Won't pick up the mirror   
You have been looking in   
morning and night,   
Seeing that this   
is your real appearance!   
Once on seeing some smoke on the other side of the fields, he wrote: Looking over the fields   
I see the unknown smoke   
rising again today.   
Whose body will be   
the kindling tomorrow?   
Once a certain priest who had been living in borrowed quarters at   
the temple, accidentally caused it to burn down. On that occasion,   
Yuren wrote: Use such occasion to test   
the ultimate unshakeablitiy   
of the usually immutable mind!

Old Lady O-San attained enlightenment while studying with Zen   
Master Tetusemon. Later, when the great master Hakuin came to   
her province, O-San went to see him.   
To tesst the lady, Hakuin asked her about "the sound of one hand   
clapping". O-San promptly uttered a verse: Rather than listen   
to Hakuin's sound   
of one hand clapping,   
clap both hands   
and do business!   
When O-San was in her final illness, she was surrounded by her   
children and grand children, who sought some last words from her.   
She smiled and intoned a verse: In this world   
Where words do not remain at all,   
any more than dew   
on the leaves,   
Whatever should I say   
for posterity?

When Zen Master Gisan was given a title of honour by the emperor   
of Japan in 1806, he responded with these poems: HUMANITY AND LAW   
Self help and helping others: this trance of mine   
is dutiful at home and loyal in public,   
never obscured in daily affairs.   
THE BENEFIT OF BUDDHISM FOR NATIONS: Do not kill, and life will be sufficient;   
do not steal, and goods will be plenty;   
How excellent the moral teachings,   
they enrich nations and stabilize families.   
PROTECTING THE NATION: Whatever is bad, do not do;   
Whatever is good, carry it out;   
then above and below will harmonize,   
the good and the bad won't compete.

Settan once wrote a set of guidelines for Zen monasteries: "An ancient said that Zen study requires three essentials. One   
is a great root of faith. The second is a great feeling of wonder.   
The third is great determination. If one of these is lacking, you   
are like a tripod missing a leg."   
"Here I have no special stipulations. I only require that you   
clearly recognize that everyone has an Essential Nature that   
can be perceived. And that there is an Essential Truth that everyone   
can penetrate. Only then will your determination continue. And   
there are sayings at which to wonder. If people go off half aware   
and half awakened, they cannot really succeed in Zen. It is imperative   
to be totally careful and totally thorughgoing."

Izu studied Zen with Haikun for a long time. As a teacher in his own   
right, Izu inherited the harsh manner of the redoubtable master   
Haikun but was ever sterner. Whenever he would receive people,   
asking about Zen, he would lay a naked sword next to his seat.   
If they were hestiant or argumentative, he would chase them   
with the sword!

Before he went to live in the mountains, Zen Master Ranryo travelled   
throughout the four quarters, making no distinction between court   
and countryside, city and village, nor avoding even wineshops and brothels.   
When someone asked him whey he acted in this way, the Zen Master   
said: My way is right there, whoever I happen to be. There is no gap   
at all!   
Later Ranryo went into the mountains, where he built a simple hut   
and lived a life of frugal austerity as he continued to work on Zen.   
Especially fond of night rain, Ranryo would burn incense and sit up   
on rainy nights, even until dawn. The people of the mountain villages,   
not knowing his name, used to call him "the Night Rain Monk". This   
amused him, so he began to use Night Rain as a literary name.   
Once a visitor asked Ranryo about the relative merits of Zen meditation   
and the Pure Land Buddhist practice of Buddha-remembrance, reciting   
the name of the Buddha of Infinite Light. Ranryo gave his answer   
in the following verse.   
Zen Meditation and Buddha Remembrance   
are like two mountains,   
Higher and lower potentials   
divide a singke world.   
When they arrive, all alike   
see the moon atop the peak,   
Only pity those who have no faith   
and suffer over the climb.
