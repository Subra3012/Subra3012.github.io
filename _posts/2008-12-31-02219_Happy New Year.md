I wish everybody a happy new year 2009.It is time for reflecting on why there  
is continuous inner noise of mind beyond control   
and to find remedy for it.I feel self-enquiry is right remedy for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Thank you very much for your greetings. I take this opportunity   
to greet all Happy New Year. Let the new year, 2009, takes us   
all further closer to Bhagavan Ramana's fold. January 11th 2009,   
is the Bhagavan's 129th Jayanti Day, the rising of the Sun, the son   
of Siva, that never sets in our Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
