Dear Ramana,   
Jnana is pronounced as the letter Jna in Tamizh. Some people also used gnana  
in English.   
There is no direct single letter in English for Jna or gna. But there are  
several words in tamizh   
with the letter Jna or gna. Sri Bhagavan uses the words Jnamali - dog; JnimiRu  
= butter fly.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear ramana1359   
 am afraid you can never spell it! don't bother to try and spell it, there  
are no letters in English for the sanskrit letter -   
**ज ्ञ​**   
Rather its best to assimilate it by listening to it again and again or if you  
can meet some Indian, you could listen to him and get more clarity about its  
pronunciation. Its impossible to spell it! it could only be learnt only by  
listening to somebody.

Dear Jyoti, Sreeswaroop, saraskrishna and others,   
Why then all gods and goddesses have got only 2 legs? Even Skanda,   
with six faces and twelve arms, have only two legs. Why?

If it were Sage Ribhu (Ribhu Gita) He would have asked you what are hands and  
Legs.   
How do we know?

Dear Jyoti,   
I was talking about this incident in the prelude to the great scripture Ribhu  
Gita, where Nigadha, the disciple of Sage Ribhu gets perplexed when his Guru  
asked him What is 'I' and what is 'You' \- In the same way, what are limbs?  
what are hands and legs? Read this fascinating story -   
Ribhu Gita is knowledge imparted to Sage Ribhu in Kailasa by Shankara Himself   
Ribhu who was the son of Brahma was a wise sage. Nidagha, who was the son of  
Pulastya, was his desciple. After receiving teaching about Knowledge from  
Ribhu, Nidagha went to city of Viranagara, situated on the banks of the Devika  
River, to live. In a beautiful grove near the river lived Nidagha, who  
acquainted himself with all the devotional practices. After the passage of a  
thousand celestial years, Ribhu was walking along the banks of the Devika  
River and went to the city of Viranagara to visit Nidagha to see how his  
disciple was progressing. He did so in disguise.   
When Ribhu arrived, Nidagha had just performed the Vaisvadeva worship, which  
is a rite to please the gods that is performed prior to taking food, and was  
standing at the gate. Nidagha led Ribhu into the house to offer him food. When  
Ribhu's hands and feet were washed and he was seated, Nidagha respectfully  
requested him to eat.   
Ribhu said to Nidagha, "O best among Brahmins, tell me what food you have in  
your house. I do not like unpleasant food."   
Nidagha replied, "There are cakes made of rice meal, barley, and lentils. O  
Revered One, eat whatever pleases you most."   
Ribhu said, "These are not pleasant food. Give me sweet things. Give me rice  
boiled with sugar, wheat cakes, and milk with curds and molasses."   
But the sage, Ribhu, loved his disciple as deply as the later venerated his  
Master in the town, just to see how far the latter had outgrown his ritualism.  
At times, the sage went in disguise, as that he might observe how Nidagha  
would act when he did not know that he was being observed by his Master.   
After the passage of another thousand celestial years, Ribhu again went to the  
place where Nidagha dwelled. On that occasion, Ribhu, who had put on the  
disguise of a village rustic, found Nidagha intently watching a royal  
procession. Unrecognised bu the town-dweller, Nidagha, the village rustic  
inquired as to what the bustle was all about and was told that the King was  
going in procession.   
"Oh, It is the king. He goes in procession! But where is he?" asked the  
rustic.   
"There, on the elephant," said Nidagha.   
"You say that the king is on the elephant. Yes, I see the two," said the  
rustic, "but which is the king and which is the elephant?"   
"What!" exclaimed Nidagha. "You see two, but do not know that the man above is  
the King and the animal below is the elephant? What is the use of talking to a  
man like you?"   
"Pray, be not impatient with an ignorant man like me,"begged thge rustic, "but  
you said 'above' and 'below' What do they mean?"   
Nidagha could stand it no more, "You see the king and the elephant, the one  
above and the other below. Yet you want to know what is meant by 'above' and  
'below'?" burst out Nidagha. "If things seen and words spoken can convey so  
little to youm action alone can teach you. Bend forward, and you will know it  
all too well."   
The rustic did as he was told. Nidagha got on his shoulders and said, "Know it  
now. I am above as the king, and you are below as the elephant. Is that clear  
enough?"   
"No, not yet." was the rustic's quiet reply. "You say that you are like the  
king, and I am below like the elephnat. The 'king,' the elephant.' 'above,'  
'below' \- so far it is clear. But pray tell me what you mean by 'I' and  
'you'?"   
When Nidagha was confronted all of a sudden with the mighty problem of  
defining the "you" apart from the "I," light dawned on his mind. At once, he  
jumped down and fell at his Masters's feet, saying, "Who else but my venerable  
Master, Ribhu, could have thus drawn my mind from the superficialities of  
physocal existence to the true Being of the Self? O benign Master, I crave  
your blessings."   
Ribhu said, "O Nidagha, I am Ribhu. Pleased with your approach towards me  
previously, I came here to give you, O high minded one, spiritual instruction.  
I have briefly described the divine Truth, the essence of which is the  
nondifferentiaion of all.   
Nidagha said, "You are certainly my teacher. My mind has not been made free  
from dualistic bias by anyone else."   
Ribhu continued, "I had come here to impart to you the Knowledge of Brahman. I  
have shown you the highest Truth, which is verily the essence, That which is  
One whithout a second."   
The Ribhu Gita was one of the first books read by Sri Ramana Maharshi after  
His Self Realisation, one whose message clearly accorded with what he had  
realised within himself.   
The inner revelation of the"I"-less "I,"the one absolute Self, which is ever-  
existent, is essential in the destruction of ignorance, which is alone the  
substance of bondage and illusion. The teachings of Ribhu are to be understood  
as pertaining to the destruction of ignorance by that which alone can truly do  
so - Knowledge - and the revelation of Reality. The Self is the one Reality.  
This is understood by those who inquire into their own nature and know it to  
be free of the limitations superimposed upon it due to misidentifications. The  
text of Ribhu Gita is, therefore, useful both as a description of the  
ineffable and as a detailed explanation of what is to be meditated upon in the  
course of inquiring within oneself to know the Self as it is.   
(adapted from The Song of Ribhu, published by arrangement with Society of  
Abidance in Truth, California, USA)

Dear SLakshmi and others,   
All gods have only two legs, because the devotee should hold them   
tight as his refuge, with his two hands. That is the purport. My prayer   
to God is only to reach his feet, two feet only. Paadam is feet, Padam   
is Source,   
Iswara Tattvam etc., need not be bothered about. They are only concepts.   
In Chandi, Devi fights with Mahishasura, the bison headed demon. It   
is symbolic of man fighting his bestial nature. In Lalita, Devi fights only   
Banda, who is symbolic of ego. After conquering bestial nature, one   
should conquer ego to move further. Then you will realize the Source.   
How is the Source? This source is the most beautiful thing one can   
imagine. Because, she is Maha Lavanya sevadhi, a treasure house of   
beauty, With her jewels, her flowers, her smiles, and glances and her likes  
and   
dislikes - we feel the gracious presence of Lalita in the entire litany.   
Abhirami Bhattar says in his Abhirami Andati, a Tamizh book of 100   
poems, she is - azagakku oruvarum ovvatha valli... No one in the universe   
can show a candle to her beauty! arumaraigal pazhaki sivantha padam   
puyathal... The Vedas are under her feet and she walks over them and in   
the process her sole had gone red!   
One can beat the litany of Lalita and Soundarya Lahari and Abhirami Andati.   
Om Kaivalya pada daayinyai Namah: salutations to Her who alone can confer Kaivalyam, the state of absolute   
Bliss. [Lalita 625]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi and others,   
Soundarya Lahari is a poem of beautiful description of Mother. There   
are no fights, no asuras to be killed. It is all her beauty, she is sitting   
on a throne, where the four legs are Brahma, Indra, Vishnu and Rudra.   
She is Sadasiva kutumbini. She is the housewife of Sadasiva, with two   
children. Her eyes are lotuses, Her face is a lotus. Her shoulders are   
like lotus creepers. Her breasts are lotuses. Her waist is like a slender   
thread not able to bear the weight of her breasts! Her limbs again are   
like lotus creepers. Her nidhambam, that is the seat, is such a big one   
as if her father Himavan had cut huge boulders from Himalayas and gave   
them as her back. Only when Siva comes, she hurriedly rises and says: Be careful. All these guys are doing namaskarams and you may by mistake   
trip on the headgears!. Her walk, is another beauty, the swans are learning   
the walking from her!   
Arunachala Siva.

Abhirami Bhattar says: You are a lotus in the early morning predawn sun [called Arunanan

full of compassion. Your compassion-oozing eyes are lotuses.   
Your face is a lotus. You two hands are two lotuses. Your twin feet

**A respectable and orthodox gentleman asked about Sri Chakra.**   
 **M.: It has a deep significance. There are 43 corners with sacred syllables  
in them. Its worship is a method for concentration of mind. The mind is wont  
to move externally. It must be checked and turned within. Its habit is to  
dwell on names and forms, for all external objects possess names and forms.  
Such names and forms are made symbolic mental conceptions in order to divert  
the mind from external objects and make it dwell within itself. The idols,  
mantras, yantras, are all meant to give food to the mind in its introvert  
state, so that It may later become capable of being concentrated, after which  
the superb state is reached automatically.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Infact, Bhagavan Himself is Shaki. Some months back, when I was getting more  
involved in Ambal Prarthanai, somewhere deep inside my heart I felt a little  
worried whether I am going away from Bhagavan and getting inclined more  
towards Ambal (Stupid thing, but you see thats how the mind is) In all this  
confusion, I picked up some book and when I opened some page in between, the  
following appeared, as if Bhagavan was speaking to me directly and all the  
dubious games of my mind was put under rest confirming that Bhagavan Himself  
is Ambal and that Arunachala is nothing but verily Sri Chakra Meru.   
Quote  
> This afternoon, during a conversation regarding old Sankara Vijayam,  
> Bhagavan asked one devotee whether it was not a fact that amongst all books

IT ABSOLUTELY DOUBTLESS THAT ARUNACHALA HILL IS MERU ITSELF and Bhagavan is  
the very Shakti worshiped as Sri Lalita Tripura Sundari. Lalita Sahasranamam  
is verily another stotram which is nothing but Self Enquiry itself. All Her  
names only signify the the highest Brahman as revealed to us by Bhagavan.  
Evert name of Sri Lalita only directs to the Self.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes, its truly exhilarating experience. Here are some more information  
pertaining to Bhagavan and Sri Chakra (Ramana Leela) -

I have also read elsewhere from Sadhu Arunachala's recollections that Bhagavan  
had circumambulated several times around the Sri Chakra the previous night  
when no body was around. Later it was decided to build a wall on both sides of  
Sri Chakra so that nobody else could circumambulate the Sri Chakra after it  
was sanctified by Bhagavan circumambulating it!   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear SLakshmi, Sreeswroop and others,   
In fact, Saiva Siddhantam speaks of Siva-Sakti as inseparable   
concorporate. Saint Manikkavachagar says this beautifully in   
Tiruvachakam, Kovil Mootha Tirupadigam, Verse 1: {UdayaaL} your consort is within you,   
And you are within UdayaaL, your consort,   
Both of you are within me, let this slave   
Be in the company of your devotees for ever,   
Please grace this alone, O Lord of the Golden Hall,   
The unending causeless Siva! please confer this boon to me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear S.Lakshmi,   
In Mother's Temple, you can see several images inside the sanctum sanctorum.  
The one closest   
to the back wall is Maha meru, Sri Chkara in three dimension. Every Friday  
puja is done for this.   
Then comes Matrubhuteswara Lingam. On his right is Utsava Miurthy, Yogamba.  
This Yogamba   
alone is adorned in various fashions during Navaratri. There are adornments as  
Gajalakshmi,   
Annapurani, Simha vahini, Gaja vahini etc., Apart from these, there is  
Vinayaka and Subrahmanya.   
Sri Lalita Sahasranama can be chanted on all days and particularly in these 9  
days.   
durga saptasathi - there is a parayna methoid, The 700 slokas are chanted on  
the basis of   
some verses per day. This is called Sapta sathi parayana. Sapta sathi parayana  
should be   
followed with some naivedyam to the goddess.   
Advaitam takes Brahman as primordial and Sakti as manifesting power. The six  
religions   
classified by Sri Sankara keeps one god or goddess as Primordial. Saktam keeps  
Sakti.   
There she is Brahma swarupini. In Kaumaram, Muruga is Brahma swarupam etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.**
