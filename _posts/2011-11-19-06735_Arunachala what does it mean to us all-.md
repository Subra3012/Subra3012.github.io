## Know About Kashyap (One Of The Saptarshis In The Present Manvantara)

Kashyap (One Of The Saptarshis In The Present Manvantara)   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyap   
Theory   
Kashyapa was an ancient sage (rishis), who is one of the **Saptarshis in the  
present Manvantara; with others being Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama,  
Jamadagni, Bharadwaja.**   
He was the father of the Devas, Asuras, Nagas and all of humanity. He married  
Aditi, with whom he fathered Agni, the Adityas, and most importantly Lord  
Vishnu took his fifth Avatar as Vamana, the son of Aditi, in the seventh  
Manvantara.With his second wife, Diti, he begot the Daityas. Diti and Aditi  
were daughters of King Daksha Prajapati and sisters to Sati, Shiva's consort.  
Kashyap received the earth, obtained by Parashurama's conquest of King  
Kartavirya Arjuna and henceforth, earth came to be known as "Kashyapi".   
 **He was also the author of the treatise Kashyap Samhita**, or Braddha  
Jivakiya Tantra, which is considered, a classical reference book on Ayurveda  
especially in the fields of Ayurvedic pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics.It  
can be safely assumed that there were many Kashyaps and the name indicates a  
status and not just one individual.   
 **The Valley of Kashmir is named after Kashyap Rishi.** He was one of the  
Saptarshi and a Saraswat Brahmin by caste. According to Hindu Mythology, he is  
the son of Marichi, one of the ten sons (Maanasa-putras) of the Creator  
Brahma. The Prajapati Daksha gave his thirteen daughters (Aditi, Diti, Kadru,  
Danu, Arishta, Surasa, Surabhi, Vinata, Tamra, Krodhavasa, Ida, Khasa and Muni  
in marriage to Kashyapa.   
His sons from Aditi or Adityas (Sons of Aditi) were, Amsa, Aryaman, Bhaga,  
Dhuti, Mitra, Pusan, Sakra, Savir?, Tvastr, Varuna, Visnu, and Vivasvat or  
Vivasvan,who went on to start the Solar Dynasty (Suryavansha), which later  
came to be known as Ikshvaku dynasty, after his great grandson, King Ikshvaku,  
whose subsequent kings were, Kukshi, Vikukshi, Bana, Anaranya, Prithu,  
Trishanku, and finally King Raghu, who gave it the name, Raghuvansh (Dynasty  
of Raghu), and then further leading up to Lord Ram, the son of Dashrath.   
His sons from Diti were, Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha and a daughter  
Sinhika, who later became the wife of Viprachitti. Hiranyakashipu had four  
sons, Anuhlada, Hlada, Prahlada, and Sanhlada, who further extended the  
Daityas.

## Arunachala what does it mean to us all?  
Author: Anand Sundaram      Date: November 19, 2011, 08:54:59 AM

dear all,   
A lot has been said and will be said on Arunachala on this site. There have  
been and will be many debates on whether it confers liberation in this life  
,etc.Many will progress in their Sadhana while some may be stagnant or even  
deteriorate.   
Atleast for those who unfortunately do not progress in their, what Arunachala  
really does for them, it seems they may realise only at the time of death  
.Only death can prove or contradict the statement or clarify the statement in  
its correct perspective that Ã©ven thinking of Arunachala ensures liberation.   
But then the devotee will not be able to come back and report.   
I wonder whether Bhagavan made any categorical statement to this effect that  
thinking of Arunachala ensures liberation in this life though he did emphasise  
the efficacy of Arunachala in many instances.Devotees are requested to kindly  
give their feedback.   
From this it seems without going into whether true or not or what it means  
(i.e one interpretation could be that the darshan of Arunachala or the thought  
of Arunachala breaks the cause and effect cycle of life and leads us to the  
one way street of liberation without stipulating the time frame which could  
still span into some lives for us to work out prarabhda ), he expected us to  
simply concentrate on self enquiry or Arunachala smarana.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Dear Anand Sundaram,   
Sri Bhagavan has emphatically said that costant remembrence of Arunachala  
shall   
confer liberation. And this is also confirmed in Sri Arunachala Mahatmyam  
(Sanskrit   
And translated Tamizh). If anyone were to do doubt this, Sri Bhagavan said:--  
It is   
only due to one's lack of faith or ego sticking out its nose.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir,   
That point is well taken.   
But what does the thought of Arunachala signify ?Does it signify that our  
previous sadhana has now lead one to this path of self enquiry or surrender  
.(to Arunachala).   
Secondly what about the one who is casually introduced to Arunachala again  
possibly due to his past sadhana but who does not engage in active sadhana  
either self enquiry or constant contemplation due to his vasanas. Sometimes it  
may transpire though highly unlikely going by all our experience that in his  
entire life, he would have thought only once of Arunachala or seen Arunachala  
only once and that's that. Does not Arunachala have a plan for him for his  
emancipation. If yes,what and how could it be ?   
Regards,Anand

Dear Anand,   
Casually introducecl....no serious sadhana.   
The casual introduction, should blossom into cosatant remembrance. This  
constant remembrance   
will first pave way for Chitta suddhi and then to Self enquiry or Self  
Surrender.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir,   
But for this person with casual acquaintence would Arunachala facilitate,such  
that he slowly goes towards the path of self enquiry or surrender.Like for  
example giving him suffering which he can endure (again he can endure only  
through Arunachala's grace) and his vasanas get eliminated sufficiently and  
quickly so that he goes towards the path of self enquiry or surrender.   
This is of course a conjecture but could you throw light on this.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Bhagavan once said to his devotee Devaraja Mudaliar, "For everybody it is good  
to make circuit of the hill. It does not even matter whether one has faith in  
this Pradakshinam or not just as fire will burn all who touch it whether they  
believe it will or not, so the hill will do good to all those who go around  
it... .. . . Go round the hill once. You will see that it will attract you"   
The Seed is sown the very moment one has the darshan of Arunachala. One  
becomes ready for emancipation.   
All his life Bhagavan referred to the spiritual effect of the mountain. Once  
when he was asked why he had left his home and come to Arunachala, he answered  
that he had been drawn there by Arunachala itself. The force could not be  
denied. "Arunachala is within and not without. The Self is Arunachala."  
Another time, when he was asked about the nature of Arunachala he answered,  
"For the human eye it is only a form of earth and stone but its real form is  
jyoti (Divine Light) "Jnana"   
Bhagavan gave innumerable example which could be quoted, in particular his  
five hyms of Arunachala, but there is one thing that cannot be denied - if  
Bhagavan can be said to be said to emotionally attached to anything it was to  
Arunachala. He would just gaze constantly for long time unmoved from the old  
hall through the window. Bhagavan also often stated that the mountain is  
inhabited by Siddhars, who live on the hill in various forms, even as animals.   
Whether casual or not, when even once, one has had the darshan of the holy  
hill, Arunachala registers a stamp in the deep realms of the heart of the  
person which slowly and steadily pulls one closer to Himself and as Himself  
eventually.   
There is not a iota of doubt about this. Infact, Nochur Acharya says, do not  
even try to put effort to achieve devotion, just be, totally relaxed, don't  
even try to understand, the subconsciousness does everything. Just allow  
yourself to relax, do not even strain analysing about how's. Just Be, in tune  
with it. Thats it!   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear friend,   
Adding to all that Nagaraj has said, what is spirituality, but a chain of  
faiths?   
Arunachala Siva.
