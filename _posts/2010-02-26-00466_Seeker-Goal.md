The Brahmo devotee: "If everything is really being done by Him, youre not  
responsible for your sins."   
Sri Ramakrishna (smiling): "Duryodhana said: 'O Hrishikesh, I act as You,  
seated within my heart, make me act.'   
"If you have the right kind of faith  that God alone is the Doer and you do  
nothing, you cant commit a sin. The person who knows how to dance well never  
takes a wrong step.   
"But unless youre pure in heart, you dont even have the faith that God  
exists."
