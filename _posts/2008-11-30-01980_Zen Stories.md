A senior Zen monk and his disciples walked on the bank of a river,   
and were about to cross. The water was not very deep, but the   
currents were high. Wary of the current, a charming young woman, in mini  
skirts, was hesitating to cross over. She asked the group, whether   
they could carry her across. The Zen Master quickly picked her up   
onto his shoulders, transported her across the river, and placed her   
back on the other bank. She thanked him and left.   
As the Master continued to walk, the disciples coming behind were   
murmuring. One of the disciples, unable to hold to his silence, spoke   
out: "Master! The Zen scriptures say that everyone pursuing Zen   
should avoid any contact with women, but how come, you picked   
that woman up on your shoulders and carried her?" The Zen Master,   
looked at them intently and replied in a cool voice: " Oh! I placed   
her on my shoulders and left her at the bank, long time back! But   
you are all still carrying her in your minds!"

Dear Ramanaduli,   
**   
Yes. It stresses the fact that it is the mind/ego, which is the   
culprit. There is no doership in egoless state of the Jnani, the   
Zen Master here. It is also said by Bhagavan Ramana in Day by Day entry dated  
5th May 1946.
