Dear Jewell,   
So far as you mentioned Inchegiry Sampradaya's teaching in this branch and  
concerning your permanent firm interest into it i'm posting here some short  
notes about the pilgrimage I've recently come from.   
Our pilgrimage lasted for about two weeks and we visited something around 15  
places, I did not count. Some ashrams were very small, some bigger. The  
biggest and the oldest is Siddhagiri Math, that was founded more than 1500  
years ago by Revannath himself (one of those famous Nine Naths). It's a place  
from where our lineage started in the beginning of 19th century. The cave  
where Gurulingajangam Maharaj was initiated is still there but is not allowed  
for visiting.   
I was also impressed by Umadi, Bausaheb maharaj's native place, where some of  
his own personal things are still saved by devotees and they allowed us to  
keep those articles in our hands and feel their vibrations. It was interesting  
to look into the famous old well in where Bhausaheb Maharaj used to meditate  
for hours keeping his balance on two steel bars.   
Guru Renade's Ashram in Nimbal is also very nice, though it has strict  
discipline. They still follow 'ant's path', whereas Siddharameshwar's  
disciples all follow 'bird's path' which doesn't require much discipline. But  
Nimbal's nowaday 'father superior' is very-very nice person shining from  
inside. I don't like a word 'enlightened' but it suits very well if refer to  
himself.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj's native place, Kandalgao, is hidden in real Indian  
jungles. They say at nights tigers come from the forest and eat village's  
dogs. (In Russia wolves do the same). It took some time to find it. Now only a  
small ashram is there and a big tree planted by Nisargadatta's hand near the  
grave of his niece. It was joy to sit on it's large roots for sometime.   
I should mention also Alandi, Gianeshwar's Samadhi place. Gianeshwar is one of  
the most honorable Maharashtra's saints. He lived in12th century. In his early  
20th he went into live samadhi. This means he entered a cave and ask people to  
brick up the entrance. There was such a violent tradition of Middle Ages'  
India. Now a big memorial is there. Lots of energy as if electricity emanates  
from his samadhi place.   
And many many more sacred places which were interesting. But the best of all  
was close everyday communication with my Guru, Ramakant Maharaj, who organized  
the pilgrimage and took care of everythig. Though we usually sleep no more  
than 4 hours on concrete floor, eat spicy food which is not so good for my  
health and had to journey by bus for about 5-6 hours daily, I never felt  
disappointed or even tired and if it was possible I would go on and on this  
pilgrimage forever.   
Though, perhaps, it's still going on in a hidden form:).   
I don't claim to describe the pilgrimage in details, just try to convey by  
words that unique vibrating atmosphere (sphere of Atman:) that I was dipped  
into for that blessed period of time.
