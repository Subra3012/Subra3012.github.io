Sri Ramana, Friend of Animals, The Life of Cow Lakshmi.   
This is a very moving story about how the path of Lakshmi the cow and the path  
of Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi came together. There was an immediate affinity  
between the two of them which lead to Lakshmi eventually taking residence at  
the ashram because of her dedication towards Sri Bhagavan. Bhagavan  
reciprocated that dedication. The story tells of the ups and downs of  
Lakshmis life and her interaction with Bhagavan. Towards the end Lakshmi  
takes ill.   
________________________________________________________________________   
Page 66 and 67 of the book. Deliverance.   
Bhagavan takes Lakshmis head into his lap, holding her and stroking her face  
and neck. Immediately her breathing becomes steady. Bhagavan embraces her and  
places his cheek against hers. Then the two pairs of eyes meet and tears begin  
to flow down their faces. Those witnessing this intimate scene are unable to  
contain their emotion and begin weeping softly. With his face touching hers,   
Bhagavan strokes Lakshmi lightly. With his eyes fixed on her, Bhagavan places  
his left hand on Lakshmis head, with his right hand strokes her from the  
throat down to the heart centre. Time passes as he continues to massage her in  
this way. Then in a soft voice to her,  What do you say Amma? May I  
go?........   
Bhagavan says to Lakshmi, Wherever I may be, I will never leave you. I will  
always be with you.   
Lakshmi remains calm, looking up at Bhagavan. Her face communicates a self-  
possession that could only belong to a devotee of stature. She knows the truth  
of these last words from her master, at this their final earthly meeting.

This story as well as being deeply moving made me look at things differently: 1\. Animals can achieve liberation.   
2\. Even if our efforts dont appear to be making headway, keep working at it  
because sometime in the future they will. Even though it may not necessarily  
be in this life. This is linked to Nagammas words on page 76 of the book.   
Its only because of steadfast longing for divine guidance in the past that we  
have gained access to Bhagavan now.

Dear paul,   
Very true. Even animals and plants can have liberation. What is   
necessary is only a vasana-free mind. It is with vasanas that   
we get into all problems in life. There is an interesting anecdote   
about Cow Lakshmi's case. When Bhagavan Ramana was with   
Mother Azhagamma, keeping one hand on her chest and another   
on her head, and caused subsidence of all vasanas. He lifed His   
hands only after mind and prana merged in Heart. In Cow Lakshmi's   
case, Bhagavan Ramana did not stay with her, till her last breath.   
When someone asked why that difference, Bhagavan Ramana replied: Why should  
I? She had no vasanas left, even before her   
last breath. Hence there was no need to stay till end.   
There is one story in Arunachala Puranam. There was one   
cactus-bush on the Hill. It was waiting for deliverence. When   
Uma came to the Hill, for doing penance to get half the form of   
Annamalai, she accidentally trampled on the cactus bush. The   
bush caught fire and got destroyed, with one huge flame rising   
about in the sky and reaching the Hill, to convey its deliverence   
to Uma!   
Arunachala Siva.
