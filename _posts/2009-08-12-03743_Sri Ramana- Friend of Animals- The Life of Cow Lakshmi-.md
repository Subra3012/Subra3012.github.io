Sri Ramana, Friend of Animals, The Life of Cow Lakshmi.   
This is a very moving story about how the path of Lakshmi the cow and the path  
of Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi came together. There was an immediate affinity  
between the two of them which lead to Lakshmi eventually taking residence at  
the ashram because of her dedication towards Sri Bhagavan. Bhagavan  
reciprocated that dedication. The story tells of the ups and downs of  
Lakshmis life and her interaction with Bhagavan. Towards the end Lakshmi  
takes ill.   
________________________________________________________________________   
Page 66 and 67 of the book. Deliverance.   
Bhagavan takes Lakshmis head into his lap, holding her and stroking her face  
and neck. Immediately her breathing becomes steady. Bhagavan embraces her and  
places his cheek against hers. Then the two pairs of eyes meet and tears begin  
to flow down their faces. Those witnessing this intimate scene are unable to  
contain their emotion and begin weeping softly. With his face touching hers,   
Bhagavan strokes Lakshmi lightly. With his eyes fixed on her, Bhagavan places  
his left hand on Lakshmis head, with his right hand strokes her from the  
throat down to the heart centre. Time passes as he continues to massage her in  
this way. Then in a soft voice to her,  What do you say Amma? May I  
go?........   
Bhagavan says to Lakshmi, Wherever I may be, I will never leave you. I will  
always be with you.   
Lakshmi remains calm, looking up at Bhagavan. Her face communicates a self-  
possession that could only belong to a devotee of stature. She knows the truth  
of these last words from her master, at this their final earthly meeting.

This story as well as being deeply moving made me look at things differently: 1\. Animals can achieve liberation.   
2\. Even if our efforts dont appear to be making headway, keep working at it  
because sometime in the future they will. Even though it may not necessarily  
be in this life. This is linked to Nagammas words on page 76 of the book.   
Its only because of steadfast longing for divine guidance in the past that we  
have gained access to Bhagavan now.

Dear paul,   
Very true. Even animals and plants can have liberation. What is   
necessary is only a vasana-free mind. It is with vasanas that   
we get into all problems in life. There is an interesting anecdote   
about Cow Lakshmi's case. When Bhagavan Ramana was with   
Mother Azhagamma, keeping one hand on her chest and another   
on her head, and caused subsidence of all vasanas. He lifed His   
hands only after mind and prana merged in Heart. In Cow Lakshmi's   
case, Bhagavan Ramana did not stay with her, till her last breath.   
When someone asked why that difference, Bhagavan Ramana replied: Why should  
I? She had no vasanas left, even before her   
last breath. Hence there was no need to stay till end.   
There is one story in Arunachala Puranam. There was one   
cactus-bush on the Hill. It was waiting for deliverence. When   
Uma came to the Hill, for doing penance to get half the form of   
Annamalai, she accidentally trampled on the cactus bush. The   
bush caught fire and got destroyed, with one huge flame rising   
about in the sky and reaching the Hill, to convey its deliverence   
to Uma!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tenth Man-a funny tale with high philosophy  
Author: arcsekar            Date: July 19, 2009, 12:20:25 PM  
---  
There was a Guru with ten stupid students.He asked the students to cross the  
river and wait for him on the other bank.He warned them about   
the depth and current of the river. Asked them to exercise care and caution.   
The scary students mangaged to cross the river and reached the other side of  
the river.Out of anxiety,they wanted to check about safe arrival of the entire  
group of ten.The first one proceeded without first counting himself and ended  
up with ""Nine"önly.Startled, they organised recounting, but the score never  
crossed Nine ;because each of them inadvertently omitted to include himself in  
the count.They cried in chorus about the loss of one of their team members and  
cursed the river.   
At last, the Guru came on the scene.He understood their problem. He gave a  
blow to each of the students to call out numbers.One..Two..Three   
the last one shouted Ten. The total tallied.Students beamed with joy that all  
of them are very much alive and kicking.Thus the Guru solved a   
non-existent problem.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to narrate this funny story to explain the need for Self  
Enquiry.   
In the book Kaivalya Navaneetham (Tamil) published by Sri Ramanashram,the  
philosophy underlying the story is well expounded.   
 Story line Philosophy   
a)Every student forgetting to count himself  
a)Ignorance of Self -Agnanam.We disregard the Self and direct our thoughts   
 on other objects exeternal to us   
b)Tenth Man not found  
b)Illusion-Maya. Mind filters the Reality. Unreal things appear as Real   
c)Crying over the missing person  
c)Wrong identification--Vikshepa. We identify ourselves with Body/Mind   
 Jeeva Bodam- and undergo sufferings.   
d)Guru asked the students to call out numbers  
d)Indirect knowledge-Paroksha Gnanam-Guru can only give some   
 techniques to find out the Truth.Seeker has to work out the same   
e)Joy of students, when they discovered the tenth student e)Direct  
knowledge-Aparoksha Gnanam.Bliss of Self. The tenth man was   
 only a rediscovery of what was already there.We are always the Self   
 before and after realisation.When realisation dawns we regain the happy   
 state which is our Nature.   
Therefore, let us keep our attention always on the Self and be happy.
