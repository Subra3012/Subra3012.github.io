Mind and Psychology: How we seek to heal the mind depends upon how we look at the mind. The Yogic  
view of psychology,   
with its emphasis on consciousness rather than mind as our real being is also  
different.   
Psychology belongs to the mind and the mind can have psychological diseases  
and imbalances, just as   
the body can have physical diseases and imbalances. A person's psychology  
reflects the condition of   
his mind, its tendencies and qualities. The mind always has a psychology  
because it is a product of time   
and outer experiences, which leave their characteristic marks upon it. They  
are classified in Ayurveda   
and Yogic psychology according to the Gunas, (sattva, rajas, and tamas),  
Doshas (vata, pitta and   
kapha), the five elements and other energetic factors.   
Our true Self or Purusha, however, does not have a psychology because it is  
unconditioned consciousness,   
the witness outside of time and the mind. It is beyond all form and  
qualities. While the mind has mental activity, the inner Being consists of  
pure unmodified awareness only, like a mirror. This means that if we can go  
deeply into our awareness to our inner being and light of consciousness, we  
can move beyond all psychological suffering. The ultimate Yogic solution to  
psychological problems is to raise our awareness   
to the inner consciousness beyond mind and its dualities. Though many outer  
factors of diet, behavior,   
the breath and the senses, can help, it ultimately requires a revolution in  
our awareness itself from a mind based consciousness to pure consciousness  
itself, from Chitta to Chit.
