Dear everyone, there is equally an excellent website called   
www.davidgodman.org. In this, there is also a forum in the form

Stilling of thought in waking state amounts to knowing the self.   
For stilling of thought self-enquiry is the best way.

Dear Sankar and others, When one starts unlearning,   
the Truth will shine. Any amount of book knowledge   
will not help. In Viveka Choodamani, Sankara speaks   
about 'three sticking'. The sticking to the body, the   
sticking to wife, children and family and the sticking   
to books! This Eeashana thrayam should go.   
Arunchala Siva.

Dear Sankar and others,   
Research is searching outside, for something unknown, through   
books, lab equipments etc., This is fruitless, without searching   
the known, inside. If you know the Heart, you know everything   
in the world. That is how Bhagavan was able to explain the   
theory of relativity to a questioner, who was having a lot of   
book knowledge!

Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: August 15, 2008, 10:19:37 AM

I-am-the-body idea is the primal ignorance.It is the vritti on which all other  
vrittis arise and so dependent on it.   
Once the mind tastes the self-knowledge there is formation of Atmakara vritti  
or Brahmakara vitti which strengthens   
day by day with spiritual practice which finally annihilates "I-am-the-body-  
idea" along with it's progeny of other vrittis.   
Once "I-am-the-body-idea" is annihilated there is spontaneous revelation of  
the ultimate reality.   
Annihilation of "I-am-the-body-idea"amounts to killing of the ego.If it is not  
annihilated self-ignorance perpetuates   
with it's consequent misery.

Dear Sankar, there are two posts from you, one on 'Stay' and another   
on 'Stay at Ashram'. In this connection, one 'seeker' has already asked how  
to go to Tiruvannamalai. Several forum members have given replies   
about going to Tiruvannamalai and staying in the Asram. I have also given my
