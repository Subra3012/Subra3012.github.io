In one song he warns against the trouble which would follow if one delights in  
the company of unawakened   
tamasic people but reassures us that the suffering will be over if one listens  
to the words of the awakened   
ones. He seeks refuge in the Lord so that the mind's mischief may end. He  
laments that he has not yet   
attained the ability to see the Light which manifests as the phenomenal world.  
He asks if it is due his   
past misdeeds that the free state of inner silence is yet denied to him. He  
sings about the state of sleeping   
without sleep. Elsewhere he asks the Lord: 'Is there any support except You  
to cause the play of ignorance   
to cease, and to cause me to fade away little by little and abide in Siva Yoga  
Samadhi, obtain Your Grace   
and reach the goal of life?'   
Achuthananda, in yet another of his songs, asks the Lord if he can only see  
Him through His strength   
and if this means that he can never see Him by his own ability. He sings the  
praise of all pervasive   
Perfect One, Who is the Sound of Pure Space, in the Vedic mantras, in the  
great Advaitic teaching   
and in the transcendental turiya state and Who is the First Cause of  
everything? He wonders when he   
will receive in solitude the darshan (vision) of the all pervasive, blissful  
Lord and bathe in the surging   
flood of transcendental, supreme silence of Jnana.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
