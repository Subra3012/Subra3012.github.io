Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Being and non-being are the same!   
Buddha called it Maha-Sunya and Sankara called it   
Maha-Ananda. The dual thoughts are only for those   
who have not found the goal. Being and nonbeing are   
the two sides of the same coin.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramanian,   
 Truth is infinite reality with self-effulgent,self-revealing conscious existence.Nothingness is like a shadow of infinite reality,so   
nothingness is also infinite but it is without stamp of self-knowledge,so it  
is not the ultimate Truth.Nothingness is not an illusion,it is the creator of  
illusion.   
Nothingness is not false,it is an agent which confers false  
impressions.Nothingness is not unreal,it makes the real appear as unreal and  
the   
unreal appear as the real.Nothingness is not duality,it is the entity which  
causes duality.It is the real infinite creator of unreal,finite things.   
The whole evolutionary process is within the domain of imagination which is  
nothingness.The consciousness cannot remain content with the   
identification with the imagined part of a really indivisible totality.This  
compels the consciousness to go beyond imagination.Cessation of imagination is  
the awakenng into the Truth-consciousness.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Hence, Being and Nonbeing   
are the two sides of the same coin. Perhaps this is why some   
ancient Tamil scholar said: "Kanndavar Vindilar, Vinadavar   
Kandilar", meaning, whose who have seen do not speak and   
those who have been speaking do not see.   
Arunachala Siva.
