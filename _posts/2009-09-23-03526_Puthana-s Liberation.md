Puthana is the demon, sent by Kamsa to kill young child   
Krishna, when he was hardly 2 years old in Gokulam. The   
demon came in the guise of a beautiful woman, with large   
breasts, which she had smeared with dangerous poison.   
She came to feed Krishna and without even asking mother   
Yasoda's permission, she took Krishna on her laps and gave   
her right breast for suckling.   
Krishna the all-knowing, sucked her right breast in such a way   
that she started crying: Munja, munja, alam, alam.... She   
died and suddenly the form became a large lady of gigantic   
proportions. When Yadavas burnt her body, nice fragrant   
smell came out as if sandal wood was burning.   
Nochur Venkataraman gives a beautiful explanation. She   
came to feed Krishna but knew that she would die. She thought   
the best way was to surrender to Him. She gave her right   
breast, (symbolic of the I thought). As Krishna sucked her   
ego, she felt that it was all over, she was ready for liberation.   
She cried: Munja, munja alam alam, it is enough, leave me!   
My ego is extinguished, leave me, let me attain liberation,   
with your touch or diksha!   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a sloka meaning "Hey Balakrishna,the one who innocently bites the  
nipple of Devaki with his two milk teeth flowered like Thumbai-a kind of tulip  
flower,while drinking milk from her and as Devaki shrieked in pain chuckles  
by glancing her secretly-May that Bala Krihsna protect t us' "   
May be from Krishnakarnamritham composed by Bilvamangala swamigal or elsewhere  
from. I will be obliged if some one can find out the sanskrit verse. Mr.R.  
S.-- perhaps you can help.
