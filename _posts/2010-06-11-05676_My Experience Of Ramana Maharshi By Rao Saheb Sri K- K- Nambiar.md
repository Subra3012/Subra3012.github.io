**IV (Selections from the Math Diary)   
Volume 5,Questions and Answers  
**Q.Is the division of time into four Yugas astronomical or arbitrary  
calculation?   
A.There is no mention of such divisions in the Vedas. They are arbitrary  
assumptions of Paurânika times.   
Q.What should be our highest ideal of character?   
A.Renunciation.**   
Q.Brahman and Maya cannot be cognised simultaneously. How could the absolute  
reality of either be proved as arising out of the one or the other?   
A.It could be proved only by realisation. **When one realises Brahman, for  
him Maya exists no longer, just as once the identity of the rope is found out,  
the illusion of the serpent comes no more.**   
Q.What is Maya?   
A.There is only one thing, call it by any namematter, or spirit. It is  
difficult or rather impossible to think the one independent of the other. This  
is Maya, or ignorance.   
Q.What is the proof of the self in us not being the product of the body etc.?   
 **A.The "ego" like its correlative "non-ego", is the product of the body,  
mind etc. The only proof of the existence of the real Self is realisation.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says purity of mind is required before practising Yoga

**VII GURU, AVATARA, YOGA, JAPA, SEVA   
Volume 5,Questions and Answers  
Q.Is not Yoga an easy path to that?   
A.(Jokingly) You have said well, I see!Yoga an easy path! **If your mind be  
not pure and you try to follow Yoga, you will perhaps attain some supernatural  
power, but that will be a hindrance. Therefore purity of mind is the first  
thing necessary.**   
Q.How can this be attained?   
A.By good work. Good work is of two kinds, positive and negative. "Do not  
steal"that is a negative mandate, and "Do good to others"is a positive one.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Few Swami Vivekananda Selected Sayings and Utterances  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 10, 2010, 10:12:37 AM

SAYINGS AND UTTERANCES   
Volume 5, Sayings and Utterances   
1\. Man is born to conquer nature and not to follow it.   
2\. When you think you are a body, you are apart from the universe; when you  
think; you are a soul, you are a spark from the great Eternal Fire; when you  
think you are the Âtman (Self), you are All.   
4\. Strength is in goodness, in purity.   
6\. You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.   
 **15\. To believe that mind is all, that thought is all is only a higher  
materialism.**   
18\. As soon as you make a sect, you protest against universal brotherhood.  
Those who really feel universal brotherhood do not talk much, but their very  
actions speak aloud.   
28\. Have charity towards all beings. Pity those who are in distress. Love all  
creatures. Do not be jealous of anyone. Look not to the faults of others.   
 **31\. There is really but one Self in the universe, all else is but Its  
manifestations.**   
 **36\. Of all the scriptures of the world it is the Vedas alone that declare  
that even the study of the Vedas is secondary. The real study is "that by  
which we realise the Unchangeable". And that is neither reading, for  
believing, nor reasoning, but superconscious perception, or Samâdhi.**   
41\. Let me die a true Sannyâsin as my Master did, heedless of money, of  
women, and of fame! And of these the most insidious is the love of fame!   
 **43. "This is a great land," said Swamiji on one occasion in America, "but I  
would not like to live here. Americans think too much of money. They give it  
preference over anything else. Your people have much to learn. When your  
nation is as old as ours, you will be wiser."**   
59\. Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone.   
67\. Never loved a husband the wife for the wife's sake or the wife the  
husband for the husband's sake. It is God in the wife the husband loves, and  
God in the husband the wife loves. It is God in every one that draws us to the  
one we love, God in everything and in everybody that makes us love. God is the  
only love.   
69\. In everyone is God, the Atman; all else is but dream, an illusion.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ My Experience Of Ramana Maharshi By Rao Saheb Sri K. K. Nambiar  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:49:52 AM

**It was in the year 1933 that a friend of mine spoke to me about Bhagavan Sri  
Ramana Maharshi and suggested that I should meet him.**   
On reaching Sri Ramanasramam,I went direct to where Sri Bhagavan was seated,  
prostrated myself before him and sat down on the floor at some distance.   
 **One or two incidents during this period may be recounted here, miracles to  
the faithful, but casual coincidences to the sceptics.   
One evening in the year 1936 when I visited the Ashram I decided to ask an  
important question of Sri Bhagavan concerning certain spiritual practices. But  
amidst the solemn hours of Veda Parayana in the evening and during meditation  
that followed I could not make up my mind to ask the question,and returned  
home somewhat disappointed.**   
 **Early next morning, when I was lying half awake, Sri Bhagavan appeared  
before me in a dream and answered the very question which I had failed to put  
to him the previous evening. And before he vanished he also told me that he  
wanted a note-book.** I said I had only one readily available and that it was  
of the octavo pocket-size. He said it was enough. I woke up with a pleasant  
thrill.   
**The dream or vision, whatever one may call it, made such a deep impression  
on my mind that I could not delay carrying out the behest, however strange it  
might seem. After early bath and ablutions I traced out the pocket note-book  
and hurried to the Ashram.** Prostrating myself before Sri Bhagavan as usual,  
I handed over the note-book to him. He received it smiling, and asked me why I  
took it to him, when I related to him, in a whisper, all about my dream.   
**Immediately he called his personal attendant, the late Madhavaswami, and  
remarked to him Did I not ask you last evening to fetch a good notebook to  
write down a Malayalam translation of the Sanskrit text of Sri Ramana Gita?  
You didnt bring one. Here is Nambiar who has brought it for me. It seems he  
had a dream in which I asked him for the book, and he has brought it.** This  
incident aroused a great deal of interest among the devotees.   
 **On another occasion in the same year I dreamt of Maharshi as seated on his  
couch as usual, surrounded by a number of devotees seated on the floor and  
engaged in meditation. Among them I recognised a young devotee from Goa,  
seated in padmasana performing pranayama.** I think he was known by the name,  
Sridhar. While he was doing pranayama, I saw, in the dream, sparks of fire  
rising from the base of his vertebral column up to his head. **Bhagavan,who  
was watching this practicant, interjected There is no need for all this  
gymnastics with breath-control. It is easier and safer to follow the method of  
Self-enquiry as enunciated by me. That is the sum and substance of the dream  
I had.Next day, when I went to the Ashram, I sought out this young Goanese  
Swami. I had no previous acquaintance with him and no occasion even to speak  
to him before. I gave him a full description of the dream I had.** He was  
visibly moved and, somewhat to my embarrassment, embraced me with delight in  
the North Indian fashion.   
**He said Brother, I was all the while waiting for an opportunity to ask  
Bhagavan whether I should continue or give up this practice of pranayama which  
I have been steadily carrying on for the past several years.** Indeed, last  
night while sitting in the presence of Sri Bhagavan I eagerly awaited an  
opportunity to put him the question but I couldnt find a suitable occasion  
for the purpose. Now, there is no need for me to ask him about it. Bhagavan  
answered it through you.   
 **When I was in England last year, I went to see a venerable, old lady, by  
name Mrs. Victoria Doe. She must be nearing 80 and lives in a quiet house at  
17. St. Martins Avenue, Epsom, Surrey, with her only daughter, Miss. Leena  
Doe. She has never come to India, never seen Bhagavan Sri Ramana in flesh and  
blood. Yet, I was deeply moved by her devotion to him. She had read about him,  
prayed to him,meditated on him, and lives in him day in and day out.**   
She showed me sheaves of letters she took from a corner of a shelf, and kissed  
them with great reverence before handing them to me. All the letters were from  
the Ashram and were meticulously preserved for the past several years. She had  
also with her all the English publications of Sri Ramanasramam. She opened one  
of the books and, running her shaky finger along the writing on the first page  
 _With Gracious Blessings from Sri Bhagavan burst into tears of joy and  
devotion. She said Mr. Nambiar,how lucky you are to have been able to be with  
him, to see him and hear him speak. Here, we treasure these books and letters  
as representing him. Now he has sent you here. I feel that he is with us now._  
 Such love, such devotion to the Sage, so tenderly expressed to me, a total  
stranger to her till the other day, moved me to the depths of my being.   
I do not profess competence to interpret Sri Bhagavans philosophy and  
teachings. The first publication I remember to have read on his teachings is  
the booklet entitled Who am I?. Having read it, I felt no need to read other  
books propounding some different approach to the realisation of the Eternal  
Truth. **I am convinced that the method of Selfenquiry suggested in that great  
little book is all that is needed   
for the highest achievement in life, namely, Self-realisation.**

Bhagavan Ramana very rarely accept the gifts brought by devotees.   
He politely refused them on many occasions. Even eatables, if   
brought daily, He would not accept. There were a few lucky devotees, like Mr.  
Nambiar whose gifts were accepted. I think on another occasion, someone or  
may be the same Nambiar brought a costly parker pen and He refused to accept  
stating that His present old ink pen would serve the purpose. One another  
gentleman brought a nice sandal wood walking stick. Bhagavan took it, smelt  
the sandal fragrance and politely refused to accept. He had accepted the corn  
flakes roasted and mixed with chilly powder and salt from Suri Nagamma. Such  
occasions were very rare. He also accepted the 'kadukkai' (Indian myrobalan)  
brought by a villager, since it would cure diarrohea and He was at that time  
suffering from that ailment.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. I agree with you. For a self realized Brahma Jnani, all the   
covenants of yoga sastra come automatically. Bhagavan Ramana   
Himself says in one of His poems: "If under has experienced the   
Self, what else is there to learn?" There are gurus aplenty today,   
who accept golden sandals and keep their feet on that for some   
time, and either give it back to the devotee or keep it for their   
safe-keeping. The devotees, if the sandals are given back, do   
pujas for that sandals. These are all comical. But Bhagavan   
Ramana never wore any slippers or sandals and so this 'comedy'   
could not take place with Him.   
Arunachala Siva.
