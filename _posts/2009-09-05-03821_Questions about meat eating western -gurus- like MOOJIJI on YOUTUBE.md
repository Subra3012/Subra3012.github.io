## Questions about meat eating western 'gurus' like MOOJIJI on YOUTUBE

Dear Sirs   
My friend are starting following   
an caraibian voodoo 'guru' named MOOJI   
and on YOUTUBE channel MOOJIJI (2 times JI)   
I know little of these things but he uses in every explanation   
Ramana Maharshi's name.   
I'm Old but when younger had a friend+, who visited Ramana many times.   
So I know Ramana was a vegetarian and that MOO man is not   
So how can he speak about God and Love while killing.   
He also tells my friends that it does not matter   
and it makes no karma once you see that you are god.   
Please help me   
What must I say to my friends and how can it be possible   
that Indians accept this MOO in ARUNACHALA   
There are many many western so called NON-DUALITY or ADVAITA 'teachers' on  
YOUTUBE and   
I believe MOST of them misuse Ramana for Power Sex and Money   
like Raneesh did.   
Can you at least confirm that it is not the right way.   
Also I would like to know who was appointed   
by PapaJI as successor and does he gives Mantras   
The MOO man gives them OMKARA mantra which to my   
humble opinion has a tendency towards the creation and not to the creator.   
I even believe he uses in a voodoo way that word as a post hypnotic command   
Is that Man really received with honor in your community.   
Or can it be, he going to your village and perhaps   
paying villagers and filming how they honor him ?

Dear Seth,   
You have many questions. I shall try to find some answers for you   
as per Bhagavan Ramana. If I have missed some questions of you,   
please let me know.   
1\. Firstly regarding meat, Bhagavan Ramana only said that vegetarian   
food would help to develop purity of mind, since meat and fish consist   
of chemicals that would encourage rajasic character. He did not   
recommend vegetarian food to Western devotees, as a matter of   
obligation. But these sincere Western devotees like Chadwick turned   
to vegetarianism on their own after some time.   
2. Regarding sex, Bhagavan Ramana has said that a family life with   
wife and children is not prohibited. One cannot become an ascetic   
just because he wants. He should be mentally prepared in all sincerity.  
Unless mind is controlled, sex cannot be controlled. So   
He permitted the householders to stay as householders and do atma   
vichara. But by obverse, He did not definitely recommend permissive sex.  
Since He has said mind must be controlled, one should conclude   
that permissive sex where there is no control of mind, is definitely   
prohibited.   
3. Those who do not follow these guidelines, have no business to   
speak about Bhagavan Ramana or consider Him as their guru or   
consider their own path as Bhagavan Ramana's Way.   
4\. Papaji came to Bhagavan Ramana and Bhagavan Ramana had guided him  
suitably. Whether Papaji later gave mantras to his disciples or prescribed  
any specific guru mantras, I do not know.   
Bhagavan Ramana did not give any mantras. His only mantra was   
to enquire Who am I?   
Arunachala Siva.

I'm extremely thankful for your service   
to answer so quickly and profondly, . . . but   
I was not sufficiently clear.   
The point is not at all the State of Mind of the disciple   
but that of the **Teacher**.   
Like and I'm so sure, because I know from first hand, Ramana   
was a super hyper strict vegetarian himself,   
So, I think : A) It's inconceivable that a person   
giving Ramana's or any Indian Saint's teachings eats MEAT and this way is a   
torturer of The Almighty in His Jivas, the animals.   
B) That such a person invites vegetarians to drop the habit   
because realizing God you will have no Karma.   
The sex thing was just a referral to   
sex power & money or in another   
sequence, the Goal of many   
and seeing the advertisings : "Be a Billionaire : Start Your Own Church"   
which has changed somewhat to : "Start Your Own Ashram, success guaranteed, : 5 years only to be a Billionaire  
"   
Still Thanks and inviting all readers to give their view   
and personally I think Ramana is shivering in His Grave   
if He had One.
