## A bricklayer's tale  
Author: Graham              Date: January 14, 2010, 04:07:29 AM

I am a little disappointed at the posts in this section so far. There is  
nothing like a good old belly laugh to release tension and set the world to  
right.   
So here is something to get you going - an example of the British habit of  
understatement: Found at - http://www.btinternet.com/~knutty.knights/bricks.txt   
 _This is a bricklayer 's accident report that was printed in the newsletter  
of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here, thanks  
to John Sedgwick is this Bricklayer's report._   
\   
Dear Sir: I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block  
#3 of the accident reporting form. I put "Poor Planning" as the cause of my  
accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following  
details will be sufficient.   
I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone  
on the roof of a new six-storey building. When I completed my work, I found I  
had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to weigh 240  
lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a  
barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the  
sixth floor.   
Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out  
and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding  
it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will note  
on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.   
Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my  
presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I  
proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding  
downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull,  
minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident  
reporting form.   
Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the  
fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I  
mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time I  
had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in  
spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.   
At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground-  
and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks,  
the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs.   
I refer you again to my weight. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent  
down the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts  
for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs  
and lower body.   
Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed  
to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks  
and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.   
I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain,  
unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again  
lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope....

This is very British. Quite different from Asian style.   
I think I understand it should be funny for British people, but it did not  
make me laugh.   
When I was in England, a Japanese man told a joke to Enlishmen.   
 Listening to the joke, I laughed. I thought it was funny.   
But no Englishmen around him laughed. They didn't get the joke. They did not  
think it was funny.   
Different culture, different humour.

Hi Akira,   
It is not the story, but the way it is told that is at the root of British  
humour.   
Clearly the incident itself was horrific, but the writer has deliberately  
composed it with typical British understatement to make it humourous. It is  
our habit to make our disasters and mistakes appear funny.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. In the same way, I think, when a large volume of incense was   
burnt or when arti was shown, Bhagavan Ramana said: "Okay. Show   
these to to your heart's content. But why not to that Kallu Swami (the   
stone image, in front of Mother's Temple? It will not object." This   
was in 1946. It happened. Today we have only the Kallu Swami but   
not Bhagavan Ramana in body. His living Presence is however definitely   
there. The Asramam has seen to it that no arti is shown or no incense   
is burnt even before that stone image!   
Arunachala Siva.

Doopam normally refers to a small wick dipped in ghee and shown   
to God in the home altar before actual camphor lighting.   
Deepam is a regular lamp, with oil or ghee.   
Dasangam is the one which is called Sambrani, the powder which   
is burnt on a coal fire.   
The words, Dasangam and Doopam are of course interchangeably used.

In the Bhakta Vijayam parampara, lineage, they are all advaitis. In fact,   
they prayed to Panduranga Vittal as their only God and nothing else mattered.   
Of course, they all went to pilgrimages but there in different temples they   
saw the images of Siva or Uma only as Panduranga Vittal. I am told the   
Panduranga image in Pandharipur is the combined form of Siva and Narayana.  
There is matted hairs on the head. The hands do not possess disc and conch-  
shell etc., Amrutanubhava is an advaitic work. Even Jnanewari, the  
commentaries are based on advaita path only.   
Arunachala Siva.

Regarding Andal, who was found out by Vishnu Siddha, her father, (Periyazhwar)  
was brought up as a brahmin girl only. She started praying   
to Ranganatha of Sri Rangam, who is Krishna. It is said that in order to   
get the love of Sri Krishna, she wanted to become a gopika, cowherdess.   
Hence she started walking with inturned hip (as cowherdesses do to take   
one curd pot on their hips!). She started wearing plaited hairs as a bun   
on the head (as cowherdesses do to carry the curd/butter pots)! She   
applied stale putrified butter on her face and sari, so that she would get the  
'smell' of a typical cowherdess!   
This is a poet's imagination.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[17]Basava  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 28, 2010, 12:18:10 PM

**Basava** (1134 - 1196)   
 **Basava** (also known as **Basavanna** or **Basaveshwara**, (1134 - 1196))  
was a philosopher and a social reformer. He fought against practice of caste  
system and rituals in Hinduism. He is also called as Vishwa Guru and Bhakti-  
Bhandari. His teachings and preachings go beyond all boundaries and are  
universal and eternal. He was a great humanitarian. Basava advocated a new way  
of life wherein the **divine experience was the center of life** giving equal  
opportunity to all aspirants regardless of the gender, caste, and social  
status. The cornerstone behind his movement was the firm belief in a universal  
concept of God. Basava has a proponent of monotheistic concept of formless  
God.   
A true visionary with ideas ahead of his time, he envisioned a society that  
flourished **enriching one and all**. In addition to being a great mystic,  
Basava was the **Prime Minister** of the **Southern Kalachuri Empire** in  
**South India** and originated a literary revolution by introducing **Vachana  
Sahitya**. Basava is said to have been a mystic by temperament, an idealist by  
choice, a statesman by profession, a man of letters by taste, a humanist by  
sympathy, and a social reformer by conviction. Many great yogis and mystics of  
the time joined his movement enriching it with the essence of divine  
experience in the form of Vachanas (Lit. sayings - sacred hymns in Kannada)  
that define a new way of looking at God and life.   
Basava's path later gave birth to a new religion (or "Sampradaya") called  
**Lingavanta Dharma** or **Lingayata**. Other synonyms for lingayata are: Basava Dharma, Sharana Dharma, Vachana Dharma.   
 **Basavanna** was born in the year **30-04-1134** into a Shaivite Kamme  
Brahmin family residing in the small town of **Ingaleshwar**, **Bagewadi** in  
the **Bijapur** district of northern **Karnataka**, Basava grew up in a  
strict, religious household where he was made to wear a sacred thread known as  
the Janivara. He did not accept the Janivara. He rejected the religion based  
on agamas, shastras, and puranas which were written in Sanskrit and were not  
reachable to common people. He did not accept the ritual rites. Shrinivas  
Murthy, in his book 'Vachana Dharma Sara' writes:  _Vachana Sahitya is not borrowed from other languages, they are the Original  
and Unique to Kannada language. What ever is there in Vedas and Upanishads is  
available in Vachanas, but what ever is there in Vachanas is not there in  
Vedas and Upanishads. Basavanna with his original and creative thinking added  
much value to Kannada language through Vachana Sahitya_.   
He left Bagewadi and spent the next 12 years studying Sangameshwara, at the  
then-Shaivite stronghold of **Kudala Sangama**. There, he conversed with  
scholars and developed his spiritual and religious views in association with  
his societal understanding. His Guru was Jataveda Muni, also known as Eeshanya  
Guru. His views included believing there is only one true, perfect God;  
additionally, he created people who perform social services like removal of  
untouchability, superstitiousness, confusions, temple culture, and  
priesthoodness. He believed people who were in search of a false god needed to  
be shown the right way. He preached equality among humankind and condemned all  
barriers of caste, creed and sex, fighting against the caste system. He is  
also known as Krantikari (revolutionary) Basavanna for his revolution in the  
social system of the **12th century**.   
Basavanna started his career as an accountant at Mangalaveda in the court of  
Kalachuri king Bijjala, a feudatory of the Kalyani Chalukya. When Bijjala  
acquired the power at Basavakalyana, by overpowering Tailapa IV (the garandson  
of Vikramaditya VI, the great Chalukya king), Basavanna also went to Kalyana.  
With his honesty, hardwork and visionary mission, Basava rose to the position  
of Prime Minister in the court of king Bijjala, who ruled from 1160 - 1196 at  
Kalyana (presently renamed as Basavakalyana). There, he established the  
**Anubhava Mantapa**, a spiritual parliament to openly discuss Lingayatism,  
which attracted many saints from throughout India. He believed in the  
principle **Kayakave Kailasa** ( **Work puts you on the path to heaven, Work  
is Heaven** ); one step ahead of Ravindranath Tagore's ' **work is worship**  
'. It was at this time that the **Vachanas**, simple and easy-to-understand  
poetic writings which contained essential teachings, were written. Below is  
one of the thousands of Vachanas that were written:  _The power of knowledge destroys ignorance;   
The power of light dissipates darkness;   
The power of truth is foe of all untruth;   
The sharana's experience of god is the sole cure of worldliness;   
Dont rob, Dont kill, Never ever lie   
dont get angry, Dont think negative about others   
Dont self describe, Dont tease others   
this is the way of self respect, this is the way to get respected by the  
world.   
This is the way of impressing my lord Koodala sangam deva._   
Basava created much controversy by actively ignoring the societal rules  
associated with the caste system, which he wished to abolish. By allowing  
untouchables to have lunch at his residence and praising the historic marriage  
of a Brahmin woman and an untouchable man, Basava caused orthodox members of  
King Bijjala's court to go to the King with such stories, some true and some  
false. Bijjala, afraid of a possible uprising in orthodox society, ordered the  
newly married couple to be harshly punished. Before punishing the couple  
Bijjala asked Basava to agree with caste system; but Basava strongly opposed  
caste system and said, both Haralayya and Madhuvaras were Lingayats and the  
rules of caste system are not applicable to them. Bijjala did not agree with  
Basavanna's ideas; and asked Basavanna to be silent and accept the punishment  
to couple or leave Kalyana. The "Being punished" (Danda-gonda) Basavanna left  
Kalyana with heavy heart and marched towards Kudala Sangama. He left Kalyana  
in 1196 A.D. of Rakshasa nama samvatsara, phalguna masada 12th day for Kudala  
Sangama and en route to Kudala sangama, he preached the people about the  
humanity, morality, honesty, simplicity, and the dignity of labour, equality  
among all human beings, human rights etc. Being a perfect yogi he released the  
bonds of the body and soul and took nirvana (Lingaikya) on **30-7-1196 A.D**,   
in response to the call from Kudala Sangama Deva, or Lingadeva the Almighty.   
Basava said that the _roots of social life are embedded not in the cream of  
the society but in the scum of the society_. It is his witty saying that the  
cow does not give milk to him who sits on its back, but it gives milk to him  
who squats at its feet. With his wide sympathy, he admitted high and low alike  
into his fold. The Anubhava Mantapa established by Basava laid down the  
foundation of social democracy. Basava believed that man becomes great not by  
his birth but by his worth to the society. This means faith in the dignity of  
man and the belief that a common man is as good a part of society as a man of  
status.   
He proclaimed that all members of the state are labourers: some may be  
intellectual labourers and others may be manual labourers. He placed practice  
before precept and his own life was of rigid rectitude. Basava brought home to  
his countrymen the lesson of **self-purification**. He tried to raise the  
moral level of the public life in the country, and he insisted that the same  
rules of conduct applied to the administrators as to the individual members of  
the society. He also taught the dignity of manual labour by insisting on work  
as worship. Every kind of manual labour, which was looked down upon by people  
of high caste, should be looked upon with love and reverence, he argued. Thus  
arts and crafts flourished, and a new foundation was laid down in the history  
of the economics of the land.   
Basava formed people's committees representing various vocations such as  
agriculture, horticulture, tailoring, weaving, dyeing, and carpentry. All  
vocations were regarded as of equal value and the members belonged to all  
sorts of vocations. Thus Jedara Dasimayya was a weaver, Shankar Dasimayya a  
tailor, Madival Machayya a washerman, Myadar Ketayya a basket-maker, Kinnari  
Bommayya a goldsmith, Vakkalmuddayya a farmer, Hadap Appanna a barber, Jedar  
Madanna a soldier, Ganada Kannappa an oilman, Dohar Kakkayya a tanner, Mydar  
Channayya a cobbler, and Ambigara Chowdayya a ferryman. There were women  
followers such as Satyakka, Ramavve, and Somavve with their respective  
vocations. The curious thing was that all these and many more have sung the  
Vachanas (sayings) regarding their vocations in a very suggestive imagery.   
Basavanna Defines GOD as: _jagadagala mugilagal migeyagal,   
nimmagala, pataLadindattatta nimma shricarana,   
brahmanDadindattatta nimma shri mukuta,   
agammya, agOcara, apramana lingave,   
neevenna karasthalakke bandu   
cuLukadirayya kudala sangamadeva._   
In this Vacana, Guru Basava has made it clear that, Kudala Sangamadeva in not  
Lord of meeting rivers. He is infinite, eternal, and beyond the reach of the  
physical senses. Basavanna gives perfect shape in the form of Ishtalinga to  
the formless and absolute GOD. Thus Ishtalinga represents the eternal,  
omnipresence, and Absolute GOD.

Kudala Sangama is the place two rivers meet, Tunghabadra and Godavari (?).   
The Lord Siva, is the kudala sangama deva. The signature of Basvanna is   
kudala sangama deva in his blank verses. A.K. Ramanujan translates it   
as the "Lord of the meeting rivers!" Akka Mahadevi who also belonged to   
Basavakalyan group, a group formed to spread Veera Saiva movement   
in Northern Karnataka. She uses the siganature, Channa Mallikarujuna   
deva, the Lord of the Golden Jasmine creepers. Desi Ramayya uses   
O Ramanatha, the Lord of Rameswaram. The foursome formed the group   
of Veera Saivas movement, which flourished even now in Karnataka. They   
wear (both women and men) a small Linga image across their waist (like   
the sacred thread). They apply Vibhuti only. No kumkum. They are strict   
vegetarians.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[19]Bhakta Chokhamela  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 02, 2010, 05:26:57 AM  
---  
**Bhakta Chokhamela** (13th century / 14th century)   
 **Chokhamela** was born in **Pandharpur** (or near that place) and was  
contemporary of **Namadeva**.   
He was an untouchable and a staunch devotee of **Sri Krishna**. He sang and  
danced before the temple of **Panduranga** in Pandari puram.   
Ironically enough the devotees who thronged before the temple were lured to  
his music like a snake which danced to the jugglers music. But the minute his  
music and dance came to a stand still, their interest in him vanished. He  
became an untouchable and was prohibited the darshan of Lord Krishna. He would  
dance to his hearts content and fall at the doorstep brooding over his ill  
fate. This farce continued for quite some time.   
His faith was questioned one day. Somebody stopped his ecstatic dance and  
asked,   
" _If your faith is so real, if your ecstasy is heartfelt. Why then doesn 't  
your lord give you permission to have is darshan. You say that God helps his  
devotees, but you are not cared for! Can a dog sit beside a Brahmin and have  
its food? Can a beggar enter a royal palace? So give up your futile attempts  
and leave this place at once!_"   
He even pushed the devotee ruthlessly!   
The untouchable rose to his feet and argued humbly,   
" _My faith in God is as real as my birth into a low caste. How can my birth  
be a hindrance? Doesn 't sun God shine over lotus born in mud? Do the clouds  
rain over rivers only ignoring mud ponds? Does Mother earth avoid us? Does my  
prayer become unwanted for my God?_"   
But it fell into deaf ears.   
He walked back home with a heavy heart. His wife showed concern and asked: " _Why are you like that?_ "   
He burst out crying, " _I dont know why I am created like that! I am destined  
to suffer. I didn 't do any crime knowingly. I don't know what is cheating or  
fooling others. All I know is an undaunted faith in Lord Krishna, but I am not  
blessed by Him_.   
Soyarabai his wife consoled him in many ways, but his sorrow was unappeasable.  
He went to bed without food, still crying heavily. Soyarabai was worried about  
him and was watching him unobtrusively, without a wink of an eye.   
Chokhamela couldn't sleep. The darkness of his heart was ten times the  
darkness around. But suddenly, there was a sparkle of light ten thousands  
times the sparkle of the sun which shattered the darkness in and around! The  
lord Panduranga Himself came to the doorsteps of Chokhamela.   
The tears of sorrow turned out to be tears of joy. The couple fell to the feet  
of Vittala. The God assured them that it was His duty to save them. So saying,  
the God held the hand of Chokhamela and led him into his temple. God took him  
into the Sanctum Sanatorium even as the doors were tightly locked. Nobody saw  
them.   
Chokhamela put one step backward,   
" _My lord! I am not permitted to enter your temple, but you are leading me  
into the Sanctum Sanatorium. It may be a bad omen to you._ "   
God laughed away his wild fears.   
" _My Sanctum Sanatorium is filled with darkness, because of such  
superstitious practices of mankind. Today it looks illumined because of your  
entry. Chokhamela, whoever doesn 't bother to reach me inspite of being born  
as a man, is an untouchable; whoever hates my staunch devotee is an  
untouchable._"   
Chokhamela was delighted by God's explanation and asked him a question for the  
welfare of mankind,   
" _Oh Lord! How should your devotees lead their lives to attain moksha ?_ "   
Panduranga Swami answered this with a smile on his face,   
_" Chokha ! Three aspects have to be followed by my devotees in Kaliyuga"   
1\. **Chanting** : They should chant the name of God incessantly. Mere  
chanting will fetch the same results in Kaliyuga what yagnas used to fetch  
earlier.   
2\. **Good Behaviour** : A devotee should practice good principles like  
ahimsa, pity, patience, control over sense organs and a life of celibacy.   
3\. **The company of Good people** : Should move always in the company of good  
people who always spend their time in the presence of God. To be acquainted  
with such people itself is a difficult task.   
So follow these three principles and set an example to the others._   
The conversation went on till the early hours of next morning. The main priest  
heard some voices even as he unlocked the door and was taken aback to see the  
forbidden man in the inner most part of the temple. The head priest questioned  
him angrily.   
" _How dare you step into this sacred place ? Why can 't we punish you for  
your stealthy act?_"   
Chokhamela humbly answered,   
" _Oh priest I did not come on my own. My Lord brought me here personally. I  
am not offensive in any way. I may be an untouchable, but my entry has not  
made the temple untouchable. If that is the case the Ganges should become  
untouchable since sinners have a dip in the holy river. The air should become  
untouchable. Just as a mother doesn 't give up an ugly child God doesn't give  
up a lowly child._"   
The wiseacres had no answer to his questions. All that they knew was, he was  
challenging them. He had crossed the barriers and he needed to be punished.  
They were worried, if they left him like that, God would bring him there every  
night. So they banished him from that place. He was asked to live at the other  
bank of the Chandrabhagha river.   
Chokhamela mutely obeyed their order as God's order and settled down there in  
a small cottage.   
One day Chokhamela was having his food under a tree before his house. His wife  
was serving him. Panduranga unable to bear His separation from his devotee  
came in search of him. He wanted to join him in dinner. The couple were more  
than delighted, did pooja to His feet and started serving him. Soyarabai in  
her excitement happened to spill curds over God's dress. Chokhamela, unable to  
control his anger, shouted at his wife,   
" _How dare you do that ? Can 't you see properly?_"   
Just then the temple priest happened to pass that way and mistook those words.  
Since he couldn't see the Lord, he thought they were aimed at him. In a fit of  
anger, he gave a big slap on his face, had a bath in the river for having  
touched him and came to the temple. In the meanwhile God disappeared from  
Chokhamela's house.   
"Oh my God!", the priest was wonder struck when he opened the temple door.  
Tears rolled down Lord Pandurangas cheek and one cheek turned red and  
swollen. You should look at the priest! His throat became dry. He missed a  
heart beat. He could hardly stand! He could see his mistake reflected on the  
Lord's face! He rushed to the senior brahmins and explained the situation.  
What the brahmin realized for himself was true! They could guess that God was  
grieved at the fate of his devotee! The only solution was to apologise to  
Chokhamela.   
Without any second thoughts, the priest hastened to Chokhamela and prostrated  
before him. The latter was shocked at his action. The priest explained the  
situation and holding his hand in his hand, brought Chokamela to the divine  
presence. Chokhamela was moved to tears to see his beloved God in sorrow. He  
pleaded,   
" _Oh God! Forgive us as a mother forgives her children. Whatever has happened  
has happened unwittingly. We can 't bear to see you in such a pitiable state.  
Please shower your Blessings on us with your ever pleasing smile._"   
God who can't say no to His devotees, looked the normal smiling self again!  
How great are the powers of God!   
Sri Namadev had won the name of the chief devotees of Panduranga. One day  
while he was singing in the temple, he was shocked to see the Lord weeping.  
When asked for the reason, God answered,   
" _Oh Namadev! There is a staunch devotee of mine by name Chokhamela. He  
chants my name incessantly, leads a life of equanimity and sacrifice. He met  
with a tragic end. As he was working with some labourers, a brick wall fell  
over them and all of them died._ "   
Namadev was touched at his story and said,   
" _Oh God! You ever love to your devotees. You blessed him by helping his  
jeevathma join you - Paramathma. Why then should you feel sorry for him?_ "   
The lord answered,   
" _No, Namadev, he had one dying wish. I can 't be happy if his desire is not  
fulfilled? I entrust you to fulfil it._"   
" _Order me, my Lord, I am at your service. There is no difference between you  
and your devotees. So I deem it a great pleasure to play my part._ "   
God was pleased at his readiness and said.   
" _Oh Namadev! Chokhamela had a strong desire. He wanted his dead body to be  
buried before my temple. But he met with an accidental death and all the dead  
bodies were given a mass burial. Now, you search his bones and get them here  
and bury them before my temple._ "   
Namadev was more than willing, but he raised a genuine doubt.   
" _How do I differentiate his bones from the rest?_ "   
God ruled it out as a strange fear!   
" _Chokhamela was chanting my name even as he breathed his last. So, whichever  
bone gives out my name, as you keep it near your ear that bone is  
Chokhamelas._ "   
Accordingly, Namadev went and examined every bone. Lo! Some bones let out the  
prayer. " _Vittala Vittala Panduranga._ " Namadev was moved to tears. He  
carefully collected all his bones and buried them before the temple. Even  
today, the devotees of Panduranga stand before his cemetry and pray to him.   
Chokhamela lived in the samsara sagara, but was not drowned in it. Just as the  
stones floated on the Ocean due to the power of Rama Nama, he floated on the  
ocean of life fue to the power of Panduranga. He also proved devotion to God  
is not coloured by caste, creed or religion. A true devotee doesn't bother  
about mundane world or the behaviour of society towards him. All that a true  
devotee knows is undaunted faith in God.   
The following song shows the realization of Chokhamela:  _In my own body I have found Him, that Lord of Pandhari,   
The Self, the eternal, He is standing on the brick!   
Know that He, Panduranga is the Supreme Soul   
And his wife Rukmini is the peace of my heart!   
What had taken a visible form has now vanished,   
Now I contemplate Viththala as the eternal Soul: In such guise did Viththala take hold of my heart and mind -   
And Chokhamela clasps His feet!_

Dear silentgreen,   
I find a lot of parallels between Periya Puranam and Sri Mahabhakta Vijayam.   
In the former, Nandanar, his name really is Tirunalai Povar, was an outcaste.   
He wanted to go and see Thillai (Chidambaram) Nataraja. First, there was   
hurdle from his land lord, he was an agricultural labourer. Then he was   
permitted to go. But how could he go to the sanctum sanctorum. He stood   
at a neaby village, called Tiru Pungur, wherefrom Nataraja gave darshan to   
him by asking Nandi, the bull, to keep away from hiding Nandanar's sight.   
Then Nandanar went to Thillai. The brahmins did not permit. Siva appeared   
in their dream and told them to raise a fire so that Nandanar could bathe in  
it and come out pure! The brahmins did accordingly, and Nandanar jumped into  
the fire and came back, in golden colour, with cross threads and vibhuti on  
his arms and forehead. He entered the Temple, but did not come back!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[21]Narahari  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 03, 2010, 12:46:09 PM

**Narahari**   
 **Narahari** was a goldsmith of **Pandharpur** who was fanatically devoted to  
**Lord Shiva**.   
He never went to the temple of **Lord Vithoba** and will not place trust in  
any other deities.   
Once a rich man took a vow that if a son was born to him, he would prepare a  
gold waistband for Lord Vithoba. His desire was granted and the merchant came  
to Narahari to make the ornament. Narahari agreed to make the gold waistband  
but not to go to the temple of Lord Vithoba to take measurements. He asked the  
merchant to take the measurement and come to him. The merchant was surprised  
to see that Narahari would not go to the temple of Lord Vithoba even for his  
business.   
The merchant himself went to the temple of Lord Vithoba and took the  
measurements. But after the waistband was made it was found to be small. He  
asked Narahari to make it bigger, but after the modification was made it was  
found to be too big. The process of corrections were repeated but the  
waistband did not fit the waist of the Lord properly.   
Finally the merchant requested Narahari to go to the temple himself and take  
the measurement but Narahari declined. The merchant gave the idea that he will  
blindfold Narahari's eyes and he need not see the image of the Lord. Narahari  
finally agreed and went inside the temple with blindfold on his eyes. Seeing  
Narahari people began to laugh but Narahari was unconcerned.   
But when Narahari began feeling the image of the Lord, he distinctly felt that  
he was touching the image of Lord Shiva with matted hair, serpants etc. He  
threw open his blindfold only to find the image of Lord Vithoba. He again put  
back his blindfold but once more felt Lord Shiva while trying to take  
measurements. This repeated and finally Narahari understood that it was Lord  
Vithoba who had played trick on him to make him realize that he and Lord Shiva  
are not different. Narahari bowed down to the Lord's feet and said, " _Victory  
to Thee, Lover of Thy bhaktas. Thou removest the illusions of Thy bhaktas_ ".  
Lord Vithoba drew Narahari to Himself and removed the last traces of ignorance  
from him - the misconception that Vithoba and Shiva are different.   
Narahari sang many abhangas and is also said to have gone to a pilgrimage to  
North India with Jnanadeva, Namadeva and the other devotees.   
Some of his abhangas show very deep realizations.   
In one of his abahangas he says that he is so convinced about the unreality of  
the world that he regards it as merely a picture drawn upon a wall.   
In another abhanga he says that " _The unstruck sound is foreever sounding in  
my ears, and my mind has been captivated by it. By means of the unstruck  
sound, think always upon God, and meditate upon Him in your heart. This will  
endow you with true love of God, and show you His pathway, as it did Narahari_  
".   
In another abhanga he says that he is a goldsmith who deals in the name of  
God. He makes his body the melting vessel of the soul, which is the gold  
therein.

One discourser said that Panduranga Vittal is the combination of Siva, Vishnu  
and   
Devi aspects. The priests have found long matted hair below his head gear. He   
keeps both the hands on his waist so that no one would thrust either a conch  
shell   
and disc or a trident and hand drum on his hands. Narahari's experience in  
Bhakta   
Vijayam only shows this aspect of Hari and Hara. Saint Karaikal Amma sings: I see you as Vishnu on your left side, I see you as Siva on your right side,  
when   
I started seeing you in Heart, I left all these suspicions. (Adhbudha tiru  
vandati)

## Re:[23]Thyagaraja  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 04, 2010, 10:37:20 AM  
---  
**Thyagaraja** (1759 AD - 1847 AD)   
 **Thyagaraja** was born in **1759** in **Tiruvarur**, a small town in the  
**Thanjavur** district of Old Madras State, now **Tamil Nadu**, to Kakarla  
Ramabrahmam and Sitamma in a Telugu Brahmin family of the Mulukanadu subsect.  
He was named Thyagaraja, after **Lord Thyagaraja**, the presiding deity of  
the temple at Tiruvarur. Thyagaraja was born at his maternal grandfather,  
Giriraja Kavi's house. Giriraja Kavi was a poet-composer in the court of the  
king of Thanjavur.   
Thyagaraja was married at a young age to Parvatamma, who died shortly  
afterwards. He then married Kamalamba and they had a daughter named  
Sitalakshmi.   
Thyagaraja began his musical training under Sonti Venkataramanayya, a noted  
music scholar, at an early age. He regarded **music as a way to experience God  
's love**. His objective while practising music was purely **devotional**, as  
opposed to focusing on the technicalities of classical music. He also showed a  
flair for composing music, and, in his teens, composed his first song **Namo  
Namo Raghavayya** in the Desika Todi ragam, and inscribed it on the walls of  
the house.   
A few years later, Sonti Venkataramanayya invited Thyagaraja to perform at his  
house in Thanjavur. On that occasion, Thyagaraja sang **Endaro  
Mahaanubhavulu**, the fifth of the **Pancharatna Krithis**. Pleased with  
Thyagaraja's composition, Sonti Venkataramanayya informed the King of  
Thanajavur about Thyagaraja's genius. The king sent an invitation, along with  
many rich gifts, inviting Thyagaraja to attend the royal court. Thyagaraja,  
however was not inclined towards a career at the court, and rejected the  
invitation outright, composing another gem of a kriti, **Nidhi Chala Sukhama**  
(English: "Does wealth bring happiness?") on this occasion. Angered at  
Thyagaraja's rejection of the royal offer, his brother threw the statues of  
Rama, Thyagaraja used in his prayers into the nearby Kaveri river. Thyagaraja,  
unable to bear the separation with his Lord, went on pilgrimages to all the  
major temples in South India and composed many songs in praise of the deities  
of those temples.   
In addition to nearly **600 compositions (kritis)**, Thyagaraja composed two  
musical plays in Telugu, the **Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam** and the **Nauka  
Charitam**. Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam is in five acts with 45 kritis set in 28  
ragas and 138 verses, in different metres in Telugu. Nauka Charitam is a  
shorter play in one act with 21 kritis set in 13 ragas and 43 verses. The  
latter is the most popular of Thyagaraja's operas, and is a creation of the  
composer's own imagination and has no basis in the Bhagavata Purana.   
Thyagaraja's works are some of the best and most beautiful literary  
expressions in Telugu language. Valmiki composed the Ramayana, the story of  
Rama, with 24,000 verses and incidentally Thyagaraja also composed **24,000  
kritis** in praise of the lord.   
The kirthanas of Thyagaraja are direct, simple and inspiring, full of wisdom  
and entire surrender to the Almighty.   
Thyagaraja died on **January 6, 1847**.   
He, along with his contemporaries Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastry,  
forms the Trinity of Carnatic music.

Two interesting pieces about Saint Tyagaraja: 1. We must be thinking that he sang only on Rama. No, there are keertans on   
Sri Panchanadeeswara, Siva of Tiruvaiyaru, near Thanjavur, where he attained   
liberation and also on various Siva shrines.   
2\. Once someone asked Bhagavan: Whether Tyagaraja sang such heart melting   
songs and attained liberation? Bhagavan answered: No, he attained liberation   
and then sang. This is anubhuti. Words of experience and not words for  
experience!

**Milarepa** (1052 AD 1135 AD)   
 **Milarepa** was born to Mila-Dorje-Senge in **1052 AD**. His father was a  
trader in wool and became quite wealthy. During childhood Milarepa was named  
**Thopaga**, (which means **delightful to hear** ) and his voice was so  
delightful that his companions were charmed by his singing. Milarepa had a  
sister named Peta who was four years younger. The family was generous and was  
loved by all relatives and neighbours in the area.   
However fate turned the fortune of the family. Milarepa's father became  
gravely ill and sensing his impending death called the extended family and put  
the care of his estate in the hands of his brother and sister till Milarepa  
(then Thopaga) had grown and married Zesay, one of the neighboring girls who  
had been betrothed to Milarepa in childhood.   
After the death of the father, the greedy uncle and aunt dispossessed  
Milarepa, his mother and sister from their property. They were forced to live  
with minimum subsistence and even made to work in the fields. The once  
prosperous family now lived on course food, tattered clothes and became  
objects of derision and abuse by all.   
When Milarepa was fifteen his mother put together all her resources and  
arranged for a feast to make the neighbours and relatives know how they were  
dispossessed of their property by the uncle and aunt. However the greedy uncle  
and aunt took the upper hand and declared that it was their property and drove  
out Milarepa, his mother and sister to fend for themselves.   
After that they lived meagerly, supported by the relatives of Milarepa's  
mother and charity from Zesay's family. The three were forced to work hard,  
exchanging their labor for a bit of food or a scrap of clothing.   
To take vengeance of the cruel acts of the uncle and aunt, Milarepa's mother  
forced Milarepa to learn **black magic**, selling half of her plot to finance  
him and even telling that she would commit suicide if her son returned without  
learning the art. Milarepa found a teacher, worked diligently and learned a  
lesson of black magic. With that he raised hail storms and utterly ruined the  
entire barley crop of that year and also killed some lives. Milarepa's mother  
in utter happiness made it public that it was her son, now an expert sorcerer,  
has wrecked this havoc. Through an intelligent ploy she also warned that  
whoever opposes her son will have to meet with similar predicament. Everyone  
was both afraid and angry. Milarepa's life was in danger and he escaped  
narrowly.   
However Milarepa became deeply repentant for his evil acts and he longed for  
the **Truth** and a way of deliverance from the **karmic effects** of his  
acts. His search for teacher led him to **Marpa** ( **Marpa the Translator**  
) who was widely known for his trips to India to procure sacred teachings  
which he brought back to Tibet in large bundles of scrolls. **Marpa** was  
initiated by **Naropa**, a powerful Saint who had fully transferred his  
exalted state of enlightenment to his disciple Marpa.   
Marpa came to know beforehand about the coming of Milarepa. To **expiate** the  
sins of Milarepa, Marpa put Milarepa in considerable hardships without  
Milarepa knowing the purpose. Marpa kept Milarepa busy at strenuous physical  
labours building various stone buildings, asking him to demolish them as if in  
whim and again rebuild them differently. His treatment was harsh and cruel to  
say the least. When Milarepa sometimes asked for the teaching, Marpa drove him  
out. So instead of teaching, Milarepa only got orders for strenous works,  
abuses and beatings. He developed deep sores in his back by constantly  
carrying stones and his state of mind was a deep despair. His only consolation  
was **Damema**, the kind wife of Marpa. She consoled Milarepa when he wept  
and tried various ways of getting Milarepa initiated by her husband, but of no  
avail. Often she became the object of anger and beating by her husband.  
Milarepa obeyed Marpa with dogged determination for initation, but eventually  
he lost hope. Damema came out with a plan to get Milarepa initiated from  
Ngogpa, a disciple of Marpa posing as if it was the order of his Master. The  
plan succeeded and Milarepa got initiated from Ngogpa. However during  
meditation he was not able to get the expected results. Upon enquiry when  
Ngogpa came to know about the plan hatched to get initiation, he said that  
since Milarepa has taken the initiation without the permission of his Guru  
Marpa, the results were not coming.   
The period of expiation came to an end and Marpa made it known that his harsh  
treatement towards Milarepa was purposeful. He also praised Milarepa for his  
dogged determination, sincerity and faith in his Guru. Milarepa finally got  
the **initiation** from Marpa. Milarepa began his meditation training shut in  
a cave with provisions. Everyday he meditated putting a lighted lamp on his  
head and would continue meditation till the lamp went out. This continued for  
eleven months after which Marpa called Milarepa and asked him to tell about  
his experiences. Milarepa said:  _   
I have understood this body of mine to be the product of ignorance, composed  
of flesh and blood and lit up by the perceptive power of consciousness. To  
those fortunate ones who long for emancipation it may be the great vessel by  
which they may procure Freedom. But to the unfortunates who only sin, it may  
be the guide to lower and miserable states of existence. This our life is the  
boundary mark whence one may take an upward or downward path. Our present time  
is a most precious time, wherein each of us must decide, in one way or other,  
for lasting good or lasting ill.   
One who aims only at his own individual peace and happiness adopts the lower  
path (Hinayana), but he who devotes the merits of his love and compassion to  
the cause of others belongs to the higher path (Mahayana).   
In meditating on the Final Goal, one has to discover the non-existence of the  
personal Ego, and therefore the fallacy that it exists (i.e. because  
everything in the universe with name and form is basically illusory in nature)   
To realize the state of non-existence of the personal ego, the mind must be  
kept in quiescence. In that state, thoughts, ideas, and cognition cease and  
the mind (awareness) passes into a state of perfect tranquility so that days,  
months, and years may pass without the person perceiving it; thus the passage  
of time has to be marked for him by others.   
The visions of the forms of the Deities which appear in meditation are merely  
signs attending the perseverance in meditation. They have no intrinsic worth  
or value in themselves.   
All the efforts put forth during this path must be made in a spirit of  
compassion with the aim of dedicating the merit of one's efforts to the  
Universal Good. There is a need of mentally praying and wishing for blessings  
on others so earnestly that one's mind processes also transcend thought.   
Just as the mere name of food does not satisfy the appetite of a hungry person  
but he must eat food, so also a man who would learn about the Voidness (i.e.  
Universal Awareness) must meditate so as to realize it, not just learn of its  
definition.   
_   
Marpa was very pleased and said that Milarepa's realizations have exceeded his  
expectations. He sent Milarepa back for more meditation.   
By now Marpa was getting on in years. Since he began teaching Milarepa, he had  
made two more trips to India to visit his Guru Naropa and receive the final  
texts he had not brought back in his earlier trips. Marpa now called together  
all his chief Lamas and disciples, including Milarepa, and gave to each those  
mystics texts that would be most valuable according to each person's line of  
development. Each also received some relic that had belonged to Naropa. To  
Milarepa was given the teaching of **Tum-mo** in which the ascending and  
descending flows along the spinal column are united to produce the vital heat  
so necessary for meditation in the cold and solitary caves of the Himalayas.  
Then all returned to their own province except Milarepa who continued for  
several more years of meditation in a cave under the direction of Marpa.   
Once Milarepa fell asleep in the cave and had a **dream** wherein he saw the  
house he had lived in as a child all in ruins. He saw his sacred books within  
the fallen house being wasted by rain water, his old mother had died, and his  
sister was roving about the countryside with no attachments and no friends. He  
felt nostalgic, came out of the cave, went to his guru and asked for  
permission to go home. Marpa gave permission but listening to his dream  
predicted that Milarepa's mother is dead and this will be their (Milarepa and  
Marpa's) last meeting. With a heavy heart the guru and disciple parted and  
Milarepa left for his native place.   
When Milarepa reached his house, he found it in ruins, he came to know that  
his mother has died and no one knows about the whereabouts of his sister.   
Milarepa begged some foodgrains and settled in the spacious comfortable cave,  
not even sleeping, but meditating continuously except for a single break once  
a day to prepare a meal of flour and water mixed with whatever root or edible  
he might find. At about this time Milarepa gained proficiency in the yogic  
power of **Tum-mo**, the generation of the Ecstatic Internal Warmth, in which  
the body generates a great deal of heat. This allowed him to stay relatively  
warm through the cold Tibetan winters with nothing but a thin cotton covering  
whereas most people had to wear thick wool and leather hides. For this reason  
he came to be called **Mila - repa** or **Mila the cotton clad**.   
His daily routine of meditation continued for four years until his supply of  
flour ran out. This caused him great concern because he had vowed to himself  
not to return to the world for any reason - but with no food, he was afraid he  
might die without having attained liberation. He decided to walk about outside  
the cave in search of some kind of food. Not far from the cave he found a  
sunny spot with springs of fresh water, an expansive view of the area, with a  
large quantity of **nettles** growing all about. He continued his meditation  
and ate only nettle soup. His body became emaciated and the hair on his body  
began to take on a greenish tinge from the nettles. Some hunters and local  
people who occasionally came near the cave thought that he was a spirit and he  
had to assure them that he was a human being. Some people made fun of his  
austerities but Milarepa was undeterred.   
Several more years passed in this way and Milarepa's sister Peta and his  
betrothed Zesay found him out. They tried to get him back but Milarepa instead  
instructed them on the real purpose of life. They often supplied food to  
Milarepa.   
His meditation attained new heights. The knot of the central spinal column  
along which the psychic energy flows was now cleared at the plexus (i.e.  
chakra center) below the naval and the psychic energy current rose up his  
spine in its fullness. He now experienced a supersensuous calmness and  
clearness that far exceeded in its ecstatic intensity any of the states he had  
previously reached. He attained to new heights of realization in which he saw  
that the highest state of Nirvana and the ordinary state of Samsaric  
consciousness were but opposite and inseparable states resting on the base of  
the **Voidness of Universal or Supra mundane Mind** (ie Ultimate Awareness).  
In his new realization he could clearly see that the samsaric or phenomenal  
existence results when the Universal Mind is directed along the path of self  
centered and self oriented awareness, and that the Nirvanic state of  
transcendence results when it is directed on the path of selfless or  
altruistic awareness.   
Later Milarepa moved to **Lapchi-Kang (Everest)** and continued his meditation  
amidst the snows and isolation there. Altogether he meditated in and made holy  
twenty caves covering the region from Mount Kailas and Lapchi-Kang in Tibet to  
far off Nepal. It is said that besides his many human converts he also brought  
to enlightenment some superhuman (ie non-embodied) beings as well, including  
the Goddess Tseringma (one of the twelve guardian deities of Tibet who reside  
at Mt. Kailas). The Goddess came to tempt him with her powers during his  
meditations and instead was herself liberated.   
During his travels over the **84 years** of his life he met many worthy  
disciples that were destined to come under his tutelage. Highest among the  
disciples was **Dvagpo Rimpoche (Gambopa)**. The most well known among them  
was **Rechung** who entreated him to tell in detail the story of his life  
which was recorded for the benefit of all sentient beings, even into the far  
future. These two disciples were respectively like the sun and the moon. The  
most exalted of beings met by Milarepa was a **Maha-Purusha (Great Being)** he  
had the excellent fortune of meeting - an Exalted Being mentioned by the  
**Buddha** himself as one of the guardians and protectors of the human race  
who live on through the centuries far from human habitation.   
Besides his two chief disciples, Milarepa had 25 additional highly  
accomplished disciples, both men and women, who became saints. Another hundred  
made such progress that they did not take rebirth. Another hundred and eight  
Great Ones obtained excellent experience and knowledge from meditation. A  
thousand sadhus and yogis, both men and women, renounced worldly life and  
lived lives of exemplary piety. Innumerable lay disciples formed a religious  
relationship with Milarepa so that the gateway to lower states of existence  
was closed to them forever.   
Thus did Milarepa radiate spiritual light like a beacon, drawing vast numbers  
of sentient beings forward toward the light of deliverance and dispelling in  
all directions the darkness of selfishness and ignorance.   
_   
" The Guru, being like the Dharma-Kaya (aggregate of all enlightened beings)  
is like the expanse of the sky.   
Upon the face of the sky, the Clouds of Good Wishes of the Sambhoga-Kaya  
(aggregate of overseeing deities in heaven worlds) gather.   
From the Clouds in the expanse of sky, descend the flowery showers of the  
Nirmana-Kaya (Great Teachers incarnated on Earth)   
These falling on the Earth unceasingly, nourish and ripen the harvest of Saved  
Beings.   
Milarepa

Dear grhluna,   
I found that reading the biographies of saints is like doing parayana  
(circumbulation of mountain or some holy place). Normally all biographies are  
available in the internet. However it still helps to put it in one place,  
because internet is such a huge collection of resources. There is no well-  
defined sequence I follow but put them as and when it occurs to me. Swami  
Sivananda is also in my agenda.

## Re:[34]Thiruvalluvar  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 16, 2010, 10:52:01 AM  
---  
**Thiruvalluvar** : About two thousand years ago there flourished in Mylapore, Madras, a born  
Siddha and a born poet by name Valluvar or, as he is more commonly known,   
**Thiruvalluvar** , which only means, the devotee of the Valluva caste.  
Valluvas are Pariahs (now called Harijans) and their vocation was proclaiming  
the orders of the king by beat of drum. There is a tradition that  
Thiruvalluvar was the son of one Bhagavan, a Brahmin, and Adi, a Pariah woman  
whom he had married.   
Thiruvalluvar was born at Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. He is regarded  
as an Avatara of Brahma. His wife **Vasuki** was a chaste and devoted lady, an  
ideal wife, who never disobeyed the orders of her husband, but always carried  
them out implicitly. Thiruvalluvar showed people that a person could lead the  
life of a Grihastha or householder, and at the same time, lead a divine life  
or a life of purity and sanctity. He showed people that there was no necessity  
to leave the family and become a Sannyasin to lead a divine life of purity and  
sanctity. All his wise sayings and teachings are now in book form and known as  
 **Thirukkural** . These sayings are all in couplets. Here are some of them:  Just as the alphabet A is the beginning of all letters, so also, God is the beginning for this universe.   
 Learn the Shastras completely and then act according to their injunctions.   
 The Anicha flower will fade by smelling, but guests are more sensitive if the hosts turn their faces a bit.   
 Death is like sleeping in the burial ground;   
 birth is like waking in the morning.   
These couplets are 1,330 in number. They contain the essence of the Vedas, the  
Upanishads and the six Darshanas. Thirukkural is regarded as a universal  
Bible. It is another Gita, Koran or Zend Avesta.   
Some aspirants repaired to Thiruvalluvar and enquired: "O sage, which Ashrama  
of life is betterGrihastha or Sannyasa?". Thiruvalluvar did not give any  
answer. He simply kept quiet. He wanted to teach them the glory of Grihastha  
Ashrama by example.   
Thiruvalluvar was taking cold rice in the morning. He said to his wife: "Vasuki, the rice is very hot. Bring a fan to cool it". Thiruvalluvars wife  
was drawing water from the well when Thiruvalluvar called her. She at once  
left the rope and ran to him with a fan to cool the rice. She did not say to  
her husband: "How can the cold rice be hot? Why do you want a fan now?". She  
simply obeyed his commands. The vessel that contained water was hanging half-  
way in the well unsupported, on account of her Pativrata Dharma Shakti. The  
aspirants noticed this phenomenon and the noble conduct of Vasuki and were  
simply struck with amazement.   
About midday, on another occasion, Valluvar called his wife and said, "Bring a  
lamp immediately, O Vasuki! I am stitching the cloth. I cannot see the eye of  
the needle. I cannot pass the thread properly". Vasuki did not say to her  
husband: "It is broad daylight now. Why do you want a lamp? You can see the  
eye of the needle clearly". But she implicitly obeyed his word. The aspirants  
were much inspired by the ideal life of sage Thiruvalluvar and the exalted  
conduct of Vasuki. They did not speak a word to the saint. They took leave of  
the saint and quietly left the place with profound satisfaction. They were  
deeply impressed by the practical and exemplary life led by Thiruvalluvar and  
Vasuki. They learnt the lesson that the life of an ideal householder was in no  
way inferior to that of an ideal Sannyasin who was treading the path of  
Nivritti and austerity in the Himalayan caves and that each was great in its  
own place, time and circumstances.   
Dear readers! Such ladies sit enthroned in the hearts of their husbands. No  
doubt they are hard to find, because such women never advertise themselves;  
but there must be many in our land of Rishis and sages; and unless we maintain  
such a high level of moral purity, we will all be going down in these days of  
modern civilization and scientific advancement. If the husbands of the present  
day behave like Thiruvalluvar, the wives will say, "My husband has become  
senseless. He wants to fan the rice when it is so cold! He wants a light when  
there is broad sunlight". The wives will rebuke their husbands and fight with  
them.   
That house wherein the wife serves the husband with sincere devotion and  
observes **Pativrata Dharma** is heaven on earth. That house wherein the wife  
fights with the husband and disobeys his orders is a veritable hell on earth.  
Ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma need not go to temples. They need not  
practise any Vrata or penance. Service to the husband becomes worship. They  
can realise God through service to their husbands. Husbands also should be  
ideal persons with noble qualities. Husbands are the Gurus for their wives.  
The wives need not get any initiation from any Acharya. Glory to such exalted  
ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma!   
\-- _Swami Sivananda_

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Vasuki's highest chastity is too great to describe.   
Once she was pulling water from a deep well and the bucket   
was half way up to the parapet. Tiruvalluvar called her suddenly   
for some urgent help. She rushed back into the house from the   
back yard. It is said that the bucket half-pulled was simply   
static there at the height left by her without falling down into   
the well.   
Such women, one can see only in some Indian villages or in   
puranas today.

**Swami Sivananda (1887 - 1963)**   
 **Swami Sivananda** was born on **8th of September, 1887** in the village of  
**Pattamadai** in South India. His father Sri P.S. Vengu Iyer was a great  
devotee of **Lord Shiva** and mother Srimati Parvati Ammal was a god-fearing  
lady. His boyhood name was **Kuppuswamy**.   
Boy Kuppuswamy was intelligent and mischievous. In his boyhood itself he  
showed signs of Tyaga (renunciation) and love for fellow-beings. He used to  
pity the poor, feed the hungry at the door, and make his father throw a pie  
into the hands of pauper passing by. He often got cakes and sweetmeats from  
his mother and distributed them liberally to his younger companions, dogs,  
cats, crows, and sparrows, himself not eating a bit. He used to bring flowers  
and bael leaves for his father's Siva Puja.   
At the Rajah's High School, Ettayapuram, where he studied, Kuppuswamy always  
topped the class and won prizes every year. He had a sweet voice and wonderful  
memory. After the completion of the First Arts Examination, Kuppuswamy went to  
the Medical School in Tanjore to study medicine. He used to be tremendously  
industrious and never went home during the holidays. He would spend the entire  
period in the hospital. He had free admission into the operation theater.  
Kuppuswamy was first in all subjects. He possessed more knowledge than doctors  
with covetable degrees, and in the first year itself he could answer the  
papers which the final year students could not. Kuppuswamy completed the  
course and earned the title of M.B.,C.M. He practiced at Tiruchi.   
Later he got an offer from Malaya from Mr. Robbins to work in the hospital of  
a rubber estate. The young doctor worked very hard. Dr. Kuppuswamy was very  
kind, sympathetic, humorous, witty, and sweet-speaking. Hopeless cases came to  
him, but success was sure. Everywhere people declared that he had a special  
gift from God for the miraculous cures effected in the patients and acclaimed  
him as a very kind and sympathetic doctor with a charming and majestic  
personality. In serious cases, he kept vigil all night. In his private  
practice, Dr. Kuppuswamy used to attend to the poor and often not charge them  
even visiting or consulting fees. Instead he would give them money for special  
diet or to cover their own expenses after discharge from hospital. He gave  
money like water. Once a poor man, drenched to the skin, came to the doctor at  
night. His wife was in birth pangs. The doctor went there at once to her aid,  
and after attending to her, stayed outside the hut in spite of the heavy rain.  
Only after the save delivery of the child did the doctor return home the next  
morning.   
In spite of his busy life, Dr. Kuppuswamy served the Sadhus, Sannyasins, and  
beggars. He attended marriage functions, parties, and other social gatherings.  
Once a Sadhu gave him a book " **Jiva Brahma Aikyam** " by Sri Swami  
Satchidananda. It ignited the dormant spirituality in him. He began to study  
the books of **Swami Rama Tirtha, Swami Vivekananda, Sankara, Imitation of  
Christ, the Bible, and literature of the Theosophical Society**. He was very  
regular in his daily worship, prayer and Yoga Asanas. Study of sacred  
scriptures like the Gita, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata, and the Ramayana was  
done with great devotion. Sometimes he conducted Nandan Charitam and sang  
Bhajans and Kirtans. He practiced **Anahat Laya Yoga** and **Swara Sadhana**.   
Nothing could tempt the doctor. His heart was as pure as the Himalayan snow.  
His immense philanthropy and spirit of service and renunciation endeared him  
to all. People lovingly called him the "Heart of Love". As days passed, he  
reflected more and more and wanted to renounce the world. His heart was  
purified through loving service. At last, Dr. Kuppuswamy, enjoying a lucrative  
practice, renounced the world like Prince Siddartha, in 1923. He left Malaya  
for India.   
At Madras he proceeded to the house of a friend and left his luggage there. He  
began his pilgrimage. At **Benares**, he had the Darshan (vision) of Lord  
Visvanath. He visited Mahatmas (great souls) and temples. At Dhalaj, a village  
on the bank of the Chandrabaga river, he met a postmaster and lived with him.  
He acted as the postmaster's cook, and when the latter arrived home in the  
evening, the doctor was ready to shampoo his legs in spite of his  
remonstrances! It was the postmaster who suggested **Rishikesh** when the  
aspiring doctor wanted a place for solitary meditation.   
Dr. Kuppuswamy reached **Rishikesh** on the 8th of May, 1924. On the 1st of  
June, 1924, there came His Holiness **Sri Swami Visvananda Saraswati**. The  
doctor saw a Guru in the monk and the monk saw a Chela (disciple) in the  
doctor. After a brief exchange of words, Dr. Kuppuswamy was initiated into the  
Sannyas order by Swami Visvananda. Swami Vishnudevanandaji Maharaj, the Mahant  
of Sri Kailas Ashram, performed the Viraja Homa ceremonies. The Guru named the  
doctor Swami Sivananda Saraswati. Swami Visvananda wrote the necessary  
instructions about Sannyas Dharma from Benares. Swami Sivanandaji stayed at  
Swargashram for Sadhana.   
Swami Sivananda dressed to clothe himself, ate to live, and lived to serve  
humanity. A small dilapidated Kutir (hut), not resorted to by others and  
infested with scorpions, protected him from rain and sun. Living in that  
Kutir, he did intense Tapas (austerities), observed silence, and fasted. Often  
he fasted for days on end. He would keep a good stock of bread in his room,  
and for a week have this, together with Ganges water. He would stand up to the  
hips in the ice-cold Ganges in winter mornings and commence his Japa, coming  
out only when the sun appeared. He would spend more than twelve hours in daily  
meditation. With all his intense Tapas, Swamiji did not neglect service of the  
sick. He visited the huts of the Sadhus with medicines, served them, and  
shampooed their legs. He begged food on their behalf and fed them with his own  
hands when they fell sick. He brought water from the Ganges and washed their  
Kutirs. He attended upon cholera and small-pox cases. If necessary, he kept  
vigil through the night by the side of the bed of the ailing Sadhu. He carried  
sick persons on his back to the hospital. With some money from his insurance  
policy that had matured, Swamiji started a charitable dispensary at  
Lakshmanjula in 1927. He served the pilgrims and saw Narayana in them. Swamiji  
practiced all the various Yogas and studied the scriptures. After years of  
intense and unbroken Sadhana, he enjoyed the bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He  
had come to the end of his spiritual journey.   
He used to gather bits of paper and used envelopes, and stitch them into  
little notebooks. He entered some self-instructions in them. Some of the  
instructions found in them read thus: "Give up salt, give up sugar, give up  
spices, give up vegetables, give up chutnies, give up tamarind". In another we  
read: Serve Bhangis, serve rogues, serve inferiors, remove faecal matter,  
clean clothes of Sadhus - take delight, carry water". In another page: "Do not  
revenge, resist not evil, return good for evil, bear insult and injury". On  
some neat little pages we again read: "Forget like a child any injury done by  
somebody immediately. Never keep it in the heart. It kindles hatred. Cultivate  
**Maitri** (friendship), **Karuna** (compassion), **Daya** (mercy), **Prema**  
(love), **Kshama** (forgiveness)". In another paragraph we see: "Develop good  
manners, extreme politeness, courtesy, etiquette, good demeanour, nobility,  
gentleness, mildness. Never be rude, harsh, or cruel. There is nothing to be  
hated in the world. Hatred is ignorance. All contempt for anything or being  
must be removed through love and Vichara (enquiry)".   
Swamiji traveled the whole length and breadth of India during his Parivrajaka  
(wandering monk) life. He visited important places of pilgrimage in the South,  
including **Rameswaram**. He conducted Sankirtan and delivered lectures. He  
visited Aurobindo Ashram and met Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati. At **Ramana  
Ashram**, he had Darshan of **Sri Ramana Maharishi** on the Maharishi's  
birthday. He sang Bhajans and danced in ecstasy with the Bhaktas of Ramana.  
Swamiji went on a trip to **Kailas-Manasarovar** and **Badri**.   
He returned after the pilgrimage, to Rishikesh, and in the year **1936** sowed  
the seed of **The Divine Life Society** on the bank of the holy Ganga. From a  
small beginning the Society grew imperceptibly and it is now the headquarters  
of a world-wide Organization having a large number of Branches both within the  
country and outside. He got the Divine Life Society Registered as a Trust in  
the year 1936, with the main objects of dissemination of spiritual knowledge  
and selfless service of humanity.   
Swami Sivananda's Yoga, which he has significantly called the ' **Yoga of  
Synthesis** ', effects a harmonious development of the 'hand', 'head' and  
'heart' through the practice of Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga.   
On the 14th of July **1963**, the Great Soul Swami Sivananda entered  
Mahasamadhi (departure of a Self-realized saint from his mortal coil) in his  
Kutir on the bank of Ganga, in Shivanandanagar.

**Poems on Mother Kali**   
\- _by Ramprasad_   
Who in this world   
can understand what   
Mother Kali really is?   
The six systems of philosophy   
remain powerless to describe Her.   
She is the inmost awareness   
of the sage who realizes   
that Consciousness alone exists.   
She is the life blossoming within   
the creatures of the universe.   
Both macrocosm and microcosm   
are lost within Mother's Womb.   
Now can you sense   
how indescribable She is?   
The yogi meditates upon Her   
in the six subtle nerve centers   
as She sports with delight   
through the lotus wilderness   
of the pristine human body,   
playing with Her Consort,   
Shiva, the Great Swan.   
When anyone attempts to know Her,   
the singer of this song laughs.   
Can you swim across   
a shoreless ocean?   
Yet the child in me still   
reaches out to touch the moon.   
O wavering mind,   
awaken your upward-flowing awareness.   
Become the sublime warrior Goddess Kali,   
who moves with graceful power   
 through the vast landscape of the body.   
Her divine form, like a black storm cloud   
 illumined by the sun,   
she stands unveiled,   
her long hair falling free like monsoon rain.   
Be lost in awe of her, O mind,   
for you will never comprehend her.   
She dwells as the primal lotus of conscious energy   
 and also as the thousand-petal blossom,   
complete enlightenment.   
She is none other than primordial bliss,   
this great swan ever swimming   
 through the lotus jungle of the subtle body.   
Gaze intently into the blazing heart of joy   
 and you will perceive my blissful Mother,   
matrix of all phenomena.   
The vision of Kali   
 kindles the fire of unitive wisdom,   
burning down conventional barriers,   
pervading minds and worlds with light,   
revealing her exalted beauty   
 as universal flower garden   
and universal cremation ground,   
where lovers merge with Mother Reality,   
experiencing the single taste of nonduality.   
This ardent poet of the Goddess cries: "Every lover longs only   
 to gaze upon the unique Beloved.   
Why close your eyes?   
Why disappear into formless trance?"

I think Sri Ramakrishna used to sing Rama Prasad's poems in   
melting devotion.

Adding to the greatness of Vasuki there is another story. Once one siddha  
Kokannavar came to Vasuki for food. As she was busy in serving her husband  
Thruvalluvar she came little bit late to this siddha and offered food. He got  
angry for attending late. So he looked as if to burn her. Immedietly vasuki  
told him do you think am i a crane which was burnt by you. The siddha was  
surprised at this comment because he burnt a crane as it put his droppings on  
his body when he was meditating. But it happened far away from vasuki's place.  
When she could know this, she might be very powerful than siddha. He felt  
ashamed for his behaviour and went away to meditate further. Simply vasuki was  
a devoted wife and got enlightened. Thruvalluvar's samadhi is in Mylapore.   
In some books say Thruvalluvar belonged to weaver's community. Thruvalluvar  
gave a treasure to the man kind. i.e. Thrukkural

There are several stories about Tiruvalluvar's birth and community.   
Some say he is a Brahmin and some others say that he belongs   
to Seniyar, weaver's community. Because of his secular nature,   
DMK took him as their favourite poet. In Chennai and other places   
of Tamil Nadu, the transport buses used to have a photograph of   
him, (only a drawing), with a book and the writing instrument on his hands.  
DMK carefully made the portrait in such a way, there is   
a upper cloth across his chest so that there is no upaveedam,   
sacred thread, on his chest!   
He did not write anything about moksham in his Tirukural. He   
had the belief that if dharma, artha and kama are properly   
followed by one, the liberation will come automatically. But there   
are 10 couplets about God in the beginning of Tirukural. There   
he mentions God in a very indirect manner without giving scope to   
guess who is that God. For example, he says God is of 8 characteristics. ( a  
la Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram). He again says   
one should hold god's feet to come out of births and deaths, again   
a Hindu concept. Some used to say that in spite of all these descriptions, he  
was a Jain. Nothing is known clearly. Later   
Tamil poets consider him as a Saivite.   
There are 10 commentaries by 10 different scholars on his   
Tirukural. All of them belong to roughly between 4th century   
and 11th century. There are umpteen modern commentaries too.   
The commentary of Parimelazhagar is considered the best.   
Arunachala Siva.
