Anger and Love have no limits; choose the latter to have a beautiful,lovely  
life.....   
Things are to be used and people are to be loved,   
But the problem in today's world is that, People are used and things are  
loved...   
 _Watch your thoughts; they become words.   
Watch your words; they become actions.   
Watch your actions; they become habits.   
Watch your habits they become character;   
Watch your character; it becomes your destiny._   
The Will of God will never take you to   
where the Grace of God will not PROTECT you...   
Stay FAITHFUL and Be GRATEFUL.

Dear Prasanth ji   
I wanted to know how the destiny forms. Here you have written the cause of our  
destiny. Our thoughts are the root for our destiny. In tamil they say EDHAI  
NENAIKKIRAYO ADHUVAHA AGIVIDUKIRAI.   
So we must watch our thoughts. Our thoughts should be good then our destiny  
would be good. All thoughts are arising from our mind only. When our mind gets  
agitated good thoughts never come. At the result actions would be bad and bad  
destiny forms.   
This CHAKKAR NEVER ENDS?   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli Garu,   
Yes you are right.As you rightly said when we are unable to control our  
emotions few times good thoughs may not come at that point of time.   
Hence it is suggested to control our thoughts(mind) through various techniques  
like Self Enquiry,breath control etc.   
In Bhagavad gita Lord Krishna says   
Quote  
Ch6 Text35   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but **it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**  
But my personal opinion is it is not possible to achieve this 100% but we  
should try our level best is my suggestion.
