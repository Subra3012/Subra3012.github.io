## Spiritual practice after retirement

Most of us, in the past and also in the present times, think that   
spiritual practice can be reserved for post-retirement life. This   
is, as if the life is on our hands. Anything can happen by the time   
you become 60. One can have a heart attack and kick the bucket.   
Or one can be afflicted with some diseases, which come in the   
way of one's concentration or attention. Or, mere senility will   
give tiredness, sleepiness, and one complaint everyday.   
We have to start spirituality, right at least, in the middle age.   
And this needs God's grace. The simple practices of sandhya,   
bhakti, listening to discourses, reading books on spirltual practices and self  
realized saints etc., will take us to the right   
mediatative practices and self enquiry.   
Once one old man came to attend a Satsangh. He was in his   
80s and he came with his grandson. He will sit on the first   
row, and within 5 minutes of the word "go", he will go to sleep!   
He will sleep and drop his head, at least 10 times in 90 minutes!   
The discourser became uneasy, because this oldie makes him lose   
all interest in speaking and also suggests him to go to nap in the   
middle. One day, the disourser told the grandson that he would   
give Rs 2.00 everyday, if that guy wakes up his grandpa with   
walking stick whenever he goes to sleep. The grandson readily   
agreed. This went on for 2 days.   
Incidentally this grandson who is 7 years old, is really the   
child of post 2K years. He can operate the internet as if   
it is a rubber ball. Very clever guy.   
The grandson stopped his work after 2 days. The disocurser   
called him and asked him why. This fellow said: Sir you are   
giving Rs 2/-. But my grandpa gives Rs 5.00 everyday, if I   
do not disturb his sleep during the discourse!   
deham pranaabhi indriyanyapi chalam buddhincha sunyam vidhu: Stree balandha jadopamast tvahamithi pranta bruchanam   
vaadihina..... (Sri D.S. Verse 5)   
This body, breath, sense organs, buddhi, the sense of stupor or nothingness,  
will deteriorate and make one to become foolish like a woman or a young boy or  
a insentient object, as time   
engulfs you. This is Maha Maya of Pruthivi, asat, imagined   
delusions and desires. Go to the Guru, before it is too late. Hurry up please  
it is time, hurry up please it is time......   
Arunachala Siva..
