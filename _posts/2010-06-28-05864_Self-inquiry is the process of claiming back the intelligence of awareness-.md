I am a pediatrician and i observed that all children are intelligent and  
spontaneous   
irrespective of their social background.So as a child we are born with  
intelligence.   
We are the manifestation of the existence which is intrinsically intelligent  
in abundance.   
I also treat the adults but they are not so intelligent and spontaneous as  
children but   
they are cunning,conditioned by the society and fall in line with the way of  
society   
which is highly corrupt,brutal,violent,possessive, suppressive,self  
centered,ambitious,   
competitive.So during the transition from the childhood to adult this  
conditioning of the   
individual by the society is happening gradually.Society never wants you to be  
naturally   
intelligent.If the human being is conditioned it is easy for the society to  
manipulate him   
through the politician, priest,parents,educational system which kills our  
natural intelligence   
and makes us stupid.The whole educational system is created not to draw your  
innate   
intelligence inherent to awareness but to serve its vested interests.Saints  
like   
Sri Ramakrishna,Ramana Maharshi,Shirdi Sai Baba,Meher Baba are not conditioned   
insuch an educational system and they reached unimaginable heights in  
consciousness.   
Even JK is not a good performer in traditional education and he is just a  
matriculate.   
There is nothing wrong in getting trained in technological skills through  
education but   
the conditioning it imposes on us kills our natural intelligence is inimical  
to our growth   
and we must be aware of it.Scientists in the world developed weapons of mass  
destruction   
which can destroy the earth 500 times in the name of defending their countries  
and   
handed over them to the politicians and one such stupid may press the button  
of an   
atomic bomb and the earth with all its beauty may disappear in few moments.   
All these are the effects of conditioning and we have come out that at any  
cost,   
otherwise it is dangerous to the existence of humanity.They say to have peace  
on earth   
we must be prepared for war all the time with latest weaponry to destroy the  
human.   
Can violence bring peace? See the insanity of human conditioning which assumes  
itself   
as a master of our life and directing us what to do.Being limited the action  
born out of   
conditioning results in constant conflict,strife,misery.Life is a flux and we  
can respond   
to it moment to moment only if we are free and intelligent,we cannot be free  
if we are   
conditioned.We cannot face life with ready made answers from our conditioning.   
Parents impose obedience on you which destroys the intelligence as a great  
value   
because parents do not want you to be intelligent.   
This intelligence can be rediscovered through Self-inquiry which destroys all  
the barriers   
that society has created to prevent you from being intelligent.Ego is nothing  
but the   
conditioning imposed on you by the society.When we are doing Self-inquiry we  
question   
the existence of ego which is a group of ideas and thoughts imposed on you by  
the society   
with which we are identified with and feeling these group of ideas as the  
"me".Obviously   
this is not our nature and ego is just an utilitarian instrument in our hand  
to function in the   
hierarchic society.   
The function of Self-inquiry is negation,it removes the blocks and rocks that  
are imposed   
on us and which prevent the awareness from flowing freely.Self-inquiry brings  
back that spring of   
awareness alive.Everybody is carrying a great potential of awareness but  
society is preventing it   
from actualizing it by putting great blocks of conditioning  
politically,racially,economically,   
religiously thus imprisoning and limiting our consciousness in a way which  
serves their interests.   
To come out of that all such imprisonments of conditioning the intelligence  
involved in   
Self-inquiry just observes without fighting with the conditioning and that  
very observation   
puts aside the conditioning and thus we become free of all conditionings.Once  
you are out   
of the conditioning watching it,being aware of it,just being a witness you are  
intelligent.   
Then your intelligence which is innate in your awareness is discovered,with  
that intelligence   
we can undo what the society has done to us.We can destroy the mischief done  
by the society   
through our intelligence.We can destroy the conspiracy of  
priests,politicians,parents,teachers.   
When we come out of it for the first time we are an authentic free human  
being.That intelligence   
brings freedom and spontaneity.Stupid persons behave mechanically and  
intelligent person   
behaves consciously.Self-inquiry is a rebellion to destroy all this repressed  
structure which we   
call ego which represses our intelligence and brings stupidity to us.That is  
why Alzheimer's disease   
is becoming increasingly common best example being Ronald Reagon.Self-inquiry  
is real inner   
revolution which is psychological.It brings us to our original nature of pure  
awareness.   
All that is needed is to discover it,because it has been hidden for many  
centuries under the   
weight of the mind.The earth is waiting for free authentic human being who is  
free of   
conditioning and so joyfully celebrates his life.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Excellent. Every human being is born with natural intelligence.   
It is the social customs, practices and the educational systam   
and other such things mar this intelligence and make him or she   
'a being of society' not 'a being of God'. It is unfortunate that   
the independent India is adding to this poison by various measures.   
The purpose of Self Enquiry, I think, is to de-emot us from this   
social emotions which are diabolic and be in our natural emotion   
of one-ness with the God or the Self.   
What are the roots that clutch   
What branches grow out of this stony rubbish?   
Son of Man, you know only a heap of broken images,   
Where the sun beats, dead trees give no shelter and cricket   
 no relief.   
 -T.S. Eliot.   
Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 348: Having become free from concepts, which are afflicting   
thoughts, and with the 'I am the body' idea completely extinguished, one ends  
up as the mere eye of Grace, the non dual   
expanse of consciusness. This is the supremely fulfilling vision   
of God.   
Verse 349: Having restrained the deceitful senses, and having   
abandoned mental concepts, you should stand aloof in your real   
nature. In that state of Self-abidance in which you remain firmly established  
in the consciousness of the Heart, Sivam will reveal itself.   
Arunachala Siva.
