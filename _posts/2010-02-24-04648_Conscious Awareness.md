The Brahmo devotee: "If everything is really being done by Him, youre not  
responsible for your sins."   
Sri Ramakrishna (smiling): "Duryodhana said: 'O Hrishikesh, I act as You,  
seated within my heart, make me act.'   
"If you have the right kind of faith  that God alone is the Doer and you do  
nothing, you cant commit a sin. The person who knows how to dance well never  
takes a wrong step.   
"But unless youre pure in heart, you dont even have the faith that God  
exists."

## Conscious Awareness

**Conscious Awareness**   
To the question, "What is the path to a happy and peaceful life?" Baba  
spontaneously replied, " _Do whatever you like, but do it consciously, with a  
sense of awareness._ " The questioner, however, continued, "If You give Me  
permission to do as I please, then what would You say if I hit somebody's head  
with a stick?" Baba smiled and replied, "Do it and see. I asked you to perform  
all actions consciously. Once you become conscious and aware, you will find  
that your conscience will prevent you form hurting anyone." The evils in  
society are perpetrated because awareness is absent. All evil actions are the  
result of unconsciousness. To seekers of truth and bliss Baba gave another  
fruitful instruction. "If you intend to become spiritual, you must analyze  
your actions and thoughts each day before you go to bed at night. You must  
assess the good actions and evil actions and come to a firm resolution not to  
repeat evil actions anymore." A seeker should try to practice all activities  
in a state of awareness. This is the most important "abhyasa-yoga" or  
spiritual practice for the aspirant. Most recurring actions that flow from  
lust, anger, greed, jealousy and the like manifest only in a state of  
unawareness. The seeds of these tendencies lie dormant in the subconscious  
layers of the mind.   
\ Baba Lokenath

**Swami Vivekananda** said:  _Teach yourselves, teach everyone his real nature, call upon the sleeping  
soul and see how it awakens. Power will come, glory will come, goodness will  
come, purity will come, and everything that is excellent will come when this  
sleeping soul is roused to self-conscious activity._   
There are two parts in this saying: \- From idleness to activity, but not an activity of the ego.   
\- The activity should be self-conscious activity;   
an activity performed with the awareness of the Self;   
or keeping one's attention on the heart, the seat of the Lord (as much as  
possible);   
or an activity done with the remembrance of the Lord; for the sake of the  
Lord.   
Self-conscious activity makes karma a yoga, Karma Yoga.   
 **Sri Krishna** says in the Bhagavad Gita:  _Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread._   
Self-conscious activity tries to capture the garland, which is the Lord,  
knowing itself to be a bead. Karma also becomes Bhakti; which is why it is  
also able to bring power, glory, goodness and purity as mentioned by  
Vivekananda, since those are the treasures which comes from the Lord.
