Chapter 18: 1\. Ribhu: Listen again to the supreme knowledge that confers liberation  
immediately. All is Brahman   
alone, always. All is tranquility - there is no doubt.   
2\. All this is the imperishable Brahman of the form of the supreme. This is  
verily void. What is said   
to be this and spoken as 'we' is wrong.   
3. Whatever little of reminiscing there be is non existent. Whatever little of even meditation or whatever   
little of the form of knowledge - all that is Brahman only.   
4. Whatever few words are there about Brahman, whatever few words of the Vedas, whatever little said   
by the Guru - all that is Brahman only.   
5\. Whatever little blemish there be in truth, whatever little sweet speech  
there be, whatever little reflection   
there may exist - all that is Brahman only.   
6. Whatever little of regular listening, whatever little of meditation undertaken, whatever little of certitude   
and earnestness there be -- all that is Brahman only.   
7\. Whatever little instruction of the Guru there is, what little thinking  
about the Guru there is, whatever   
little diversity there be in the yoga practices - all that is Brahman only.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
