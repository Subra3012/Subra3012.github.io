Magda Havas demonstrates how WiFi connects your laptop, iPhone and iPad to the  
internet via microwave radiation. You will also learn how WiFi base stations,  
portable phones and baby monitors constantly radiate microwave radiation. The  
Swiss Government feels that all of these devices have the potential to do  
great harm if used incorrectly and warn their citizens.

I was discussing with my friend, about these huge Telephone towers found in  
many residential areas. It is no secret these days how harmful there towers  
are. My friend told me that in India they use primitive technolody that  
radiates high radiations and are extremely dangerous for everyone, and even  
more specifically for pregnant woman and babies. I asked, if it is so  
dangerous why is the government allowing these things on? he said, the  
companies have invested huge monies in all these towers and unless they are  
able to recover their costs, they are only going to hold us on ransom. For the  
companies, money is important than the people. For the government, their power  
is important than people.   
I guess, cigarate smoking is much better than these radiations (just kidding)  
some time back the media had some reports regarding these towers, but there  
was no response, and, thereafter, the media themselves forgot about all these.  
There are more interested in sensationalism than real welfare.   
This is what i observe, that the world has changed ridiculously even from what  
it was around Bhagavan's time.   
We are living in dangerous times. Where just meditation is not enough. These  
radiations definitely interfere with our mental energies.   
Can we do anything?

Dear Nagaraj,   
This subject has been bothering me for some time now. I have noticed over the  
past 10 years how so many people, who previously had good memories have become  
totally forgetful and easily distracted.   
Perhaps the digital age itself is partly to blame, because in these days of  
instant communication memory is not required as much (most of it in my  
experience being unnecessary chatter), but I am almost sure that the radiation  
from these towers is not helping matters.   
I was told that some westerner brought a detector from the west and measured  
the output from the towers. According to the story I was told, they were  
either 1600 or 16,000 times the radiation level permitted in the west.   
We are all being slowly cooked from the outside by the sun and the inside by  
the microwaves.   
Let us hope that it improves.   
Graham

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thank you for bringing light to this very important topic Yes, lets hope and  
pray that things improve! At least each one of us becoming aware of these,  
could lead to some change, to at least a minimal extant.

## Topic: speech by Sri J. Jayaraman @ Prasanthi Nilayam  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: April 30, 2012, 10:40:27 AM

Prasanthi Nilayam witnessed a festival of difference, Sri Sathya Sai Aradhana  
Mahotsavam, a celebration in commemoration of the ascent of the Avatar of the  
Age  Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba on 23rd, 24th and 25th April 2012. It was  
on the 24th of April last year that Bhagawan moved on from the physical plane  
of existence, to become the subtler omnipresence all-pervading reality. The  
festivity for three days was attended by thousands of devotees from all around  
the world and was marked with speeches and cultural programmes.   
Continuing with the colloquium, Experiencing the Divine  the Form to the  
Formless two programmes were slated for the evening session of 23rd April  
2012. The first was a scholarly speech by Sri J. Jayaraman from the  
Ramanashram.   
Sri Jayaraman gave a scholarly exposition delving into philosophical truths.  
Paying his salutations to the Self-effulgent, Self-sporting light Bhagawan Sri  
Sathya Sai Baba, the speaker spoke of his inner experiences. Sri Jayaraman  
opined that one cannot expect the form to be always there. One has to withdraw  
to go to a higher plane. One has to withdraw from the outer and travel to the  
inner plane. The inner subsumes the outer.   
Speaking further, the learned speaker posed a question, What is the most  
permanent thing in the Jagrat (waking) state? It is the sense of being. One  
has to surrender, and that is the ultimate stage in ones life. It will be  
foolhardy to say, I want to experience the Supreme Oneness. One has to  
surrender every action to the Lord.   
Sri Jayaraman was also blessed with two interviews with Bhagawan. When he  
asked Swami in one of the interviews for Balam (strength), Swami gave a  
succinct reply: Atma is Balam. He concluded his speech with a Sloka (verse)  
of Ramana Maharshi.   
The entire speech is currently unavailable, when it is made available, i shall  
post it here.
