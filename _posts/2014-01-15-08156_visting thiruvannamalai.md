## Ayur Vedic Medicine

Is there someone well versed in Ayur Vedic Medicine who can tell me something  
about it? At least shortly, okay I sincerely I am lazy to read, I have even  
book about it (paper - hard copied book), but I still don't read it, regarding  
healing treatmens, I read about Reiki now.   
My questions: 1) For what aliements - medical problems it is good for?   
2) What are the advantages, disadvantages (compared to other medical  
practices, like western scholar medicine) and finally what are the limits of  
this practice (for example it can cure this and this disease, but it can only  
relieve some pain in such and such medical problems, and for these problems  
that and that kind of medicine is better option)?   
Yes, critical thinking and critical view all the time...

though many may be aware of,   
i read some time ago, from an authentic source, a simple home made recipe  
using just two our kitchen ingredients. when i recommended to to my relatives  
and friends most chronics got far better while border and others totally  
cured. at no appreciation to me i am prepared to share it when i am contacted  
either over phone[9731833455] or at mail drsdm23@gmail.com i  
am positive about the goodness of this.

Dear sundaram,   
That is the only route. If you go by Volvo buses which ply at night, you may  
not feel the strain.   
Arunachala Siva.
