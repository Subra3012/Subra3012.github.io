Go beyond knowledge and ignorance; only then can you realize God.   
 **To know many things is ignorance. Pride of scholarship is also ignorance.  
The unwavering conviction that God alone dwells in all beings is Jnana,  
knowledge.**   
To know him intimately is Vijnana, a richer knowledge. If a thorn gets into  
your foot, a second thorn is needed to take it out.   
When it is out both thorns are thrown away. You have to procure the thorn of  
knowledge to remove the thorn of ignorance; then you must set aside both  
knowledge and ignorance. God is beyond both knowledge and ignorance.   
 **Once Lakshmana said to Rama, "Brother, how amazing it is that such a wise  
man as Vasishtha wept bitterly at the death of his son!" Rama said,"Brother,  
he who has knowledge must also have ignorance.   
He who has knowledge of one thing must also have knowledge of many things. He  
who   
is aware of light is also aware of darkness."   
Brahman is beyond knowledge and ignorance,virtue and vice, merit and demerit,  
cleanliness and uncleanliness.

Dear prasanath,   
Very nice. In this connection, one or two points: 1. Bhagavan Ramana also said in Upadesa Saram, that Knowledge   
(lit. Brahman) is beyond knowledge (objective knowledge, suttarivu   
says, Muruganar) and ignorance. (Verse 27)   
2\. Once Parvati from the sky was seeing Rama weeping bitterly   
for the loss of Sita. Parvati told Siva: See, he is brahma-swarupam,   
but he is weeping for his wife's loss. Siva said: "Yes. As Rama,   
he has to do that. Rama is Brahman. But sometimes he should   
act as if he is ignorant. Do one thing. Go in disguise as Sita and   
stand before him and see what happens."   
Parvati went as Sita and stood before Rama.   
Rama said: " O my sister Parvati! What is all this disguise   
as my wife? How is Sambhu? Kindly give my namaskarams   
to Sambu." saying these words, Rama further moved, crying   
O Sita, where are you?   
Parvati became ashamed and told Siva about what had happened.   
Siva said: "He is Rama Brahman. But he has show ignorance and   
also true Knowledge depending upon the situations."   
Bhagavan Ramana has told this story once in the Old Hall.   
Arunachala Siva.
