Everyone is searching something rather other. What makes us to search? Is it  
really missing? When our search will get end? Does it need any help to find  
out?   
After geting the missing thing..... searcher will become speachless.... There  
will be only silence.

Dear I,   
The paradox is that, like how Ramana Maharshi says, that a person who is in  
Arunachala keeps asking the way to Arunachala.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The search is there for Godhead as well as also in the world. The   
only difference is the search for Godhead is within. All outside   
searches also give some happiness. Bhagavan Ramana says in   
Who am I?: "When one gets the desired object and also when   
the hated object suffers, in both the cases, the mind goes back into   
Atma and enjoys the happiness! But this is obviously temporary."   
The mind gets happiness, when hated object suffers. This is something a  
little more complicated to understand. For example,   
there is a cricket match between India and Pakistan. When India   
wins it gets happiness. Suppose there is a match between South   
Africa and Pakistan. When Pakistan suffers defeat, we (Indians)   
get happiness!   
Arunachala Siva.
