Questioner: I am a retired chartered accountant and my wife is engaged in  
social work for poor women. Our son is leaving for the United States and we  
came to see him off. We are Panjabis but we live in Delhi. We have a Guru of  
the Radha-Soami faith and we value satsang highly. We feel very fortunate to  
be brought here. We have met many holy people and we are glad to meet one  
more.   
Maharaj: You have met many anchorites and ascetics, but a fully realised man  
conscious of his divinity (swarupa) is hard to find. The saints and Yogis, by  
immense efforts and sacrifices, acquire many miraculous powers and can do much  
good in the way of helping people and inspiring faith, yet it does not make  
them perfect. It is not a way to reality, but merely an enrichment of the  
false. All effort leads to more effort; whatever was built up must be  
maintained, whatever was acquired must be protected against decay or loss.  
**Whatever can be lost is not really one 's own; and what is not your own of  
what use can it be to you? In my world nothing is pushed about, all happens by  
itself. All existence is in space and time, limited and temporary.** He who  
experiences existence is also limited and temporary. I am not concerned either  
with 'what exists' or with 'who exists'. I take my stand beyond, where I am  
both and neither.   
The persons who, after much effort and penance, have fulfilled their ambitions  
and secured higher levels of experience and action, are usually acutely  
conscious of their standing; they grade people into hierarchies, ranging from  
the lowest non-achiever to the highest achiever. To me all are equal.  
**Differences in appearance and expression are there, but they do not matter.  
Just as the shape of a gold ornament does not affect the gold, so does man 's  
essence remain unaffected. Where this sense of equality is lacking it means  
that reality had not been touched.**   
Mere knowledge is not enough; the knower must be known. The Pandits and the  
Yogis may know many things, but of what use is mere knowledge when the self is  
not known? It will be certainly misused. Without the knowledge of the knower  
there can be no peace.   
Q: We were told that of all forms of spiritual practices the practice of the  
attitude of a mere witness is the most efficacious. How does it compare with  
faith?   
M: The witness attitude is also faith; it is faith in oneself. You believe  
that you are not what you experience and you look at everything as from a  
distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the  
witness only and the understanding acts. You need nothing more, just remember  
that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself: 'Who am I?', the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease  
to be the object and become the subject of all that happens; once having  
turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found  
yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the  
subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.   
Q: Krishnamurti says that Guru is not needed.   
M: Somebody must tell you about the Supreme Reality and the way that leads to  
it. Krishnamurti is doing nothing else. In a way he is right -- most of the  
so-called disciples do not trust their Gurus; they disobey them and finally  
abandon them. For such disciples it would have been infinitely better if they  
had no Guru at all and just looked within for guidance. to find a living Guru  
is a rare opportunity and a great responsibility. One should not treat these  
matters lightly. You people are out to buy yourself the heaven and you imagine  
that the Guru will supply it for a price. You seek to strike a bargain by  
offering little but asking much. You cheat nobody except yourselves.   
Q: How can I come to see myself as you see me?   
M: It is enough if you do not imagine yourself to be the body. **It is the  
'I-am-the-body' idea that is so calamitous. It blinds you completely to your  
real nature. Even for a moment do not think that you are the body. Give  
yourself no name, no shape. In the darkness and the silence reality is  
found.**

Nisargadatta' statement is not correct in one aspect.   
Before seeking, we have 'lost' the Self for ourself. But Self is   
our own, it is ours. So the 'lost' Self can be 'gained' because it   
is our own.   
Arunachala Siva.
