DRISHTIKON-- PERCEPTION   
There was a millionaire who was bothered by severe eye pain. He consulted so  
many physicians and was getting his treatment done. He did not stop consulting  
galaxy of medical experts; he consumed heavy loads of drugs and underwent  
hundreds of injections.   
But the ache persisted with great vigor than before. At last a monk who has  
supposed to be an expert in treating such patients was called for by the  
millionaire.   
The monk understood his problem and said that for sometime he should  
concentrate only on green colors and not to fall his eyes on any other colors.   
The millionaire got together a group of painters and purchased barrels of  
green color and directed that every object his eye was likely to fall to be  
painted in green color just as the monk had directed.   
When the monk came to visit him after few days, the millionaire"s servants ran  
with buckets of green paints and poured on him since he was in red dress, lest  
their master not see any other color and his eye ache would come back.   
Hearing this monk laughed said "If only you had purchased a pair of green  
spectacles, worth just a few rupees, you could have saved these walls and  
trees and pots and all other articles and also could have saved a large share  
of your fortune.   
You cannot paint the world green." Let us change our vision and the world will  
appear accordingly.   
It is foolish to shape the world, let us shape ourselves first.   
Change Your Perception..!!

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Gold Wrapping Paper  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 26, 2010, 10:34:11 AM

**http://ramanujamchats.blogspot.com/2009/02/gold-wrapping-paper.html**   
The story goes that some time ago a mother punished her five year old daughter  
for wasting a roll of expensive gold wrapping paper.Money was tight and she  
became even more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box to  
put under the Christmas tree.Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift  
box to her mother the next morning and then said, "This is for you, Momma."   
The mother was embarrassed by her earlier over reaction, but her anger flared  
again when she opened the box and found it was empty. She spoke to her  
daughter in a harsh manner. "Don't you know, young lady, when you give someone  
a present there's supposed to be something inside the package?" She had tears  
in her eyes and said, "Oh, Momma, it's not empty! I blew kisses into it until  
it was full."   
The mother was crushed. She fell on her knees and put her arms around her  
little girl, and she begged her forgiveness for her thoughtless anger.   
An accident took the life of the child only a short time later, and it is told  
that the mother kept that gold box by her bed for all the years of her life.   
 **Whenever she was discouraged or faced difficult problems she would open the  
box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had  
put it there.   
In a very real sense, each of us, as human beings, have been given a Golden  
box filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children, family,  
friends and GOD.   
There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Can God be seen?

Emperor Akbar once asked his wise Minister Birbal, Well, Birbal, you often  
repeat God is everywhere.   
Birbal rejoined, Yes, Baadshah! God is everywhere. There is absolutely no  
doubt in this.   
Akbar pulled the diamond ring off his finger and asked Birbal, Is your God in  
this ring, too?   
Birbal replied, Yes, Baadshah! He is certainly in the ring.   
Then can you make me see Him? asked the Emperor.   
Birbal had no answer to this. He asked for time; the Emperor allowed him six  
months in which to find an answer or to find out a way to show Akbar God in  
the ring. Birbal went home; he was puzzled. He knew there was a solution to  
the problem; but he knew not that solution. He dared not face the Emperor  
again without an answer to his question. He grew pale and anxious.   
Shortly after this encounter with the Emperor, a little boy-mendicant came to  
Birbals house for alms. He asked Birbal, What ails you, Sir? Why do you look  
so sordid and miserable? You are a wise man, and wise men should have no  
reason for misery! Joy and tranquility are the marked characteristics of a  
wise man.   
True!, replied Birbal. The heart is convinced, but the intellect cannot  
frame words for it. Birbal then narrated all that transpired between him and  
the Emperor.   
Is this what you are worrying about? exclaimed the boy in amazement. I can  
give you the answer in a moment; but will you allow me to talk to the Emperor  
personally?   
Birbal replied in affirmative and took the boy to the imperial court and  
addressed the Emperor, My Lord! Even this little boy can give you the answer  
to your question.   
Akbar inwardly appreciated the pluck and boldness of the boy and was curious  
to hear him. He asked the boy, If God is all-pervading, son, can you show me  
your God in the ring?   
O King! replied the boy, I can do so in a second; but I am thirsty; I can  
answer the question after I have taken a glass of curd.   
The Emperor at once had a glassful of curd given to him. The boy began to stir  
the curd and said, O Emperor, I am used to drinking good curd which has  
butter in it. I do not like this stuff which your bearer has brought and which  
does not yield butter at all.   
 **Certainly, this curd is the best available, replied the Emperor.  
Remember, little one, that you are partaking of the product of the Emperors  
personal diary.   
The boy said, Very well! If your Majesty is so sure that this cup of curd  
contains butter in it, please show me the butter.   
The Emperor laughed aloud and said, I thought so! O ignorant child! You do  
not know that butter can be got out of curd only after churning it; and yet  
you have the audacity to come here and show me God!**   
I am not a fool, Baadshah Sahib, replied the boy quickly: I only gave you  
the answer to your own question!   
The Emperor was puzzled. The boy said to him, **Your Majesty! In exactly the  
same manner, the Lord is residing within everything. He is the indwelling  
Presence, the Self of all, the Light of all lights, the Power that maintains  
the universe. Yet one cannot see Him with ones physical eyes. A vision is  
only a projection of ones own mind before the eye of the mind. One can  
realize God intuitively and see Him with the eye of wisdom; but before that  
one has to churn the five sheaths, and the objects, and separate the butter,  
the Reality, from the curd, the names and forms.**   
The young boy had thus answered Akbars question and the Emperor was greatly  
impressed. He wanted to know more and asked,  **Child! Now tell me, what is  
your God doing all the while?**    
 **The mendicant-boy replied: Well, your Majesty, it is God who lends power  
to our senses, perception to our mind, discernment to our intellect, strength  
to our limbs; it is through His will that we live and die. But man vainly  
imagines that he is the actor and the enjoyer. Man is a mere nothing before  
the Almighty governing power that directs the movement in the universe. It is  
in a twinkling of an eye, when compared to the unimaginable age of the  
universe, that empires rise and fall, dynasties rise and perish, the  
boundaries of the land and the sea wax and wane, and we find a mountain range  
where there had been a sea and a new sea where there had been a plateau.**   
 **It is in a twinkling of an eye that we find millionaires become paupers,  
and paupers become millionaires, and a King becomes a wandering exile by a  
tryst of destiny, and a vagrant becomes a King. So many planets are created,  
sustained and dissolved every moment in this vast universe. Who is behind  
these gigantic phenomena? It is God and none but the one God, to realize whom  
one has to give up vanity, the feeling of doer ship, arrogance and pride; to  
realize Him one has to surrender oneself entirely to His will, which can be  
discerned through cultivation of purity, emotional maturity and intellectual  
conviction; to realize that God, one has to efface oneself in toto and feel  
that one is a mere instrument of His will.   
It was a new experience for Emperor Akbar to hear the ancient wisdom from so  
young a mendicant. Akbar was very liberal in his views, and this encounter  
with a Hindu child-monk was perhaps in a way partly responsible for the  
Emperor to invite to his court many Hindu scholars and holy men to participate  
in spiritual and academic deliberations with Muslim divines and Maulvis.**

Dear prasanth,   
Many devotees had asked Bhagavan Ramana, whether they could   
see God. Bhagavan Ramana said: Turn the mind within and you   
will see him. Siva Darshan is only experiencing Siva inside. Siva   
is hidden from all outside objects, outside in everything, that   
you will see or use any of your five senses. Bhagavan Ramana did   
not even approve the so called visions, where people see God of   
their liking. He had said on many occasions: "Seeing God is Being God."   
It is interesting that what the boy said to Akbar has been said   
by Saint Manikkavachagar also in one of his poems in Tiruvachakam.   
There the saint-poet says: You are like the curd when the milk is set for curds. Curds are   
not seen immediately. The curds will appear only in proper time.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
Even bhagavan ramakrishna also says the same thing.   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=5063.0   
 **Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means  
of religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with  
the water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the  
world. Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart  
from the world.**
