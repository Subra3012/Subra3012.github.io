Hopefully it will be smooth and free from problems, but it might require the

Dear Sri Graham,   
Namaste,   
i was just wondering, if you can provide a small space in the top of this  
webpage, a section for Daily Quotes of Sri Bhagavan, automated may be. That  
would be really nice to read it everyday. Something like we have the Ashramam  
website - Quote of the Day.   
Just a suggestion. i request our members also to share some thoughts on this.   
Thank you,   
Regards,   
Nagaraj

## Paul Brunton And Major Chadwick's primary criticism of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: August 02, 2010, 05:22:00 PM  
---  
Brunton felt that Ramana took no stand on issues like the coming war. Brunton  
seems   
particularly upset by an incident when news was brought to the ashram that  
Italian planes had gunned undefended citizens on the streets of Ethiopia (the  
Italians invaded Ethiopia in October, 1935).   
Brunton reports that Ramana said: The sage who knows the truth that the Self is indestructible will remain  
unaffected even if five million people are killed in his presence.Remember the  
advice of Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield when disheartened by the  
thought of the impending slaughter of relatives on the opposing side.   
Bruntonâs criticisms of Ramana are quite different from what he said in  
Search: But perhaps it maybe good for us to have a few men who sit apart from our  
world of unending activity and survey it for us from afar (Search,289).   
 **Chadwick also made some criticisms of Ramana. He says that Ramana used to  
chew snuff(A pinch of smokeless tobacco inhaled at a single time), and that  
when Chadwick knew him he still chewed betel nut (Chadwick, 35).   
A more serious ethical shortcoming is that caste was observed in the ashram  
dining room.On one side the Brahmins were seated, on the other side the rest.  
Ramana insisted on it (Chadwick, 34).   
And Ramana seemed unconcerned regarding World War II. He is reported to have  
once remarked, âWho knows but that Hitler is a Jnani, a divine  
instrument.â (Chadwick, 35).**   
Ramana seemed to believe that a realized person was above ethical obligations  
of right and wrong. For the jnani there is no good or evil, only spontaneous  
activity or actionlessactivity of Tao:  _What is right and wrong? There is no standard by which to judge something to  
be right and another to be wrong. Opinions differ according to the nature of  
the individual and according to the surroundings. They are again ideas and  
nothing more. Do not worry about them. But get rid of thoughts. If you always  
remain in the right, then right will prevail in the world (Talks, 428; Feb. 8,  
1938)._   
 **It is this lack of ethical concern for others that was Brunton 's primary  
criticism of Ramana, and the reason that he chose V. Subrahmanya Iyer as his  
guru instead of Ramana.**

What are controversial and rubbish, need not be brought forward at all. This  
is my humble opinion. Its like opening the burial ground and extracting the  
rotten bones and smelling it.   
Spiritually, its not good.

We have read in Puranas, many stories... In Ramayana we have seen how Sage  
Vishwamitra requested Sri Rama to come and kill those Rakshasas who were  
creating trouble while conducting Yajnas...   
Those Rakshasas not to be literally taken, but, these bits of informations are  
themselves Rakshasas. They come and may affect a Sadhaka. If one is a Jivan  
Mukta its fine... all of us are just Sadhakas. These may tend to corrupt the  
minds and slow our progress and cause trouble to our faith! Why bring forth  
such Rakshasas ourselves?   
Its like, showing porn videos to children.   
... just my humble request and opinion... that these bits can be avoided... we  
are not going to gain anything out of it... these are not going to serve any  
purposes.... it will only create agitation in our (sadhakas) minds of   
Why not we immerse ourselves only in Bhakti and inknowing the True Self... is  
this not our true duty?

Infact, we all would have heard our elders say that one should not read or  
keep Mahabharata in Homes... thats basically because, these stories, could  
corrupt the reader. These are to be learnt only from a Guru. There have been  
some systems.. one cannot take initiations into mantras all by himself, a Guru  
has to initiate a disciple.   
Mantras are not just syllables, they could prove destructive if wrongly used.   
Our ancient seers, what ever puranas, we may read, they never recorded any  
controversial piece of informations, they are wise.   
There is a saying. .. "nadi moolam rishi moolam" should not be enquired upon  
at all meaning the source of a river and a rishi should never be enquired or  
even attempted to even know them at all.

Dear prasanth and Nagaraj,   
**   
Paul Brunton - we should be grateful to him, only for the fact,   
that he introduced Bhagavan Ramana to the western world. Otherwise, he was a  
grass-hopper not sticking to any one Guru   
or Path and further he wrote something as his own which are in   
fact, Bhagavan Ramana's teachings. This was the main criticism   
of everyone. But only good thing that we should remember Brunton   
is for his introduction of Bhagavan to the other side of the hemisphere. His  
role is like Kaikeyi's [even though such comparisons are odiou] who sent  
Rama to the forest and   
this gave an opportunity for Rama to kill Ravana, who had taken   
50 lacs days of longevity from Siva!   
Chadwick wrote what Bhagavan Ramana said about Hitler. He did not write  
anything on this further. A Brahma Jnani is beyond good   
and evil. Hitler was like that and his moksha lied in formation   
of a Nazi world. On the way to this goal, he never bothered as to how many  
were butchered on the way.   
You know that there were during Bhagavan's time a few brahmins who liked  
Hitler. Because, they felt that Hitler was an Aryan   
(Indo-Germanic) and under his rule brahmins in India will become Presidents  
and Prime Ministers, Generals and Field Marshals!   
As rightly opined by Chadwick, even if 50000 people were butchered in front of  
Bhagavan Ramana, He would have been   
expressionless. Because for a Jnani, everything, the world and its people are  
all unreal.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree. Such tangent [often untrue] criticisms should be welcome for  
debate. Recently David Godman quoted one speech   
of Osho, where he had said, that "this brahmin in codpiece, went   
to the Hill to search a cow to take it as his disciple.....David   
grew indignant. However, a lot of comments were exchanged in   
his blog."

Dear prasanrth,   
What would be Bhagavan Ramana's view on the pageant "that   
50000 butchers are butchered in His presence."   
He would say: "Oh! A few hundred shadows are axing a few thousand shadows.  
Both are unreal."

There is nothing in debating these topics...   
Its a good fruit for the ego to go on...   
Somewhere deep inside we, the 'I' wants such spices to keep going and  
strengthen itself. ..   
some how i would like to keep away from this... we all know what happened  
between two famous math fights. they left the essential teachings of Guru and  
his teachings and went about researching to defame each other. The cold war  
still persists.   
Controversies are virus.

Osho seems to have great reverence for Bhagavan: Just the other day I was reading a lecture of U. G. Krishnamurti. He says he  
went to see Ramana Maharshi. He was not attracted - because he was chopping  
vegetables. Yes, Ramana Maharshi was that kind of man, very ordinary. Chopping  
vegetables! U. G. Krishnamurti must have gone to see somebody extraordinary  
sitting on a golden throne or something. Ramana Maharshi just sitting on the  
floor and chopping vegetables? preparing vegetables for the kitchen! He was  
very much frustrated. Then another day he went and saw him reading jokes.  
Finished for ever! This man knows nothing. This man is very ordinary. He left  
the ashram; it was not worth it. But I would like to say to you: this man,  
Ramana Maharshi, is one of the greatest Buddhas ever born to the world. That  
was his Buddhahood in action! U. G. Krishnamurti must have been in search of a  
pretender. He could not see the ordinariness and the beauty of it and the  
grace of it. And this same man, U. G. Krishnamurti, lived with Swami Sivanand  
of Rishikesh for seven years - and that chap was just stupid - and practised  
yoga with him. And after seven years he recognized that he has nothing; but  
after seven years, he took seven years. That simply shows that he also has a  
mighty dull mind. Seven years to see that Sivanand has nothing. Seven seconds  
are more than enough! And with Ramana Maharshi, seven seconds were enough -  
because he saw him chopping vegetables or reading jokes, looking at cartoons.  
That's how the ordinary mind, the egoistic mind functions. The ego is always  
searching for something bigger, some bigger ego. And the true sage has no ego;  
he is an ordinary man. He is utterly ordinary - that is his extraordinariness!  
I would like to say to U. G. Krishnamurti: he should have looked in the eyes  
of Ramana Maharshi. He looked only at the hands which were chopping  
vegetables. He should have looked into his eyes - with what love he was  
chopping the vegetables. He should have looked into his eyes to see what love  
he was. He was the Real Man. There is only one indication and that is love.  
But to understand love you have to be a little silent, a little loving, a  
little open. If you are full of prejudices about how the enlightened man  
should be, then you will go on missing. You should not have any prejudices.  
Just look into the eyes of a real man, and suddenly something will start  
stirring in your heart too. Tears will come to your eyes, your energy will  
have a great delight, your heart will throb with new vigour. Your soul will  
spread its wings.

Because of loka vasana Paul Brunton and Chadvick felt like that about  
Bhagawan.To really understand Bhagawan we also must   
have uninterrupted Self-knowledge but just having a taste of Self is not

Dear I,   
Very True sir, and very important point you have mentioned "to have  
uninterrupted Self-Knowledge and not just having a taste of Self... it is not

Our efforts must be so sincere and continues giving no rooms for vasanas to

People should go to guru with true thirst and empty,open mind. Then they will  
get realization.   
There is a story..... I heard...longtime ago.. One man wanted to get self  
realization. After hearing some people he approached one guru. The man started  
talking, talking and told what he knew from the scriptures etc. etc.   
Guru did not utter a word instead he started making tea and poring tea into a  
cup which was already filled with tea. The cup started over flowing but Guru  
was continuing. The man got frustrated for not getting a single   
 upadesam and left that place. Guru showed his teaching through this action,  
means anything can be kept in a empty vessels not into a filled one. Poor man  
he could not understand this great teaching. Bhagavan was also like this guru.  
He never called people for teaching.   
This shows that we should forget all our learning and go with empty mind and  
approach with full longing for knowledge. Those who went like this to Bhagavan  
got immense bliss.

Well said raju garu.   
I agree with you and only because of loka vasanas few are lost in the race.   
Anyways as bhagavan says everyone will surely reach source/brahman and for few  
it takes little more time.   
Sri Sadhu Om describes it nicely.

Yes. One cannot approach Bhagavan Ramana or even His Presence   
today, without chitta suddhi. Pure mind and not judging things   
as per world's standard unreal standards. Sometimes Bhagavan   
Ramana's comments or words were depending upon the questioner's mind and thus  
His comments or words differed from person to person. All comments and words  
of Bhagavan Ramana should be viewed accordingly, contextually.   
Dear silentgreen,   
UGK's views were also to find fault with gurus thus create a sensation. He  
could not find any thing faulty in Bhagavan Ramana and hence he did not offer  
any comment.   
Arunachala Siva.
