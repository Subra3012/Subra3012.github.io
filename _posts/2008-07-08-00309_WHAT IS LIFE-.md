I recently sent two email messages to all members. Many were returned because  
the addresses were non-existent. The majority of those accounts have now been  
deleted because there is no way of contacting the member.   
The accounts of active members whose emails bounced have not been deleted. So  
if you are an active member then please ensure that your email address is  
correct.   
Email verification has now been enabled for those registering for the first  
time or re-registering.

My dear Graham, My e mail address is: g337h4@yahoo.com.   
But, Sir, I had a different problem for the past 15 days. My   
computer broke down and it took 2 weeks to set right and today only   
it became alright. I case I have not received your e mail, I shall send   
you a communication. Thanking you,   
Yours truly,   
Subramanian. R

When the mind is killed, you are the Self. Satyam-Nyayam-Dharmam,   
Satyam-Sivam-Sundaram, Prajna Parimita, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss,   
Maha Sunya, ALL these are names. Who cares? If one becomes   
the Sugar candy, what does it matter to you, if one calls it sweet, another   
sour and the third bitter? If you are the Rose, what does it matter to   
you, if one calls it pink, another green and the third black?   
Arunachala Siva.

Life is a great opportunity to know the nature of self.

Dear Sankar, the Eye, the limitless eye, as Bhagavan said,   
will be known to you only when you go past the organic   
eye, not only eye but all the cognative and contative senses.   
Till such time, you will only be eyeing for the Eye, which is   
within you.   
Arunachala Siva.
