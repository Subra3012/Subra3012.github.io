My Greetings to all inhabitants of this forum !   
I?m a man, 40 y.o., living in Ukraine.   
During reading books ?Face to face with Ramana Maharshi? and ?Talks with  
Ramana Maharshi? I had Satori ( temporary realization / awakening ). It was  
several times and it was marvelously !   
I have some thoughts and I would like to share it with all interested in  
Advaita.
