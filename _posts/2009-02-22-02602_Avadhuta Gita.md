## Avadhuta Gita

Avadhuta Gita is a text of Vedanta representing extremen Advaita. It is  
ascribed to Dattatreya. Avadhuta means liberated soul, one who has 'passed  
away from' or 'shaken off' worldly attachments. Avadhuta naturally implies  
renunciation but yet a higher state which is neither attachment nor non  
attachment but beyond both.   
I felt this thread would benefit the forum member immensely. I thought I'd  
share some selected verses whenever I get time to post here.   
 _ekameve samam tattvam vadanti hi vipashchitah   
raaga-tyaagah punah chittam ekaanekam na vidyate_   
Sages say that reality is one only and the same   
and through renunciation of attachment,   
the mind, which is one and many, ceases to exist.   
Satguru Paahi Paahi

_anaatma ruoam chan katham samadhih   
atma svarupam cha katham samadhih   
astiti nastiti katham samadhih   
moksha svarupam yadi sarwam ekam 23   
_   
If it is of the nature of the not-Self, how can there be samadhi?   
If it is of the nature of the Self, how can there be samadhi?   
If it is both - 'IS' and 'IS NOT', how can there be samadhi?   
If it is all one and nature of freedom, how can there be the nature of  
Samadhi?   
As long as the seer is present to describe itself as 'Self', or describes  
itself 'not Self' or find itself to be both as the only IS or what is not, how  
can there be samadhi?   
When Samadhi takes over, we can never know it, for we will not be there, there  
is no Seer.   
_Tattvamasyaadi vaakyena svaatma hi pratipaaditah   
Neti Neti srutir bruyaat anrutam Pancha Boutikam 25   
_   
By the great Tattvaas such as 'That Thou Art' your own Self is affirmed,   
of all that which is untrue and composed of the five elements, the Sruti says  
Neti-Neti - Not this not that.   
 _Aatmanyevaatmana sarvam tvaya purnam nirantaram   
dhyata dhyaanam na te chittam nirlajjam dhyaayate katham 26_   
As the Self is filled only by the Self alone, so is all continuously filled by  
you.   
There is no Meditator or Meditation. Why does your mind meditate shamelessly?   
Its again affirmed again here that all is only the self itself. Even all those  
imagined is verily the self itself. In our ignorence we strive strive and do  
severe austerities to attain the Self. But is the Self something to attain?  
how can we attain something that we itself are? what is the need to meditate?  
on what do we meditate? the object of meditation is also in our mind and our  
mind iin our self, and the problem is that we think we are meditating on some  
different entity and that different entity will come and give us the  
knowledge of the Brahman and all? all these are imaginary make outs of the  
Self itself?   
The verse conveys that I am Self! why do anything afterall, you are already  
that, you are not going to change after meditation, or will the meditation  
change you in anyway. In the end I am what I am, The Self will remain the same  
in spite of any austerities.

_Sivam na Janami Katham vadami?   
Sivam na Janami Katham Bhajami?   
Aham Sivas cet Paramaartha Tattvam   
Sama Svarupam Gaganopamam ca 27_   
I do not know the supreme (Sivam) how shall I speak of him?   
I do not know the supreme (Sivam) how shall I worship him?   
If I am the Supreme One, who is the highest truth,   
who is homogeneous being and like unto space,   
How then shall I speak of Him and worship him?   
Bhagawan Ramana always advised everyone to be quiet or to stay Mouna. what  
else is required of us. All the texts say that we cannot know that state of  
realisation as it is beyond senses of perception. Trying to know that state is  
an endless cycle. There is no end to it.   
Since that state being not knowable through senses, how can we really worship  
that state or even talk of that state so as to praise or attain that state?  
the very entity who is making this enquiry itself is the unknowable. what can  
it speak of itSelf?   
O Bhagawan I love you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: Being still, Summa irutthal, is real mounam. This  
is delving in Atma Swarupa. Saint Tayumanavar   
says: If one becomes That, That will tell what It is. Athuvanal   
athuvahum, athuve sollum.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Beautiful verses - "Athuvanal athuvahum, athuve sollum" I would like to read  
the works of Saint Tayumanavar, which is the Saints main work?   
no vedya vedakam idam na ca hetu tarkyam   
vacaamagocaram idam na mano na buddhih   
evam katham hi bhavatah kathayaami tattvam   
Jnaanaamrutam samarasam gaganopamo'ham 17 (Chapter 3)   
This (Self) is neither knowable nor the instrument of knowing. It is neither  
reason nor the one to be reasoned about. It is beyond the reach of words. It  
is neither mind nor intelligence. How then can I speak of this Truth to you? I  
am the nectar of knowledge, homogeneous Existence, like the Sky.   
Prostrations to Bhagawan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Tayumanavar songs are available in a single book, and is published   
by Swami Chidbhavananda, of Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam, Tiru   
Paraithurai, near Tiruchirapalli. I do not know the pincode. You   
may write to them, and it costs about Rs 75 + courier charges.   
There is no English prose translation. Meanings for difficult words   
have been given in the same Tamil book.   
Tayumanavar lived in 18th century in Tiruchirapalli. He was a   
great devotee of Akhilandeswari and Jambukeswara of Tiru   
Anaika, the 'water' of Panchabhuta stala. He did a lot of miracles   
in his young age. He is a Pillai, like M. Sivaprakasam Pillai of   
Bhagavan, a Saivite non brahmin. I think he was married too.   
Arunachala Siva.
