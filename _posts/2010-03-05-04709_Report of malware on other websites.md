## Sayings of Milarepa  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 05, 2010, 02:11:13 PM  
---  
Initial realizations of Milarepa: In order to achieve perfect seeing one needs a perfect master who knows how to  
transmit fully and unerringly the four aspects of initiation and skillfully  
explain the hidden meaning with compassion. Initiation awakens one to ultimate  
reality and from then onward one meditates through all the various stages of  
the Path. Having endeavored to discover the non-selfhood of personality, which  
is common to all esoteric traditions, one examines the self by means of logic,  
the teaching, and analogies and, not finding the self, one understands  
**selflessness**. One must then bring the mind into a quiet state. When the  
mind is **calmed** by means of such reasoning, discriminating thought ceases  
and mind reaches a **non-conceptual state**. If one continues in this state  
for days, months, and years, so oblivious to the passing of time that one  
needs to be reminded of it by others, one has then achieved **tranquility** of  
mind.   
This state of **tranquility** is maintained by means of continued  
**attention** and **awareness**, not allowing it to become distracted or to  
sink into passivity. Intensified by the force of awareness, one experiences  
**pure consciousness** without differentiation - naked, vivid, and crisp.  
These are the characteristics of tranquillity of mind.   
Pure consciousness may be regarded as a flash of perfect insight; individuals  
do not actually experience it until they reach the first stage of  
Enlightenment. At this stage, one meditates, visualizing the forms of the  
yidam. In so doing one may experience visions and forms, but these are devoid  
of substance and are merely products of meditation.   
To sum up: First, a vivid state of **mental tranquility** and a **sustaining  
energy** together with a **discerning intellect** are indispensable  
requirements for attaining perfect insight. They are like the first steps of a  
staircase.   
Second, all meditation, with or without form, must begin from deeply aroused  
**compassion** and **love**. Whatever one does must emerge from a loving  
attitude for the **benefit of others**.   
Third, through perfect seeing, all discrimination is dissolved into a **non-  
conceptual state**.   
Finally, with an awareness of the **void**, one sincerely **dedicates the  
results for the benefit of others**. I have understood this to be the best of  
all ways.   
Just as a starving man cannot be fed by the knowledge of food but needs to  
eat, so too one needs to experience in meditation the meaning of emptiness. I  
understand more particularly that in order to arrive at perfect insight it is  
necessary to practice **meritorious deeds** and **self-purification**,   
without respite, in the intervals between meditations.   
In short, I saw that this mediator's understanding of the **emptiness** of  
things, of their unity, of their indefinability, and of their non-  
differentiation corresponds to the four aspects of initiation according to  
Vajrayana.   
In order to make this knowledge manifest in myself, I subdued my body,  
deprived it of food, harnessed my mind, and achieved equanimity in the face of  
all circumstances including the danger of death.

## Re:[1]Nagarjuna's Mahamudra Vision  
Author: matthias            Date: March 06, 2010, 08:52:41 AM

Nagarjuna's Mahamudra Vision   
Homage to Manjusrikumarabhuta!   
1\. I bow down to the all-powerful Buddha   
Whose mind is free of attachment,   
Who in his compassion and wisdom   
Has taught the inexpressible.   
2\. In truth there is no birth -   
Then surely no cessation or liberation;   
The Buddha is like the sky   
And all beings have that nature.   
3\. Neither Samsara nor Nirvana exist,   
But all is a complex continuum   
With an intrinsic face of void,   
The object of ultimate awareness.   
4\. The nature of all things   
Appears like a reflection,   
Pure and naturally quiescent,   
With a non-dual identity of suchness.   
5\. The common mind imagines a self   
Where there is nothing at all,   
And it conceives of emotional states -   
Happiness, suffering, and equanimity.   
6\. The six states of being in Samsara,   
The happiness of heaven,   
The suffering of hell,   
Are all false creations, figments of mind.   
7\. Likewise the ideas of bad action causing suffering,   
Old age, disease and death,   
And the idea that virtue leads to happiness,   
Are mere ideas, unreal notions.   
8\. Like an artist frightened   
By the devil he paints,   
The sufferer in Samsara   
Is terrified by his own imagination.   
9\. Like a man caught in quicksands   
Thrashing and struggling about,   
So beings drown   
In the mess of their own thoughts.   
10\. Mistaking fantasy for reality   
Causes an experience of suffering;   
Mind is poisoned by interpretation   
Of consciousness of form.   
11\. Dissolving figment and fantasy   
With a mind of compassionate insight,   
Remain in perfect awareness   
In order to help all beings.   
12\. So acquiring conventional virtue   
Freed from the web of interpretive thought,   
Insurpassable understanding is gained   
As Buddha, friend to the world.   
13\. Knowing the relativity of all,   
The ultimate truth is always seen;   
Dismissing the idea of beginning, middle and end   
The flow is seen as Emptiness.   
14\. So all samsara and nirvana is seen as it is -   
Empty and insubstantial,   
Naked and changeless,   
Eternally quiescent and illumined.   
15\. As the figments of a dream   
Dissolve upon waking,   
So the confusion of Samsara   
Fades away in enlightenment.   
16\. Idealising things of no substance   
As eternal, substantial and satisfying,   
Shrouding them in a fog of desire   
The round of existence arises.   
17\. The nature of beings is unborn   
Yet commonly beings are conceived to exist;   
Both beings and their ideas   
Are false beliefs.   
18\. It is nothing but an artifice of mind   
This birth into an illusory becoming,   
Into a world of good and evil action   
With good or bad rebirth to follow.   
19\. When the wheel of mind ceases to turn   
All things come to an end.   
So there is nothing inherently substantial   
And all things are utterly pure.   
20\. This great ocean of samsara,   
Full of delusive thought,   
Can be crossed in the boat Universal Approach.   
Who can reach the other side without it?   
Colophon   
The Twenty Mahayana Verses, (in Sanskrit,   
Mahayanavimsaka; in Tibetan: Theg pa chen po nyi   
shu pa) were composed by the master Nagarjuna.   
They were translated into Tibetan by the Kashmiri   
Pandit Ananda and the Bhikshu translator Drakjor   
Sherab (Grags 'byor shes rab). They have been   
translated into English by the Anagarika   
Kunzang Tenzin on the last day of the year 1973   
in the hope that the karma of the year may be mitigated.   
May all beings be happy!

## Report of malware on other websites  
Author: Akira               Date: March 05, 2010, 06:38:29 PM

Anti-virus software on my computer detected a trojan horse type of malware   
on Nithyananda's website - in the link 'ashrams&centers' on his website  
homepage.   
I am not sure if it is appropriate to report malware on other websites here,   
but I report it for other members' safety,   
thinking that somebody might visit his website out of curiousity just like I  
did.

Hi Akira,   
Badly designed websites can be hijacked by malware which piggy-backs on the  
genuine URL, redirecting you to a malware site which warns you about having  
trojans, etc. on your computer. It then invites you to download anti-virus  
software which is actually Malware itself. This will then pretend to remove  
malware but set about stealing all of your passwords, credit card details,  
etc. and you will then become part of a Botnet.   
The best thing to do, is to type in the URL yourself, without any code after  
the '/' which follows the domain name. Then search from there - for example -   
The URL of this page is http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/forum/index.php?action=post;topic=4709.0;num_replies=0   
Type in http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/ instead and search from there.

## Report of malware on other websites

Anti-virus software on my computer detected a trojan horse type of malware   
on Nithyananda's website - in the link 'ashrams&centers' on his website  
homepage.   
I am not sure if it is appropriate to report malware on other websites here,   
but I report it for other members' safety,   
thinking that somebody might visit his website out of curiousity just like I  
did.

Hi Akira,   
Badly designed websites can be hijacked by malware which piggy-backs on the  
genuine URL, redirecting you to a malware site which warns you about having  
trojans, etc. on your computer. It then invites you to download anti-virus  
software which is actually Malware itself. This will then pretend to remove  
malware but set about stealing all of your passwords, credit card details,  
etc. and you will then become part of a Botnet.   
The best thing to do, is to type in the URL yourself, without any code after  
the '/' which follows the domain name. Then search from there - for example -   
The URL of this page is http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/forum/index.php?action=post;topic=4709.0;num_replies=0   
Type in http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/ instead and search from there.
