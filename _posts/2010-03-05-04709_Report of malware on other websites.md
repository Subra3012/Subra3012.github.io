## Report of malware on other websites

Anti-virus software on my computer detected a trojan horse type of malware   
on Nithyananda's website - in the link 'ashrams&centers' on his website  
homepage.   
I am not sure if it is appropriate to report malware on other websites here,   
but I report it for other members' safety,   
thinking that somebody might visit his website out of curiousity just like I  
did.

Hi Akira,   
Badly designed websites can be hijacked by malware which piggy-backs on the  
genuine URL, redirecting you to a malware site which warns you about having  
trojans, etc. on your computer. It then invites you to download anti-virus  
software which is actually Malware itself. This will then pretend to remove  
malware but set about stealing all of your passwords, credit card details,  
etc. and you will then become part of a Botnet.   
The best thing to do, is to type in the URL yourself, without any code after  
the '/' which follows the domain name. Then search from there - for example -   
The URL of this page is http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/forum/index.php?action=post;topic=4709.0;num_replies=0   
Type in http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/ instead and search from there.
