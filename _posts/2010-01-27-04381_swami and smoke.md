a) Once, a boy was seated in front of Sri Bhagavan. Flies were troubling him  
and he was killing them.   
Seeing this Bhagavan told him: Dont kill them; it is wrong. After some time  
the boy looked at Bhagavan intensely and remarked: You say killing is wrong.  
I was only killing little flies which were giving me trouble, but you have  
killed a big tiger and you are sitting on its skin. How can it be? Bhagavan  
laughed and said: Yes, what he says is quite right!   
b) The same boy had the habit of wasting food served on his leaf-plate while  
seated with others. Once Bhagavan told him that he should not leave anything  
on the plate when he finished eating. That day too the boy could not eat  
everything, but stuffed something into his mouth and took out the empty leaf.   
Bhagavan saw him take out the empty leaf. However, the boy after throwing away  
the leaf also spat out the food that he had stuffed in his mouth. It was  
reported to Bhagavan. He enjoyed the trick of the boy and gave a hearty laugh.   
c) Another boy who used to go round the Hill with Sri Bhagavan and other  
devotees was always silent, though others used to sing hymns and prayers and  
chants. (Bhagavan sometimes even used to hold this boys shoulder while  
walking round the Hill.)   
One day Bhagavan, after everyone of the party had sung some song or other,  
asked this boy why he alone did not sing.The boys spontaneous reply made Sri  
Bhagavan laugh to his hearts content. It was: Do jivanmuktas ever sing?   
d) The author of Sat Darshana Bhashya, Sri Kapali Sastriar,was very close to  
Sri Bhagavan from his early youth, so much so he was one of the very few whom  
Bhagavan addressed intimately without prefixing or suffixing respectful terms  
(Bhagavan was very particular in addressing all, even children, only with  
respect). His parents were very keen to get him married and he himself was  
stoutly opposing it. They even approached Bhagavan to persuade him to marry.   
One day, Sri Kapali Sastriar went near Bhagavan and said: Bhagavan, tomorrow  
I intend taking up asrama1 (stage in life). Bhagavan, who knew his aversion  
to marriage and the anxiety of his parents, was surprised and said Kapali,  
what are you saying? Have you taken the permission of your parents?   
Meekly he replied: Yes, Bhagavan! I am going to enter into the second asrama1  
(meaning, marriage)! Bhagavan laughed heartily and enjoyed the joke.   
e) A young girl, named Rukmini, aged ten, the daughter of Vilacheri Ranga  
Iyer, used to meditate in front of Sri Bhagavan,seated like a statue. Some  
older boys or girls sitting next to her used to tickle her to disturb her.   
Bhagavan used to watch all these in amusement. One day, after having had her  
bath,Rukmini, as usual, sat for meditation in right earnest (like a yogi). A  
boy nearby (who had not had his bath yet) teased her,saying: I am going to  
touch you. Rukmini firmly replied: No one can touch me! Bhagavan was looking at them. She turned to Bhagavan  
and then asked, Yes, none can touch me,they can touch only my body. How can  
any one touch ME?   
Bhagavan gave an expression of wonder and appreciation at the depth of her  
statement!   
f) Mudaliar Patti, who used to feed Sri Bhagavan daily, always tried to serve  
more cooked rice to him, by making a ball of rice by pressing it hard into a  
certain shape.   
One day, Sri Bhagavan,noticing her trick, commented, She is clever.   
She feels she could serve me more food through making it appear less. I know  
her trick! Bhagavan made gestures of her pressing the rice with her hands.  
Taking the cue, straight came Mudaliar Pattis reply: Bhagavan! What is more  
and what is less? There is nothing that is either big or small.   
Everything is only our bhavana (thinking). She made similar gestures as made  
by Bhagavan. Bhagavan enjoyed the joke and remarked, See, see! How well she  
is giving back to me my own teaching.

Dear friend,   
Nice post. Bhagavan Ramana's humour is itself quite harmless.   
His children were also making jokes like Him, without harming   
anyone and at the same time revealing highest Truth.   
Once one kitchen server, I think it is Sampurnamma, served   
Bhagavan Ramana with more of rice. Bhagavan Ramana told   
her: It is quite a large quantity. Sampurnamma said: "What is   
large? What is small? It is all in the mind!"   
Bhagavan laughed heartily and said: "O, You are telling my teachings to me!"   
Arunachala Siva,

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. In the same way, I think, when a large volume of incense was   
burnt or when arti was shown, Bhagavan Ramana said: "Okay. Show   
these to to your heart's content. But why not to that Kallu Swami (the   
stone image, in front of Mother's Temple? It will not object." This   
was in 1946. It happened. Today we have only the Kallu Swami but   
not Bhagavan Ramana in body. His living Presence is however definitely   
there. The Asramam has seen to it that no arti is shown or no incense   
is burnt even before that stone image!   
Arunachala Siva.

Doopam normally refers to a small wick dipped in ghee and shown   
to God in the home altar before actual camphor lighting.   
Deepam is a regular lamp, with oil or ghee.   
Dasangam is the one which is called Sambrani, the powder which   
is burnt on a coal fire.   
The words, Dasangam and Doopam are of course interchangeably used.   
Arunachala Siva.
