ALTHOUGH Thayumanavar lived less than 300 years ago and remains the most  
popular Tamil poet-saint, there is no authentic record of his date of birth or  
death. What is known to have transpired between these two events can be summed  
up briefly: At an early age he began working in the service of a king. When the king died  
he left this work because of the amorous advances of the king's widow. He then  
travelled in search of a Guru. At Tiruchilapalli he met Mouna Guru Arulananda  
Sivachari. **He asked to be taken as a disciple, but the saint answered  
'chumma iru', meaning 'be still' or 'be quiet' or 'just be' (a phrase which  
Ramana Maharshi also used on a number of occasions). However, the saint said  
that when the time was ripe he would initiate him.**   
 _Thayumanavar then returned home and married. Soon after his wife delivered  
their first child, a boy, she died. That again prompted Thayumanavar to leave  
home in answer to his spiritual calling. He once more approached Arulananda  
Sivachari and, true to his word, the guru fulfilled his promise and initiated  
Thayumanavar into sannyas._   
Thayumanavar followed the discipline of silence (mouna), which he describes  
as: "that state which spontaneously manifests after the annihilation of the  
ego." He says: "It is a state beyond light and darkness, but it is called  
light, since language is inadequate to express it. **The ego disappears and  
'I' spontaneously manifests in full glory." The Maharshi particularly singled  
out this verse of his for admiration.**   
Thayumanavar was equally great as a saint and a poet. Often he would retire to  
the forest or public gardens and remained for days absorbed in the bliss of  
the Self. Legend has it that he was sitting thus, immobile in samadhi in a  
public garden in Ramnad when the gardeners, not noticing him, piled a heap of  
dry leaves and twigs about him and set fire to it, and thus his body was  
consumed and he merged in the Supreme.   
 **Thayumanavar 's key teaching is to discipline the mind, control desires and  
meditate peacefully. He went on to say that "it is easy to control an  
elephant, catch hold of the tiger's tail, grab the snake and dance, dictate  
the angels, transmigrate into another body, walk on water or sit on the sea;  
but it is more difficult to control the mind and remain quiet".**   
Ramana Maharshi was often heard quoting from his exquisite verses. The  
following are ten verses especially selected by the Maharshi:  **1 & 2\. The individual ego known as "I" having manifested and troubled  
everyone**, the universal Maya, the diversifying agency, spontaneously follows  
in its wake. Who can possibly describe the vast ocean of misery consequent  
upon it? It appears as the flesh, the body, the senses, interior and exterior,  
as the all pervading ether, air, fire, water and earth, as mountain, forest,  
huge visions like hills physical and subtle, as forgetfulness and memory, and  
so on, rising up wave after wave and beating against man, bringing pleasure  
and pain, which are the result of his past actions, and also their remedies  
known as creeds, religions, God-Seeker, and the testimonies and sanctions  
found in various sciences, and explained by logic. All these are more numerous  
than even the fine grains of sand on the seashore.   
3\. Unaccountable troubles crop up spontaneously, sheaf upon sheaf. How to  
root them out wholesale, even as burning up a hill of camphor without residue  
in a vast blaze of fire? In order to achieve this miracle, and to enlighten  
me, Grace took shape. In every respect, like my self, eating and sleeping,  
suffering and enjoying, bearing a name and born somewhere, it appeared as the  
Silent Guru, like a deer used to decoy another of its species.   
4\. And claimed my body, possessions and life itself and consistently with the  
process of elimination, signified "you are not the five senses nor the five  
elements, nor the limbs, nor the mind, nor their attributes, nor all these  
collectively, nor the body nor knowledge nor ignorance. You are pure  
consciousness, unassociated like a crystal, but reflecting the background to  
lookers-on; whereas we (guru) are only the inherent nature revealing the truth  
on finding you ripe for it."   
5\. "If eager to reach Consciousness-Bliss-Eternity innermost in all, which is  
also the inner abode of refreshing Grace, listen to the course I indicate. May  
you reach the Pure Heart and abide there forever! May dense ignorance vanish  
for you! May you attain to Bliss-Consciousness! May bondage cease for you!"  
Communicating thus,   
6\. "And dispensing the true knowledge of the Natural and Unique Silence which  
destroys all bondage and where there is no meditation nor the ego, no space,  
no time, no direction, no association, no elimination, no differentiation, no  
expression, no phenomena of night and day, no end, no beginning, no middle, no  
interior or exterior, nor an aggregate of all these."   
7\. (The Guru indicated further) that, though all these are eliminated, "It"  
is not void, but is Natural, Eternal Be-ing inexpressible by words, not  
manifesting as ego, but is the Reality engulfing all, having swallowed all  
ignorance like day covering night, and absorbing unhindered all knowledge,  
metamorphosing the person into Itself, It shines in Silence, Self-effulgent;   
8\. With its emergence, It prevents any other from appearing; and all else is  
put out suddenly like burning camphor blown away without residual flicker or  
glow; and in its place It shines beyond the senses, and apart from the knower,  
known and knowledge; and yet It is there, though who can speak of it and to  
whom? For if It arises, the individual is metamorphosed; It will assert Itself  
(Literally: It Speaks Itself),   
9\. (And further on), if it is said to be "It," the question arises "which,"  
though such doubt about the non-dual One is illogical; so transcending it  
also, King Janaka or Suka and others remained like the bee intoxicated with  
honey in that state. (The same Guru's) blessing helped me to reach it. **Grace  
is needed in order to reach the Nirvikalpa Samadhi and attain absolute  
Bliss.** I will not rest nor attend to my wants until I attain it.   
 **10\. On the "I" idea of the individual ego vanishing, there springs up  
within me a current of "I-I" endless indeed. This confers bliss engulfing all  
my knowledge, unique and transcendental, ending in Silence! How then can  
Silence be expressed?**

Saint Tayumanavar was living in Tiruchirapalli. He belonged to   
Pillai community (like M.Sivaprakasam Pillai), a Saivite. From his   
young age, he had a spiritual outlook and was a great devotee   
of Akhilandeswari, the goddess of Tiruvanaika (now called Tiruvanaikaval)  
across the Kavri river from Tiruchirapalli. He   
developed a lot of siddhic powers, which came on his own. Then   
at the appropriate time, he met his Guru, his name is not known,   
and he was ever in silence. Hence, he calls him as Mouna Guru in   
his songs. Mouna Guru taught him Self enquiry asking him to keep   
silent. After realization, he has composed some songs on various   
deities and on abstract subjects like silence, the non-silent mind,   
erring senses, etc., He must have also gone up to Rameswaram,   
since he has mentioned about the goddess Parvata Vardhini, of   
Rameswaram Siva (Ramanatha.). He used to address the goddess,   
as Malai VaLar Kadhali, the girl who grew up in mountains (Himalayas -  
Parvatam).   
Tayumanavar's collection of Tamil poems has been compiled and   
published by Swami Chidbhavananda of Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam,   
near Tiruchirapalli.   
Arunachala Siva.

I had left out one important information about Saint Tayumanavar.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to appreciate some of his songs, when   
Devaraja Mudaliar sang these songs. Other devotees have also   
sung the saint's songs in the presence of Bhagavan. Bhagavan   
Ramana particularly liked the following songs of Saint Tayumanavar: 1\. Aahara Bhuvanam - Chidambara Rahasyam. Bhagavan recommended   
verses 15 to 23 of this composition.   
2\. Paayapuli - 14th verse.   
All these ten songs were once translated into English and were   
rendered in Parayana before Bhagavan during His times.   
3. Mandalthin - Verse 8 to 11.   
4\. Sukavari - 12th verse.   
The above two verses were actually explained by Bhagavan Ramana   
at that time, for His devotees in the Old Hall.   
Bhagavan Ramana has also mentioned the following songs for   
reading by devotees: 5\. Ninaivonru   
6\. Panmaalai   
7\. Satchitananda Sivam - 9th verse   
8\. Chinmayananda Guru - 11th verse.   
9\. Paayapuli - 36th verse.   
10\. Udal Poyyuravu - Verses 5,52, and 53.   
In the saint's composition, the words Oru Sol, one word, comes often. (e.g.  
Karunakara KadvavuL). Bhagavan Ramana used to   
say that the words Oru Sol, indicate only Summa Iru. (Be still)   
Sri Devaraja Mudaliar who has given these details, presented one   
brand new copy of Saint Tayumanavar's songs on 14.12.1942 (Jayanti Day).  
Bhagavan Ramana gave him in turn, the copy of newly printed book, Sri Ramana,  
the Sage of Arunagiri. (This was written by   
G.V. Subbaramiah.)   
Arunachala Siva.
