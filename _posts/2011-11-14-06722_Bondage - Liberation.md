तदा बन्धो यदा चित्तं किन्चिद् वांछति शोचति ।   
किंचित् मुंचति गृण्हाति किंचिद् गदृष्यति कुप्यति ॥८-१॥   
tadā bandho yadā cittaṁ kincid vāṁchati śocati   
kiṁcin muṁcati gṛṇhāti kiṁcid dṛṣyati kupyati 8-1   
Bondage is when the mind longs for something,   
grieves about something, rejects something, holds on to   
something, is pleased about something or displeased about   
something.   
तदा मुक्तिर्यदा चित्तं न वांछति न शोचति ।   
न मुंचति न गृण्हाति न हृष्यति न कुप्यति ॥८-२॥   
tadā muktiryadā cittaṁ na vāṁchati na śocati   
na muṁcati na gṛṇhāti na hṛṣyati na kupyati 8-2   
Liberation is when the mind does not long for anything, grieve   
about anything, reject anything, or hold on to anything, and is   
not pleased about anything or displeased about anything.   
(Ashtavakra Gita)   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Nagaraj,   
Very Nice quotations from Ashtavakra Gita. All longing for possessions and all  
possessions   
are bondage. Once Sri Bhagavan and Ganapati Muni were strolling on the Hill.  
Muni said,   
Bhagavan, if one can have rs. 2 per month, one can easily do atma vichara  
without any   
worry. Sri Bhagavan said,Why two rupees? One needs only the body and nothing  
else,   
to do Atma Vichara!   
Arunachala Siva.
