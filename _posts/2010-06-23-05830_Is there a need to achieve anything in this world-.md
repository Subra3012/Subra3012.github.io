## The nature of consciousness,mind and the need for Self-inquiry.

Mind is consciousness in movement.When that movement stops minding  
stops.Suppose we are walking   
and if stop walking legs will be there but the process,the function of walking  
stops.It is like pedalling a   
cycle.As long as you pedal the cycle moves,if you stop pedalling the cycle  
stops moving but cycle will be   
there.So when minding stops consciousness remains as a silent pool of energy.   
You are that consciousness.   
Minding is a function of consciousness but your nature is not the minding.   
The nature of minding is movement.If that movement is stopped due to any  
reason there is nothing like   
mind.Thought is the mind.If there is stilling of thought due to any reason  
there is no entity like   
mind(naiva manasam).   
In such a state we encounter static aspect of consciousness in full senses.   
The nature of such static consciousness is existence,Self-  
knowledge(awareness),bliss   
(Tranquility,peace).   
You think you are the mind. This fallacy that you are the mind gives the mind  
total freedom, because   
then there is no one to master it, to control it. There is no one! Mind itself  
becomes the master. It may   
become the master, but that mastery is just seemingly so. Try once and you can  
break that mastery  it   
is false.This breaking up of process of minding is possible in Self-  
inquiry.Then you will know for yourself   
about   
what is the nature of static aspect of consciousness and what is the nature of  
the minding which is just   
the dynamic function of consciousness.There is nothing wrong in minding but  
identity with that minding   
and thinking that minding as the me(thinker) is the wrong state of  
affairs.Then we go on minding   
(thinking) whether it is   
required or not.Self-inquiry stops that pathological minding,(thinking)   
and we develop mastery over the minding(thinking).If we master the  
minding(thinking) it is one of the   
best servant.But at   
present mind is behaving like a master   
without any control bringing so much disaster,disorder,chaos to the individual  
and society at   
large.Through Self-inquiry we develop the capacity to allow minding(thinking)  
when it is necessary and   
stop   
minding(thinking) where it has no role to play.For example thought i.e  
minding(thinking) has no role to   
play in human relation   
but we are relating with the other through thought only which definitely  
brings conflict,strife in the   
relationship.Then if we can posit in   
static aspect of consciousness during relating with the other,the relating   
is based on present moment and we have a healthy relationship.   
In science,technology we require minding and we should allow minding  
there.Once that task is over we   
should not go on minding but we should be back to our natural center of static  
aspect of consciousness   
and enjoy the serenity,tranquility,peace,bliss of it.This is possible through  
Self-inquiry.   
Then we become the master of our own mind which is superior than being   
emperor of the whole world.Existence feels fulfilled through us by becoming   
master of the mind.This is the purpose for which we are born on earth but   
we are preoccupied with doing all sorts of silly things which takes us no  
where   
from the present state of highly disordered life.

## Pure awareness--Ego awareness and Self-inquiry.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:02:11 PM

Suppose on a plain paper we mark a zero with a pencil,we feel   
that zero mark is really zero.If we carefully observe even when we think that  
mark of pencil indicates zero with no value   
its background is plain paper which is there even before marking zero by the  
pencil and it will be there even after   
erasing the pencil mark of zero.   
Similarly on the screen of awareness for functional purpose   
awareness mind is created whose essential nature is nothingness.That mind  
gives direction to the awareness   
so that awareness can function in the fleeting phenomenal reality.Mind has an  
utilitarian value in the phenomenal reality   
because awareness acts through it,just like pencil mark of zero on the plain  
paper has utilitarian value.Noe if we want   
have only plain paper we have to erase the pencil mark of zero.Similarly if we  
want to know the nature of awareness   
which is the background of mind,first we must know the   
nature of mind which is nothingness.Once we know that   
a gestalt in our attitude happens and we observe the   
nature of awareness which is the background of the mind.   
We direct our attention towards the source of mind   
which is awareness.The real can be known only through the false, so the ego is  
a must. One has to pass through it. It is a discipline. The real can be known  
only through the illusion. You cannot know the truth directly. First you have  
to know that which is not true. First you have to encounter the untrue.  
Through that encounter you become capable of knowing the truth. If you know  
the false as the false, truth will dawn upon you. So you have two centers. One  
center you come with, which is given by existence itself. That is the self.  
And the other center, which is created by the society, is the ego. It is a  
false thing - and it is a very great trick. Through the ego the society is  
controlling you. You have to behave in a certain way, because only then does  
the society appreciate you. You have to walk in a certain way; you have to  
laugh in a certain way; you have to follow certain manners, a morality, a  
code. Only then will the society appreciate you, and if it doesn't, you ego  
will be shaken. And when the ego is shaken, you don't know where you are, who  
you are.   
The others have given you the idea. That idea is the ego.   
That which is given by the existence is the screen of awareness.That which is  
written on your screen by the   
society is the false center of awareness or ego.If we are   
aware that our essential nature is screen of awareness   
that which is written on the screen will not affect us.   
Suppose there is news paper,we can see the letters on it   
and forget for the time being that writing and reading of   
letters are possible only because paper is there to write   
or read something on it.If we are aware of the fact then   
gestalt happens and we recognize that paper is the background of all these  
letters.Just as letters written with   
white chalk piece on a black board are very clear,we can see   
the contents of the mind,its thoughts,feelings with the background of  
awareness which is possible in Self-inquiry.   
The ego is not individual. Ego is a social phenomenon - it is society, its not  
you. But it gives you a function in the society, a hierarchy in the society.  
And if you remain satisfied with it, you will miss the whole opportunity of  
finding the self.   
And that's why you are so miserable. Try to understand it as deeply as  
possible, because this has to be thrown. And unless you throw it you will  
never be able to attain to the self. Because you are addicted to the center,  
you cannot move, and you cannot look at the self. This throwing is possible  
only through Self-inquiry.

## Is there a need to achieve anything in this world?  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:06:02 PM

In the previous note we observed that mind is consciousness in movement and it  
is essential for the   
consciousness to function in the phenomenal reality.Nobody has seen this world  
without the mind.   
Mind and world appear and disappear simultaneously.So both are interrelated  
and interdependent.   
When the mind does not perceive the world as in deep sleep,swoon,samadhi it  
becomes no-mind.   
So world must be a projection of the mind.Mind being consciousness in movement  
world must also   
be consciousness in movement.The sanskrit word Jagat(world) literally means  
that which always changes   
moves.So movement is common factor to both.If they don't move they cease to  
exist.   
So mind is the world.   
A child is born without any knowledge, any consciousness of his own self. And  
when a child is born the   
first thing he becomes aware of is not himself; the first thing he becomes  
aware of is the other. It is   
natural, because the eyes open outwards, the hands touch others, the ears  
listen to others, the tongue   
tastes food and the nose smells the outside. All these senses open outwards.   
That is what birth means. Birth means coming into this world, the world of the  
outside. So when a child is   
born, he is born into this world. He opens his eyes, sees others. 'Other'  
means the thou. He becomes   
aware of the mother first. Then, by and by, he becomes aware of his own body.  
That too is the other,   
that too belongs to the world. He is hungry and he feels the body; his need is  
satisfied, he forgets the   
body.So child observes the seen as a witnessing consciousness including his  
own body.He is yet   
to develop an ego so he sees the world without any separative feeling.   
Now starts the genesis of the ego.   
First he becomes aware of you, thou, other, and then by and by, in contrast to  
you, thou, he becomes   
aware of himself.   
This awareness is a reflected awareness. He is not aware of who he is. He is  
simply aware of the mother   
and what she thinks about him. If she smiles, if she appreciates the child, if  
she says, "You are   
beautiful," if she hugs and kisses him, the child feels good about himself.  
Now an ego is born.   
Through appreciation, love, care, he feels he is good, he feels he is  
valuable, he feels he has some   
significance.   
A center is born.   
But this center is a reflected center. It is not his real being. He does not  
know who he is; he simply knows   
what others think about him. And this is the ego: the reflection, what others  
think. If nobody thinks that   
he is of any use, nobody appreciates him, nobody smiles, then too an ego is  
born: an ill ego; sad,   
rejected, like a wound; feeling inferior, worthless. This too is the ego. This  
too is a reflection.   
First the mother - and mother means the world in the beginning. Then others  
will join the mother, and the   
world goes on growing. And the more the world grows, the more complex the ego  
becomes, because   
many others' opinions are reflected.   
The ego is an accumulated phenomenon, a by-product of living with others. If a  
child lives totally alone,   
he will never come to grow an ego. But that is not going to help. He will  
remain like an animal. That   
doesn't mean that he will come to know the real self, no.   
In this way the essential witnessing consciousness "I am" is mixed with  
adjuncts like the body,   
thinking faculty,intellect,memory resulting in a compound consciousness as "I'  
thought or   
I-am-the-body-idea" which imagines itself to be a body,so limited (kinchigna)  
so feels separated from rest   
of the existence,it is a distorted false form of "Real I"consciousness 'I  
am".So mind is imagining itself   
to be not only the body but also the underlying Self consciousness "I am".Mind  
cannot rise without   
imagining itself to be our real Self consciousness.The mind comes into  
existence by superimposing   
imaginary adjuncts on the basic form of consciousness "I am".   
Human requires basic needs like food,shelter,clothing,medical aid,job etc for  
his maintenance.   
For this he has to earn in right means.This is normal and physiological.   
Once ego is crystallized it starts comparing with others,becomes rabidly  
ambitious, competitive,   
starts possessing what he earns,because he has goal to reach through achieving  
lives a life of purpose   
and a man with purpose is angry,violent.In this way an achieving life relates  
with the existence in a   
pathological way and thinks that the other separate and contrary to his  
life.In this process of   
achieving and becoming desiring takes strong roots which makes us future  
oriented bypassing the   
present.A man of desire misses and sacrifices the present moment for a future  
which is yet to be.   
Some monks have non-achievement as their life goal and this is also an  
attitude of achieving in a   
different manner.We should go beyond achieving and non-achieving and live a  
natural way of life.   
Achieving attitude of mind is the seed of  
conflict,violence,disorder,strife,war in the society.   
Just imagine there are 750 crore achieving minds in the world whose interests  
are against each other.   
Total wealth of the world is in the hands of 2% rich people and so rest of the  
population are denied   
the basic needs of life.So see the danger of achieving attitude of mind and  
its consequences on the   
individual and so the society.Achieving attitude is only to fulfill  
psychological appetites for which   
there is no limit.Can real be achieved?Is it wise to run after to achieve that  
which is false.   
In life actually there no need to achieve anything for psychological purpose.   
If one starts for achieving Self that is also a self centered activity.Self is  
not achievable but it is there   
for you to become one with it through Self-Inquiry.

First the mother - and mother means the world in the beginning. Then others  
will join the mother, and the   
world goes on growing. And the more the world grows, the more complex the ego  
becomes, because   
many others' opinions are reflected.   
The ego is an accumulated phenomenon, a by-product of living with others. If a  
child lives totally alone,   
he will never come to grow an ego. But that is not going to help. He will  
remain like an animal. That   
doesn't mean that he will come to know the real self, no.   
In this way the essential witnessing consciousness "I am" is mixed with  
adjuncts like the body,   
thinking faculty,intellect,memory resulting in a compound consciousness as "I'  
thought or   
I-am-the-body-idea" which imagines itself to be a body,so limited (kinchigna)  
so feels separated from rest   
of the existence,it is a distorted false form of "Real I"consciousness 'I  
am".So mind is imagining itself   
to be not only the body but also the underlying Self consciousness "I am".Mind  
cannot rise without   
imagining itself to be our real Self consciousness.The mind comes into  
existence by superimposing   
imaginary adjuncts on the basic form of consciousness "I am".   
Human requires basic needs like food,shelter,clothing,medical aid,job etc for  
his maintenance.   
For this he has to earn in right means.This is normal and physiological.   
Once ego is crystallized it starts comparing with others,becomes rabidly  
ambitious, competitive,   
starts possessing what he earns,because he has goal to reach through achieving  
lives a life of purpose   
and a man with purpose is angry,violent.In this way an achieving life relates  
with the existence in a   
pathological way and thinks that the other separate and contrary to his  
life.In this process of   
achieving and becoming desiring takes strong roots which makes us future  
oriented bypassing the   
present.A man of desire misses and sacrifices the present moment for a future  
which is yet to be.   
Some monks have non-achievement as their life goal and this is also an  
attitude of achieving in a   
different manner.We should go beyond achieving and non-achieving and live a  
natural way of life.   
Achieving attitude of mind is the seed of  
conflict,violence,disorder,strife,war in the society.   
Just imagine there are 750 crore achieving minds in the world whose interests  
are against each other.   
Total wealth of the world is in the hands of 2% rich people and so rest of the  
population are denied   
the basic needs of life.So see the danger of achieving attitude of mind and  
its consequences on the   
individual and so the society.Achieving attitude is only to fulfill  
psychological appetites for which   
there is no limit.Can real be achieved?Is it wise to run after to achieve that  
which is false.   
In life actually there no need to achieve anything for psychological purpose.   
If one starts for achieving Self that is also a self centered activity.Self is  
not achievable but it is there   
for you to become one with it through Self-Inquiry.

## Is there a need to achieve anything in this world?

In the previous note we observed that mind is consciousness in movement and it  
is essential for the   
consciousness to function in the phenomenal reality.Nobody has seen this world  
without the mind.   
Mind and world appear and disappear simultaneously.So both are interrelated  
and interdependent.   
When the mind does not perceive the world as in deep sleep,swoon,samadhi it  
becomes no-mind.   
So world must be a projection of the mind.Mind being consciousness in movement  
world must also   
be consciousness in movement.The sanskrit word Jagat(world) literally means  
that which always changes   
moves.So movement is common factor to both.If they don't move they cease to  
exist.   
So mind is the world.   
A child is born without any knowledge, any consciousness of his own self. And  
when a child is born the   
first thing he becomes aware of is not himself; the first thing he becomes  
aware of is the other. It is   
natural, because the eyes open outwards, the hands touch others, the ears  
listen to others, the tongue   
tastes food and the nose smells the outside. All these senses open outwards.   
That is what birth means. Birth means coming into this world, the world of the  
outside. So when a child is   
born, he is born into this world. He opens his eyes, sees others. 'Other'  
means the thou. He becomes   
aware of the mother first. Then, by and by, he becomes aware of his own body.  
That too is the other,   
that too belongs to the world. He is hungry and he feels the body; his need is  
satisfied, he forgets the   
body.So child observes the seen as a witnessing consciousness including his  
own body.He is yet   
to develop an ego so he sees the world without any separative feeling.   
Now starts the genesis of the ego.   
First he becomes aware of you, thou, other, and then by and by, in contrast to  
you, thou, he becomes   
aware of himself.   
This awareness is a reflected awareness. He is not aware of who he is. He is  
simply aware of the mother   
and what she thinks about him. If she smiles, if she appreciates the child, if  
she says, "You are   
beautiful," if she hugs and kisses him, the child feels good about himself.  
Now an ego is born.   
Through appreciation, love, care, he feels he is good, he feels he is  
valuable, he feels he has some   
significance.   
A center is born.   
But this center is a reflected center. It is not his real being. He does not  
know who he is; he simply knows   
what others think about him. And this is the ego: the reflection, what others  
think. If nobody thinks that   
he is of any use, nobody appreciates him, nobody smiles, then too an ego is  
born: an ill ego; sad,   
rejected, like a wound; feeling inferior, worthless. This too is the ego. This  
too is a reflection.   
First the mother - and mother means the world in the beginning. Then others  
will join the mother, and the   
world goes on growing. And the more the world grows, the more complex the ego  
becomes, because   
many others' opinions are reflected.   
The ego is an accumulated phenomenon, a by-product of living with others. If a  
child lives totally alone,   
he will never come to grow an ego. But that is not going to help. He will  
remain like an animal. That   
doesn't mean that he will come to know the real self, no.
