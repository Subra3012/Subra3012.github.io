Namaste Friends,   
With Bhagavan's grace, my family will be visiting India/Arunachala in June. I  
am a little nervous about the weather. After reading some of the posts, sounds  
like mid-week(Wednesday, Thursday June 13, 14) should be the least crowded  
days. Will it be possible to do girivalam? I would love to see Virupaksha  
cave, etc. and walk on the ground that Bhagavan has walked on. The  
anticipation is hard to bear!   
Any suggestions for good a/c hotels? We plan to drive from Coimbatore and stay  
overnight. I don't know how my 9yr old son will do with the long car drive and  
the heat.   
I will appreciate any guidance since this will be our first visit to  
Ramanashramam.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Anandji,   
Thank you for your response. We would love to stay in the ashram but don't  
think my son can manage without a/c. Also hotel will be better since we will  
not disturb the other devotees if our schedule changes. Hopefully, on our next  
visit we can stay for a few days peacefully in the ashram.

Dear latha,   
You can try the hotel Arunai Anantha, a little away from town, but should have  
air conditioned rooms. You can google for   
it to get the address and India phone number. Arunai Anantha should have also  
car/auto rickshaw facilities to drop the   
residents to the Asramam. If you do not stay in the Asramam guesthouses, you  
cannot take food their without prior approval   
from them. The Asramam provides morning break fast at 7.am (iddlis + coffee),  
lunch (simple vegetarian lunch, South Indian   
type) at 11.30 am and then dinner at 7.30 pm of the same type.   
Inside the Asramam - no one can walk with slippers on. You have to walk  
barefooted, everywhere inside the premises.   
So also in Big Temple, as you enter, you have to remove the slippers and hand  
over them for safe custody.   
During mid June also, it will be hot. But not very hot like April and May.  
The monsoon starts only around October.   
For girivalam, again it is to be undertaken barefooted. But nowadays some  
walk with slippers.   
Climbing Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam - one can after some distance, wear  
slippers. But inside the Virupaksha   
Cave and Skandasramam one should not wear slippers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Lathaji,   
Please try Sri Seshadri swami Asramam that is quite near Sri Ramanasramam and  
it has AC Rooms.You may call Mr Muthukumar,Advocate as in this link and try to  
book an accommodation: http://www.swamigal.com/contact.htm   
Sri Seshadri swami's Samadhi is quite a calm place and the rooms(A/C) will be  
okay,but do not expect plush setup.We have stayed there on a couple of  
occasions.They charge a nominal rent for the rooms(Rs 500-Rs 750/-) and I  
would prefer it any day compared to a Hotel.Also being near Sri  
Ramanasramam,one will be able to attend programs in the Asramam and retire for  
some rest if need be to seshadri Swami asramam,which is walkable(100  
yards).June will definitely be hot and Powercut plays havoc and AC room may  
not mean much!So please be warned! I am not sure whether any Hotel may run  
Generators to keep the AC functioning.   
 Giripradakshina may be done either at night or early in the morning(Start at  
04:30 hrs and allow 5 hours if this is the first time you are going to do  
this.Please wear shoes as otherwise you are likely to develop blisters,if not  
used to long walks.   
Most persons would recommend walking without any shoes on,but I always have  
worn it and felt none the worse for it.   
Namaskar.

Dear Lathaji,   
Seshadri Ashram rooms are filthy. Try Sparsa Hotel (great view of the  
mountain + has a swimming pool for your son) and Arunai Anantha. Westerners  
like these hotels. There is also Ramana Towers which is walking distance from  
Ramanasramam.   
What Indians call walking distance can turn out to be a harrowing experience  
for you. On our first trip we had to dodge every kind of vehicle there is on  
this earth, dogs, cows, and goats - try not to step on grass as Tiruvannamalai  
is home to vicious snakes. Buses and trucks drive on that road like they were  
driving on a national highway in the west. Numerous deaths have happened on  
that stretch. So now we get an autorickshaw or car rather than spoil our  
peace of mind.   
Ramana Ashram is still our favourite.

Subramanianji, Raviji, Chid of Arunachala,   
Thank you for your responses - very useful information. Just trying to be  
practical travelling with my son and don't want him to miss out on visiting  
such a sacred place.   
As for the Indian roads, yes they are chaotic and I honestly get nervous even  
sitting in an autorikshaw but it is home. There is an inexplicable quality  
about the place - maybe its the sanctity. We all feel the grace of Bhagavan  
and he will help us cross this samsara and I am sure the Indian roads too   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Lathaji,   
Yes,it is indeed a Blessed idea to somehow cajole your young son to visit Sri  
Ramanasramam, Arunachala and the Arunachaleswarar temple.We never know when  
these seeds sown will spring to life in time,but that surely will happen  
sooner or later.Do go in for a Hotel suggested by Child of Arunachala.The  
Landscape around the Giripradakshina road had changed a lot.In the seventies  
there were no tar roads, only sandy pathways that ran around the Hill passing  
through villages.I recall how on a new moon day in the late seventies,We  
started Giripradakshina at 20:00 hrs and there were no street lights(No  
Traffic too!),It was pitch dark and as a flash of Lightning illuminated the  
path ahead,I could see a snake friend slithering along to my right.Everyone  
has a right to do Giripradakshina and as Sri Bhagavan says-'It is we who have  
come to their place!What right do we have to evict them'!As the magic of  
Arunachala unfolds,one does not care a straw for filth or any other drawback  
there may be.Even the Filth is sacred.Those days the only sound we heard as we  
walked were the tinkling of the bells that the cows made as they shake their  
heads-this was the only music that could be heard as we walk past villages  
.All along the roadside there are small shrines with only an earthenware lamp  
lighted(Can anything match the Beauty of this simple thing!)and all is  
otherwise Quiet.As you look to your right,Arunachala looms like a Big brother  
-silent and immovable.It is a Good idea to do the pradakshina in the Night,for  
as one completes it and goes to sleep, the 'meditation' effect would continue  
right through the sleep.One other keything in doing the Girpradakshina is not  
to view it as a 'Marathon walking' exercise but as keeping 'company with  
Arunachala'.Keep the conversation going with Arunachala and not with any  
companion that may be there walking along.   
These days,you have a pathway for walkers and if one walks on this,one is  
pretty safe from the Traffic.The Pathway is well lit by Electric lamps(What a  
pity!).Early morning and Night time are the Best as the Traffic will be  
less.Please avoid 'Good,Holy Days'!Choose an inauspicious day,as the crowd  
will be less!Anyway for Sri Bhagavan and Arunachala,all days are auspicious  
,so we can have the best of Both the worlds!   
If your son is fond of taking pictures,you may like to delegate the filming of  
your trip to him.This would keep him engaged,capturing the moments in Sri  
Ramanasramam in a camcorder.I had friends from the U.S and I did this job and  
gave them a DVD.Those two friends,both females in their late forties and  
fifties stayed in Sri Ramanasramam,and truly had a lovely time here.Not once  
did they complain about anything-everything was Holy and sacred.We went to  
Skandasramam, virupaksha cave. One of them also did Giripradakshina with me  
and was ecstatic as we completed it-'We made it' she cried out!We started at  
06:00 Hrs from Sri Ramanasramam and made it back exactly at 10:30  
hrs.(December 26th 2010)As we covered the last stretch on the dusty, dirty  
roads of tiruvannamalai,although we did slow down,there simply was no letting  
down of the intensity of feeling that we are on the spiritual journey all  
through.Truly a Great soul,this friend of mine;she is a novelist who has  
written many books.   
So,it depends ultimately on our mind set-whether one is a westerner or a local  
person-these things do not matter.What a wonderful sight it is to see all  
people from various countries,from different parts of the world sitting  
together and eating in Sri Ramanasramam dining hall-the haloed place where  
people had the privilege of sitting and eating with sri Bhagavan.Even now, as  
we sit there,we feel as if Sri Bhagavan is just here as before and we continue  
to have this privilege!   
Lathaji,do consider a dual option-You may book the rooms in Sri Ramanasramam  
and have the Hotel room as well,and have the flexibility of choosing depending  
on how your son feels.Chances are that he may choose the sparse room in Sri  
Ramanasramam!This would also enable you to eat the wonderful prasada of sri  
Bhagavan-The food is highly satvic and no one visiting this place for the  
first time should miss this-as well as the loving way in which the devotees  
serve the food.Please do consider the dual option-with the Hotel room as a  
'Reserve' and Sri Ramanasramam as the 'Anchor room'.   
Absolutely no point in driving around the hill in a motor car.This needs to be  
avoided at any cost as it would only add to polluting Sacred Arunachala!No one  
ever thinks of this pollution that one leaves behind!It will never get one the  
benefit of keeping company with Arunachala by walking around it.If someone is  
not fit,then let him just sit and keep company,but this going around the Hill  
on a vehicle is just ridiculous.   
Wish you the very Best.   
Namaskar.

Raviji,   
Thank you, I could picture Arunachala as you described - how wonderful it  
sounds. We will definitely try the dual option as you suggested with a nicer  
hotel that Subramanianji and Child of Arunachalaji very kindly suggested, as a  
backup for the night.   
In one of our earlier trips to India, we visited the Arunachaleshwarar temple  
while visiting various Lord Shiva temples. But there was no exposure to  
Bhagavan Ramana or serious spirituality then. Its amazing how visiting the  
temple even without knowing its complete power is pulling us like a magnet  
again("Kantham irumbu pola"). Now I understand the connection with Bhagavan  
which seemed to come out of the blue! As you put it, the seeds were sown then  
and I am seeing it spring to life now!   
Yes, I would love to see my son become spiritual and get drawn to  
Bhagavan/Self. Nochurji once mentioned that a mother told her little daughter,  
"Nan Shashvatham illai, Ivar(Ramanar) kaiya puduchiko, Ivar dhan  
Shashvatham". In English, "I am not permanent, hold His(Bhagavan's) hand, only  
He is permanent". I always say this to my son.   
I have been watching the Youtube films on Arunachala and Ramanashramam, thanks  
to the people who uploaded such priceless videos. It feels like magic to be  
able to visit the place in person! Also, to communicate with strong devotees  
like yourself, Subramanianji, Nagarajji, Anilji and all the others - it is  
Bhagavan's blessings definitely to have such beautiful long-distance  
satsangha.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Dear latha,   
If you stay in Seshadri Swamigal Asramam, there is one special benefit. If you  
go to the backyard of that Asramam, there   
is a Daskhinamurti stone image, facing the road. As you sit (they have  
provided a couple of chairs there) and watch Dakshinamurti,   
you can also watch the Hill behind. The sight of Hill from this spot is quite  
wonderful. Once during Mahadeeapam Time (I went   
after the three days, but the Deepam was still burning) I was sitting and  
watching the Hill with a deepam atop and this was   
a sight that gods would envy to have.   
In Sri Ramanasramam also they have installed a Dakshinamurti on the rear side  
of the Asramam. You can watch it by walking   
towards that straight from the main gate. There is also a dhayana mantapam  
there.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, sir   
I, too, love the Dakshinamurthy in Seshadri Ashram and Ramanasramam and don't  
forget the Dakshinamurthy temple between these two ashrams.   
I am wondering, however, if you are not allowed to go into Seshadri Ashram if  
you don't stay there. We go in freely. Are we breaking some rules? Oops   
BTW, we don't stay at Seshadri Ashram because the rooms we were shown were  
genuinely filthy and we worried about catching a disease. When we asked to see  
other rooms, we were told "they are all like this" Even the so called a/c  
room had no windows and had a huge bed in a really small room. It smelt of  
something toxic. Don't know what it was. There were some dogs on the other  
side of the wall, in the village, that kept barking.   
Ramanasramam, on the other hand, is heaven, always will be for us. Ramana  
Towers is good too. Very clean and quiet. It is a short distance away from  
both these ashrams. Ofcourse, Sparsa has its own quality. The mountain is  
all you have. It is great for meditation. We love that whole area.

Dear Child of Arunachala,   
Any one can visit Sri Seshadri Ashram and see the Seshadri Lingam, and before  
that Chezhunchudar Vinayakar and also go further   
into to see Sri Dakshinamurti stone image. There is no need to stay there to  
have darshan of all these.   
I have not visited inside the rooms of Sri Seshadri Ashram and I have no  
comments.   
Regardiing Sri Dakshinamurti Shrine between the two Ashrams, this deity is  
quite powerful. One should see the crowd on   
Thursdays. This temple was the town limit in the olden days. Beyond that in  
Chengam Road, there was only a girivalam path   
(those days mud path) and on both sides forests. One added information is  
Muruganar used to stay at this temple many times.   
Once when Aviyal (mixed vegetable preparation) was prepared in the Asramam,  
Sri Bhagavan told the kitchen worker to go and   
give a cup of Aviyal to Muruganar. Varanasi Subbalakshmi Ammal rushed out  
searching for Muruganar, calling Sambhamurti, Sambhamurti,...(it was  
Muruganar's child hood name; both Muruganar and Subbalakshmi Ammal hail from  
Ramanathapuram   
thus know each other from childhood). Muruganar was sighted near Dakshinamurti  
Temple and the aviyal was handed over   
to him and Subbalakshmi Amma said that Sri Bhagavan wanted to give him.   
Muruganar became excited and said: Oh, Bhagavan said this... He then put the  
cup near his eyes as if prasadam and ate it   
fully. He did not go for bhiksha to the town on that day!   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanianji, Child of Arunachalaji   
Thank you for sharing about the Dakshinamurthy statues and the Shrine. After  
learning Dakshinamurthy Stotram sometime back I have been very fascinated by  
this aspect of Lord Siva.   
Subramanianji, Nochurji was mentioning in his Arunachala Pancha Ratnam  
discourse about the same avial incident. He was also saying how Sri Muruganar  
who was a wonderful Tamil scholar had to go for bhiksha after surrendering to  
Bhagavan. All these special devotees must have been very blessed. Do you know  
of anyone who is still alive and does not mind meeting new people?   
I am so thankful for all the replies and the guidance.

Dear latha,   
Practically all of Sri Bhagavan's devotees have merged with Sri Bhagavan. Sri  
Ganesan son of Sri Venkataraman, who was   
the son of Sarvadhikari Chinnaswami was only 2 years old when Sri Bhagavan was  
there in body. Other brothers, Ramanan   
and Mani might not have been born at that time. Smt, Kanakammal was the last  
one to merge with Sri Bhagavan on Jan 1,   
2010.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am pretty sure I have seen pictures of V.S. Ramanan, Mani and Ganeshan in  
their teen years with Bhagavan. The pictures were exceptionally powerful to me  
- how Bhagavan was shaping them to be spiritual leaders and these kids had not  
a clue. The innocence in their eyes made me cry.

reading about other saints,watching devotional movies,forums,blogs etc is one  
way to engage our mind only in devotional activities and not to deviate.   
remember bhagavan also used to read newspapers,listen tyagaraja music,watched  
few devotional movies,wrote many hyms in praise of arunachala and for his  
mother's sake,translated few adi sankara works into tamil/telugu/malayalam  
language,talked to devotees and listened to their personal problems,helped his  
brother if required in management activities of the ashramam,cooked food,read  
few other devotional books like saint of tibet etc..   
So all these above activities done by bhagavan does not mean that he is not  
doing self enquiry in that time but it is like actor doing his role knowing  
about his real nature all the time.

There are many ways for good sadhana, without depending on TV, cinemas in  
videos, music channels, and buying CDs   
containing cinema songs. One can browse many interesting articles in various  
spiritual webs like www.Shivam.org etc.,   
In fact the Human Gospel of Sri Ramana Maharshi was also made avaialble to us  
by Ravi who had browsed that website.   
It is a wonderful collation of information about Ramana devotees by Sri V,  
Ganesan. In fact, I have taken print out of the   
entire 800+ pages by engaging an internet center. There are many many  
spiritual books to read. One can do all these   
without getting bored in life and depending on pulp fiction, TV and cinema. On  
top of all, there is Graham Boyd's forum.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasnath,   
The Human Gospel is not a printed book from Sri Ganesan. It is an e book,  
available if you access:  www.chrob.org/reviews/2000/HumanGospelShaing   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Praviprolu,   
I guess it's hard to get accommodation in Ashram guest house.   
You can happily stay at "Siva Sannidhi" which is exactly opposite to Ramana  
Ashram.   
I have stayed there couple of times in 2013.   
During that time they didn't charge me anything and i donated the amount i  
wished to.   
They provide accommodation and food as well.It should be the same now.   
More details here.
