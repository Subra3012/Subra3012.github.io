Hi All   
I have a question.   
It is said that a Jnani see all others as Jnanis.   
So why did Ramana say that Lakshmi the cow became enlightened, when to him   
all are Jnanis.   
ps how does one pronounce 'Jnani' ?   
Thanks Sky ^^^ Om

Dear Skyperson,   
If I were to ask this question to myself - I'd say honestly I don't know!  
Anything more would only be a speculation and a spoon full for the thoughts to  
relish.   
So the best course would be to be wait and see it for myself. Summa Iru - Stay  
still.   
Only a Jnaani can know this. For us its mere speculation.   
Well the best spelling to pronounce Jnani would be "nnyaani" a very small "g"  
comes into play - "ingnnani" comes hidden when you pronounce where "G" is very  
little - just. 25% of its complete sound.

Dear skyperson,   
Jnani is spelt as Jnani. Some books spell it as Gnani.   
Both are correct.   
Bhagavan Ramana saw every being as Jnani. But did   
Cow Lakshmi know that it is a Jnani? Seeing every   
being as Jnana Swarupa, is the view of the Jnani.   
Since you and I can know that we are not Jnanis,   
we can speak it out to Bhagavan Ramana. The Cow   
Lakshmi could not speak to others. But it must have definitely   
spoken to Bhagavan Ramana: "I have come here specifically   
to you for deliverence or become a Jnani." You and I   
cannot listen to what other non-humans say. Nowadays   
rich men and women who breed pet dogs, speak to their   
dogs! Is it not? That is how Bhagavan Ramana also should   
have spoken to Cow Lakshmi. He called all beings as he or   
she and never as it or that. You must be knowing that.   
Further in puranas, we read that great avataras spoke   
to non human beings too. Tiru Moolar spoke to the calves   
which have lost their master. Krishna must have also spoken   
to some beings like that. Bhagavan Ramana is also an   
avatara or Jnani like Tirumoolar and Krishna. He is an   
avatara of Skanda and Tiru Jnana Sambandha. Or if you   
don't like that theory you can definitely call Him as a   
great Brahma Jnani.
