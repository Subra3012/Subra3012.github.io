The raison d'etre of Yoga is the direct intuition of the Self unmediated by  
all the objective categories,   
belonging to the realm of the Prakriti. The first two steps of Yoga, yama,  
niyama, refer to the ethical   
qualities demanded of the aspirant. The third one, asana, is as regards the  
perfection of the body.   
The fourth, pranayama, is by way of stabilizing the psychic energy, which in  
concert with relative   
consciousness, perceives the manifest world. The fifth step, that is  
pratyahara, refers to the idea of   
stopping the objective knowledge flowing through the senses being resolved  
back to the mind, taking   
the form of the mind, only the past impressions remaining.   
The subsequent stages, which are proximate to the inner being, are the  
following a) dharana - this   
is by way of the isolation of the mind to a seamless whole from the present  
objectives; b) dhyana -   
this refers to the stage of abidance in this, not by way of time process, but  
as pure knowledge.   
Finally, c) Samadhi, the grand finale, refers to a state of mind in which the  
object alone shines in its   
purity without the notions of observer being foisted on it. In the last three  
processes the linear flow   
of mind, the discursive way of thinking through the mediation of the senses,  
all these are no longer   
there. There is a direct perception of the object, which Patanjali calls  
ritambhara, which can be   
Dharana, dhyana and samadhi constitute a unitary process, the consummation  
termed as Samyama   
in yoga, and Prajna by the Buddhist, revealing the essence of the objects,  
through a direct perception.   
The knowledge obtained through Samadhi, that is truth-bearing consciousness,  
which is a balanced   
state, 'swarupa sunya' (empty of selfhood as it were), reveals the very thing  
itself, with the memory   
of the past not insinuating itself into the being. This knowledge is beyond  
the five fluctuations. Samadhi   
is the disjoining union of the matter and spirit, leaving the individual all  
alone. It is not even becoming   
one with Cosmos, but refers to something beyond time and space.
