The epic work of Thiruvilayadal Puranam was written in mind pleasing Tamil by  
Paranjyothi Munivar. Beautiful in its verses, song structure as well as  
extremely appreciable in its composition, Thiruvilayadal Puranam is considered  
to be a great work of art in Tamil.   
Paranjyothyaar was an extremely versatile and well learned Shivacharyar. Born  
to a staunch Shaiva, Meenakshi Sundara Desikar, in the Shiva Sthala of  
Vedaranyam in the 16th century, Paranjyothiyaar was a blessed child right from  
the time of birth. It is believed that he lived on for 350 years singing the  
praises of the lord.   
Within a few short years following his birth, Paranjyotiyaar had mastered the  
art of singing and used to sing both Tamil and Sanskrit songs with explicit  
clarity. With his age also grew his devotion towards the serpent-clad lord.   
His father acted as his Guru and taught him the Shivagamas, Thevaram,  
Thiruvasagam as also Bharatham, Law, Palmistry etc. Paranjyothi was an equally  
bright student and grasped everything at the go. In his leisure time, he used  
to experience immense bliss through japa, thapa, dhyana and yoga. Soon he  
finished his education and totally immersed himself in the service of lord  
Shiva.   
Wanting to visit as many Shivasthalas as he could, Paranjyothi started on a  
theertha yatra to all the temples. He went from place to place, worshipping  
Shiva and Ambal, praising them with his flawless Tamil verses. And so he  
proceeded, with his followers until he entered the holy city of Thiru Aalavay.  
There he went into hysterics of bliss on having darshan of Somasundara Perumal  
and Angayarkanni. He sang a number of songs on them and worshipped them with  
tear-filled eyes. Such was his devotion.   
Having no desire to leave the city of Madurai, he stayed on, worshipping  
Sundareshwaran and Meenakshi with whole hearted devotion. He lost himself  
before the emerald idol of Meenakshi and used to sit there for hours together.  
It was during one such long period of self experienced bliss did Shiva himself  
come to Paranjyothiyar as a Shiva Yogi. Paranjyothiyaar welcomed him with  
respect as any other Shiva devotee and offered him a seat. The Shiva Yogi  
blessed Paranjyothi, gave him Deeksha, Gnyanopadesam and went his way.   
With the blessings of Shiva himself, the glory of Paranjyothi spread far and  
wide. People flocked to hear him speak and loved to hear him sing. Highly  
impressed by his knowledge, the pundits of Madurai asked him to translate the  
Sanskrit work Aalasiya Maanmiyam into Tamil. Aalasiyamaanmiyam is a work based  
on the Shankara Sangithai part of the Skandha Purana. It talks in detail about  
the greatness of Madurai, its glorious history and sacred legends.  
Paranjyothiyar gladly accepted the proposal, promising to give them his very  
best. He started reading the Sanskrit work day and night, with a never  
diminishing zeal.   
One night, when Paranjyothi was in deep sleep, Meenakshi herself appeared in  
his dream and gave darshan to Paranjyothi.   
Paranjyothi, she said, her face illuminated by her bright smile, Sing the  
Sixty Four divine acts of our lord, Somasundara Peruman, in pure and sweet  
Tamil. It is my very desire to see this work come to fruition. I give you my  
complete blessings.   
Paranjyothi immediately woke up from his dream, sweating vigorously. He was  
ecstatic about the words of Meenakshi. He was not able to sleep anymore that  
night. When it dawned, he hurried to the temple and sang praises of the Lord  
and Goddess to his heartâs content and thanked them for the trust that they  
had placed on him.   
On an auspicious day, he worshipped the palm leaves and his pen. Then invoking  
the blessings of Somasundarar he began his work on the epic with an opening  
verse praising Ganesha, requesting him to provide his complete blessings for  
the successful completion of the work.   
Thus did Thiruvilayadal Puranam come into existence. Just as Periyapuranam  
sings the glory of the 63 Nayanmars, so does Thiruvilayadal Puranam praise the  
64 divine acts that were staged by Somasundara Peruman in the prosperous city  
of Madurai.   
The epic of Thiruvilayadal Puranam is divided into three parts- Madurai  
Kaandam, Koodar Kaandam and Thiruaalavaay Kaandam. Before the start of Madurai  
Kaandam, there are 343 verses in beautiful Tamil which describe in detail the  
glory of the Pandya Empire, the sheen attraction of the city of Madurai, the  
greatness of Kailasha, the sanctity of the Sthala (When Brahma put all the  
holy places on earth, including Kailasha, on one pan of a weighing scale and  
Madurai alone on the other pan, the plate containing Madurai was always found  
to be a bit heavier), the purity of the Pottramarai Kulam, the golden lotus  
tank, (to view it is Dharma, to touch it bestows wealth and to bathe in it  
grants liberation) and ofcourse the grace of the presiding deity. The 344th  
stanza which serves as the starting of the main epic is considered to be the  
crowning glory of the whole work.   
The Arangetram (first reading) of the Thiruvilayadal Puranam was done amidst  
much fanfare by the townsfolk. The whole city wore a festive look with  
beautiful garlands and colourful Kolams. Every person wore his best to go to  
the temple where the Arangetram was taking place. Paranjyothiyaar performed  
the first reading of the epic in the famous Thousand Pillared Hall to a packed  
audience including the Sanga Pulavars (The great Tamil Pundits of yore).  
Paranjyothi was greatly praised for his Magnum Opus, but he deferred them all  
to the boundless grace of Meenakshi and Aalavayappan. He was honored by the  
king and the people alike for giving them this great work of literature.   
After completing the epic, not having the heart to leave Thiru Aalavaay, he  
continued to live at Madurai, singing the glories of the deities, setting up  
institutions and madas to continue his services to the lord and after having  
lived to a ripe old age, he left the material world and merged into the cosmic  
bliss that is Shiva. However, he continues to live in the form of his works,  
delighting the devotees to no end.

Dear Krishnan,   
All the stories of TiruviLaiyadal Puranam, takes place only in Madurai. It is  
out and out Somasundara's story. There are at least 4 stories in regard to  
Siva's sports with Saint Manikkavavchagar. Saint Manikkavachagar describes  
them briefly in his Tiruvachakam. I got the original verse version of  
TiruviLaiyadal Puranam by Paramjothi Munivar, from Sri Ramanasramam!   
It is not a publication of Sri Ramanasramam, but they were selling a few  
copies from Kasi   
Matham, TirupanandaL.   
It contains the famous invocatory verse on Sri Dakshinamurti, where he sits  
under the banyan   
tree and shows the true I am ness in silence, with his chinmudra.   
Arunachala Siva.**
