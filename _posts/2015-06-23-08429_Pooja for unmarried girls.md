I have given the translation of Ozhivil Odukkam (Repose in the Remainder) of  
KaNNiudaiya VaLLalar,   
by Robert Butler with commentary of S. Ram Mohan and Robert Butler - up to  
Verse 77 in my serial   
post titled, 'Ozhivil Odukkam - A Second Serial Post', from 2013 onward, under  
the 'Teachings of   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.' I am giving in this the translation and commentary  
from Verse 78 onward,   
from the issues of Mountain Path, Jan. 2015 onward.   
Verse 78: The way in which the disciple is killed (by the word of the master),yet still  
lives, may be compared to a wife   
dying on merely hearing the death of her husband; to milk (which boils over in  
an instant); to a deeply devoted   
wife, immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre; to a loving widow (who  
remains faithful to her husband   
even after he dies), or to the generosity of Karna at the time of his death.   
In this verse, the woman who has lost her husband is used three times as a  
term of comparison. In the first   
two instances, the widow stands for the ego, the personal self, which is  
annihilated immediately on the mature   
disciple hearing the words of the guru. In the third, the widow stands for the  
disciple himself, who on hearing   
the word of the guru abandons all ideas of 'I' and 'mine', just as the  
faithful widow gives up her previous worldly   
existence on the death of her husband.   
In the reference to milk, it is not clear which property of milk is being  
referred to. One possibility is that it is a   
reference to the way in which a tiny amount of curd is sufficient to 'seed' a  
whole dish of milk, leaving nothing   
of the original milk, just as a word from the guru is sufficient to entirely  
transform the consciousness of the ripe   
disciple in an absolute and and irreversible fashion.   
The reference to Karna at the end of the verse requires some explanation.  
Karna is a major character in the   
Mahabharata who fought on the side of Dhritarstra against the sons of Pandu.  
Karna had been born to Kunti   
by the sun god Soorya, before her marriage to Pandu. Abandoned at birth, he  
had been adopted by Adhirata,   
a great comrade of Dhritarastra, and thus came to fight against his own half  
brothers,the sons of Pandu, in the   
Kurukshetra battle.   
Different accounts of Karna's act of generosity at the time of his death, are  
given in the Sanskrit Mahabharata of   
Vyasa and in the Tamizh Villibharatam of Villiputturar. In the latter,  
Krishna approaches Karna in the guise of   
a brahmin, asking for alms. Being on the battlefield Karna has nothing to  
offer. The brahmin reminds him that   
he can give him the mountain-like Punya which he has accumulated throughout  
his life with his matchless   
generosity. Karna agrees. Krishna then reveals his true identity and leaves,  
having rendered Karna capable   
of being killed by Arjuna through the loss of merit which had previously  
protected him. In the Sanskrit   
Mahabharata, in which Karna's vulnerability to Arjuna is established very  
early in his life, a much lesser degree   
of generosity is involved. In order to resolve a dispute over whose son is  
greater, Karna's father, Soorya and   
Arjuna's father Indra appear as brahmins on the battlefield. Karna, having  
nothing to offer, breaks of his gold   
teeth and gives them to the brahmins, thus establishing his superiority.   
Chidambara Swamigal assumes that the former account is being referred to here,  
as he glosses; "like the   
generosity of Karna, through which, at the time of death, being mindful of his  
next birth, he gave up to a   
brahmin all the merit he had accumulated.

Verse 79:-   
Just as the gold which goldsmith melts down in his crucible is of various  
degrees of purity, the results of the   
Master's teaching, though taken from the Siva Agamas and clearly conveyed,  
will vary, depending upon the   
degree of ripeness of the disciple. Know that all do not share the same  
degree of maturity.   
The Tamizh word used in this verse is MaaRRu, which is the technical term for  
the degree of fineness of gold,   
which was determined by the touchstone. (See also Verse 68). To refine gold,  
the goldsmith would place the   
gold of various degrees of purity in a crucible and melt it down, skimming off  
the impurities that rose to the   
surface. If the gold contained a lot of impurities it would take longer to  
refine and might need to be smelted   
by a number of times, getting gradually purer. However, whatever the degree of  
purity, there was only one   
process of refining it. In the same way, the Master's teachings, though  
derived from the Saiva Agamas and   
same for all, will take more or less time to bear fruit, depending upon the  
maturity of the disciple.

Verse 80:-   
The true reality of the life of the householder will become clear (to those of  
low spiritual maturity) only   
very slowly. It can be compared to a carving a statue by gradually chipping  
away the stone, or to the   
process of purifying muddy water with clearing nut. In the end this ancient  
world will be as repulsive   
to him as rice vomited up. Like the stem of a plantain tree placed on the  
fire, (very slow to burn), true   
knowledge (Jnana) will arise in him only very slowly.   
The subjects of this verse are the aspirants who possess the lowest grade of  
spiritual maturity, those   
who are mantaram - exceedingly slow to respond to the teachings of the guru.  
The clearing-nut tree,   
Strychnos potatorum, is a decidous tree which grows up to forty feet in  
height. Its Tamizh name is   
chillam and its Hindi name is nirmali. The seeds of the tree are commonly used  
in traditional medicine   
as well as purifying water in India and Myanmar. The state of being in which  
one is involved in worldly   
attachments is compared to murky water; just as the clearing nut slowly causes  
the clear water to separate   
out from the muddy sediment, the teaching of the guru will gradually purify  
the consciousness of the   
disciple, eliminating those attachments.

Verse 81:-   
For those whose nature can be molded as one would forge an image in iron, true  
knowledge will be won (more   
swiftly), as fire will burn green firewood. Then, like a drop of rain sliding  
from the leaf of a lotus, their wordly   
life will fall away. Divorced from them, the entire world will appear like a  
mirage.   
The devotees of the next to lowest degree of attainment will gain Jnana in the  
manner of green wood, which   
will burn will enough along with a few pieces of dry wood. Chidambara Swamigal  
sums up the meaning of the   
verse as follows: Just as green wood will burn with the help of a few pieces  
of firewood, Jnana will arise in them   
through a few words of instruction.   
The lotus leaf possesses a complex composition which repels water from its  
surface, reducing it to tiny droplets   
and causing it to run off the leaf if it is tilted. Not only that, any dirt  
particles on the leaf adhere to the droplets   
of water which thus cleanse the leaf. Hence those who are able to live in the  
world without being contaminated   
by it are compared to the lotus leaf, which remains dry and clean, even while  
living in a wet, muddy environment.

Verse 82:-   
(For the next highest class), to remove the body's inherited dispositions (and  
bestow Jnana) will be like   
(carving) a wooden doll. (Jnana will arise in them swiftly), as fire consumes  
charcoal. They will be   
indifferent to the household they had previously cherished. It will be like a  
palace of general assembly   
to them, (with the people coming and going). Even the life of the gods will  
seem like an insubstantial   
dream.   
This first part of this verse is extremely elliptical, but the intended  
meaning is reasonably clear from what   
precedes it. Since the two preceding verses dealt with the two lowest grades  
of seeker, it an be assumed   
that the next to the highest grade, "theevira pakkuvar" in Tamizh, are being  
described here. Since the   
first two verses referred, respectively, to the shaping of stone and iron,  
this phrase may be assumed to   
be referring to the carving or shaping of wood, and that what is being  
compared to the fire burning charcoal   
is the action of Jnana in swiftly consuming the conditional awareness of the  
disciple.   
The significance of the phrase the body's inherited dispositions is that  
aspirants of this degree of maturity   
will no longer have any need to remove their bodha vadhanai \- inherited  
dispositions related to sensual   
desire, since these will already have been transcended.   
The idea expressed in the final line seems to be that, although we cannot  
experience the life of the gods,   
we feel assured that it vastly more pleasurable than this earthly life.  
However, even such pleasures,   
as we might imagine them, will seem ephemeral and insubstantial to the  
theevira pakkuvar.

Verse 83:-   
For (those whose nature is easily molded, like) dolls made out of butter, the  
acquisition of Jnana will be swift,   
like squirrel fur or cotton falling into the flame of a lamp. For them there  
are no desires. Tears will pour down   
from their eyes. Oblivious to time, sobbing and melting inwardly, they will  
laugh and cry by turns, and the   
hair of their bodies will stand on end.   
Verse 84:-   
(In those of the highest degree of maturity) the in dwelling anavam, ego and  
the outer kanmam and mayai (Karma   
and Maya) have become separated (from their true self), just as the fruit of  
the tamarind becomes separate   
from its shell when ripe, and the seeds of future kanmam, (Karmas) have been  
thus annihilated, just an eye less   
needle cannot be threaded. For such as these, this freedom from desire is the  
bliss of the Self.   
The text simply says that which sprouts within along with that which is  
exterior. Chidambara Swamigal identifies   
that which sprouts within as anavam (the principle of egoism) that is  
intimately associated with the jiva in an   
inward sense, yet eternally separate from it, and that which is outside as the  
other two malams (impurities),   
mayai and kanmam (Maya and Karma), the world illusion and the self  
perpetuating deeds and their fruits,   
which affect the jiva in an outward sense, and must be eradicated before the  
inwardly dwelling anavam can   
be tackled. For those preferring an interpretation more in line with Advaita  
Vedanta we might say that which   
sprouts within is the mind, and that which is exterior is the senses and their  
activity.   
The fruit of the puLi - tamarind tree is a long green pod. When it ripens,  
the outer shell becomes brown and   
brittle, at which point the brown pulp containing the seeds becomes detached  
from the shell and is quite easy   
to extract. Just as the brittle shell of the ripe tamarind fruit will fall  
away easily, the conditional awareness   
of the ripe disciple will be easily eradicated by the word of the guru. At  
this point the ego, the sense of a   
personal self, has died, and the disciple cannot create any further kanmam or  
experience its effects. The   
actions of the physical body are now those of the Self, Sivam.   
Towards the end of the verse, there is a play on the word Pasam (attachments)  
which means the thread   
as well as having the familiar meaning worldly bondage. Just as thread (Pasam)  
cannot follow a needle   
without an eye -- kanmam - actions and their fruits cannot be become  
associated with those who have   
abandoned worldly attachments (pasam).

Verse 85:-   
(The attainment of Jnana), will be like the rising of the sun, like the  
overwhelming desire of the lover for   
his beloved; like a ship sighting shore after surviving the perils of the  
ocean; it will be like being freed   
from prison or being cured of an incurable disease; it will be like  
witnessing a miracle.   
The sun is referred to as Arunan, from Sanskrit Aruna meaning reddish brown,  
tawny, red, ruddy, (the color of   
the morning opposed to the darkness of night). It is therefore a word well  
suited to symbolize the coming of   
the dawn of realization, before which the darkness of Anava malam (the ego, an  
impurity), the ego and the   
false world of duality, which is founded upon it, fades and ceases to be. The  
all consuming bliss of the Self is   
then compared to the desire of the lover for the beloved, which grows ever  
greater, eclipsing any other thoughts   
and desires.

Verse 86:-   
As the body, senses, mental faculties, the three gunas (principles of nature),  
and the ten vital airs fall away   
one after another,(mature disciples will attain) the liberation which lies  
beyond nada, the highest of tattvas;   
then the personal self, which stands at the middle ground, (between the world  
and the Self), will be eradicated,   
and they will enter the ocean of supreme bliss. Finally, becoming free of all  
divisions, how will they not be   
amazed, knowing how now that which they have never never known?   
In this verse, the thirty six tattvas are referred to once more, with the  
addition of the three universal principles   
\-- rajas, ramas and sattva, and the ten vital airs, vayu, the principal one  
of which is prana. The thirty six   
tattvas are subject to a total of ninety six, which include, in addition to  
the thirty six which are the main focus   
of Siddhanta, the gunas, the vital airs, the bodily sheaths, the nerves, and  
so on. Four stages, leading to the   
disciple's realization of his unity with the Self, are described.   
First, he grasps the nature of the world around him, (described in Siddhanta  
terms as consisting of the thirty   
six tattvas), and realizing that it is none other than the Self, becomes free  
of it, resulting in Veedu (liberation)   
(from the tattvas); next the 'I' which stands between the Self and the world  
of the tattvas, subsides, a process   
here described as "tan ozhivu" \- the loss of oneself, the duality which it  
had previously mediated having now   
ceased; at that point the disciple is enveloped in the ocean of supreme bliss.  
Finally even this state is transcended   
and the disciples attain the state of oneness with the Self becoming 'chanthu  
azhivar' \-- those who are free of   
all divisions. See also Verse 41 which expresses the same four fold  
progression.

Verse 109 of Ozhivil Odukkam: When you think of it, is it feasible to measure and know the extent of earth  
and the heavens,   
the weight of the mountains and the volume of the surging ocean? Similarly,  
when you say that   
you are the Real, these are only words, (since it cannot be measured or  
known), without encompassing   
the destruction of your own ego self. If you try to know it otherwise,. it  
will remain quite alien from you.   
(109).   
There are a number pf ways of interpreting the latter part of the verse, but  
the overall sense is as follows: the discriminating consciousness cam affirm, 'I am the Real', but it cannot  
know that the reality   
objectively, since the Real is only revealed upon the destruction of the  
discriminating consciousness,   
that is attempting to know it. Should on make that attempt, the Real will  
seem alien and unobtainable.

Ozhivl Odukkam: Verse 110: The world of Maya, arising and subsiding by turns,is unreal like the clouds in  
the sky. If we do not realize   
this, and attempt to suppress the world that rises up using the mind that  
rises with it, will this not be   
like a ball, bouncing back again each time we hit it to the ground?  
Therefore, observe it as the witness   
only. It will be like a tree dug up by the root, yielding neither flowers nor  
fruits. (110).   
The literal meaning in the second sentence here is, 'If (one) suppresses that  
which rises up with that   
which rises up. Uthippu is a noun from which the verb 'uti', which means to  
spring up, arise,come into   
existence. Since the world and the mind arise together in consciousness, the  
word is suited to conveying   
both meanings. The repetition of the word prefigures the idea of bouncing  
back and forth,as of the ball   
in the metaphor which follows, and also lends weight to the idea being  
presented here that the world and   
the mind are not in essence different, that they are the two sides of the same  
coin, as it were.   
Thus an attempt on the part of the mind to suppress the world will cause the  
world to 'bounce back'   
as it were, prompting further mental activity in never ending vicious circle.  
The alternative to engaging   
in the fruitless activity described in the first part of the verse is simply  
to remain as witness. If the mind,   
the discriminating consciousness, is eliminated, there will be no world of  
the mind and senses, just as,   
if the root of a tree is ripped out, it will produce neither flowers nor  
fruits.

Verse 111: Should you succeed even for a split second in reaching the state of absorption  
in the Self, (nishta),   
which is as the pure state (Chuttam), in which the discriminating  
consciousness has fallen away,   
is free of all limitation, ah! I am at a loss to describe it! Is the bliss  
that rises up then a thing of little   
account? It would be as if one accessed the vast ocean of milk through the  
tiny hole in a tear! (111)   
Chuttam is the pure state is the state of Jagrat Sushupti \- waking sleep, a  
state which is neither waking   
but one of total freedom which transcends both of these states. See the notes  
to Verse 106.   
The bliss of the Self is compared to the ocean of milk, churned by the gods  
and asuras, to obtain divine   
ambrosia; the experience of the infinite bliss of the Self whilst still in  
the body upon the loss of the   
discriminating consciousness is compared to gaining access to the Puranic  
ocean of milk through the   
tiny hole of a teat.

Verse 112 of Ozhivil Odukkam: Being totally identified with the body, you torment yourself saying, 'When  
will the time come to this body   
is no more, and divine grace will be mine?' What is the use of this? Do not  
the myriad phenomena that   
appear in ether eventually subside again? Similarly, in the absolute fullness  
of Reality, which is beyond   
duality, there is nothing other than yourself? (112)   
Puranam - the absolute fullness of Reality, is said here to be 'ethir arra',  
which means literally without   
that which is opposite to, in front of, over against it. In other words, in  
that Puranam, there exists no   
'other', which could take as its object. 'Ethir arra' has therefore been  
translated as beyond duality.

Verse 113 of Ozhivil Odukkam: Know that the habit is pernicious. A fowl will scratch even at a bare rock,  
and dig around even in a heap   
of paddy. The blind man who recovers his sight will feel threatened by the  
light, recoil from it and refuse   
to give up his walking stick. Similarly the Jiva will persist in perceiving  
distinction in the grace of the Self   
(even after realizing its non dual nature). \- 113.   
Verses 113-116 demonstrate how, due to ingrained habit, the discriminating  
ego-consciousness will have   
the tendency to reassert itself at the first opportunity until it is finally  
eradicated.   
The phrase 'amma arulai pakkuvam' means literally the Jiva will divide grace.  
The verb 'paku' in its   
transitive form means to divide, distribute, apportion, allot. The Jiva will  
not be able to hold onto the   
Self if it attempts to divide it, i.e. analyze it with the discriminating  
mind. The expression 'pakuttarivu'   
is commonly used in the sense of discriminating knowledge, rationality. In  
this verse, 'arul' -grace   
is equated with the Self or Sivam. As mentioned previously, in Siddhanta  
'arul' is nothing other than the   
Sakti of Sivam itself, in its active role of removing the three malams and  
conferring enlightenment.   
Unless you slap it and drive it outside, a young calf will not leave its  
tethering post, even if you untie the rope.   
Likewise, even if you tell the Jiva to abode as Sivam, so that it remains free  
of attachment like Sivam, itself,   
thus removing its separate identity and bringing it to a state of oneness, it  
will revert to its dualistic mode of   
thought.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse No. 114 of Ozhivil Odukkam: A young calf may be so used to bring tied up that it does not know what to do  
when its tether is removed.   
The farmer has to slap it to drive outside, where it will find its mother and  
be able to enjoy her milk. Similarly   
the unripe disciple, having been guided toward the state of the Self by the  
guru, will, out of sheer habit,   
return to his habitual dualistic state of mind, trying to analyze the state he  
is in, and will therefore be unable   
to enjoy the bliss of the Self. TCS glosses: 'Although it has been made one  
with Siva, the jiva, which became one with it through the cessation of the  
ego-consciousness, will become two (again) through the movement of that ego-  
consciousness.'

Verse 143.   
For those who merely act the part of the realized sage what enjoyment will  
there be, other than that of   
the daily offerings of food they receive? Can they know the bliss which is  
not known even to those whose   
consciousness is pure, who have cut away desire, renouncing both inwardly and  
outwardly?   
The text says 'nana kiriyai nadippavar' which means literally 'those who act  
out the conduct of Jnana.'   
Here the word 'kiriyai' is used in the general sense of action, conduct. TCS  
glosses it as nanacharam   
\- the practices related to jnana, the final stage on the Siddhanta spiritual  
path.   
As described in a number of previous verses, bliss is a state which precedes  
the final state of liberation,   
and in which there is a still a trace of discriminating consciousness. In the  
final state itself there is no   
longer any distinction between the bliss and the knower of it. In that state,  
the Jnani is both the   
Self, and the bliss of the Self; he knows it by being it, since there is no  
other to know it objectively,'   
hence it is called 'ariya inbam' \- the bliss which is not known. Sri Ramana  
has spoken of bliss in the   
following terms: ...ananda (bliss), is also called an obstacle, because in that state a feeling  
of separation from the source   
of ananda, enabling the enjoyer to say, 'I am enjoying ananda' is present.  
Even this has to be surmounted.   
The final stage of samadhana or samadhi has to be reached in which one becomes  
Ananda or one with Reality,   
and the duality of enjoyer and enjoyment ceases in the ocean of Sat Chit  
Ananda or the Self.   
(Day by day with Bhagavan, 25.4.1946 morning.)   
At the end of the verse the Tamizh text says 'avaa arutttu turavu aay' \-  
cutting away desire and practicing   
renunciation. TCS glosses, 'turavu' is the ending of outward attachment.  
'avaa aruttal' is the ending   
of inner attachment. When both these forms of attachment fall away, the states  
of Chakalam and   
Kevalam fall away. When these fall away, true realization appears. The verse  
is an indirect reference to   
Tirukkural in which Chapter 36, entitled Mey unarthal -Knowledge of the True  
is located between   
Chapter 35, Turavu - Renunciation and Chapter 37, Ava Aruttal - The  
Extirpation of Desire.

Verse 144: Bliss is indeed the dwelling place of true knowledge. You are like the Achunam  
bird, in that an atom of   
suffering in this world appears as great as a mountain, and through this  
virtuous quality a longing for   
supreme bliss has arisen in you. Listen now, and seeking supreme bliss in the  
following manner, you   
shall obtain it.   
The word 'puL' employed in the verse a bird in general. Here the Asunam bird  
is meant. It is described   
by the Tamizh Lexicon as follows, 'A creature believed to be susceptible to  
harmony that when it is   
fascinated by notes of music, a sudden loud beat of the drum causes its  
instantaneous death.' Similarly   
the mature disciple, in whom the desire for liberation has grown exceedingly  
strong, will suffer greatly   
from the least contact with the things in the world, if he allows himself to  
become identified with them.

Verse 145: Supreme Bliss is not separate from you. It is your true Being. That which  
arises with the sense objects   
is bliss also, but it is not the pure consciousness in which bliss itself is  
annihilated. In that state both   
kinds of bliss are annihilated.   
Since our true nature is bliss only, a degree of bliss is experienced through  
contact with the objects of sense,   
but this bliss is not to be mistaken for the bliss which is experienced  
through transcending the senses   
entirely, and which precedes its own annihilation in the state of realization.  
The meaning is not entirely   
clear. In this translation it has been taken to mean that the Jnani, having  
freed himself from the bliss   
of the world of the senses, then experiences supreme bliss at the point of  
merging with the Self. However,   
for this merger to take place, even this supreme bliss, which still contains  
a trace of duality, must be lost.   
It could also mean that the first kind of bliss is lost because it is only  
temporary, and when it passes away,'   
the experiencer is returned once more to the sufferings of the phenomenal  
world, whilst the second kind   
of bliss, supreme bliss, is lost because the duality of experiencer and the  
thing experienced cease on merging   
permanently with the Self.

Verse 146: The inferior bliss that arises with the objects of sense, lasts for some time,  
then disappears is of little   
worth; the superior bliss is that which is all consuming and endures without  
intermission. Can it   
be gained by the discriminating mind? The bliss which appears and is  
subsequently lost is synonymous   
with the alternating states of pleasure and pain. Your true state is that of  
the bliss which neither   
appears nor subsides.   
The state referred to in the first part of the verse is that of those who try  
to experience bliss with   
the discriminating mind, it being understood that no such attempt on the part  
of the Jnani would,   
or could, be made.   
The state of being merged in the Self is one of pure bliss, yet it is not  
perceived as such, since there   
is no discriminating intelligence to perceive it. Being of the very nature of  
the Self, it neither appears   
nor disappears. This is rather like the state of deep sleep, which we  
recognize to have been blissful   
only on waking up from it. If we imagine therefore a state which is like deep  
sleep, but filled with   
undifferentiated awareness, then we have some idea of the state being alluded  
to here.
