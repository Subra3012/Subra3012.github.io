**INDIA 'S GIFT TO THE WORLD (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 27, 1895)**   
Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday night under the  
auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a fairly large audience at  
the hall of the Long Island Historical Society, corner Pierrepont and Clinton  
streets. **His subject was "India's Gift to the World".**   
"In religion," he said, "she has exerted a great influence on Christianity, as  
the very teachings of Christ would [could] be traced back to those of Buddha."  
**He showed by quotations from the works of European and American scientists  
the many points of similarity between Buddha and Christ.** The latter's birth,  
his seclusion from the world, the number of his apostles, and the very ethics  
of his teachings are the same as those of Buddha, living many hundred years  
before him.   
"Is it mere chance," the lecturer asked, "or was Buddha's religion but the  
foreshadowing of that of Christ? **The majority of your thinkers seem to be  
satisfied in the latter explanation, but there are some bold enough to say  
that Christianity is the direct offspring of Buddhism** just as the earliest  
heresy in the Christian religion  the Monecian [Manichaean] heresy  is now  
universally regarded as the teaching of a sect of Buddhists. **But there is  
more evidence that Christianity is founded in Buddhism. We find it in recently  
discovered inscriptions from the reign of Emperor Oshoka [Asoka] of India,  
about 300 B.C., who made treaties with all the Grecian kings, and whose  
missionaries discriminated [disseminated ?] in those very parts, where,  
centuries after, Christianity flourished, the principles of the Buddhistic  
religion.**   
"The same holds good with respect to sciences. India has given to antiquity  
the earliest scientifical physicians, and, according to Sir William Hunter,  
she has even contributed to modern medical science by the discovery of various  
chemicals and by teaching you how to reform misshapen ears and noses. **Even  
more it has done in mathematics, for algebra, geometry, astronomy, and the  
triumph of modern science  mixed mathematics  were all invented in India,  
just so much as the ten numerals, the very cornerstone of all present  
civilization, were discovered in India, and are in reality, Sanskrit words.**   
 **" In philosophy we are even now head and shoulders above any other nation,  
as Schopenhauer, the great German philosopher, has confessed.** In music India  
gave to the world her system of notation, with the seven cardinal notes and  
the diatonic scale, all of which we enjoyed as early as 350 B.C., while it  
came to Europe only in the eleventh century. **In philology, our Sanskrit  
language is now universally acknowledged to be the foundation of all European  
languages, which, in fact, are nothing but jargonized Sanskrit.**   
 **" In literature, our epics and poems and dramas rank as high as those of  
any language; our 'Shaguntala' [Shakuntala] was summarized by Germany's  
greatest poet, as 'heaven and earth united'.** India has given to the world  
the fables of Aesop, which were copied by Aesop from an old Sanskrit book; it  
has given the Arabian Nights, yes, even the story of Cinderella and the Bean  
Stalks. In manufacture, India was the first to make cotton and purple [dye],  
it was proficient in all works of jewelry, and the very word 'sugar', as well  
as the article itself, is the product of India. **Lastly she has invented the  
game of chess and the cards and the dice.** _So great, in fact, was the  
superiority of India in every respect, that it drew to her borders the hungry  
cohorts of Europe, and thereby indirectly brought about the discovery of  
America._   
 **" And now, what has the world given to India in return for all that?  
Nothing but nullification [vilification] and curse and contempt. The world  
waded in her children's life-blood, it reduced India to poverty and her sons  
and daughters to slavery, and now it adds insult to injury by preaching to her  
a religion which can only thrive on the destruction of every other religion.  
But India is not afraid. It does not beg for mercy at the hands of any nation.  
Our only fault is that we cannot: fight to conquer; but we trust in the  
eternity of truth. India's message to the world is first of all, her blessing;  
she is returning good for the evil which is done her, and thus she puts into  
execution this noble idea, which had its origin in India. Lastly, India's  
message is, that calm goodness, patience and gentleness will ultimately  
triumph.** For where are the Greeks, the onetime masters of the earth? They  
are gone. Where are the Romans, at the tramp of whose cohorts the world  
trembled? Passed away. Where are the Arabs, who in fifty years had carried  
their banners from the Atlantic to the Pacific? and where are the Spaniards,  
the cruel murderers of millions of men? Both races are nearly extinct; but  
thanks to the morality of her children, the kinder race will never perish, and  
she will yet see the hour of her triumph."   
At the close of the lecture, which was warmly applauded, Swami Vivekananda  
answered a number of questions in regard to the customs of India. **He denied  
positively the truth of the statement published in yesterday 's [February 25]  
Standard Union, to the effect that widows are ill-treated in India. The law  
guarantees her not only her own property, before marriage, but also all she  
received from her husband, at whose death, if there be no direct heirs, the  
property goes to her. Widows seldom marry in India, because of the scarcity of  
men.** He also stated that the self-sacrifices of wives at the death of their  
husbands as well as the fanatical self-destruction under the wheels of the  
Juggernaut, have wholly stopped, and referred his hearers for proof to Sir  
William Hunter's "History of the Indian Empire".

Dear prasanth,   
Excellent. What India gave to the world, the great treasures are   
one by one, thrown away by the post Independent governments   
of India. We have not given its due place to Sanskrit. The temples   
which were run by pious and self less priests, have been taken over   
by government and the Government Officers are now in executive   
positions to run these temples. These guys may be IAS officers,   
but they know little about Hindu theology or philosophy. We   
are ruining our own treasures.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
I agree sir. we have many theory masters but very few who implement like  
ramana maharshi,ramakrishna etc..   
We need more of ramana maharshi,ramakrishnas for bring back the glory of  
Sanatana Dharma.   
For this each one of us should do best of our capacities.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says When the sense of distinction and separation is absent  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 10:49:02 AM

**Chapter 28 All Suffering is Born of Desire**   
Questioner: I come from a far off country. I had some inner experiences on my  
own and I would like to compare notes.   
Maharaj: By all means. Do you know yourself?   
Q: I know that I am not the body. Nor am I the mind.   
M: What makes you say so?   
Q: I do not feel I am in the body. I seem to be all over the place everywhere.  
As to the mind, I can switch it on and off, so to say. This makes me feel I am  
not the mind.   
M: When you feel yourself everywhere in the world, do you remain separate from  
the world? Or, are you the world?   
Q: Both. Sometimes I feel myself to be neither mind nor body, but one single  
all-seeing eye. When I go deeper into it, I find myself to be all I see and  
the world and myself become one.   
M: Very well. What about desires? Do you have any?   
Q: Yes, they come, short and superficial.   
M: And what do you do about them?   
Q: What can I do? They come, they go. l look at them. Sometimes I see my body  
and my mind engaged in fulfilling them.   
M: Whose desires are being fulfilled?   
Q: They are a part of the world in which I live. They are just as trees and  
clouds are there.   
M: Are they not a sign of some imperfection?   
Q: Why should they be? They are as they are, and I am as I am. How can the  
appearance and disappearance of desires affect me? Of course, they affect the  
shape and content of the mind.   
M: How did you come to your present state?   
Q: Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings have put me on my way. Then I met one  
Douglas Harding who helped me by showing me how to work on the 'Who am I ?'   
 **Q: What is love?   
M: When the sense of distinction and separation is absent, you may call it  
love.   
Q: What is happiness?   
M: Harmony between the inner and the outer is happiness. On the other hand,  
self-identification with the outer causes is suffering.**   
Q: What is the real cause of suffering?   
M: Self-identification with the limited (vyaktitva). Sensations as such,  
however strong, do not cause suffering. It is the mind bewildered by wrong  
ideas, addicted to thinking: 'I am this' 'I am that', that fears loss and  
craves gain and suffers when frustrated.   
Q: A friend of mine used to have horrible dreams night after night. Going to  
sleep would terrorise him. Nothing could help him.   
M: Company of the truly good (satsang) would help him.   
Q: Generally one cannot find such friendship.   
M: Seek within. Your own self is your best friend.   
Q: Why is life so full of contradictions?   
M: It serves to break down mental pride. We must realise how poor and  
powerless we are. As long as we delude ourselves by what we imagine ourselves  
to be, to know, to have, to do, we are in a sad plight indeed. Only in  
complete self-negation there is a chance to discover our real being.
