## The Child is the Father of the Man!

In a recent wedding, at a relative of my wife, almost all the guests   
were new to me and were known to my wife only. To each every,   
inquisitive guest, I had to keep on telling that I was so and so.   
I almost lost my patience. To some guest, who asked looking at me: "You..?" Then I am told him, "I am married to Geetha, so I am her   
husband!" That guest was still not fully satisfied. "But she is S. Geetha?"  
he continued. (My wife is called 'S.Geetha' because there are so many Geethas  
in the family.)   
Still, the inquisitive guest could not satisfy himself. Then I thought   
I should give a final reply. "Yes. Her father is Subramania Iyer.   
I am also Subramanian (Iyer). So, she continues to remain as S.   
Geetha..."   
The Child is Father of the Man!

## Birth, Death and Rebirth  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 04, 2009, 11:01:27 AM

What is Birth and Death? This question haunted me for a long time. Then one  
day I understood thus: What is called as Birth? We know what is birth by seeing a child being born,  
if a child is born, then we know it to be birth, we say a child is born.  
Similarly, we know what is death when we see some person die. We see a person  
lie flat as know im to be dead. We call this as death! Both the above points  
i.e. birth and death is known to us by seeing what is birth and by seeing what  
is dead. So we have only seen what is birth and what is death.   
Do 'I' or 'you' know what birth are death is? Do you remember your birth? How  
much so ever you try to recollect where from, when you were born, you cannot  
recollect your own birth! The truth is 'You' 'I' are birth less. You know your  
your birth day, time of your birth only by what others have told you, for  
example, your parents have recorded your birth date and so on, but do you  
really know your own birth? you have been believing that you were born on this  
date this time etc...   
The fact is, 'You' can never know your birth date at all by yourself, for you  
are actually birth less. Similarly, 'You' can never know your death at all  
because you can never know when you die? do you? So long what we know about  
death is only what we saw, but we have never experienced death or birth. The  
fact is you can never experience Death because you are Deathless.   
So now what is Rebirth?   
Is there a Rebirth? You are born every moment, and when every moment that  
passed by you died. to make it more simple, every new thought is   
your rebirth and every thought that just passed by is your past life. You are  
born and dead innumerable number of times - countless.   
This moment when you know this truth, now you can remember all your past  
life's. What you were and what you are now. What is called prarabdha is this.  
It because of your past actions you are now thus. You can recollect your past  
life. It is said Buddha recollected all his previous life's - It is this  
truth!   
The Vedas, Upanishads say, you have now been born as a human being after  
ountless births and you have this rare opportunity to be born as a human. What  
is its essence? Does it mean you were something else in your past life and  
all? Just think about this. Let me take an example of a Terrorist, Does he  
know he is a human being? He does not, He has all animal instinct in him, He  
kills, destroys and all etc.. later at some point in his life, he then  
realizes his folly, he realizes how he has been so long like an animal, now  
when he realizes this truth, that moment he is born as a Human Being. He was  
animal in his past life as a terrorist. Now when he realized his folly he  
became a human being. This is the Truth!   
I would like to illustrate this further with the srory of Jadabharatha.   
As the story goes just when all his austerities were going to give him their  
fruits i.e. when he was just about to attain liberation, One day while  
offering prayers to the Sun God on the river bank, he saw a lone and heavily  
pregnant doe coming to quench its thirst in the river. Hardly had it touched  
the water when the forest echoed with the roar of a lion. The doe became  
terror-stricken and it just leaped into the water without even quenching its  
thirst and tried to ford it in a bid to escape to the other side of the river.  
Shocked by fear and overcome by the effort to negotiate the current, the doe  
gave birth to a young deer midstream. Without even being aware of it, the doe  
reached the other bank where it died of exhaustion. The royal sage who saw it  
all, was moved by compassion at the sight of the motherless infant deer being  
carried away by the river. He picked the young deer, took it to his ashrama  
and fed it with tender grass and protected it from wild beasts. Soon he grew  
very fond of it. In course of time the sage became so attached to it that he  
could not part from it even for a short while. He feared all sorts of harms to  
his pet and prayed for their removal. He forgot that he was a sage and behaved  
like a foolish householder doting over his child. In the end he died with  
thoughts of the deer in his mind.   
The Vedic scriptures say that a man will be born in his next birth as that  
thing about which he was thinking most at the time of his death. So in this  
case, Jadabharatha thinking about the motherless deer, for the love for the  
deer, and hence he was born as a deer (He decided to be its caretaker, Mother  
deer), the essence is that he is not born again as a deer but in that love, he  
forgot himself and himself lost in the love of the deer became a (caretaker  
like a mother) deer to take care the motherless infant deer. He became a  
mother deer. Like How sometimes, young people are mesmarised on terror and  
become terrorist. Similarly, Jadabharatha became a deer. Then like the example  
being discussed how the terrorist realizes his folly and becomes human being,  
Jadabharatha realized - "regretted: "How foolish of me to have forgotten my  
tapas and become attached to an animal? And now I suffer for it, being born an  
animal. I shall not repeat the mistake." Saying this the deer left its mother  
and began living in the vicinity of a Rishi's ashrama spending all its time  
thinking of God. When death approached, the deer entered the water of a river  
and standing there, gave up its body. So the last thought at death was he  
realized his mistake and did not want to commit the same mistake (Note he dint  
die, his thought dies).   
In the next birth the deer was born as the son of a pious Brahmana. The past  
tapas and mistakes lingered in the child's mind and so he did not want to  
commit the same mistake. As a child Bharata in his third birth did not show  
any attachment to his family. He did not even speak. People therefore called  
him Jada or a dunce. Hence the name Jada Bharata.   
I have seen some people saying that they have wasted their life so far and  
they cannot do anything in this life and hope for the best in the next birth!  
The question is do they even have this birth like how they think? or is there  
another birth like they think? The truth is there is no "Next Birth" like how  
it sounds. Rebirth is now. Death is now. You dont die or take birth at all. So  
there is No Birth, no Rebirth, or Death at all as it is normally understood.  
The real essence of Birth, Rebirth and death is only your thoughts and not  
you.

In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Krishna said to Uddhava thus about death: The mind combined with 5 indriyas and tendencies derived from Karma which  
constitute the linga sharira (Subtle Body) transmigrates from one body to  
another. The Atman though different from the Linga Sharira, also seems to  
follow it because of the absolute superimposition between them.   
The mind of the dying man, swayed by his own actions and their impressions,  
thinks intensely on experiences he had in life, on what he had seen, heard and  
passed through. Consequently he feels that he has entered a new body that has  
manifested by its intense thought, and left the old one. With the coming of  
the consciousness of the new body, there is complete oblivion of the old body,  
its history in the world.   
On account of the intensity of attraction felt for the new body for whatever  
reason, the memory of the of one is completely effaced.   
Death means this complete forgetfulness of the old body and its affairs by the  
Jiva.   
The acceptance of the new body by the Jiva and his complete identification  
with it is called birth. How this happens is found in the examples of dreams  
and reveries. As in these states, the Jiva becomes completely oblivious of the  
old body and gets identified with the new one. The Identification is absolute  
that the Jiva forgets its pre-existence and comes to believe that he has come  
into being with a new body.   
When Jada Bharatha saw the infant deer without its mother, he became its  
caretaker by becoming its mother. then when he realized his mistake, he left  
the old body as a mother - caretaker and also the infant deer and was born  
again as a pios Brahmana and attained the lord.
