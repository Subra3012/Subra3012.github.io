## Thoughts on Good Friday - 2009

Today is the Good Friday, the day of crucifixon of Jesus Christ,   
son of God. On the Sunday next, Easter, is the day of Resurrection, the union  
of son with the father. While Good Friday is a day of solemnity, Easter is a  
day of celebration.   
The crucified Jesus Christ made seven statements in the midst of His suffering  
on the Hill of Calvary. These are known as the Seven Words   
on the Cross.   
1\. The first word: "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do," is  
the supreme example of forgiveness as Jesus interceded for those who scoffed  
at Him.   
2\. The second word: "Verily I say unto Thee. Today thou shalt be with me in  
Paradise," was addressed to one of the two malefactors who were crucified on  
either side of Him. One repented and asked for forgiveness and Jesus assured  
him that he was forgiven.   
3\. The third word: "Woman behold your son!" addressed to the weeping mother  
Mary, demonstrated the filial care and responsibility by entrusting her to the  
care of His beloved disciple John.   
4\. The fourth word: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani - My God, my God, why has  
thou forsaken me?" is the anguished cry of Jesus who by taking the sins of the  
whole world became repugnant to God, the essence of holiness. It was an  
ironic reward for His redemptive sacrificial suffering for all humankind.   
5\. The fifth word: "I thirst," proves the Man on the Cross was truly human in  
all respects, parched with thirst, after having been nailed to the cross for  
three hours in the terrible heat of the sun from noon to three O'clock in the  
afternoon.   
6\. The sixth word: "It is finished", is a familiar word taken from the world  
of commerce. It would be a triumphant shout of a contemporary Jew, who having  
been paid all his debts in full, would proclaim that he was free from all  
debts. The relief was great because a defaulting debtor and his family could  
have been thrown into prison until the last penny with interest had been paid.  
Jesus had paid the debt for all of humankind's sins. Only later would people  
understand what it truly meant.   
7\. The seventh and the last word: "Father into thy hands, I commend my  
spirit", was Jesus's surrendering His earthly life into the safekeeping of  
God.   
The Seven Words in the Cross are applicable to all those -- of whatever faith  
they subscribe to -- as the believer's relationship with God who creates,  
punishes and forgives.   
Arunachala Siva.

Swami Vivekananda on Jesus Christ: It is the Man who said: "I and my Father are one"   
whose power has descended unto millions.   
For thousands of years it has worked for good.   
And we know that the same Man, because he was a non-dualist, was merciful to  
others.   
To the masses who could not conceive of anything higher than a Personal God,  
he said,   
" _Pray to your Father in heaven._ "   
To others who could grasp a higher idea, he said,   
" _I am the vine, ye are the branches_, "   
but to his disciples to whom he revealed himself more fully, he proclaimed the  
highest truth,   
" _I and my Father are one_ "   
.................   
The three years of his ministry were like one compressed, concentrated age,   
which it has taken nineteen hundred years to unfold, and who knows   
how much longer it will yet take!   
Little men like you and me are simply the recipients of just a little energy.   
A few minutes, a few hours at best are enough to spend it all, to stretch it  
out,   
as it were, to its fullest strength, and then we are gone for ever.   
But mark this giant that came: centuries and ages pass, yet the energy that he left upon the world is not yet  
stretched,   
not yet expanded to its full.   
It goes on adding new vigour as the ages roll on.   
..................................   
Om Shanti. ..
