**Verse 4**   
 _Ram doot atulit bal dhama   
Anjani-putra Pavan sut nama_   
**Meaning** : You are the divine messenger of Shri Ram. The repository of immeasurable  
strength, though known only as Son of Pavan (Wind), born of Anjani.   
 **Commentary :**   
Here lord hanuman was praised as divine messenger of Lord Shri Ram.Also Lord  
hanuman is praised of having immeasurable strength.   
In this verse Tulsidas shows the importance of lord capabilities when  
descended as a human avatar.   
Though god comes as a human avatar and comes from a women's womb we should  
never under-estimate the capabilities of god/guru.   
We should always treat our guru equal to god and should have immense faith in  
him.   
As ramakrishna paramahamsa says,   
Blood and semen are thin liquids, and yet out of them comes such a big  
creature as man. Everything is possible for God.   
One who is an acharya should give up 'woman and gold';otherwise people will  
not take his advice.   
It is not enough for him to renounce only mentally; he should also renounce  
outwardly. Only then will his teaching bear fruit. Otherwise people will  
think,"Though he asks us to give up 'woman and gold',he enjoys them himself in  
secret."   
Sri Ramakrishna says many times Guru Will Let You Know Who You Are And What  
Your Real Nature Is.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to tell one story: Once two persons were sleeping in a hall.Both were poor.During the sleep, one  
man was dreaming.He dreamt that he is a very rich person and he has stacked  
all the gold and currency in a cupboard.And a thief comes and takes away all  
the gold and currency, and runs away.The dreaming man shouts in shock: "O! the  
thief is running away with all my wealth.   
Please catch him, please catch him...."   
The other man woke up. He was not dreaming anything, neither the thief, nor  
the gold and currency. What shall he do? Will he run out to the front yard to  
catch the thief? Will he rush to the police station to complain? He will  
simply wake that wailing man from sleep and dream.   
The Guru is like the man who wakes us, the dreaming men, up.The only  
difference is that the Guru is within your Heart.   
The state where "I-thought" is not there, even in a trice,is Swarupam. This is  
called as Silence. I am Swarupam.The world is Swarupam. Isvara is Swarupam.  
All are Siva-Swarupam."   
As Subramanian.R garu says,   
There is an elephant in the forest.The elephant is scared about the Lion in  
the forest.The Lion has not appeared before the elephant in recent times. It  
was once sighted and the elephant became totally afraid of lion. One night,  
the elephant dreamt of the Lion, it got scared even its dream about the Lion.  
It woke up with a huge cry.There was not Lion. Only it was there. The elephant  
got self realized.   
All are dreams. But unlike the elephant's dream, our dream about Bhagavan  
Ramana is a pleasant dream. But this dream should also end one day, when you  
would really wake up.That waking is the realization.

Long time ago I heard one pravachanam where it was told, we can take Hanuman  
like our guru. All the jivas are like Sita. We have to go to Ram. He is the  
Paramathman. With the help of Hanuman i.e. guru all jivas can attain  
Paramathman.
