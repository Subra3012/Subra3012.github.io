Sharing this article from merinews: When you save your environment, you save the future of mankind.   
Gone are the days of clear blue sky, chirping birds, pure water streams,  
limpid sunshine, today, these are all just locked in our fantasy books.  
Courtesy- Mankind, for the continued active efforts to have made earth the  
place it is today!   
Do you care when you see the no-more-blue-sky, are you scared to drink the no-  
more-pure water, annoyed of the honking of vehicles, has depletion of ozone  
layer bothered you any day, are u anxious to embrace the bright sunshine  
again? Many luxuries have overridden the importance of our natural habitat -  
The environment. Before we take the final step on the ladder of causing the  
repeated damage, let us hold on for sometime and think, take your steps back  
people, save the environment and save the future of mankind. Because the  
breaking news is : There's just one planet we can live on.   
When our planet 'Earth' is facing huge environment challenges, it is our duty  
to undo the damage, we have inflicted on our home 'the earth'. We, each one of  
us, needs to take on the baton and save our planet. It is a call for sincere  
accountability and responsibility on every one's part, let's save our home,  
together.   
June 5, calls for World Environment day every year to stimulate awareness  
across the world on environment issues, this year, United Nations urged the  
world to take corrective measures to fight for change in the climate and put a  
check on improved management of forests and green land. The theme for year  
2009 is 'Your planet needs you - Fight to combat climate change'.   
One might debate over the environment issues and measures to preserve it but  
maybe it deserves a bit more respect than mankind has bestowed upon it so far.   
Question yourself-   
What can we do to preserve environment?   
Do we keep a check on every action that might hamper our natural habitat?   
Do we ever to restore what we have destroyed?   
Can we raise awareness around?   
Its not a favour, its our responsibility towards our own planet.   
Om Shanti. ..
