## After realisation....

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
There are lots and lots of poems written by saints, who have realised souls.  
Sometimes they say, every thing is brahma and there is only one soul.   
And they say, there is no difference in between atma and paramathma. But same  
saints sing about paramathma as if He is separated from them.   
Here it looks like they are singing about themselves. Is not it? For me I  
always feel He is separated from me and I have to feel within me (even though  
it is not correct according to the scriptures and Bhagavan.) But they were  
realised souls.   
Your comments please

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Why should saints like Manikkavachagar, Jnaneswar and   
Bhagavan Ramana were all already self-realized. They were   
ever in Bliss of the Self. All the poems they sang and all   
the verses they composed, at dual level, were for the   
sake of others. Why should Manikkavachagar sing: "I   
am not telling your names, I am not plucking flowers and   
making garlands, I am not offering you Prasadam..."   
Why should he do? He was Siva Himself. But it is for the   
sake of people like us. Jnanadeswar sang thousands of   
abhangams. It is all for us. Bhagavan Ramana sings in   
Akshara Mana Malai: "Let me not wither like creeper,   
without your support! Please be my support!" All these are for us. They have  
no need to pray at all. They have sung for the welfare of others who trust  
God, and want to pray to him. Sankara has also composed many such wonderful  
poems.   
One Azhwar says: "I do not want even Vaikuntam. Let   
me a stone slab in your sanctoum sanctorum and be looking   
your coral like lips" This is towards Venkatesa of Tirupathi.   
All their crying, shedding tears, melting are only for us.   
Arunachala Siva.

It only appears in our eyes, that they are singing about themselves for we are  
still unrealised. But for a Jnani, it will be nothing at all. He is always in  
blissful inaction. Only for us, who are still unrealised itseems like this. It  
is said in scriptures, that once realised, a jnani will remain like an  
ordinary person but he will be in supreme bliss but we are in the world of  
thoughts and they are thoughtless.   
Sri Ramana

I just modified my front page. Took out a few things. Ive notice this in the  
past as well. I have my default photo and the top menu as well as the main  
menu on the left side. However my main article info doesnt start until below  
the main page and log in info. For some reason my page is being pushed down  
below that. Is the main menu and the log in section causing the problem some  
how? How do I tell?   
Thank you,

Sharing this article from merinews: When you save your environment, you save the future of mankind.   
Gone are the days of clear blue sky, chirping birds, pure water streams,  
limpid sunshine, today, these are all just locked in our fantasy books.  
Courtesy- Mankind, for the continued active efforts to have made earth the  
place it is today!   
Do you care when you see the no-more-blue-sky, are you scared to drink the no-  
more-pure water, annoyed of the honking of vehicles, has depletion of ozone  
layer bothered you any day, are u anxious to embrace the bright sunshine  
again? Many luxuries have overridden the importance of our natural habitat -  
The environment. Before we take the final step on the ladder of causing the  
repeated damage, let us hold on for sometime and think, take your steps back  
people, save the environment and save the future of mankind. Because the  
breaking news is : There's just one planet we can live on.   
When our planet 'Earth' is facing huge environment challenges, it is our duty  
to undo the damage, we have inflicted on our home 'the earth'. We, each one of  
us, needs to take on the baton and save our planet. It is a call for sincere  
accountability and responsibility on every one's part, let's save our home,  
together.   
June 5, calls for World Environment day every year to stimulate awareness  
across the world on environment issues, this year, United Nations urged the  
world to take corrective measures to fight for change in the climate and put a  
check on improved management of forests and green land. The theme for year  
2009 is 'Your planet needs you - Fight to combat climate change'.   
One might debate over the environment issues and measures to preserve it but  
maybe it deserves a bit more respect than mankind has bestowed upon it so far.   
Question yourself-   
What can we do to preserve environment?   
Do we keep a check on every action that might hamper our natural habitat?   
Do we ever to restore what we have destroyed?   
Can we raise awareness around?   
Its not a favour, its our responsibility towards our own planet.   
Om Shanti. ..
