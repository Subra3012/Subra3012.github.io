## Six types of strength, bala.  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 21, 2009, 09:52:52 AM

Last evening one discourser said that anyone needs six   
strengths or balas to perform the correct pujas.   
The first is deha-bala, the strength of the body. A person   
having problems in knee, legs, back cannot sit for, say,   
two hours, to do a Siva Puja or Lakshmi puja. He becomes   
restless with pain and has to get up.   
The second is dana-bala, the strength of money. He should   
have enough money to purchase a good quantity of jasmine,   
lotuses, roses, bhilva and tulsi, sandal paste, camphor, ghee for lamps, nice  
tasty food for offering to god. A pauper cannot   
do all these.   
The third is samskara-bala. He should have good lineage,   
good parentage, particular family practices, to do a particular puja. I cannot  
go to mosque and peform namaz five times   
a day. A Sri Vaishnavite is not allowed to do Siva puja and   
a Saivite, Lakshmi puja elaborately at home.   
The fourth is Vidya-bala. He should know the 1008 names   
of god, and pronounce them correctly. He should know   
details of poorvanga puja, kara nyasa, mudras, etc., It   
is not always possible.   
The fifth is samsara-bala. He should have an understanding wife or a son or a  
daughter, to assist such practices.   
The sixth is Jnana-bala. Even one does the puja, unless   
he knows the purport of the puja and the inner meaning   
of mantras and rituals, he will not benefit from them in   
most of the cases, even though mantras, when correctly   
pronounced, produce results like Gayatri mantra.   
That is why Krishna says, one flower, one fruit, one leaf,   
or some water will be adequate when done with true   
bhavana and concentration. Bhagavan Ramana says,   
Atma Nishta is the best devotion to god.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The First Birth Anniversary - 19th May 2009

Today, on 19th May 2009, this Ramana-child is celebrating   
its first birth anniversary in the Forum. It has been fed by   
hundreds of cups [posts] of nectarine milk by other members   
and it has also given them hundreds of cups [posts] of nectarine   
milk.   
I should first of all, thank Graham Boyd, the Adminstrator,   
for giving this nice opportunity to share the glory of Bhagavan   
Ramana.   
There were hurdles, many of them. There were frequent un-   
scheduled power cuts, low voltage problems, (I fixed an UPS   
only about 2 months back), doorbell ringing, telephone line   
ringing, unwanted guests who were speaking for 2 hours about   
the price increase of brinjals. I needed enormous patience, which Bhagavan  
Ramana gave.   
There were challenges. Difficult posts to think about. Diehard   
arguments with people like 'avatara' and 'mai chop gohok', who   
were finding that Sri Ramanasramam is full of rituals and no   
advaita, and that animals have no mind, and even idiots look   
like Jnanis.   
There were pleasant exchanges. Some friends gave newer   
insights. Some like David Godman, Dr. Raju, srkudai, varadharajan,  
rajasmanian from Singapore, karthikeyan. M,   
even corresponded with me outside the Forum. I cherish their   
brotherhood.   
In retrospect, I find that this could be one form of Sadhana, or   
it could even be an ego's daily mischieves. But Bhagavan Ramana knows really  
what it is.   
There were good serial posts, which I would like to preserve.   
1\. Tiruvembavai and TirupaLLi Ezhuchi in Dec 2008.   
2\. Upadesa Saram serial which srkudai started, also contributed by Dr. Raju  
and me with some anecdotes of Bhagavan, for each   
verse.   
3\. Miracles Do Happen serial. This will continue.   
4\. Back and forth correspondence on vasanas and thoughts   
for which I studied GVK and Padamalai in good detail.   
5\. Mountain Path stories.   
6\. The heart rending life of Mahalakshmi Amma.   
7\. Posts on Gaudapada Karika of Mandukya Upanishad,   
 (I think this has been pruned by Graham Boyd.)   
8\. My Tiruvannamalai darshan experiences. Bhagavan Ramana   
called me five times to Tiruvannamalai, between May 2008   
and May 2009.   
I bought many new books and existing ones I re-read them   
more thoroughly. This is definitely a fruit of Sadhana.   
Now, what next? I do not really know. If Bhagavan Ramana   
wills me to write further, I shall write. If Bhagavan Ramana   
will be to reduce the posts, I shall. If Bhagavan Ramana wills   
me to stop, I shall stop.   
I was roaming about with fools who do not know the path   
 of liberation.   
You gave me bhakti, and severed all my fruits of past karma.   
You cut off the three impurities, ego, kanma and maya, You   
 took over me and made me Sivam.   
O Father! Who else can get this grace, how can I describe?   
 Acho!   
 \- Tiruvachakam, Acho Padigam, verse 1.   
 (Decad on Acho, i.e my marvelling)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
I am only a human being, perhaps Tamil brahmin by birth,   
of Smartha subsect, which follows advaita. The knowledge   
of Tamil came from my father. I developed it further. My   
knowledge of English is quite limited, my Sanskrit is rank   
bad and low. Whatever has been given to me is Bhagavan's   
gift and whatever I have not got is what I have not acquired,   
due to my karma. I do not even perform the duties of a brahmin, fully since I  
do not know much about rituals.   
Arunachala Siva.
