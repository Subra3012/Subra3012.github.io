## Bisleri water everywhere. .. but is any of it fit to drink

There are many brands of bottled water in India and there have probably been  
just as many scandals as there are brands.   
For the past five years I have been purchasing Bisleri in the plastic 12 litre  
and now 10 litre cans at the rate of four or five per week here in  
Tiruvannamalai.   
In previous years there would occasionally be a bad one, but the last 12  
months has been exceptional in that the rate of bad and/or stinking water has  
grown from perhaps 2% five years ago to a minimum of 50% and sometimes even  
reaches 100% today.   
Is this surprising for a company that prides itself on its green credentials  
and advertises that it cares about its products. Being located in India the  
answer is unfortunately 'no'.   
I have lodged complaints for the past six months with no response, let alone  
change and the problem continues to get worse. Bisleri clearly does not care  
about its products.   
So my advice is to avoid Bisleri at all costs until such time as this company  
sorts its problems out and delivers what it promises rather than the pack of  
lies it is delivering at the moment.

Dear Sri Graham,   
My wife prepares hot water and cools it in room temperature, without placing  
that in refrigerator and our family drink only that.\   
All brands of mineral waters are waters packed in plastic containers. No  
brand is supplying pure water.   
Arunachala Siva.

Graham,   
Sorry but i have doubt here also.   
By 12 liters, do you mean the cans supplied to houses? And what about 1  
litre water bottles that are sold opp. to Ramansramam?   
I heard antoher notion that the shopkeepers or intermediate vendors just fill  
river water and supply those plastic cans to houses, not just bisleri band to  
be blamed. Even in Bangalore AquaGuard plastic cans have issues atleast as I  
know.   
Best way is to finish this adulterated janma and attain permanent liberation.
