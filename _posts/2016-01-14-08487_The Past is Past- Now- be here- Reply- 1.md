All the books on this Series, have philosophical format. The first chapter is  
a short history of the   
philosopher's life. The second chapter is an overview of what will follow.  
Then come chapters on   
epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, spiritual practices, jivan mukti, and an  
evaluation vis a vis the   
philosopher being covered.   
What an incredible time I had writing the book. From Sri Ramana Maharshi's  
perspective, there   
is no teacher, no taught, no birth, no death, no enlightened individual, no  
unenlightened individual,   
no path to enlightenment, there is no knower, no known, and no means of  
knowledge. Obviously   
Sri Ramana was not a philosopher in the traditional sense of the word.   
As Sri Ramana said, 'I was indeed fortunate that I never took to philosophy.  
Had I taken to it, I   
would probably nowhere, but my inherent tendencies led to directly to inquire,  
'Who am I?'   
How fortunate!' What is astonishing is Sri Ramana's teachings emerged  
spontaneously as the fruit of   
his Great Awakening and only subsequently, almost by accident, did He learn of  
the ancient Upanishadic   
and philosophical teachings. Even more astounding is that His words are  
almost, word for word, identical   
with those found in the Scriptures.
