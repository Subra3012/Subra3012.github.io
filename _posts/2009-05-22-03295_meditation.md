## Why need six strengths for puja, bala?

We have seen how Purandara Dasa said about the six   
strengths for puja and why should one waste time on   
all these? Saint Manikkavachagar, says in TirupaLLi   
Ezhuchhi, the song that is sung along with Tirvuembavai   
in the month of Margasirsha. He says only your body, and   
a good musical instrument is needed, at best.   
He sings: [In the temple]   
People with veena or yazh are singing on the one side.   
People say prayers in Rig Veda and Tamil Stotras.   
People keep their folded flowerlike hands and pray to you on one side.   
People are prostrating, weeping and melting on the one side.   
You have also taken charge of me and ruled me,   
[who does not do any of these]   
O Siva of Tiruperundurai!   
O my Master, please wake up and bless us!   
Arunachala Siva.

Is it good to meditate when our mind is got disturbed or just sit and watch  
how we are suffering and feeling low.   
Is this way Bhagavan teach us means just watch the mind instead of  
doingmediate?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana said that meditation for a fixed time,   
is good in the beginning. In due course, one can increase   
the time depending upon his work. At a mature stage, the   
meditation will become permanent amidst work and other   
demands. Disturbance through the thoughts can come   
at anytime, when one mediates or not. The suggestion   
is to bring back the mind, with one thought say, a nama   
of god, like showing some grass to the wayward bull   
and bringing it back to the shed.   
Arunachala Siva.
