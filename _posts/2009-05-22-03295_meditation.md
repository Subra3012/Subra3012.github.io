## Six types of strength, bala.

Last evening one discourser said that anyone needs six   
strengths or balas to perform the correct pujas.   
The first is deha-bala, the strength of the body. A person   
having problems in knee, legs, back cannot sit for, say,   
two hours, to do a Siva Puja or Lakshmi puja. He becomes   
restless with pain and has to get up.   
The second is dana-bala, the strength of money. He should   
have enough money to purchase a good quantity of jasmine,   
lotuses, roses, bhilva and tulsi, sandal paste, camphor, ghee for lamps, nice  
tasty food for offering to god. A pauper cannot   
do all these.   
The third is samskara-bala. He should have good lineage,   
good parentage, particular family practices, to do a particular puja. I cannot  
go to mosque and peform namaz five times   
a day. A Sri Vaishnavite is not allowed to do Siva puja and   
a Saivite, Lakshmi puja elaborately at home.   
The fourth is Vidya-bala. He should know the 1008 names   
of god, and pronounce them correctly. He should know   
details of poorvanga puja, kara nyasa, mudras, etc., It   
is not always possible.   
The fifth is samsara-bala. He should have an understanding wife or a son or a  
daughter, to assist such practices.   
The sixth is Jnana-bala. Even one does the puja, unless   
he knows the purport of the puja and the inner meaning   
of mantras and rituals, he will not benefit from them in   
most of the cases, even though mantras, when correctly   
pronounced, produce results like Gayatri mantra.   
That is why Krishna says, one flower, one fruit, one leaf,   
or some water will be adequate when done with true   
bhavana and concentration. Bhagavan Ramana says,   
Atma Nishta is the best devotion to god.   
Arunachala Siva.

Is it good to meditate when our mind is got disturbed or just sit and watch  
how we are suffering and feeling low.   
Is this way Bhagavan teach us means just watch the mind instead of  
doingmediate?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana said that meditation for a fixed time,   
is good in the beginning. In due course, one can increase   
the time depending upon his work. At a mature stage, the   
meditation will become permanent amidst work and other   
demands. Disturbance through the thoughts can come   
at anytime, when one mediates or not. The suggestion   
is to bring back the mind, with one thought say, a nama   
of god, like showing some grass to the wayward bull   
and bringing it back to the shed.   
Arunachala Siva.
