## Enlightenment and Saintliness  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 12, 2009, 01:30:12 PM  
---  
David Godman, in one of his talks with some Westerner has   
said that it is quite rare to witness a person like Bhagavan   
Ramana who is both enlightened and saintly.   
I also agree with him. There are only two in my view where   
both saintliness and enlightenment were together. One is   
Bhagavan Ramana and the other is Chandrasekhara Saraswati   
of Kanchi Math. Both were extraordinary.   
There are many people who were enlightened but not   
saintly, at least, in outward behaviour. Seshadri Swamigal   
and earlier Kaduveli Siddhar [about whom I wrote] were   
such types.   
There are many who are saintly in their disposition but not   
self-enlightened. There are numerous examples which I   
do not want to quote here.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is saintly? Where do you place Sri Ramakrishna?

SRK is no doubt enlightened. But regarding his saintliness,   
he was somewhere between Ramana and Seshadri Swami.   
Certain of his practices were causing embarassment for   
the devotees/rare visitors. One should also conform to   
the culture of the times, is it not? Do not ask what is culture? Today saints  
are wearing trousers and T shirts. They grow a long beard to look saintly.  
They distribute their face engraved   
lockets and bracelets. They always keep a fire near their   
seat as if they are effulgence itself. But Ramana and Ramakrishna were not  
overstepping the culture of their   
times. Both tolerated casteism. Both did not wear tweed   
trousers and coats. Remember British had already landed   
in India during their times.   
Arunachala Siva.

What about Avadutas like Sadasiva brahmendral.   
In the same way, Sri Ananda Mayi ma. She got married in her early stage but  
she was enlightened. She was a saint even though she got married.   
She came to have darshan of Bhagavan with Yogananda. There is a photograph of  
3 holi people. But Bhagavan is exceptional. All others shed their   
mortal body in different manner but there was no shooting star in the skay. We  
are this much fortunate to take birth in the same land of Bhagavan   
of course Bhagavan does not have any terriory. He is everywhere.   
They say while leaving this mortal body, it can be noticed how we lived in  
this life. The prana should go URDHUVA GATHI. I pray as Namazhlvar

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The need for chanting God's name is that it will always   
be with us, become part of our thought, so that at death   
he can chant that name and attain liberation. Unless   
one constantly practices the chanting during his healthy   
years, it may be difficult. Nammazhwar is noted for   
such splendid songs. One fellow had three sons. They   
and his wife were standing near the death bed. The   
wife says: Please say Narayana. The old hag says: Please   
wait. He calls the first son to go and collect the dues from   
a neigbour! The wife says: Narayana. That chap says: Wait. He calls the second son to go and pick up the rice   
bags from the godown since it might rain! The wife pursues   
"Please say Narayana." He calls the third son for some other   
job. Yama said: "I gave you three chances. You did not   
listen. Now let me do my job." The old fellow died!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
But Ajamilan was very lucky. At the last moment he called his son, Narayana,  
and died. Duthas came from Vaikund and took him to Vaikund even though   
he was a sinner. Same time duthas came from yamas, and not allowed to take  
Ajamilan but they were not allowed to take him as because he uttered   
Narayana. They say God is that much kind and He always ready to shower His  
grace. Bhagavan Ramana also moved and shed tears when He was   
narating the stories to His devotees. Here He himself is god and shed tears.  
Like Rama and Krishna how acted in their period.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "Grace is always there, ever   
flowing. But one should bring vessel to take it." Vessel   
here means a clear mind. If the vessel is large, then the   
Grace is also large. If we take a small tumbler, we will   
take only a tumbler-ful of Grace. Muruganar and Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Muni and others went with a very large vessel,   
like the olden-day boilers. Paul Brunton took a large vessel,   
no doubt, but he dropped the nectar on the way!   
Arunachala Siva.
