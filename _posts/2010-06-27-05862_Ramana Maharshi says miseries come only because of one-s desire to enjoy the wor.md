**The boat may remain in water, but if water enters the boat it will bring  
great catastrophe. [Likewise] a man may live in the world, but if the world  
enters [the mind of] the man the whole life will be miserable.**   
 **Sri Muruganar** : It is not the world itself but only the attachment  
towards the world which constitutes samsara-bandha [the bondage of mundane  
existence]. Attachment is caused by the mind, and not by what is outside. No  
harm will befall one by ones merely living in the world; **but all miseries  
come into existence only because of ones desire to enjoy the world.**

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar also says these ideas in his Padamalai: Verse 895: The Jivas' habit of wandering and struggling on many   
paths and attaining liberation arises from the delusion of bondage.   
Verse 548: If bondage and liberation are creations of the mind,   
all the experiences and states manifested through 'suttarivu' are   
likewise concepts.   
Verse 2205: The origin of the concepts of bondage and liberation   
is in the ego, the deception that is the cause of the pairs of opposites  
[dwandha buddhi].   
Verse 475: The ego alone is bondage, and one's own swarupam,   
free of the contagion of the ego, is liberation.   
Verse 2877: There is no greater deception than [believing that]   
liberation, which is ever present as one's own nature, will be attained at  
some later stage.   
Verse 2292: In relationships with the world, any attitude other than   
indifference [udaseena] will only lead to suffering.   
Talks No. 653 reads as under:- (part)   
Question: We are told to practice indifference [udaseena] which is   
possible only if the world is unreal?   
Bhagavan: Yes. "Oudasinyam abhipsitam". Indifference is advised.   
But what is it? It is absence of love and hatred. When you realize   
the Self on which the these phenomena pass, will you love or hate   
them? That is the meaning of indifference.   
Arunachala Siva.
