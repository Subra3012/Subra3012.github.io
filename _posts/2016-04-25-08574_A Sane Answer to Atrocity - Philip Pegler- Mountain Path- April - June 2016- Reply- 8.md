We cannot predict what will happen when we finally stop resisting the forward  
thrust of living, because   
our surroundings and everyone we meet are affected differently by what we do  
and have their own freedom   
of choice to respond to our behavior. Anyway we obviously do not live in  
isolation but truly belong to one another. Life is indivisible because  
everything is inter-related, and plainly there can be only be one totality.   
The desperate tragedy of modernity is the essential fact that human beings are  
an inescapable part of reality   
\-- and yet we do not realize their innate solidarity and suffer accordingly  
from the unremitting and un-   
acknowledged anguish that only the sense of separation from wholeness of being  
can bring.   
The most important thing to remember is that we never need be afraid. Life is  
pure in essence and benign   
in purpose. How could the mysterious and mighty power, which created the  
universe, be other than   
supremely beneficent? Once we realize this, we are set free to become  
informed by mercy as we play a part   
in the unfolding of a more subtle and wondrous plan than anyone can envisage.  
It is an unobtrusive way of   
service to the wider community in a world entrancing in beauty but overwhelmed  
by strife and sorrow.   
Then all will be well with us, but we need not imagine that our personal life  
will somehow end there or   
cease to unfold. Not at all -- it will continue to be just the way it is, but  
now we shall view it differently   
as the mystery of the unknown. It is a profound mystery about which we may  
never cease to wonder,   
even as we gain confidence to explore it in awe and delight \-- more wide  
awake than before, but less   
heedless and more responsive to the stark challenges we face.   
There is always work to be done - the noble work of unassuming goodness \-  
and it is within the scope of   
almost everyone to contribute in this way as best as they can. Furthermore,  
it is always this moment --   
the task immediately at hand -- that claims our attention. For every single  
person in each living moment,   
there is no other placed but here - and no time like the present. We are  
already living in eternity. It is   
certainly an uncomfortable paradox, but the best way to save the world is to  
realize, that at the most   
profound level, the world does not really need to be saved.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
