## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious  
life." You both are helping all of us to better understand our Guru's  
teachings. Thanks!   
Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to  
communicate with His devotees, if any. I am specialy interested in this matter  
and would appreciate any help all of you can do. Yours in Bhagavans' grace,  
Sebastian.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

Nandu   
That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (

In Ramana's teaching, one uses questioning in order to free oneself of false  
concepts about who we really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept,  
but freedom from the false assumptions which we usually function under. It is  
like the old analogy of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is  
nothing left. So what we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we  
may experience reality as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

In Ramana's teaching, one uses questioning in order to free oneself of false  
concepts about who we really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept,  
but freedom from the false assumptions which we usually function under. It is  
like the old analogy of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is  
nothing left. So what we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we  
may experience reality as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an

At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious

Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to

and would appreciate any help all of you can do. Yours in Bhagavans' grace,

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment

It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas

at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious  
life." You both are helping all of us to better understand our Guru's  
teachings. Thanks!   
Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to  
communicate with His devotees, if any. I am specialy interested in this matter  
and would appreciate any help all of you can do. Yours in Bhagavans' grace,  
Sebastian.   
Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

Nandu   
That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.

A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

Nandu   
That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

Nandu   
That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.   
Greetings

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious

Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings   
Hameed

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious

teachings. Thanks!   
Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to  
communicate with His devotees, if any. I am specialy interested in this matter  
and would appreciate any help all of you can do. Yours in Bhagavans' grace,

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

Nandu   
That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!

goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada   
Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.   
Greetings

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff  
Author: dedhed              Date: February 12, 2007, 02:53:21 AM

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He

he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,

personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be

that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same

come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.

## Practical Stuff

I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or

He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He

there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.
