Please see pravachanam of **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami Garu** in **telugu**  
for Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram in the below link.

 **Source** : http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sri_Dakshinamurthy_Stotram   
Translated by P.R.Ramachander   
Adhi Sankara has written very many great Stotras (prayers) but here is a  
unique prayer, which is not only a prayer but the summary of all the  
philosophy that he has taught. Even during his time, this stotra was difficult  
to comprehend and it became necessary for one of his disciples,  
Sureshwaracharya to write a commentary called Manasollasa to this stotra.  
There are large number of books and commentaries on this commentary itself.   
Mouna Vyakhya prakatitha, para,   
Brahma thathwam yuvanam,   
Varshishtha anthevasad rishiganai,   
Ravrutham brahma nishtai,   
Acharyendram kara kalihtha chin,   
Mudram ananda roopam,   
Swathmaramam mudhitha vadanam,   
Dakshinamurthim eede.   
I praise and salute that Dakshinamrthy,   
Who faces the south,   
Who explains the true nature of the supreme Brahman,   
Through his state of silence,   
Who is young in looks,   
Who is surrounded by disciples who are old Sages,   
Whose minds are fixed on Brahman,   
Who is the greatest of teachers,   
Who shows the Chinmudhra by his hand,   
Who is personification of happiness,   
Who is in the state of extreme joy within himself,   
And who has a smiling face.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Dumb people should have also  
have become gurus if by silence only doubts get eradicated. So it means we  
need to listen carefully in silent mind without having any other thoughts and  
do sravanam,mananam and nidhidyasanam by concentration.** As time is dependent  
on him so it means he looks young.   
Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram was first told to Sanaka,Sanatana,  
Sanandana,Sanatkumara who are the sons of Lord Brahma By Lord  
shiva(Dakshinamurthy).Adi Guru from which gnana started by  
Dakshinamurthy(Siva). **Please note that Gnana is never created and gnana is  
eternal.** Example: Even before newton discovered our earth is having  
gravitational force and only newton discovered it and not invented.   
In Hand as known thumb finger is very important and base and other four  
fingers have no power without thumb finger.   
 **In our hand the middle,ring and little fingers represent walking,dream,deep  
sleep states. 4th finger(Index Finger) i.e pointing finger represents  
ego(jiva).When we obverse jiva always tries to be close with the other 3  
fingers but not with thumb finger.   
Chinmudra means hand gesture in which the first finger is kept at the root of  
the thumb, the last three fingers are unfolded which means jiva mixes with  
thumb finger which is paramatma as thumb finger is required for any operation  
with hand.**   
Below article gives more information about Chin Mudra.   
http://www.hathayoga.co.za/mudras.htm   
 **Chin Mudra**   
 **This gesture symbolises the connected nature of human consciousness. The  
circle formed by the index finger and thumb represents the true goal of yoga  
â the merging of the individual soul with the universal soul, or the soul of  
God. The nail of the index finger is placed into the first joint of the  
thumb.** The last three fingers always face down towards the earth in this  
mudra. It is a gesture of receiving. When the finger touches the thumb a  
circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into  
the environment to travel back into the body, and up to the brain.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Vedanta is for one who thinks he is bound and  
no age,sex factors come into consideration.   
In dreams even though there is no external light,sun,moon and though we close  
our eyes we are still seeing our dream by our own light(chaitanyam).We are not  
the body also we are only observer of the body but not the body as we observe  
our body growing old etc...

Similar to the image of a town as seen in the mirror,   
When one sees the image of the world within him,   
 **The world appears as if it is outside.   
It is similar to his seeing due to illusion,   
During the state of sleep,   
That the one real fact appears as many different truths,   
And he realizes,when he wakes up and sees the reality,   
That he is really the one and only one soul.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The above stanza tells us that the world which is outside us is same as our  
soul but we see them as different entities due to the veil of ignorance. As  
soon as we wake up, we realize that the dream is false and even while seeing  
our image in the mirror, we know that we are not seeing us in the mirror but  
our image. When we get knowledge from the guru we are in the wakeful state  
without the veil of ignorance.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Seeing two different things is not  
Duality(Dvaitam) but not having bhava that all beings are one and the same is  
Duality(Dvaitam).Here in this stanza sleep mentioned is dreams.In dreams we  
also dream relations,sorrows etc.If many pots are there to know all are made  
with mud then it is advaita else if we differentiate then it is dvaita.   
As known Ramana Maharshi said many times that walking state and dream state  
are same.   
 **As sundara chaitanya swami says,in dreams we create the world(drishti-  
srishti vada) but in waking state world is already created and we see the  
world.(srishti-drishti vada).everyone dreams are different but waking state is  
same to everyone.**   
 **But our mind is the same in dreams and waking states which is important.**  
So consciousness is our real nature.Knower,known and knowledge i.e subject and  
object are all false.   
Also our body and mind and five senses are also objects which is important as  
we are knowing about changes in our body and five senses. **As in deep sleep  
we are alive though there is no mind,body,world.**   
So world is in us rather than we in the world.   
Fore more details i suggest to read Adi Shankara's Drik Drusya Vivekam.

vivekam.html   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says in english "ok" means only krishna  
:-)**   
Beejasyanthari vankuro jagadhidham,

Like the germ inside the seed is its part,   
But becomes different after development   
The many places and time which are before us,   
Are drawn by illusion in the board of life in a peculiar manner,   
By a great savant or an expert Siddha,   
Who can create them as per their will,   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
When the net of illusion is lifted and when we reach the stage of  
manifestation, we would find that what we think as different is but one and  
the same.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says with Dakshinamurthy Stotram we  
are clear that time and space are not real and hence we cannot accept creation  
has been done in 7 or 6 or N number of days and that god created water on  
first day etc etc..Also it seems it was written in that book that god was not  
clear which he has created in the first 3 days and hence he was ensuring  
again.6th day it seems that god created sun.It is false theory as without sun  
if do we know that 5 days are passed? These theories and those books and  
followers are blind and wrong as known time and space are not real.Person who  
are intelligent will not believe in these false theroies.Also it seems that it  
was written that people who don 't believe will go to hell which is again  
false propaganda.**   
Because though all religions accept god is creator but no one clearly tells  
what is the material with which he created no one knows. if we accept god  
created universe with some material like plastic then we need to accept  
plastic are there before only.   
 _But if we think who created our dreams so we are clear that only our mind is  
responsible for creation of dreams and waking states but we cannot accept  
srishti-drishti vada._   
Also we cannot accept that god is changing and he has been changed to world  
etc.Because we say it is only superimposition we are seeing like rope and  
snake.So only brahman only exists and nothing exists like explained above  
already chinmudra in our hand where thumb finger is seperate and not attached  
to any states.   
Even Einstein theory also says that time and space are relative.   
Yasyaiva sphuranam sadathmakamasath,

Yath saksht karanath bhavenna punara,   
Aavrithir bhavambhonidhow,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 4   
He who exists as the real light of truth,   
And shines in the false world of appearance,   
And He who teaches disciples the great saying,   
âThou art thatâ after realizing its import,   
Gets away from this cycle of life and death.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says âThou art thatâ is the brahmastram  
and ultimate weapon.In sanskrit it means "Tat Tvam Asi". In advaita it means  
absolute equality of 'tat', the Ultimate Reality, Brahman, and 'tvam', the  
individual self, jiva.   
Nanachidhra ghato dhara sthitha maha,   
Deepa prabha bhaswaram,   
Jnanam yasya thu chakshuradhi karana,

 **Like the light emanating from a lamp,   
Kept in a pot(kunda) with many holes,   
Goes out in all directions,   
Similarly In the person in whom the wisdom goes out   
Through the openings of ear, eye, mouth and thought,   
And when that person realizes that âI know myselfâ,   
This whole universe shines after Him alone,   
Who shines in the consciousness as the knower.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Our body prevents us from seeing the truth(the light from outside) that we are  
the Brahman and lets out light though the sensory organs and makes us deceive  
ourselves by feeling that we are happy.** This simile of a pot with holes for  
the body occurs in many places in Indian philosophy.   
 **Note** : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says who speaks spritiual technical  
terms like karma etc(edo naa karma sir ani aneevallu) without knowing meaning  
also is fine and we should never blame them.   
 **He blamed people who says all religions are same and he says people who  
tells these are one who donot know basics in religion.But he says everyone  
should live together peacefully.**   
Deham pranam api indryanyapi chalaam,   
Budhim cha soonyam vidhu,   
Stree balandha jadopamasthvaha mithi,   
Brandha brusam vadhina,   
Maya sakthi vilasa kalpitha maha,   
Vyamoha samharine,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 6   
Those great philosophers, who think that,   
The body, the soul and the fickle intellect,   
The concept of emptiness and all other nothingness,   
Are nothing but themselves,   
Are similar to the women children, blind and the ignorant.   
It is only He who can destroy, this veil of ignorance,   
And wake us up from this state of deceit.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **This is a sample of the approach of negation in identifying the truth about  
the concept of self. Senses, the body etc cannot be the absolute truth as they  
are transient.**   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami strictly condemns **Carvaka** school of  
thought.He questions that if body is really atma why does the dead body does  
not speak and why cannot we stop our death?   
In budhdism one sect called "kshanikha vignana vadam" means atma is only  
temporary means if i see a flower then i get flower knowledge and later once  
we forget flower then knowledge is given and so is atma.   
In budhdism another sect called "sunyavadam" where they believe that atma is  
sunyam like deep sleep where nothing remains.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya swami condenms all sects of buddhism though he tells  
that buddhism is better when compared to other religions.   
Rahu grastha divakarendu sadrusho,   
Maya samachadanath,   
Sanamthra karanopa samharanatho,   
Yo abhoot sushuptha pumaan,   
Pragaswapsaamithi prabodha samaye,   
Yaa prathyabignayathe,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 7   
Similar to the Sun when being masked by the serpent Rahu,   
Knows that it was existing, once the eclipse is over   
That man whose senses are suppressed   
When he is asleep,   
Because of the veil of illusion,   
Realizes that he was in the state of sleep,   
When he wakes up.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **Similar the sun existing even when there is eclipse, we exist when we are  
sleeping. This is denial of the Buddhist theory that, when we are asleep there  
is nothingness.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says to say we slept happily in deep sleep  
means we should have experienced it to say we slept happily so sunyam concept  
of Buddhist is denied completely.Therefore we are sat-chit-ananda as i am  
existing in all threee states i.e dream,deep sleep,waking state.Therefore i am  
witness of the 3 states.**   
 **Note : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says experience is not really required  
and only jnana is required which helps to eradicate ignorance.   
Our life is always with combination of questions and answers only.In our  
childhood our parents ask various questions like they ask us to recognise who  
is father,mother,pen...etc etc..   
Later we start asking questions like mother,where did father go outside? amma  
is food ready? or husband asks wife what is lunch today etc etc.**   
All our experiences are difference like we have diff experience when we lose  
our wealth and our experience is diff when we gain more health and our  
experience is diff when we fail in exams.But all these experiences are  
experienced by us.

Svathmaanam pragatikarothi bajatham,

Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 8   
 **Salutations to him who shines and exhibits,   
Himself by the beatific Chinmudhra of the hand,   
That he exists within the humans as self,   
Forever and non changing,   
Even during the changing states of childhood, youth and old age   
And even during the states of sleep, dream and wakefulness.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The truth as represented by the concept of Brahman, exists always.   
 **In dreams we have only bhokta and no kartha because it is only mind who  
dreams.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says one of the big scripture in the world is  
told in dreams by god.**   
Brahmins are called Shastri because he is the knower of Shastras.   
Viswam pasyathi karya karana thaya,   
Swa swami sambandatha,   
Sishyacharya thaya thadaiva pithru,   
Puthradhyathmana bedatha,   
Swapne Jagrathi va ya esha purusho,   
Maya Paribramitha,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 9   
 **The world sees as cause and effect,   
The differences between us and our lord,   
The distinction between teacher and the taught,   
The distinction between father and son,   
And so the man is confused by illusion,   
And believes in these differences,   
During the times of dream and wakefulness.**   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
The ignorance of the truth because of the veil of ignorance Maya is  
reemphasized.

Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 10   
To the sake of which supreme Brahman,   
The universe is shining as self,   
Which is Movable and immovable, with its aspects?   
Of water, fire, air, space,   
The sun, moon and the individual soul,   
And also to those who examine the truth behind,   
The meaning of this universe and find,   
That it Consists of nothing but,   
The God who is every where.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Sarvathmathvamithi sphutikruthamitham,   
Yasmadamushamin sthave,

Syadheeswarasthvam svatha,   
Siddhyeth thath punarashtadha parinatham,   
Chaisvaryamvayhatham., 11   
The concept of the Athma,   
Which is explained in this poem of praise,   
Hearing which, understanding which,   
Meditating which and singing which,   
One would attain the state of the godliness,   
And the great state of self realization,   
And also you would get the eight powers of occult,   
Without any problems in between.   
Appendix   
The following three stanzas as well as the first stanza are chanted after the  
main stotra:-   
Chitram Vata tharor mole vruddha,   
Sishya, Guror Yuva,   
Gurostu mounam vykhyanam,   
Sishyasthu china samsaya   
It is strange to see,   
The very old disciples,   
And the very young teacher,   
Who sit under a banyan tree,   
With the teacher always observing silence,   
And the students getting all the doubts cleared.   
Om nama pranavarthaya,   
Suddha jnanaika moorthaye nama,   
Nirmalaya prasanthaya,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the meaning of the pranava, âomâ,   
Who is the personification of unalloyed wisdom,   
Who is crystal clear in his thought,   
And who is the epitome of peace.   
Gurave sara lokaanam,   
Bishaje bhava roginaam,   
Nidhaye sarva vidhyanam,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the teacher of the entire world,   
Who is the doctor to those,   
Afflicted by the disease of birth and death,   
And who is the treasure hose of all knowledge.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Bhaja Govindam by Sri Shankaracharya - Part1  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 12, 2010, 08:29:14 AM

I request readers to view and listen Pravachanam By **Sri Sundara Chaitanya  
Swami in telugu.**   
There are totally 8 Volumes and in each volume there are totally 8 videos.   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BhajaGovindam+Volume1&aq=f   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Bhaja Govindam is also called Moha  
Mudgara.**   
Mudgara in sanskrit means hammer.   
So it is hammer that strikes at the illusion.so to conclude Bhaja Govindam  
will help us to eradicate ignorance.   
 _The first twelve slokas are called dwadasa manjarika sthotram as the first  
12 verses are told at a time.   
Because the first 13 verses are meant only for the old man who even at the age  
of 80 yrs is keen to study sanskrit grammer and not interested in devotion in  
god._   
The first 13 are told by Adi Shankara to the old man.while Adi Sankara recited  
the first 13 verses disciples who are there with him inspired by their guru  
and wrote each verse by themselves.So the next 14 verses are written by the 14  
disciples who are there nearby.So the next 14 are called Chaturdasa manjarika  
sthotram.   
Disciples then shown the verses to Adi Sankara and he was impressed and he  
himself wrote another 4 verses blesssing them.   
TEXT 1   
bhajagovindam bhajagovindam   
govindam bhajamuudhamate   
sampraapte sannihite kaale   
nahi nahi rakshati dukrijnkarane   
Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda. Oh fool! Rules of Grammar  
will not save you at the time of your death.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Govinda in telugu means "vakkulachee  
pondagaligee vaadu" means by learning/understanding vedas attain govinda.   
We recite govinda 2 times because govinda was written 2 times in Vishnu  
Sahasranamam.   
He says donot have raga dvesa regarding house,food etc by saying i want only  
icecream,house in hyd central etc.   
He says cloth jeans is not the means for liberation.   
TEXT 2   
mudha jahiihi dhanaagamatrishhnaam   
kuru sadbuddhim manasi vitrishhnaam   
yallabhase nijakarmopaattam   
vittam tena vinodaya chittam   
Oh fool! Give up your thirst to amass wealth, devote your mind to thoughts to  
the Real. Be content with what comes through actions already performed in the  
past.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Desire for wealth is most dangerous.   
He wonders why in telugu language we compare money with stone like we say "edo  
naalugu rallu venakesukundamani".   
Also greed for money is no ending as we say if i have say 50 croes i will be  
happy even though at the present moment we can always be happy but we keep on  
postpone it.   
He says us to think for a moment how a sanyasi feels confident,brave,bold even  
though he leaves his family,money,relatives and all his attachments but on the  
otherwide we householders though we have required money,children,father,mother  
but yet wont feel happy and secured and keeps complaining for one thing or  
other.   
TEXT 3   
naariistanabhara naabhiidesham   
drishhtvaa maagaamohaavesham   
etanmaamsaavasaadi vikaaram   
manasi vichintaya vaaram vaaram   
Do not get drowned in delusion by going wild with passions and lust by seeing  
a woman's navel and chest. Bodies are flesh, fat and blood. Do not fail to  
remember this again and again in your mind.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says householder duty is that wife and  
husband aim should be for moksha.Our body without skin is nothing but  
blood,flesh and fat.   
Dana,Daya,Dharmam are good if they go hand-in-hand with atma-jnana.   
TEXT 4   
naliniidalagata jalamatitaralam   
tadvajjiivitamatishayachapalam   
viddhi vyaadhyabhimaanagrastam   
lokam shokahatam cha samastam   
Uncertain is the life of man as rain drops on a lotus leaf. Know that the  
whole world remains a prey to disease, ego and grief.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says if we are really our body then we  
should get satisfaction if body needs get fulfilled.But in deep sleep there is  
no body/world/mind but we exist.   
So we are not the body.In dream we imagine another body and we imagine them to  
be real.   
Only just because we imagine "we are the body" we establish relations and have  
a family etc and go deep in illusion.   
so we are sat-chit-ananda.   
TEXT 5   
yaavadvittopaarjana saktah   
staavannija parivaaro raktah   
pashchaajjiivati jarjara dehe   
vaartaam koapi na prichchhati gehe   
So long as a man is fit and able to support his family, see the affection all  
those around him show. But no one at home cares to even have a word with him  
when his body totters due to old age.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says we can take a snap/photo of the flower  
but the smell of the flower cannot be taken in the photo.Similarly we can live  
together with other humans but cannot know what is there in their mind.   
Human beings buy dead hen,fish and other animals to eat but humans never sell  
dead body of other humans.For mrudangam instrutment animal skin is used.   
TEXT 6   
yaavatpavano nivasati dehe   
taavatprichchhati kushalam gehe   
gatavati vaayau dehaapaaye   
bhaaryaa bibhyati tasminkaaye   
When one is alive, his family members enquire kindly about his welfare. But  
when the soul departs from the body, even his wife runs away in fear of the  
corpse.   
TEXT 7   
baalastaavatkriidaasaktah   
tarunastaavattaruniisaktah   
vriddhastaavachchintaasaktah   
pare brahmani koapi na saktah   
Childhood is lost in play. Youth is lost by attachment to woman. Old age  
passes away by thinking over many past things. Alas! Hardly is there anyone  
who yearns to be lost in Parabrahman.   
TEXT 8   
kaate kaantaa kaste putrah   
samsaaro.ayamatiiva vichitrah   
kasya tvam kah kuta aayaatah   
tattvam chintaya tadiha bhraatah   
Who is your wife? Who is your son? Strange is this samsara. Of whom are you?  
Where have you come from? Brother, ponder over these truths.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says adi sankara in 1st verse told "O Fool"  
but here in verse 8 adi sankara kindly says kindly "brother".   
He said bhagavad gita was told by Lord Krishna who was a samsari and who  
listened was Arjuna who was a samsari and who has written bhagavad gita vyasa  
was also a samsari.   
So here lesson is not to think that we should not have samsaram but to  
understand it is not real.Samsara is related to mind but not to wife,children.   
TEXT 9   
satsangatve nissngatvam   
nissangatve nirmohatvam   
nirmohatve nishchalatattvam   
nishcalatattve jiivanmuktih   
From Satsanga comes non-attachment, from non-attachment comes freedom from  
delusion, which leads to self-settledness. From self-settledness comes Jivan  
Mukti(liberation).   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says peace of mind cannot be attained by mere  
money only.   
TEXT 10   
vayasigate kah kaamavikaarah   
shushhke niire kah kaasaarah   
kshiinevitte kah parivaarah   
gyaate tattve kah samsaarah   
What good is lust when youth has fled? What use is a lake which has no water?  
Where are the relatives when wealth is gone? Where is samsara (the  
continuaiton of birth and death) when the Truth is known?   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says lust will be there at max for 3-4 years  
in our life.   
In Srisailam it is called Dholi Darshanam because according to puranas kumari-  
swami left his father and mother and came to srisailam and his father/mother  
came there to see their son and because they are in huge affection so they  
does not care for formalities like cleaning their feet as they want to see  
their son ASAP.   
It also means in Srisailam god is waiting for us(devotees) to visit him and  
does not care for formalities as we are his sons/daughters.   
There are so many good activities(charity,teaching,sanyasam...) which can be  
done in our life but we must think what is good for us.Example: There are so  
many channels in TV today but with help of remote we usually keep channel  
which we like best.   
TEXT 11   
maa kuru dhana jana yauvana garvam   
harati nimeshhaatkaalah sarvam   
maayaamayamidamakhilaM hitvaa   
brahmapadaM tvaM pravisha viditvaa   
Do not boast of wealth, friends, and youth. Each one of these are destroyed  
within a minute. Free yourself from the illusion of the world of Maya and  
attain the timeless Truth.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami In Volume4 Part9 has sung a beautiful song on  
Chandra Bhagavan(Moon) comparing moon with Lord Krishna.   
TEXT 12   
dinayaaminyau saayam praatah   
shishiravasantau punaraayaatah   
kaalah kriidati gachchhatyaayuh   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaavaayuh   
Daylight and darkness, dusk and dawn, winter and spring time come and go. Time  
plays and life ebbs(A gradual decline) away. But the storm of desire never  
leaves.   
Moreover in Bhagavad Gita it is written   
Ch2 Text 70   
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires--that enter  
like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still--can  
alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says we all came here in this world for a  
short visa.   
TEXT 13   
dvaadashamajnjarikaabhirasheshhah   
kathito vaiyaakaranasyaishhah   
upadesho bhuudvidyaanipunaih   
shriimachchhankarabhagavachchharanarih   
This bouquet of twelve verses was imparted to a grammarian by the all-knowing  
Shankara, adored as the bhagavadpada.   
TEXT 14   
kaate kaantaa dhana gatachintaa   
vaatula kim tava naasti niyantaa   
trijagati sajjanasam gatiraikaa   
bhavati bhavaarnavatarane naukaa   
Oh mad man! Why this engrossment in thoughts of wealth? Is there no one to  
guide you? There is only one thing in three worlds that can save you from the  
ocean of samsara. Get into that boat of satsangha (knowledge of the Truth)  
quickly.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Sanyasis are of 3 types   
a) Kapata sanyasa   
b) Original sanyasa   
c) Sanyasi who has failed to live as perfect sanyasi.   
TEXT 15   
jatilo mundii lujnchhitakeshah   
kaashhaayaambarabahukritaveshhah   
pashyannapi cana pashyati muudhah   
udaranimittam bahukritaveshhah   
There are many who go with matted locks, many who have clean shaven heads,  
many whose hairs have been plucked out; some are clothed in saffron, yet  
others in various colors all just for a livelihood. Seeing truth revealed  
before them, still the foolish ones see it not.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Rotti Kashayam means "Otti Kashayam" as  
today we sanyasis are fake and only put kashaya simply for food.   
TEXT 16   
angam galitam palitam mundam   
dashanavihiinam jatam tundam   
vriddho yaati grihiitvaa dandam   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaapindam   
Strength has left the old man's body; his head has become bald, his gums  
toothless and leaning on crutches. Even then the attachment is strong and he  
clings firmly to fruitless hope.   
TEXT 17   
agre vahnih prishhthebhaanuh   
raatrau chubukasamarpitajaanuh   
karatalabhikshastarutalavaasah   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaapaashah   
Behold there lies the man who sits warming up his body with the fire in front  
and the sun at the back; at night he curls up the body to keep out of the  
cold; he eats his beggar's food from the bowl of his hand and sleeps beneath  
the tree. Still in his heart, he is a wretched puppet at the hands of  
passions.

The Verse 2 reminds me of Bhagavan Ramana's arrival to   
Tiruvannamalai and His subsequent activities. After embracing   
Aruanchaleswara in the Temple, He came out! A barber on his   
own asked Him whether He could have a tonsure. He said yes   
and had the tonsure. Then should one not take bath after hair   
cut or tonsure? He did not care. Suddenly unusual rains came   
and wetted Him. It was September 1 and the rains are even today   
unusual at this time. Then He removed His dhoti and tore a corner   
and wore it as a coupina. He did not keep the remaining dhoti   
for an alternate coupina for next day. He threw away all the coins   
that He had and the sweetmeats too. He had already left the relatives and  
mother and now the remaining possessions too.   
Thereafter, He never touched the money. It took more than   
20 years to build the Mother's Temple in the present form. But   
He never approved donations. He sat on a sofa given by a   
person, other wise He would have gladly sat on the floor. Nothing He asked  
for. Whatever came from others voluntarily, He took   
them as Arunachala's gift to Him. He abhorred costly gifts. He returned the  
sandal wood walking stick and also the costly pen   
given by devotees.   
The only thing He approved was Anna dhanam, and even for this, He never  
coerced anyone to give rice, dhal and vegetables. His life is graphic picture  
of Verse 2 of Bhaja Govindam.   
Arunachala Siva.

observe the following verses, also from Bhaja Govindam: punarapi jananam [yet again we are born] punarapi maranam [yet again we die]   
punarapi janani [yet again, in the mother's] jatare shayanam [womb, we sleep]   
iha samsare bahu dustare [this world is really very deceiving -- how can we go  
through the same experience again and again and yet think there some some  
novelty in it?], kripaya pahe pahe murare [please surrender to Sri Krishna]   
ratya charapata virachita kantah [his rags are the pieces of cloth thrown away  
by others on the roads]   
puny-apunya vivarjita pantah [he has left punya and papa (apunya) both]   
yogi yoga niyojita chittah [whose mind is resolved in complete union]   
ramate balah - unmata tav devah [and he revels as a child (kid) or like a mad  
man in the world]   
yoga ratho va [whether in yoga], bhoga ratho va [or in bhoga]   
sanga ratho va [whether in the company of othes - society], sanga viheena [or  
remaining alone, in noone's company]   
yasyah brahmani ramathe chittam [whose mind revels in Brahman]   
nandati nandati nandati eva [he is always in bliss]
