I request readers to view and listen Pravachanam By **Sri Sundara Chaitanya  
Swami in telugu.**   
There are totally 8 Volumes and in each volume there are totally 8 videos.   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BhajaGovindam+Volume1&aq=f   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Bhaja Govindam is also called Moha  
Mudgara.**   
Mudgara in sanskrit means hammer.   
So it is hammer that strikes at the illusion.so to conclude Bhaja Govindam  
will help us to eradicate ignorance.   
 _The first twelve slokas are called dwadasa manjarika sthotram as the first  
12 verses are told at a time.   
Because the first 13 verses are meant only for the old man who even at the age  
of 80 yrs is keen to study sanskrit grammer and not interested in devotion in  
god._   
The first 13 are told by Adi Shankara to the old man.while Adi Sankara recited  
the first 13 verses disciples who are there with him inspired by their guru  
and wrote each verse by themselves.So the next 14 verses are written by the 14  
disciples who are there nearby.So the next 14 are called Chaturdasa manjarika  
sthotram.   
Disciples then shown the verses to Adi Sankara and he was impressed and he  
himself wrote another 4 verses blesssing them.   
TEXT 1   
bhajagovindam bhajagovindam   
govindam bhajamuudhamate   
sampraapte sannihite kaale   
nahi nahi rakshati dukrijnkarane   
Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda. Oh fool! Rules of Grammar  
will not save you at the time of your death.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Govinda in telugu means "vakkulachee  
pondagaligee vaadu" means by learning/understanding vedas attain govinda.   
We recite govinda 2 times because govinda was written 2 times in Vishnu  
Sahasranamam.   
He says donot have raga dvesa regarding house,food etc by saying i want only  
icecream,house in hyd central etc.   
He says cloth jeans is not the means for liberation.   
TEXT 2   
mudha jahiihi dhanaagamatrishhnaam   
kuru sadbuddhim manasi vitrishhnaam   
yallabhase nijakarmopaattam   
vittam tena vinodaya chittam   
Oh fool! Give up your thirst to amass wealth, devote your mind to thoughts to  
the Real. Be content with what comes through actions already performed in the  
past.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Desire for wealth is most dangerous.   
He wonders why in telugu language we compare money with stone like we say "edo  
naalugu rallu venakesukundamani".   
Also greed for money is no ending as we say if i have say 50 croes i will be  
happy even though at the present moment we can always be happy but we keep on  
postpone it.   
He says us to think for a moment how a sanyasi feels confident,brave,bold even  
though he leaves his family,money,relatives and all his attachments but on the  
otherwide we householders though we have required money,children,father,mother  
but yet wont feel happy and secured and keeps complaining for one thing or  
other.   
TEXT 3   
naariistanabhara naabhiidesham   
drishhtvaa maagaamohaavesham   
etanmaamsaavasaadi vikaaram   
manasi vichintaya vaaram vaaram   
Do not get drowned in delusion by going wild with passions and lust by seeing  
a woman's navel and chest. Bodies are flesh, fat and blood. Do not fail to  
remember this again and again in your mind.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says householder duty is that wife and  
husband aim should be for moksha.Our body without skin is nothing but  
blood,flesh and fat.   
Dana,Daya,Dharmam are good if they go hand-in-hand with atma-jnana.   
TEXT 4   
naliniidalagata jalamatitaralam   
tadvajjiivitamatishayachapalam   
viddhi vyaadhyabhimaanagrastam   
lokam shokahatam cha samastam   
Uncertain is the life of man as rain drops on a lotus leaf. Know that the  
whole world remains a prey to disease, ego and grief.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says if we are really our body then we  
should get satisfaction if body needs get fulfilled.But in deep sleep there is  
no body/world/mind but we exist.   
So we are not the body.In dream we imagine another body and we imagine them to  
be real.   
Only just because we imagine "we are the body" we establish relations and have  
a family etc and go deep in illusion.   
so we are sat-chit-ananda.   
TEXT 5   
yaavadvittopaarjana saktah   
staavannija parivaaro raktah   
pashchaajjiivati jarjara dehe   
vaartaam koapi na prichchhati gehe   
So long as a man is fit and able to support his family, see the affection all  
those around him show. But no one at home cares to even have a word with him  
when his body totters due to old age.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says we can take a snap/photo of the flower  
but the smell of the flower cannot be taken in the photo.Similarly we can live  
together with other humans but cannot know what is there in their mind.   
Human beings buy dead hen,fish and other animals to eat but humans never sell  
dead body of other humans.For mrudangam instrutment animal skin is used.   
TEXT 6   
yaavatpavano nivasati dehe   
taavatprichchhati kushalam gehe   
gatavati vaayau dehaapaaye   
bhaaryaa bibhyati tasminkaaye   
When one is alive, his family members enquire kindly about his welfare. But  
when the soul departs from the body, even his wife runs away in fear of the  
corpse.   
TEXT 7   
baalastaavatkriidaasaktah   
tarunastaavattaruniisaktah   
vriddhastaavachchintaasaktah   
pare brahmani koapi na saktah   
Childhood is lost in play. Youth is lost by attachment to woman. Old age  
passes away by thinking over many past things. Alas! Hardly is there anyone  
who yearns to be lost in Parabrahman.   
TEXT 8   
kaate kaantaa kaste putrah   
samsaaro.ayamatiiva vichitrah   
kasya tvam kah kuta aayaatah   
tattvam chintaya tadiha bhraatah   
Who is your wife? Who is your son? Strange is this samsara. Of whom are you?  
Where have you come from? Brother, ponder over these truths.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says adi sankara in 1st verse told "O Fool"  
but here in verse 8 adi sankara kindly says kindly "brother".   
He said bhagavad gita was told by Lord Krishna who was a samsari and who  
listened was Arjuna who was a samsari and who has written bhagavad gita vyasa  
was also a samsari.   
So here lesson is not to think that we should not have samsaram but to  
understand it is not real.Samsara is related to mind but not to wife,children.   
TEXT 9   
satsangatve nissngatvam   
nissangatve nirmohatvam   
nirmohatve nishchalatattvam   
nishcalatattve jiivanmuktih   
From Satsanga comes non-attachment, from non-attachment comes freedom from  
delusion, which leads to self-settledness. From self-settledness comes Jivan  
Mukti(liberation).   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says peace of mind cannot be attained by mere  
money only.   
TEXT 10   
vayasigate kah kaamavikaarah   
shushhke niire kah kaasaarah   
kshiinevitte kah parivaarah   
gyaate tattve kah samsaarah   
What good is lust when youth has fled? What use is a lake which has no water?  
Where are the relatives when wealth is gone? Where is samsara (the  
continuaiton of birth and death) when the Truth is known?   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says lust will be there at max for 3-4 years  
in our life.   
In Srisailam it is called Dholi Darshanam because according to puranas kumari-  
swami left his father and mother and came to srisailam and his father/mother  
came there to see their son and because they are in huge affection so they  
does not care for formalities like cleaning their feet as they want to see  
their son ASAP.   
It also means in Srisailam god is waiting for us(devotees) to visit him and  
does not care for formalities as we are his sons/daughters.   
There are so many good activities(charity,teaching,sanyasam...) which can be  
done in our life but we must think what is good for us.Example: There are so  
many channels in TV today but with help of remote we usually keep channel  
which we like best.   
TEXT 11   
maa kuru dhana jana yauvana garvam   
harati nimeshhaatkaalah sarvam   
maayaamayamidamakhilaM hitvaa   
brahmapadaM tvaM pravisha viditvaa   
Do not boast of wealth, friends, and youth. Each one of these are destroyed  
within a minute. Free yourself from the illusion of the world of Maya and  
attain the timeless Truth.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami In Volume4 Part9 has sung a beautiful song on  
Chandra Bhagavan(Moon) comparing moon with Lord Krishna.   
TEXT 12   
dinayaaminyau saayam praatah   
shishiravasantau punaraayaatah   
kaalah kriidati gachchhatyaayuh   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaavaayuh   
Daylight and darkness, dusk and dawn, winter and spring time come and go. Time  
plays and life ebbs(A gradual decline) away. But the storm of desire never  
leaves.   
Moreover in Bhagavad Gita it is written   
Ch2 Text 70   
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires--that enter  
like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still--can  
alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says we all came here in this world for a  
short visa.   
TEXT 13   
dvaadashamajnjarikaabhirasheshhah   
kathito vaiyaakaranasyaishhah   
upadesho bhuudvidyaanipunaih   
shriimachchhankarabhagavachchharanarih   
This bouquet of twelve verses was imparted to a grammarian by the all-knowing  
Shankara, adored as the bhagavadpada.   
TEXT 14   
kaate kaantaa dhana gatachintaa   
vaatula kim tava naasti niyantaa   
trijagati sajjanasam gatiraikaa   
bhavati bhavaarnavatarane naukaa   
Oh mad man! Why this engrossment in thoughts of wealth? Is there no one to  
guide you? There is only one thing in three worlds that can save you from the  
ocean of samsara. Get into that boat of satsangha (knowledge of the Truth)  
quickly.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Sanyasis are of 3 types   
a) Kapata sanyasa   
b) Original sanyasa   
c) Sanyasi who has failed to live as perfect sanyasi.   
TEXT 15   
jatilo mundii lujnchhitakeshah   
kaashhaayaambarabahukritaveshhah   
pashyannapi cana pashyati muudhah   
udaranimittam bahukritaveshhah   
There are many who go with matted locks, many who have clean shaven heads,  
many whose hairs have been plucked out; some are clothed in saffron, yet  
others in various colors all just for a livelihood. Seeing truth revealed  
before them, still the foolish ones see it not.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Rotti Kashayam means "Otti Kashayam" as  
today we sanyasis are fake and only put kashaya simply for food.   
TEXT 16   
angam galitam palitam mundam   
dashanavihiinam jatam tundam   
vriddho yaati grihiitvaa dandam   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaapindam   
Strength has left the old man's body; his head has become bald, his gums  
toothless and leaning on crutches. Even then the attachment is strong and he  
clings firmly to fruitless hope.   
TEXT 17   
agre vahnih prishhthebhaanuh   
raatrau chubukasamarpitajaanuh   
karatalabhikshastarutalavaasah   
tadapi na mujncatyaashaapaashah   
Behold there lies the man who sits warming up his body with the fire in front  
and the sun at the back; at night he curls up the body to keep out of the  
cold; he eats his beggar's food from the bowl of his hand and sleeps beneath  
the tree. Still in his heart, he is a wretched puppet at the hands of  
passions.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 29, 2010, 08:24:21 AM

The Verse 2 reminds me of Bhagavan Ramana's arrival to   
Tiruvannamalai and His subsequent activities. After embracing   
Aruanchaleswara in the Temple, He came out! A barber on his   
own asked Him whether He could have a tonsure. He said yes   
and had the tonsure. Then should one not take bath after hair   
cut or tonsure? He did not care. Suddenly unusual rains came   
and wetted Him. It was September 1 and the rains are even today   
unusual at this time. Then He removed His dhoti and tore a corner   
and wore it as a coupina. He did not keep the remaining dhoti   
for an alternate coupina for next day. He threw away all the coins   
that He had and the sweetmeats too. He had already left the relatives and  
mother and now the remaining possessions too.   
Thereafter, He never touched the money. It took more than   
20 years to build the Mother's Temple in the present form. But   
He never approved donations. He sat on a sofa given by a   
person, other wise He would have gladly sat on the floor. Nothing He asked  
for. Whatever came from others voluntarily, He took   
them as Arunachala's gift to Him. He abhorred costly gifts. He returned the  
sandal wood walking stick and also the costly pen   
given by devotees.   
The only thing He approved was Anna dhanam, and even for this, He never  
coerced anyone to give rice, dhal and vegetables. His life is graphic picture  
of Verse 2 of Bhaja Govindam.   
Arunachala Siva.

punarapi janani [yet again, in the mother's] jatare shayanam [womb, we sleep]   
iha samsare bahu dustare [this world is really very deceiving -- how can we go  
through the same experience again and again and yet think there some some  
novelty in it?], kripaya pahe pahe murare [please surrender to Sri Krishna]

by others on the roads]
