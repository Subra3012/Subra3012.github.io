## Thief  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 03:34:05 AM

How is the ego to be destroyed?   
Bhagavan: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks  
this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree to kill itself? This  
question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the  
ego you will find it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   
In this connection I am often reminded of a funny incident which took place  
when I was living in the West Chitrai Street in Madura. A neighbour in an  
adjoining house anticipated the visit of a thief to his house. He took  
precautions to catch him. He posted policemen in mufti to guard the two ends  
of the lane, the entrance and the back-door to his own house. The thief came  
as expected and the men rushed to catch him. He took in the situation at a  
glance and shouted "Hold him, hold him. There-he runs-there-there.'' Saying so  
he made good his escape.   
So it is with the ego. Look for it and it will not be found. That is the way  
to get rid of it.

## superset and subset  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 12:40:52 PM  
---  
A student was asked to give an example of superset-subset relationship: He wrote: Superset A = {}   
Subset B = {mind, ego, thought}   
The teacher was angry. He asked: Why did you make the superset null?   
How will you get things from a null superset in a subset?   
The student scratched his head and replied: That is what I am learning.   
The teaching gave him 0, a rejection of null.   
A holy man saw it and gave him 0, a blessing of null.   
(A set is an unordered collection of elements)

## What do you think about buddhist meditation?  
Author: snow                Date: January 08, 2010, 01:25:38 PM

There is a lot of similarities between the teachings of Gautama Buddha and Sri  
Ramana Maharshi. But however their methods are quite different.   
Sri Bhagavan thaught self enquiry as way the to enlightenment and Nisargadatta  
Maharaj's realized the Self without "following any particular course of  
breathing, or meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever happened, I would  
turn away my attention from it and remain with the sense 'I am'"   
The Buddha however gave very different instuctions. According to him the  
mindfulness of breathing is the way to liberation.  
(http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html)   
This differs quite lot from self enquiry in the way that buddhist mediation is  
gradually taming the mind and developing the mind (and it doesn't envolve  
enquiry Who am I ofcourse). As Buddha says in Dhammapada: Restrained Mind Leads To Happiness   
 The mind is very hard to check   
 and swift, it falls on what it wants.   
 **The training of the mind is good,   
 a mind so tamed brings happiness.**   
However Nisargadatta said that there is no such thing as peace of mind! We  
must go beyond mind and it doesn't matter what kind of mind we leave behind  
us. So why I'm talking about is, is because I've practiced zen buddhist  
meditation for two years now. It has helped me to overcome lot of my  
obsessions and depression. But I still haven't had many insights and I feel  
that zazen gives me relief, but not release. And outside meditation cushion I  
don't feel too peaceful or joyful. I'm still thinking about continuing it and  
practicing it alongside with self enquiry. But is it necessary? Can I get the  
same benefits from self enquiry?

I am not an expert in Buddhist meditation techniques. But I   
feel that mindfulness of the breath, helps one to ward off other   
thoughts. This is also in Yoga marga of Patanjali. Bhagavan   
Ramana says: Breath control brings about control of mind but   
not total destruction of thoughts (mind). When breath control   
is discontinued after the usual sitting, the mind again jumps out   
and makes a riot with all vasanas. Vasanas are thoughts imbedded   
in the subconscious, waiting for a chance to come out.

This is a good question that I also have been thinking about. To expand the  
question : what 'practices' other than self-enquiry are acceptable ? Any ?  
None ?   
Currently I am regularly doing asana, pranayama, kundalini meditation,  
psychotherapy, yoga nidra, mindfulness meditation, bhakti, and self-enquiry.   
I feel that working on all levels is preparing the soil and using the body,  
mind and heart to reach the goal. Karma, bhakti, jnana. And I check with  
self-enquiry if I am ready. If I am not then I prepare more. Then self-  
enquiry again - am I ready ? If not more preparation etc...   
?

Dear rideforever,   
Yes, all are good. Bhagavan Ramana did not much recommend   
Raja Yoga marga, because this method is considered tough and   
any mistake will result in negative consequences. The Kundalini   
Power is a double edged sword and one has to be exteremely   
cautious about it. But Sri Sankara did recommend. In case of   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri, he had this unbearable burning sensation in the  
crown when he was practising in Tiruvottiyur   
and Bhagavan Ramana had to go in his subtle body skyward   
and place His hand on Sastri's skull, to quell the heat and burning   
sensation.   
With an experienced teacher, the Raja Yoga is quite good.   
Arunachala Siva.

When a mind is restrained, it will try to recede towards its source and vanish  
uncovering the spiritual heart which is pure consciousness. The effect of  
controlling the breath is the same since the "source" of both breath and mind  
is same. However without attaining purity by giving up desires and practising  
devotion, the mind will revolt when trying to restrain. With purity, mind  
control itself becomes redundant since it is felt more and more from within  
that one is more of pure consciousness than mind. God is directing the show  
from the heart, and mind is only a "camping site" to carry on the day to day  
works.   
All practices have their own good points. The final goal is the same whether  
it is approached in a straight path or a little roundabout way.

Hmm. Nisargadatta believed his guru and following his teachings. But is this  
possible for everyone ?   
Perhaps Nisargadatta had certain vasanas that caused him to following  
teachings very closely and achieved the end. He was lucky to be conditioned  
in such a way.   
If you are conditioned so that you do not following teachings, then what can  
be done ?

Dear rideforever,   
If one is not able to follow Guru's teachings due to his conditioning   
that is, vasanas, nothing can be done. Many people came to Bhagavan Ramana  
and only a few stuck to Him. Certain visitors who   
came with their friends (who were ardent devotees) came in, saw   
the trees, monkeys, peacocks and the Hill and a glance at Maharshi   
and then left for market to buy brinjals*. They came in the evening   
to the Asramam to get back to their town as per programme.   
* Even today, Tiruvannamalai is known for its brinjals, palmyra   
fruits (Nongu in Tamil) and tomatoes and cotton dhotis.   
Arunachala Siva.

mindfullness of breath is called shamata or shine meditation...and this is the  
primary meditation of hinayana (the smaller vehicle of buddhism) it is said to  
take aeons and millions of lifetimes to realize buddhanature in this way   
so saying shamata is buddhist meditation is true but a very partial truth.

Actually there is no controlling of breath in the meditation that the Buddha  
thaught. One is just aware of the breath.   
Quote

primary meditation of hinayana (the smaller vehicle of buddhism) it is said to  
take aeons and millions of lifetimes to realize buddhanature in this way  
Smiley   
so saying shamata is buddhist meditation is true but a very partial truth.  
After the some level of peace has been attained, vipassana (insight  
meditation) naturally starts.   
I think that one of the differences between self enquiry and buddhist  
meditation is that in buddhism formal sitting meditation is considered  
essential. In some places there may even be 20(!) hours of meditation a day.  
Sri Bhagavan on the other hand said that formal meditation is for the merest  
beginner. There have been also buddhists masters like zen master Dogen who  
said that   
"Those who see worldly life as an obstacle to Dharma see no Dharma in everyday  
actions; they have not discovered that there are no everyday actions outside  
of Dharma."   
But still he recommended zazen (meditation) to be done four times a day and he  
said that sitting is the gateway of truth to total liberation.   
And also zen master Shunryu Suzuki said that Zen is not some kind of  
excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine" where as  
Nisargadatta said: "What harm is there in making automatic, what is habitual and repetitive (  
_daily life_ )? It is automatic anyhow. But when it is also chaotic, it causes  
pain and suffering and calls for attention. The entire purpose of a clean and  
well-ordered life is to liberate man from the thraldom of chaos and the burden  
of sorrow.   
Q: You seem to be in favour of a computerised life.   
M: What is wrong with a life which is free from problems? Personality is  
merely a reflection of the real. Why should not the reflection be true to the  
original as a matter of course, automatically? Need the person have any  
designs of its own? The life of which it is an expression will guide it. Once  
you realise that the person is merely a shadow of the reality, but not reality  
itself, you cease to fret and worry. You agree to be guided from within and  
life becomes a journey into the unknown."   
Nisargadatta also said that this environment that is seen by the senses is  
just a tiny point in his consciousness. Buddhism in my opinion is basically  
coming back to the senses.

Dear Subramanian R.   
I think this is not correct. The Guru's teachings are a vasana, so something  
can be done.   
Unfortunately it appears that some vasanas might lead to salvation. I someone  
explains even the rudimentary idea of self-enquiry to someone else. .. that is  
itself a vasana.   
Clearly the situation is difficult and very subtle. In order to remove all  
vasanas we might have to follow some good vasanas (self-enquiry) and then at  
then end try to remove even these ones. Making a mistake, getting lost, or  
falling into illusion, must be a great great danger.   
If the truth is pulling you from the other side then that would be helpful.

dear mai chop wok   
it works for me, but ramana is still my guru.. and I enjoy the conversations  
here   
so I dont draw a line between these two...my sadhana is from tibetan buddhism,  
but the "view" is so close and similar that it makes really not a big  
difference if I write here or somewhere else.   
you see this is in a way my internet sangha, and very dear to me   
I mean I started writing/reading here when I didnt know much about this  
religion   
but bhagawan in a way "told" me that I will meet different teachers and that  
they are in reallity himself...so it carried me in this direction.. and I dont  
really question it, feels right and good for me

Dear rideforever,   
I have said today in another post, desiring the Self is the only   
vasana that one can have. Bhagavan has said this. For desiring   
the Self, if one goes to a Guru or read His teachings, then it   
becomes auxillary to that desiring of the Self. These are all   
done by Suddha Manas, or Pure Mind, which do not cultivate   
prarabdha effect.

Dear soham3,   
For practisers, the Self is on the right side of the chest, two digits   
to the right of the midpoint. Many have asked whether it is Anahata.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "No. However, this could be as per

of final experience.

Dear soham3,   
For practisers, the Self is on the right side of the chest, two digits   
to the right of the midpoint. Many have asked whether it is Anahata.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "No. However, this could be as per   
kundalini yoga." Bhagavan Ramana also accepts the principle of   
dwadasantam, the space, twelve digits above the crown as the seat   
of final experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Far eastern thoughts place it at the intersection between the line from back-  
head to forehead & another line connecting tops of the 2 ears.   
I am from Far East, but have never heard of this.

Brahmandra is the concept of Raja yoga marga. Once when a devotee was  
sleeping   
in the Hall, and his head hung up, Bhagavan Ramana pointed out this to Nayana  
and   
said: See if Brahman is on the skull, how can it fall, when the body sleeps?   
Arunachala Siva.
