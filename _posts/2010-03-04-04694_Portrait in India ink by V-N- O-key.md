Dear Ramanaduli,   
Back after long time! Welcome once again. Guru Gita is a work of about 250  
verses.   
There are Sanskrit-English version and Sanskrit-Tamil version. I remember, I  
had   
given the English translation of a few verses, some months back. I shall try  
the   
remaining soon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks. After practicing vichara maraga of Bhagavan, instead of geting aha  
kann (inner eye) thirappu, my unnak kann got opened by operation. Still there  
is one week has to go. But due to curiousity I opened pc. I consulted 3  
doctors, accidently this doctor is a follower of Bhagavan, When I visited his  
clinic I saw Bhagavan's photo immedietly I decided to go for it. During this  
post operation period, I enjoyed becasue I had lots of time to recalls all the  
posts and the replies. Bhagavan helped me by giving answers for all my  
quieries.   
Thanks Bhagavan.   
Ramanaduli

Dear ramanaduli,   
Wish you a very speedy recovery, with Bhagavan's Grace. He is the Eye of the  
eye.   
You have gone to a doctor who is Ramana bhakta. What better omen you want   
for the successful recovery? Karunaiyal ennai anda nee enakku.... He rules  
through   
His Grace. Grace is Mother Unnamulai. (Sri Arunachala Padigam)   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you Subramaniyan ji and matthias ji. Yes, It is Bhagavan's grace is  
flowing always for every one of us. After my recovery there is a wish to go   
Bhagavan's ashramam. Waiting for His call. In one way going to ashramam is  
body will go there. If I cannot go I do not worry for that because He is   
every where.This maturity also came to me by His grace only. Ellam avan  
cheyal.   
Ramanaduli

One Manian Selvam has also made a pencil stroke painting. It has been  
printed   
and published by the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan. This is the same portrait   
from Welling Bust photograph.

Dear grhluna,   
Nice poem. A great Yogi or a Jnani does not care for the world.   
He smiles at everyone, take them as they are, without a pre-   
condition and at the same everyone is a straw for him. Even   
the five elements obey him. He does not fear anyone. But he   
loves everyone. Once Alexandar came to his guru Dionysus (Spelling?) and stood  
before him. D was doing his surya namaskar.   
All Aryans pray to the Sun. Alexander bowed to him and told him: Sir, I have defeated many many kings and brought cart load of   
treasures. I want to give you some thing. What do you want?   
Tell me.   
The Guru told him: Please stand away without hiding the Sun from   
my sight and that is all. Go away!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
What the church-goers do on Sundays? The priest or parish calls them   
all: O Sinners! They all accept the statement, without hesitation.   
Then after the Mass, one by one comes to the priest and confesses his   
sins during the previous week. The priest assures them that he has   
heard them and he forgives them. They go back. And start sinning   
from the time they left the church. This is how the most Westerners   
do their prayers and meditation. Hindus believe that no sin goes un-   
accounted. Only when God's grace showers on you, your sin will   
be washed off. For that, you should constantly meditate and surrender   
to Him. No one, neither the priest nor the gurus like Nityananda have   
power to wash off your sins.   
Arunachala Siva.
