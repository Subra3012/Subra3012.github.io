## Unity in Diversity with numbers

Those who have gone to the essence of numbers often find that there is a  
divine quality in numbers. It does not load the mind like names.   
There is an unity in diversity.   
The same Being ( **ripe I** ) has manifested in so many forms.   
So how to capture this diversity?   
We use names for persons, places, things etc, in sentences like John, market,  
apple etc.   
An alternative is to use numbers.   
If we write the sentence   
" _John is going to the market to buy apples._ "   
as   
" _I is going to the I to buy I._ "   
it will create confusion.   
A solution is to assign numbers to each person, place, object and then **marry  
them** with " **I** ": John = 121, market = 243, apple = 765   
Once the mapping sinks inside the mind (after which it becomes more or less  
automatic), the sentence is written as: " _I121 is going to the I243 to buy I765._ "   
It loads the mind less than the names.   
While writing, the numbers are there (visual), but while reading (listening)  
they are kept silent.   
So the sentence is inwardly pronounced as: " _I is going to the I to buy I._ "   
By constantly repeating the _I,I_ we feel the unity.   
The numbers with their divine quality gives the diversity.   
Since the numbers are married to the " **I** " ( **the Purusha** ) they will  
always remain subordinate and never raise their heads.   
So there is unity in diversity.   
For the Bhakta, God is everything. So "I" should be replaced by " **L** " (for  
**Lord** ), " **Y** " (for **You** ), or " **K** " (for **Krishna** ), " **S**  
" (for **Shiva** ) etc.   
So the sentence becomes: " _L121 is going to the L243 to buy L765._ "   
Keeping the numbers silent during pronounciation gives: " _Lord is going to the Lord to buy Lord._ "   
Correction for the ego (or unripe I): It is often uncomfortable to attribute every bad deed to "I" or "Lord".   
In that case "I" or "L" can be replaced by " _e_ " (for _ego_ ) knowing that  
"e" will one day lose its temporary identity to "I" or "L".   
The sentence: "The unkind person beat the dog mercilessly" becomes   
" _The unkind e123 beat the L141 mercilessly_ ".   
Those who want to see the Lord even in the unkind person can use "l"  
(lowercase L) for the unkind person.   
" _The unkind l123 beat the L141 mercilessly_ ".   
The equivalent for the Jnani will be "i" (lowercase I) and the sentence  
becomes: " _The unkind i123 beat the I141 mercilessly_ ".   
The vocal repetition still gives the continuity of "i-I" with a little  
reservation of small "i".   
So there is unity in diversity.   
And scope for spiritual growth.

Dear silentgreen,   
An unique and excellent post. Bhagavan Ramana has said there is only   
1. All numbers are adding 1 to each resultant number. If zero is added,   
if no-activity in mind, words and deeds is added, then 1 remains only   
as 1, the Unitary Principle. If on the other hand, zero kept to the right   
of 1, the value multiplies. Thus a Jnani's activity, with no-thought, is   
an excellent activity for benefit of others. Bhagavan Ramana's kitchen   
preparations, His stroll with devotees in the Hill, His preparing a nice   
stick for the shepherd, His careful keeping of the egg which was showing   
a clevage, to its maturity as a bird -- all these are examples of a Jnani's   
no-mind activity for the benefit of fellow beings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. All Jnanis have said the same Truth, as if they were   
school boys copying from each other's note books!   
Whatever you have mentioned about the songs of Uttara Gita,   
has also been told by Bhagavan Ramana, in Sad Darsanam, Supplement, Verses 3  
to 5.   
Verse 3:- When one has learned to love the company of Sages,   
wherefore all these rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool,   
southern breeze is blowing, what need is there for a hand fan?   
Verse4:- Body heat is overcome by the cool light of the moon,   
want by the good wish-yielding tree (Karpaga), and sin by the   
Holy Ganga. These three - body/mind heat, want and sin all flee   
at the august sight of the peerless Sage.   
Verse 5:- Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols which are   
only of stones and clay, are not as mighty as the Sages are. For   
while they make one pure in course of countless days, the Sage's   
eyes by a mere glance purify at once.

Swami Vivekananda sang this song before Sri Ramakrishna.   
 _Let us go back once more, O mind, to our proper home,   
Here in this foreign land of earth,   
Why should we wander aimlessly in stranger's guise?   
These living beings round about,   
And the five elements,   
Are strangers to you, all of them; none are your own.   
Why do you so forget yourself,   
In love with strangers, foolish mind?   
Why do you so forget your own?   
Mount the path of truth, O mind! unflaggingly climb,   
With love as the lamp, light your way.   
As your provision on the journey, take with you   
The virtues, hidden carefully;   
For, like two highwaymen,   
Greed and delusion wait to rob you of your wealth.   
And keep besides you constantly,   
As guards to shelter you from harm,   
Calmness of mind and self-control.   
Companionship with holy men will be for you   
A welcome rest-house by the road;   
There rest your weary limbs awhile, asking your way,   
If ever you should be in doubt,   
Of him who watches there.   
If anything along the path should cause you fear,   
Then loudly shout the name of God;   
For He is ruler of that road,   
And even Death must bow to him._
