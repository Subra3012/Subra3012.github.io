In the 19th and early 20th century, it was common amongst all Hindus   
to celebrate the attainment puberty and first menstruation of the girl child.   
There used to be a lot of happy exchanges of words, greetings, eats and   
dance and music at home. This has fallent into disuse.   
Akka sings one such celebration, with a pageant, with inbuilt advaitic  
meaning.   
"Vidya" has become "a big lady" today.   
Let us celebrate. Oh girls, come.   
Upanishad, Brahmasutram, Vedas and Yoga Vasishta came   
 as best girls.   
They make fun of Vidya, apply kumkum, and sandal paste on her face.   
They ask her to sit "one corner" called meditation on God.   
They dance and sing the music of non dual consciousness.   
They distribute laddus of ananda, the payasam of satsangh.   
Let us celebrate, come.   
Here comes the Guru, the grand old ma of the house,   
She tells Vidya to do this and not to do that.   
"Do not jump here and there, (with your thoughts)   
It will pain your belly (mind).   
Keep silent and listen to songs and dance of Upanishads.   
The four day celebrations are over.   
*   
Vidya comes out (of isolation) and has her Holy Bath of Self Realization.   
The girls go away, saying that they have no more work with her.   
The grandold ma of the house looks at Vidya.   
"O Vidya looks really matured.   
She talks a little, she sings a little, she moves with dexterity.   
She eats a little, she sleeps a little,   
Always in the state of Self realization!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. All Jnanis have said the same Truth, as if they were   
school boys copying from each other's note books!   
Whatever you have mentioned about the songs of Uttara Gita,   
has also been told by Bhagavan Ramana, in Sad Darsanam, Supplement, Verses 3  
to 5.   
Verse 3:- When one has learned to love the company of Sages,   
wherefore all these rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool,   
southern breeze is blowing, what need is there for a hand fan?   
Verse4:- Body heat is overcome by the cool light of the moon,   
want by the good wish-yielding tree (Karpaga), and sin by the   
Holy Ganga. These three - body/mind heat, want and sin all flee   
at the august sight of the peerless Sage.   
Verse 5:- Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols which are   
only of stones and clay, are not as mighty as the Sages are. For   
while they make one pure in course of countless days, the Sage's   
eyes by a mere glance purify at once.

Swami Vivekananda sang this song before Sri Ramakrishna.   
 _Let us go back once more, O mind, to our proper home,   
Here in this foreign land of earth,   
Why should we wander aimlessly in stranger's guise?   
These living beings round about,   
And the five elements,   
Are strangers to you, all of them; none are your own.   
Why do you so forget yourself,   
In love with strangers, foolish mind?   
Why do you so forget your own?   
Mount the path of truth, O mind! unflaggingly climb,   
With love as the lamp, light your way.   
As your provision on the journey, take with you   
The virtues, hidden carefully;   
For, like two highwaymen,   
Greed and delusion wait to rob you of your wealth.   
And keep besides you constantly,   
As guards to shelter you from harm,   
Calmness of mind and self-control.   
Companionship with holy men will be for you   
A welcome rest-house by the road;   
There rest your weary limbs awhile, asking your way,   
If ever you should be in doubt,   
Of him who watches there.   
If anything along the path should cause you fear,   
Then loudly shout the name of God;   
For He is ruler of that road,   
And even Death must bow to him._
