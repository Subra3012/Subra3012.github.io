## Tenth Man-a funny tale with high philosophy

There was a Guru with ten stupid students.He asked the students to cross the  
river and wait for him on the other bank.He warned them about   
the depth and current of the river. Asked them to exercise care and caution.   
The scary students mangaged to cross the river and reached the other side of  
the river.Out of anxiety,they wanted to check about safe arrival of the entire  
group of ten.The first one proceeded without first counting himself and ended  
up with ""Nine"Ã¶nly.Startled, they organised recounting, but the score never  
crossed Nine ;because each of them inadvertently omitted to include himself in  
the count.They cried in chorus about the loss of one of their team members and  
cursed the river.   
At last, the Guru came on the scene.He understood their problem. He gave a  
blow to each of the students to call out numbers.One..Two..Three   
the last one shouted Ten. The total tallied.Students beamed with joy that all  
of them are very much alive and kicking.Thus the Guru solved a   
non-existent problem.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to narrate this funny story to explain the need for Self  
Enquiry.   
In the book Kaivalya Navaneetham (Tamil) published by Sri Ramanashram,the  
philosophy underlying the story is well expounded.   
 Story line Philosophy   
a)Every student forgetting to count himself  
a)Ignorance of Self -Agnanam.We disregard the Self and direct our thoughts   
 on other objects exeternal to us   
b)Tenth Man not found  
b)Illusion-Maya. Mind filters the Reality. Unreal things appear as Real   
c)Crying over the missing person  
c)Wrong identification--Vikshepa. We identify ourselves with Body/Mind   
 Jeeva Bodam- and undergo sufferings.   
d)Guru asked the students to call out numbers  
d)Indirect knowledge-Paroksha Gnanam-Guru can only give some   
 techniques to find out the Truth.Seeker has to work out the same   
e)Joy of students, when they discovered the tenth student e)Direct  
knowledge-Aparoksha Gnanam.Bliss of Self. The tenth man was   
 only a rediscovery of what was already there.We are always the Self   
 before and after realisation.When realisation dawns we regain the happy   
 state which is our Nature.   
Therefore, let us keep our attention always on the Self and be happy.

Dear Aham Brahmasmi.   
I have not done it. But people say: 1\. One has to start at the time of sunrise.   
2\. Choose a non windy, non rainy, sunny day.   
3\. Go via Virupaksha Cave/Skandasramam route.   
4\. Take water and some eats like biscuits / fruits.   
5\. Do not load your knapsack too much.   
You may take further minor details from Asramam inmates.   
Arunachala Siva.
