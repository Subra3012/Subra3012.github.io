Source And Courtesy : http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50.html   
I request readers to access the above link to read all the 50 divine  
thoughts.i will paste here few important ones.   
The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable faith  
in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows. Bhakti  
alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are the  
agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all  
places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our  
gratitude to God.   
In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need must be with  
reference to another **.Let action be out of love. Passions such as desire and  
hatred, anger and malice must be totally eschewed.** If love becomes the  
grounding principle of all deeds. then most of the ills of the world will  
vanish.   
What is the purpose of human birth? To earn, to eat, to undergo misery  
everyday and finally to die? Instead of earning and suffering, can we not die  
now? The purpose of birth is to avoid re-birth. Except man, all animals grow  
horizontally. Only man grows vertically. Instead of growing horizontally, it  
is God's will that he should grow vertically in order to look up. God has  
given to animals devices for self-protection; to man alone He has given  
intelligence. **By doing nothing, we avoid re-birth; By giving up attachment,  
we avoid sins.**   
When any object is consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black residue  
is burnt again, it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain white even  
when burnt again. This shows that white is the ultimate and black is proximate  
to it. Science tells us that diamond and coal are basically one. White and  
black are not colours. The primary colours get separated from the objects to  
which they are attached when subjected to the test of fire and ultimately  
white.Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the Ultimate Reality is  
Siva, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who is dark. When we test  
everything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge, the residue is Siva. Ash  
in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the spiritual plane. **We smear  
our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves of Siva and the fact that  
the ultimate goal of life is Siva.**   
Right education should make us know that God is the Truth. Knowledge must fill  
one with good qualities, through which one can realise the Truth, that is God.  
Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the understanding of the Ultimate Truth.  
The first fruit of education must be humility and self control.   
 **Why so many Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak  
of one God only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to  
satisfy hunger, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger. Then  
why can 't we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side dishes?  
So, if we eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food tasty to  
the palate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a particular God  
he worships that.   
By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty. What is essential for life and  
honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is for  
this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should not  
increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their  
prosperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we  
increase our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it  
will only produce poverty and sorrow.**   
Vedanta which is the peak of the Vedas teaches the way for the removal of  
sorrow. Hatred and desire arise only in respect of the objects other than us.  
That desire will not arise if those objects are rendered identical with us, if  
there is nothing other than us, then desire will not arise. **If there is no  
desire, there will be no effort and no sin. When there is no sin, there will  
be no body and there will be no misery.**   
 **Our religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -  
purification. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and conflict.  
The reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of Hinduism, in  
spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure of money, etc.,  
is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are impressed. We  
develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion. There is a text in  
the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees automatically. If we  
examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect, the world will follow  
him.**   
 **It is clear to us that there is birth and there is death.Passion is the  
cause of birth. Time is the cause of death. What is created by passion is  
destroyed by time.** If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the  
tree dies. Kaalo Jagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate when  
time comes. If there is no passion, there is no production. If there is no  
time then there is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and  
Kaama. Iswara burnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is  
neither birth nor death for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father  
and Mother.   
**Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as iron filings  
are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;  
the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.**   
A mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and  
eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child.  
Similarly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire picture of  
life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the past  
and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper  
perspective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper  
setting.   
Whenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must remember the divine  
source from which he derived the qualifications to receive that honour, and  
feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - importance.   
 **Cultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;   
Look at others as yourself;   
Give up war; give up jealousy;   
Don't commit aggression without reason;   
Mother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;   
The Lord God is like father showering mercy   
People of the World !   
Live with discipline;   
Live with charity;   
Live with mercy;   
May all people attain greater well - being**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Joke Of 21st century :-) Man to become immortal by 2029: scientist

http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/24/man-to-become-immortal-  
by-2029-scientist.htm   
A futuristic American scientist has predicted that man could become immortal  
in as little as 20 years' time through nanotechnology and better understanding  
of the body mechanism.   
Ray Kurzweil, known to have predicted future technologies decades ahead has  
written in The Sun, 'I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20  
years we will have the means to re-programme our bodies' stone-age software so  
we can halt, then reverse, ageing. Then nano-technology will let us live for  
ever.'   
The 61-year-old, lauded by Microsoft [ Images ] founder Bill Gates [ Images ]  
as the smartest futurist on Earth said," We are living through the most  
exciting period of human history.   
'Computer technology and our understanding of genes -- our body's software  
programs -- are accelerating at an incredible rate.'   
The scientist says that already, blood cell-sized submarines called nanobots  
are being tested in animals. These will soon be used to destroy tumours,  
unblock clots and perform operations without scars.   
Ultimately, nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of  
times more effectively, he added.   
According to his theory called the Law of Accelerating Returns mankind will  
experience a billion-fold increase in technological capability for the same  
cost in the next 25 years.   
Nanotechnology will help in making humans achieve immortality said Kurzweil,  
'By the middle of the next century we will have back-up copies of the  
information in our bodies and brains that make us who we are. Then we really  
will be immortal.'   
'Nanotechnology will extend our mental capacities to such an extent we will be  
able to write books within minutes. If we want to go into virtual-reality  
mode, nanobots will shut down brain signals and take us wherever we want to  
go. Virtual sex will become commonplace. And in our daily lives, hologram like  
figures will pop in our brain to explain what is happening,' he said.   
The scientist also predicts that humans in future will become cyborgs, with  
artificial limbs and organs.

Dear prasanth,   
Your Joke post makes me visualize some two scenarios: 1. Every body becomes immortal. But they will not be self   
realized. So, the earth will become full and overflowing with   
duds.   
2\. Perhaps, they may stop future births too. Then the earth will be full of  
old people, a 70 year old Subramanian, a 90 year old   
Mr.X and a 120 year old Mr. Y.   
3\. If everybody is immortal, how can Kalki (the 10th avatara of   
Vishnu can come down, to kill people? So Puranas will become   
a falsity. Kalki cannot come down on earth.   
4. In homes, all old couples will be watching, TV serials ad nauseum. In T.V serials too, there will be 100 year old hero   
singing duet song with a 90 year old herione. Even if they   
use special advanced make-ups, there age is quite known to   
audience.   
5. Since everyone is immortal, no one can kill others. So,   
some great Tsunami or earth quake, or a number of Icelandic   
volcanoes have to erupt, to clear up the mess. Or super humans   
from Mars should invade the earth and burn the earth totally!   
Arunachala Siva.

by-2029-scientist.htm   
A futuristic American scientist has predicted that man could become immortal  
in as little as 20 years' time through nanotechnology and better understanding  
of the body mechanism.   
Ray Kurzweil, known to have predicted future technologies decades ahead has  
written in The Sun, 'I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20  
years we will have the means to re-programme our bodies' stone-age software so  
we can halt, then reverse, ageing. Then nano-technology will let us live for  
ever.'   
The 61-year-old, lauded by Microsoft [ Images ] founder Bill Gates [ Images ]  
as the smartest futurist on Earth said," We are living through the most  
exciting period of human history.   
'Computer technology and our understanding of genes -- our body's software  
programs -- are accelerating at an incredible rate.'   
The scientist says that already, blood cell-sized submarines called nanobots  
are being tested in animals. These will soon be used to destroy tumours,  
unblock clots and perform operations without scars.   
Ultimately, nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of  
times more effectively, he added.   
According to his theory called the Law of Accelerating Returns mankind will  
experience a billion-fold increase in technological capability for the same  
cost in the next 25 years.   
Nanotechnology will help in making humans achieve immortality said Kurzweil,  
'By the middle of the next century we will have back-up copies of the  
information in our bodies and brains that make us who we are. Then we really  
will be immortal.'   
'Nanotechnology will extend our mental capacities to such an extent we will be  
able to write books within minutes. If we want to go into virtual-reality  
mode, nanobots will shut down brain signals and take us wherever we want to  
go. Virtual sex will become commonplace. And in our daily lives, hologram like  
figures will pop in our brain to explain what is happening,' he said.   
The scientist also predicts that humans in future will become cyborgs, with  
artificial limbs and organs.

Dear prasanth,   
Your Joke post makes me visualize some two scenarios: 1. Every body becomes immortal. But they will not be self   
realized. So, the earth will become full and overflowing with   
duds.   
2\. Perhaps, they may stop future births too. Then the earth will be full of  
old people, a 70 year old Subramanian, a 90 year old   
Mr.X and a 120 year old Mr. Y.   
3\. If everybody is immortal, how can Kalki (the 10th avatara of   
Vishnu can come down, to kill people? So Puranas will become   
a falsity. Kalki cannot come down on earth.   
4. In homes, all old couples will be watching, TV serials ad nauseum. In T.V serials too, there will be 100 year old hero   
singing duet song with a 90 year old herione. Even if they   
use special advanced make-ups, there age is quite known to   
audience.   
5. Since everyone is immortal, no one can kill others. So,   
some great Tsunami or earth quake, or a number of Icelandic   
volcanoes have to erupt, to clear up the mess. Or super humans   
from Mars should invade the earth and burn the earth totally!   
Arunachala Siva.

When the scientist   
When the scientist can create even God, why he cannot create unconditional  
heart and implant in human being so the whole world become heaven?   
whatever he creates it would have mind within which may create lots of  
problem.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Joke Of 21st century :-) Man to become immortal by 2029: scientist

by-2029-scientist.htm   
A futuristic American scientist has predicted that man could become immortal  
in as little as 20 years' time through nanotechnology and better understanding  
of the body mechanism.   
Ray Kurzweil, known to have predicted future technologies decades ahead has  
written in The Sun, 'I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20  
years we will have the means to re-programme our bodies' stone-age software so  
we can halt, then reverse, ageing. Then nano-technology will let us live for  
ever.'   
The 61-year-old, lauded by Microsoft [ Images ] founder Bill Gates [ Images ]  
as the smartest futurist on Earth said," We are living through the most  
exciting period of human history.   
'Computer technology and our understanding of genes -- our body's software  
programs -- are accelerating at an incredible rate.'   
The scientist says that already, blood cell-sized submarines called nanobots  
are being tested in animals. These will soon be used to destroy tumours,  
unblock clots and perform operations without scars.   
Ultimately, nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of  
times more effectively, he added.   
According to his theory called the Law of Accelerating Returns mankind will  
experience a billion-fold increase in technological capability for the same  
cost in the next 25 years.   
Nanotechnology will help in making humans achieve immortality said Kurzweil,  
'By the middle of the next century we will have back-up copies of the  
information in our bodies and brains that make us who we are. Then we really  
will be immortal.'   
'Nanotechnology will extend our mental capacities to such an extent we will be  
able to write books within minutes. If we want to go into virtual-reality  
mode, nanobots will shut down brain signals and take us wherever we want to  
go. Virtual sex will become commonplace. And in our daily lives, hologram like  
figures will pop in our brain to explain what is happening,' he said.   
The scientist also predicts that humans in future will become cyborgs, with  
artificial limbs and organs.

Dear prasanth,   
Your Joke post makes me visualize some two scenarios: 1. Every body becomes immortal. But they will not be self   
realized. So, the earth will become full and overflowing with   
duds.   
2\. Perhaps, they may stop future births too. Then the earth will be full of  
old people, a 70 year old Subramanian, a 90 year old   
Mr.X and a 120 year old Mr. Y.   
3\. If everybody is immortal, how can Kalki (the 10th avatara of   
Vishnu can come down, to kill people? So Puranas will become   
a falsity. Kalki cannot come down on earth.   
4. In homes, all old couples will be watching, TV serials ad nauseum. In T.V serials too, there will be 100 year old hero   
singing duet song with a 90 year old herione. Even if they   
use special advanced make-ups, there age is quite known to   
audience.   
5. Since everyone is immortal, no one can kill others. So,   
some great Tsunami or earth quake, or a number of Icelandic   
volcanoes have to erupt, to clear up the mess. Or super humans   
from Mars should invade the earth and burn the earth totally!   
Arunachala Siva.
