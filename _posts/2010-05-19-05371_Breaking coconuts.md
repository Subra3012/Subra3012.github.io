## Question concerning the path of surrender  
Author: Japo                Date: May 19, 2010, 04:26:27 PM  
---  
Sri Bhagavan said that self-enquiry and surrender are the only two ways for  
realization. Now, when people asked what should they do when doubts, fears and  
desires arise, Sri Bhagavan replied "see who is it that all these arise to".  
These were (I assume) people who were on the path of jnana. But how should one  
who is taking the path of surrender proceed when doubts, fears and desires  
arise.

## Re:[1]ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ  Question concerning the path of surrender

Japo Garu,   
Throw all burden on God and be happy.   
Bhagavan ramana clearly tells us in 'Nan Yaar PARAGRAPH THIRTEEN'   
Being completely absorbed in atma-nishtha [self-abidance, the state of just  
being as we really are],giving not even the slightest room to the rising of  
any thought other than atma-chintana selfcontemplation,the 'thought' of our  
own real self], is giving ourself to God. Even though we place whatever amount  
of burden upon God, that entire amount he will bear. _Since one paramesvara  
sakti [supreme power of God] is driving all activities [that is, since it is  
causing and controlling everything that happens in this world], why should we  
always think, 'it is necessary [for me] to act in this way; it is necessary  
[for me] to act in that way', instead of being [calm, peaceful and happy]  
having yielded [ourself together with our entire burden] to that [supreme  
controlling power]?_ **Though we know that the train is carrying all the  
burdens, why should we who travel in it suffer by carrying our small luggage  
on our head instead of leaving it placed on that [train]?**

What Bhagavan said in Who am I? paragraph 13 and what   
prasanth said in his post is the correct answer.   
The surrender is a total process where the ego is killed. In   
Atma Vichara also, the ego is eventually killed. Both are the   
same. Apparently, for many seekers, it would appear that surrender   
is easy. IT IS NOT SO. Total surrender to god or guru which is   
Self-surrender is the same as Atma Vichara and is not less difficult   
than the other one.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks, I like these replies. I found a nice quote regarding this question.   
"If one surrenders oneself there will be no one to ask questions or to be  
thought of."

as i see it surrender is not a path at all, it is a stepping off the path,   
stopping.   
surrender is easy as it requires no effort. it is the following of paths with  
the expectation of getting somewhere or something that takes great effort. a  
path can be usefull in that after travelling what is believed to be a path  
that will give you something in the future you become dissillusioned and  
realize you will never find what you are searching for and in this there comes  
a surrender. following a path is actually an avoidance of the fear of  
surrender that must be experienced to surrender. the ego does not have to be  
killed because truth includes even this. ego is simply the mind. in  
surrender the ego is still there but not identified with. there is only one  
real surrender. .. the surrender to the truth of who you really are. it takes  
less than an instant to surrender, but the WILLINGNESS to bear the pain and  
experience the fear without supressing or expressing it, even when you are on  
a cross and god himself has forsaken you, is required.

Actually, or rather paradoxically, to Not Question is the only sadhana  
required to practice the path of Surrender   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Japo,   
You say surrender is easy and requires no effort. It is not correct.   
The surrender, I mean, the total surrender, is as difficult as   
self enquiry. You again say, there is no need for effort. But   
to be in effort-free surrender, is difficult. It requires all efforts   
to be effortless. The total surrender has to be achieved with efforts   
to attain that state. Because we are always thoughts-bound   
and we make all sorts of efforts. Partial surrender, which we always do, is  
somewhat easy. But total surrender is not.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
You know when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Hill, in total mounam,   
someone broke the coconut on His head also. This incomparable   
Brahma Jnani was keeping silent and enjoying the cool coconut   
water dripping from His head to the cheeks.   
In Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there is one practice. When a Sri   
Vaishnava sannyasi (they call them Jeers, as you might have heard   
in Tirupati). When they leave the body, the devotees break a coconut on his  
head. If the skull breaks quickly, even before the   
coconut breaks, with one or two blows, it is said, that the   
particular Vaishna Sannyasi has attained realization!   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan Ramana was achalam, non moving. Muruganar says: Even Arunachala, the non moving Hill is quite shameful to see   
your greater non moving capacity! Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
1\. Some urchin passed urine on His back.   
2\. Some other fellow threw cowdung or some excreta on His back.   
3\. Some urchins pelted stones at Him.   
4\. Some bogus sadhus moved the rocks from higher level of the   
Hill so that these would roll down and hit Him.   
5\. Some sadhu applied green chilli paste on His body.   
6\. Someone tried to drop the cactus plant juice on His open   
eyes with a vacant gaze. (of course, this was not done).   
7\. One boy wanted to take His torn towel saying wittingly, "The   
Governor wants Your towel. Please give."   
8\. Only one boy saw Him and wept and then told Him to come to   
his boss so that he would give a job to Him, for the fees of 1   
paise per day! (That was the coolie fees in those days for child   
labour per day!)   
Bhagavan Ramana stood as achalam. Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
Arunachala Siva.

I read some books where it is said, when the life force leaves through the  
skull it is called KAPALA MOKHAM.   
Some sadhus know their ending so they would tell their followers what should  
done when he sits in samadhi.   
Some rare cases the skull would split then immedietly their followers put  
vibudhi, pachai karpuram etc. etc.   
then they close with mud and install Lingam. For some reason when it does not  
split followers would break   
coconut as desired by the sanyasis. Main dying will take place when our mind  
dies. That is important. It happened for Bhagavan Ramana.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What you say is true. In Yoga marga, the prana power breaks   
open the crown and leaves and there will be breaking of the   
skull. Saint poetess Avvaiyar says in her Vinayakar Ahaval: "Karuthinil kapal vayil kaatti...."

Bhagavan Ramana was achalam, non moving. Muruganar says: Even Arunachala, the non moving Hill is quite shameful to see   
your greater non moving capacity! Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
1\. Some urchin passed urine on His back.   
2\. Some other fellow threw cowdung or some excreta on His back.   
3\. Some urchins pelted stones at Him.   
4\. Some bogus sadhus moved the rocks from higher level of the   
Hill so that these would roll down and hit Him.   
5\. Some sadhu applied green chilli paste on His body.   
6\. Someone tried to drop the cactus plant juice on His open   
eyes with a vacant gaze. (of course, this was not done).   
7\. One boy wanted to take His torn towel saying wittingly, "The   
Governor wants Your towel. Please give."   
8\. Only one boy saw Him and wept and then told Him to come to   
his boss so that he would give a job to Him, for the fees of 1   
paise per day! (That was the coolie fees in those days for child   
labour per day!)   
Bhagavan Ramana stood as achalam. Achalame NaaNa achalamai

I read some books where it is said, when the life force leaves through the  
skull it is called KAPALA MOKHAM.   
Some sadhus know their ending so they would tell their followers what should  
done when he sits in samadhi.   
Some rare cases the skull would split then immedietly their followers put  
vibudhi, pachai karpuram etc. etc.   
then they close with mud and install Lingam. For some reason when it does not  
split followers would break   
coconut as desired by the sanyasis. Main dying will take place when our mind  
dies. That is important. It happened for Bhagavan Ramana.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What you say is true. In Yoga marga, the prana power breaks   
open the crown and leaves and there will be breaking of the   
skull. Saint poetess Avvaiyar says in her Vinayakar Ahaval: "Karuthinil kapal vayil kaatti...."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
You know when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Hill, in total mounam,   
someone broke the coconut on His head also. This incomparable   
Brahma Jnani was keeping silent and enjoying the cool coconut   
water dripping from His head to the cheeks.   
In Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there is one practice. When a Sri   
Vaishnava sannyasi (they call them Jeers, as you might have heard   
in Tirupati). When they leave the body, the devotees break a coconut on his  
head. If the skull breaks quickly, even before the
