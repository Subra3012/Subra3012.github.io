Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.   
Love!

dear skrudai I was in line with what you said, but maybe I was not clear  
enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,

Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.

and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had

this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,

I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a

impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

dear skrudai I was in line with what you said, but maybe I was not clear  
enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Dear matthias,   
 Turning awareness to Arunachala is forgetting one's sense of "I" for a few minutes. That wont help.   
That gives some bliss for sure...

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it

Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote

Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your

and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a

impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

dear skrudai I was in line with what you said, but maybe I was not clear  
enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

 SAT Sangh is not something to be "done". .. it is something to be recognized. .. that The Self every IS, here and now is to be realized. That understanding is true Sat Sangh.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

dear skrudai I was in line with what you said, but maybe I was not clear  
enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

Dear friends,   
 SAT Sangh is not something to be "done". .. it is something to be recognized. .. that The Self every IS, here and now is to be realized. That understanding is true Sat Sangh.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.

dear Skrudai   
the saint baba faqir chand said that it is the saint that you aline your  
awereness with that makes holy places holy...   
and this I feel is true...If I go into a beautiful church here in austria then  
I aline with christ there and I get something of his presence, I was also at  
the grave of Saint francis of assisi and I also fellt his presence and had  
visions of him at night...   
this is in fact just my energy or awereness that concentrates on the saint,  
this is the game of samsara or maya: action and reaction...   
I think you are right...but anyway arunachala and the shrine of ramana are a  
good thing to aline your awereness with...and I do think it will have an  
impression on your soul and conciousness.......maybe some seekers will need to  
visit this place to drop their body conciousness? who knows the ways of god?   
it has nothing to do with self realisation, but it is beneficial for the  
person who goes there, wen the mind goes there with the right attitude.....   
but it is a fact that it is just a spiritual projection....but it is indeed  
helpfull...

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they  
need not put in any effort from their side.   
One has no alternative but to know oneself and see within how nothing can  
affect them. Without this whether one is in arunachalam or in hyderabad it  
hardly matters.

dear skrudai I was in line with what you said, but maybe I was not clear  
enough....   
anyway I do know that this is sensation it had a begining abd it will  
end....like you say   
but now to turn arround every stone: you said that persons need this sort of projection, because so they do not  
need to but effort in their sadhana, but the fact that you turn your awareness  
to arunachala or to ramana is an own effort...   
so like I said it is a good thing but samsara   
so please read what I write before you going to deconstuct it

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear Matthias,   
 Very nice post.   
I am impressed by your experience of presence at the church and at the grave  
of Saint Francis. Now tell me. .. if one night can have such an effect... what  
would happen if you live your whole life there ?   
Strangely the answer to this question is "Nothing".   
The initial momentem wanes away. There are many people living there for long  
long time. .. what happened to them? Nothing !   
Please see. .. its like a person going to Himalayas. .. the first time he sees  
it he is awed ! But ask the person who had been staying there always. He will  
see it normally.   
Getting Awed or not. .. is at the mental level. We have to trancend this very  
mental level and be with the Self.   
I think only thing that can really help is understanding the Truth.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and Matthias,   
Your view, I would not say, is incorrect. But people who have been   
benefited have told this about Arunachala. Matthias felt the power   
in the church in Austria. People going to Vatican may feel higher   
power than in a country church. That is why, Arunachala Mahatmayam   
says about two things about Arunachala.   
1\. Those who see it, or even mentally think of it from afar will become   
self realized.   
2\. Those who live within three "yojanas" (about 36 miles) around   
Arunachala will be self realized even without initiation.   
Since Bhagavan Ramana Himself has praised these verses, I am   
sure, these are not exaggerations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
So everyone who lives in Arunachalam should be realized : by your idea?   
if that were so. .. why all this unnecessary sadhana? Just go to Arunachala.   
Sir, people want such sort of assurances. They enjoy it coz, for that they

Importance of Sat sangha   
Well. What are the steps to be followed for a person who steped into the  
Ramanar Vazhi. I think the person should move with the same kind of people who  
are already in vichara marga. I read that the people who attended there used  
to get their answers even they did not ask Him. The answers came through  
somebody's question. Where we will get this type of chance. I think all the  
doubts will be washed away if one see His own Self. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Fixing the mind in self is real satsangha.Because master is in such a state association with him amounts to association with the self.   
Mental association with the master is more vital than physical  
association.Even Siva told the same thing saying that those who have mental  
contact   
with Arunachala Giri will confer liberation,this is my order he said.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, Sat-Sangh is being with Sat.   
It may refer to the Self or the self-realized soul, the guru who   
is a Brahma Jnani.

In my opinion association with self itself is not right. we are self and there  
is nothing to get associatied with. but the literal meaning of sat sangha can  
be in association with those who have similar seeking (real seekers) so that  
lot of discussions on our understanding can be done to get more and more  
clarity. Further sat sangha will get is away from dhur sangha (Wrong  
associations) keeping us tight in our path. Without satsangha it is impossible  
to realise self and be in it as nochur venkataraman often puts in his  
discourses "andha nilaileye irukkanum" it is extremely difficult a process.

Dear ushanpri,   
I have mentioned, what Bhagavan Ramana said about Sat-Sangh   
on some occasions. But sat-sangh can also mean what you are   
saying, that is, the meeting of people, who are eager to realize   
the Self, by removing the non-self.

Dear friends,   
 SAT Sangh is not something to be "done". .. it is something to be recognized. .. that The Self every IS, here and now is to be realized. That understanding is true Sat Sangh.

Dear srkudai,   
I agree that the Self or Bhagavan Ramana, is always here and now.   
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there. It is like comparing a home   
altar and a temple, where in the latter the power is more. In   
Santa Cruz, California, there is one group called SAT, Society for   
Abidance in Truth and I think no body can name the Satsangh better   
than these people. This SAT has published the English Ribhu Gita,   
composed in free verses, by Mr. Nome and Dr. Ramamoorthy.   
May be it will be difficult for people in far off Western countries,   
to come to Arunachala in terms of money, health and distance.   
But even people who are in Madras, just 190 kms away have not   
visited Arunachala in their lifetimes. Perhaps, it depends upon   
one's destiny.   
When Annamalai Swami wanted to go back to Polur, his native   
place, for sadhana after 12 years of construction work inside   
the Asram, Bhagavan Ramana told him not to leave Arunachala,   
since the power is more in Arunachala, to pull the seekers quicker   
into the Self than other places. This is being felt by many devotees   
including me. Maurice Frydman, was going to Arunachala every   
week from Bangalore in his jeep, and when Bhagavan asked why,   
he said: I have to charge my battery every now and then!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
Quote  
But for seekers, going to Arunachala definitely help, because the   
Power of the Presence is more there   
Sir. .. i do not know. .. Right now, i am in the embrace of God. .. tell me  
where i will have to go ?   
Right now this very moment i do not see a better spiritual place than this  
... i do not find a more appropriate time than this. ..   
if at all anything is to be done. .. just remember our True Nature. Just revel  
in the presence of Ramana/God.   
Right now.   
What happens if a person goes to Ramanashram ? For the first day he will feel  
very special... due to his emotional attachment and soon it wanes away. .. and  
if he stays there a second day the effect will be a little less. .. and if he  
stays there for 100 days, 1 year. .. it will become normal too. Afterall it  
is an emotion and emotions cannot stay with us for ever.   
Someone once told me that if they stay at the Basara [Sarswathi temple in  
andhra pradesh] overnight, they will get some educational benefits. I said, if  
that is so, the beggar sitting before the temple should have been most  
educated person. One has no alternative than to understand himself and see  
the truth for himself. Grace and Presence are always there. .. no use longing  
for grace as if it is not there. .. it is here now... everywhere... same with  
presence. What one needs to do is See oneself. .. Observe one's mind and see  
how no thought can affect them and how indeed they are Awareness: Suddha  
Chaitanya Rupam sivoham Sivoham. Changing places does not change the person.  
Otherwise everyone in Arunachalam should have become realized. .. there too, i  
am sure, people would be there who long for money, food, name, fame etc - Who  
are tormented by the same feelings, anger, jealousy etc. It is not the place  
... but the person who has to change.   
I used to think in a similar way regarding Dakshineswar Temple. I still have  
emotional attachment to that place... coz it is where Sri Ramakrishna used to  
live.   
Same with Ramana. it is just emotional attachment. Perhaps due to emotional  
attachment, someone might remember one's True nature more and remain more  
dedicated at these places. .. that is why it is important. Coz right now, if i  
do not think this place is special, i might "take it easy" and not remain  
witness... but when i go to a Ramanashram. .. i might think it special and  
remain witness. .. so it is ultimately remaining witness that leads to  
liberation not going to a particular temple.   
and more important than all this is understanding oneself.   
Love!
