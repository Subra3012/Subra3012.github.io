Please, what is the correct spelling of "Arunachala"?   
Is Arunachala a manifestation of Shakti Ma too?   
Is there an Arunachala Shakti Mantra that can be used for Bhakti and for which  
no initiation is necessary?

Dear Jyoti,   
Arunachala - is the correct spelling. Arunachala is Siva with concorporate   
Sakti. Because, this is where Uma got her half-portion of Siva and Siva   
became Ardhnari- half woman / half man. Chanting Arunachla is chanting   
for both Siva and Sakti.   
Arunachala Siva.
