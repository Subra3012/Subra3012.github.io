Once a devotee of Sri Bhagavan, a leper, came to His presence and told Him  
that he was much disgusted with life and therefore wished to die. Sri Bhagavan  
kept quiet, but another devotee in His Presence pointed out the eleventh verse  
of Sri Arunachala Patikam in which Sri Bhagavan says: Lo! How many are those like me who have been ruined (i.e. have lost their ego)  
by thinking this Hill to be the Supreme! O men who, having lost the desire to  
live because of intense misery, are roaming about seeking a means to give up  
the body, there is on earth a rare Medicine which, without killing, will kill  
anyone who thinks of it even once within the heart. Know It is verily  
Arunachala! Hearing this verse, the leper devotee immediately fixed his mind  
on Arunachala and started to go round the Hill. Because his whole body was  
ravaged by disease and covered with wounds, he was only able to proceed slowly  
and with much difficulty. After many hours he reached this spot and, being  
very tired, he lay down on this rock and fell asleep. Soon he was awakened by  
a voice asking him why he was lying there. He locked up and saw a figure clad  
in white,   
but before he could answer anything, that person started to beat him with a  
bunch of neem leaves, saying, Getup at once, you have no business to be  
here! Being much afraid, the leper jumped up and started to run away, and  
only after running some distance did he notice that the wounds on his feet,  
hands and face had disappeared and that his whole body was completely cured.  
Wondering at the great Grace of Sri Bhagavan, he returned to His Presence and  
told his story. Though as usual Sri Bhagavan denied any doership.   
The place where he started running is called Siddhar Paarai, which comes on  
the way - Giri Pradakshina Route.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Please, what is the correct spelling of "Arunachala"?   
Is Arunachala a manifestation of Shakti Ma too?   
Is there an Arunachala Shakti Mantra that can be used for Bhakti and for which  
no initiation is necessary?

Dear Jyoti,   
Arunachala - is the correct spelling. Arunachala is Siva with concorporate   
Sakti. Because, this is where Uma got her half-portion of Siva and Siva   
became Ardhnari- half woman / half man. Chanting Arunachla is chanting   
for both Siva and Sakti.   
Arunachala Siva.
