## Karna

The most poignant character in Maharbharata is Karna. Soul Stirring. Oh  
Krishna! There is a lot of essence to learn from this song.   
This is a very beautiful song form Tamil movie Karna about Karna: Ullathil nalla ullam   
Urangaadhenbadhu   
Vallavan vaguthadhadaa, Karna   
Varuvadhai edhirkolladaa.   
The most beautiful amongst souls   
Shall never fall to the fatal tell of time   
Thus, say the greatest of men, Karna   
Prepare for the fate that shall be thine.   
Thaaikku nee magan illai   
Thambikku annan illai   
Oor pazhi etraayadaa   
Naanum un pazhi kondenadaa   
You aren't a son unto your own mother (referring to Kunti's desertion)   
And not a brother to each of your sibling (the Pandavas)   
Oh! How you bore the insinuations!   
I too shall be your sinner by my cunning. (The ploys Krishna uses to bare  
Karna)   
Mannavar paNi erkum   
KaNNan paNi seyya   
Unnadi paNivaanadaa   
Manniththu arulvaayadaa, Karnaa   
He who is served by the greatest kings   
(That) Krishna, to serve you, is ready   
By bowing to your magnanimity.   
Karna, will you grace me with mercy?   
Senjotru kadantheerka   
Seraatha idam sairndhu   
Vanjaththil viyinthayadaa, Karna   
Vanjakan, Kannanadaa   
To repay the hand that fed you   
You pledged your loyalty to the vile Kauravaa   
And fell in the trap of great deception, Karna.   
(Though) the greatest knave is the son of Vasudeva.   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj,   
Karna is one of the most famous characters of Mahabharata. It   
is only Bhishma who reveals about Karna's birth to Kunti much   
later in the story. If Karna had not been killed by foul means by   
Arjuna, the war might have had a different ending!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Mahabharata signifies that justice is hard as stone. Justice does not have any  
sort of emotions.   
Bheeshma took the vow of Brahmacharya for the sake of his father, Shantanu. He  
pledged that he would never forsake the throne of Hastinapura. Therefore  
Bheeshma could not help but just see Draupadi being stripped in the assembly,  
even though he knew the truth. He was more akin towards Hastinapura Throne.  
The Throne of Hastinapura blinded him. But he knew his end   
Dritarashtra was a typical human with too much affection towards his sons that  
it blinded him the Truth. But he knew his end.   
Drona who was in utter poverty, had no option but to be with Dritarashtra.  
Money for living blinded him. But he knew his end.   
Karna, who only took the side of Duryodhana just because he held him high when  
the whole world forsake him. Arjuna did not go about and tell people that he  
was the greatest archer, but it was, Bheeshma, Drona and others who held him  
high. Arjuna did not care to prove to anyone that he was a greatest archer.  
but Karna did not like everyone praising Arjuna even without proving his  
archery. He did not even bother to think what sort of person was Duryodhana  
before accepting his friendship. Initially Duryodhana praised Karna only to  
spite the Pandavas where as for Karna, it was a burning ego cooled down when  
Duryodhana accepted him. What was the need for Karna to get entangled in a war  
between two groups with who he had no connection? only because Duryodhana  
praised him! He also knew his end. Even when he knew that he was the eldest of  
Pandavas, he promised Kunti that the would not kill his brothers except  
Arjuna. after the war there would still remain Pancha Pandavas - Either He or  
Arjuna would survive. He could not accept this.   
He had a lot of Good qualities, He took a vow that in day time, whoever came  
to him for alms, he would never say no to them. Hence When Indra came he had  
to give away his Kavacham. There was no moderation in his vow.   
Balarama did not join the war on wither side because he was the teacher for  
both Duryodhana and Bheema.   
Krishna, who seems a man of stone, totally non emotional person is the all  
Supreme God. He did not have any MOTIVE at all. all else had some motive or  
the other. Krishna really did not play any role at all. He just flowed like a  
river!   
All the characters in Mahabharata are some way or the other to be found in  
each one of us. It is known as the 5th Veda.

Is the Mahabharata worth a read, is it Hindu philosophy or something. I have  
heard of it many times. What does Mahabharata mean?

Among all the people of Mahabharatham, who is brahmajnani. Did ever Krishna  
show His emotions.?

Dear I,   
I have always had some emotional connect with Karna, I don't know why. There  
is some greatness in him that nobody else had in Mahabharata.   
When all Pandavas died, they were all taken to hell first for all their sins.  
Only Yudhishtra was taken in a Golden chariot to Heaven, and on reaching  
Heaven, hist first glance fell upon Duryodhana and he searched and searched  
for all his brothers, but there was no trace of them anywhwere and upon  
enquiry with Yamadeva, he learnt about them being in Hell. He was shocked and  
questioned Yamdeva about how could of all Duryodhana be in heaven and his  
brothers in hell, it is absurd!!   
Then, Yamadeva narated to him how Duryodhana landed up in heaven. After his  
death in the battle, Duryodhana was taken to hell for his deeds, and soon  
after the death of Karna, the Devas came with a Golden chariot and escorted  
him to heaven, upon reaching heaven, Karna had only one thought in his mind,  
of his beloved friend Duryodhana. He searched and searched and when he was not  
to be found anywhere, he enquired with Yamadeva, and when he learnt that  
Duryodhana was in Hell, he could not control his tears, he immediately asked  
for himself to be sent to Hell near his dearest friend Duryodhana, and when  
Yamdeva refused and said that he can never do that because of his various  
misdeeds, Karna still insisted that atleast he be sent to hell and it doesn't  
matter to him, if he is in hell or heaven as long as he is with his beloved  
friend Duryodhana, such was his loyalty towards his friendship with  
Duryodhana. But Yamadeva too could not do that or even think about a person  
like Karna suffer in Hell, he pursuaded Karna that he would give him more  
luxuries and pleasures and highest place in heaven, still Karna, who was in  
sorrow, refused. Finally, Yamadeva had to bring Duryodhana to heaven just for  
the sake of Karna. After hearing this, Yudhishtra could not but just be at  
'awe' on Karna.   
Such was the greatness of Karna.   
This also illustrates about the greatness of Satsangh.   
To my knowledge, Krishna is the only Brahmajnani.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent piece about Karna. Karna is liked by one and all. But   
for his association with Duryodana, he must have made Pandavas   
look like mere chaff. Such a great dharmic, he was.   
Mahabharata is only a story but all required teaching for one's life   
are embedded there. Certain passages like Srimad Bhagavad Gita,   
Yaksha Prasna are direct philosophical teachings. There are prayers   
suitable for bhaktas too. Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam is the greatest   
prayer in Mahabharata.   
As for Jnanis, everyone is a Jnani only in that story. For some,   
the impurities were dense, for some others these impurities were   
less. I would put Bhishma as the first rank Brahma Jnani in that   
epic.   
Arunachala Siva.
