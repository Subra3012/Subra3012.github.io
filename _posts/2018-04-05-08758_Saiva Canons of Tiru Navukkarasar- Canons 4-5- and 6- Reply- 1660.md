Verse 8: பெருங்கை யாகிப் பிளிறி வருவதோர்   
கருங்கை யானைக் களிற்றுரி போர்த்தவர்   
வருங்கை யானை மதகளி றஞ்சினைப்   
பொருங்கை யானைகண் டீர்புக லூரரே.   
Siva covered himself with the skin of a male elephant which has a trunk with  
which it can kill and which came roaring having a big trunk. He is like the  
elephant which does not satiate, if we look at it very often. He is the  
elephant with a big trunk which fights with the five senses which are like  
frenzied elephants.   
Arunachala Siva.
