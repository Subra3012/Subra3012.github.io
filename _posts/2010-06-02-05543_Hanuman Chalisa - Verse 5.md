**Verse 5**   
 _Mahavir Vikram Bajrangi   
Kumati nivar sumati Ke sangi _   
**Meaning** :  **With Limbs as sturdy as Vajra (The mace of God Indra) you are valiant and  
brave. On you attends good Sense and Wisdom. You dispel the darkness of evil  
thoughts.**   
 **Commentary:**   
Here Lord Hanuman is praised being "brave" and "valiant" by Tulasidas.Here  
with the grace of guru/god our evil thoughts are dispossed off.   
As guru ramana says,   
As a lion seen in a dream by an elephant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a  
sage, awakens the disciple from the dream of ignorance.The cause of all  
miseries is the impure vasana, the belief that holds the body to be I.   
The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you will only  
receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of the ocean;  
the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is entirely upto  
you.   
Those who serve God (Siva) for the sake of objects desired do not (really)  
serve God; they serve the desired objects; hence they do not win the (true)  
reward of devotion. (105)   
In Nan Yar Paragraph Thirteen Guru Ramana says,   
Being completely absorbed in atma-nishtha [self-abidance, the state of just  
being as we really are],giving not even the slightest room to the rising of  
any thought other than atma-chintana selfcontemplation,the 'thought' of our  
own real self], is giving ourself to God. Even though we place whatever amount  
of burden upon God, that entire amount he will bear. Since one paramesvara  
sakti [supreme power of God] is driving all activities [that is, since it is  
causing and controlling everything that happens in this world], why should we  
always think, 'it is necessary [for me] to act in this way; it is necessary  
[for me] to act in that way', instead of being [calm, peaceful and happy]  
having yielded [ourself together with our entire burden] to that [supreme  
controlling power]? **Though we know that the train is carrying all the  
burdens, why should we who travel in it suffer by carrying our small luggage  
on our head instead of leaving it placed on that [train]?**

Dear prasanth,   
Nice post. It is the Guru who acts as a bridge beween the devotees   
and Godhead or the Self. Sri Govindarajiyam, a famous Sri Vaishnava texts  
says about Sundara Kandam: This Kandam displays only the guru-tattvam. Hanuman is the   
Guru between the devotee/Jivatma Sita and Sri Rama, the Paramatma or the Self.  
Guru is sent by God itself, to find out the devotee/ Jivatma and convey the  
good news that the union will take place soon. Hanuman as a guru goes to Sita,  
the Jivatma and there was no need for her to be worried and dejected and soon  
the Paramatma to come to her place and save her from 5 Jananendriyas and 5  
Karmendriays which constantly engage in thoughts/activity.   
This 5 + 5 represents the 10 headed Ravana.   
Arunachala Siva.
