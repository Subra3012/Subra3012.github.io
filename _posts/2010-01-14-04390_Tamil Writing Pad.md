## Tamil Writing Pad  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 14, 2010, 07:10:16 AM  
---  
I have created a Tamil Writing Pad through which one can write Tamil using  
English alphabets.   
Tamil is a bit different since some of the letters have multiple  
pronunciations.   
So multiple alternative English letters have been added for some of the Tamil  
letters.   
The special letters (from Sanskrit) of Tamil has not been included in this  
writing pad.   
You can try out the writing pad at: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_writing_pad.php   
Some examples are: 1\. ammaa [a2m-maa-]: **அ ம்மா**   
2\. maram [maram-]: **ம ரம்**   
3\. meesai [meesai]: **ம ேசை   
4\. thannnniir [thann-nniir-]: **த ண்ணீர்**   
5\. kullirkaalam [kullir-kaalam-]: **க ுளிர்காலம்**   
6\. vaazhaippazham [vaazhaip-pazham-]: **வ ாழைப்பழம்**   
Give your feedback in case of any issues.   
Have a nice day.

Dear silentgreen,   
Thank you very much. In fact, I tried two famous Tamil fonts,   
Azhagi and Kailai. But my comp. mechanic told me that I cannot   
use them since the virutal memory becomes too low, due to MB   
strength of these font-folders. I shall try yours and I shall also   
see whether I can change my machine to a more powerful one.   
The present one is Pentium 5, bought for my son, sometime   
in 2003 and I think it has outlived its utility.   
Arunachala Siva.

Some of the special characters have been included like, ja, ssa, sa etc which  
are used to form quite a large number of words and supported by unicode. For  
example: ஸ்ரீ [s2a-rii] is written using the character ஸ [s2a]

What is the difference from Tamil MS IME?   
The strong point is you do not have to remember the layout of Tamil keyboard,  
right?

I have not used Tamil MS IME till now.   
However I read about it and the differences seems to be as follows: 1\. For Tamil MS IME, you need to install fonts in your local machine; Tamil  
Writing Pad is on the other hand is internet based and there is no requirement  
to install any fonts.   
2\. Tamil MS IME is mainly for writing MS Word documents; Tamil Writing Pad on  
the other hand generates HTML code of alphabets which can be used to write  
Tamil alphabets in HTML pages; for writing MS Word document, the generated  
Tamil alphabets can be pasted directly on the MS Word document.   
3\. Tamil MS IME is for Windows machines only; Tamil Writing Pad can be used  
with any operating system which has the browsers installed: IE, Firefox etc.

I checked the website and was able to find the page and also generate some  
Tamil fonts from English.   
Maybe when you tried, the website was down for some time.   
This is the url for the writing pad: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_writing_pad.php   
This is the url for the symbol map, i.e. shows what english alphabets to type  
to generate tamil alphabets: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_symbol_map.php   
This is the url for some example tamil words generated from English: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_example.php   
All the urls can be navigated from the main page through links.
