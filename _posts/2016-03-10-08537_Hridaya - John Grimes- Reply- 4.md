Sri Ramana used the term Hridaya not to imply that there is a particular  
location or center for the Self   
but merely to indicate that the Self is the source from which all appearances  
manifest. He experienced   
the spiritual Heart on the right side of His body while maintaining that in  
reality it is 'located' both everywhere   
and nowhere. It is like Bhagavan's being everywhere but more powerfully here.  
He is nowwhere for He never   
had a form.   
According to Sankara, one's Heart is the temple (adhishtana) of Brahman, of  
the Self, and it is there that   
Brahman is experienced; it is the seat of Brahmanubhava. (Taitt. Up. Bhashya  
II. 6.1); Brahma Sutra Bhashya I.3.25: Brah. Up. Bhashya III. 9.23) Sri  
Ramana said, 'Therefore, it is stated, that what is called the Heart is no  
other than Brahman. Moreover, for the reason that Brahman shines in the  
hearts of all souls as the Self,' the name 'Heart' is given to Brahman.  
(Self Inquiry Section 9).
