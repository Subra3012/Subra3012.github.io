## Sanskrit Writing Pad

Sanskrit is an ancient language which is considered sacred. Lot of ancient  
scriptures like the Upanishads are written in Sanskrit. Hence whoever is  
interested in the ancient texts, whether writer or learners needs to be in  
touch with Sanskrit. Sanskrit language is written with Devanagari script.   
To make Sanskrit writing and learning easier, I have developed an online  
Sanskrit Writing Pad. With this pad, Sanskrit texts can be written using the  
nearest English alphabets. The generated text can be pasted in word documents.  
The writing pad also generates the Unicode of the text which can be used to  
create web pages. The approximate transliteration of the text is also  
generated by the pad.   
An example text generated by the writing pad is: ॐ हिरण्यवर्णं हरिणीं सुवर्णरजतस्त्रजम् ।   
चन्द्रं हिरण्मयीं लक्ष्मीं जातवेदो म आ वह ॥१॥   
\- First verse of Shree Suktam   
The Sanskrit Writing Pad can be accessed from this URL: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/sanskrit_writing_pad.php   
Symbol Map and examples are available at the site for getting started.   
Wish this would help authors to write in Sanskrit and learners to learn  
Sanskrit.   
Om Shanti Shanti Shantih.

Dear silentgreen,   
My delightful thanks to you. People like me, who know very little   
Sanskrit and particularly want to know about its sound variances and compound  
letters will use this Unicode Writing Pad to a great   
extent. Thank you, once again.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear soham3,   
Thanks for trying the Sanskrit Writing Pad. If you can tell me the exact error  
it will be easier to correct it, if any.   
I have written the Gayatri Mantra with the pad and got:  **ॐ भूर्भुवहः स्वः ।   
तत् सवितुर्वरेण्यं ।   
भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि ।   
धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् ॥**   
For this I typed:  _om bhuur-bhuvahah2 s-vah2   
tat- savitur-varenn-yam   
bhar-go devas-ya dhiimahi   
dhiyo yo nah2 p-racodayaat- _   
The letters to type can be obtained from the Symbol Map which has been made  
more user-friendly now.   
The approximate English Transliteration generated is: om bhuurbhuvahah svah   
tat saviturvarennyam   
bhargo devasya dhiimahi   
dhiyo yo nah pracodayaat   
The approx. transliteration closely follows the pronunciation given in the  
unicode chart for Devanagari alphabets.   
Also with this writing pad I wrote the: 1\. Shree Suktam: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/spirituality/mantras/lakshmi/shree_suktam.php   
2\. Hymn to Aparajita of Devi Mahatmyam: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/spirituality/mantras/durga/devi_mahatmyam1.php   
without any issue.   
Thanks for your feedback.

Dear soham3,   
You can read David Godman's remeniscenses about V. Ganesan's visit to  
Nisargadatta here: http://davidgodman.org/interviews/nis2.shtml   
Really nice story. I visited V. Ganesan's sharings several times. He gives  
very interesting information about Bhagavan and his closest devotees. He  
_remembers_ them well, and remembers not only information which one can  
receive from books but something more.
