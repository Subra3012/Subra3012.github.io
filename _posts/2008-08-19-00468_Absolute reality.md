Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Absolute Reality is everywhere, all pervading.   
During enquiry, Bhagavan Ramana wanted us to use a 'focal point'   
the Heart, where it is said to be. So, It is in us. If the self-enquiry   
becomes successful, we are Absolute Reality, the Heart, the all   
pervading, the 'bhuma' as Skanda (as Sanat Kumaraa) said to   
Narada, in Chandogya Upanishad. This Upanishad calls self-   
enquiry as Bhuma-Vidya.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sankar,   
 Are we not manifestations of the ultimate reality?Is there possibility of otherwise because ultimate reality is all pervasive.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Reality is alone IS. It is all pervasive,   
the One without a second. There is a beautiful piece in   
Ribhu Gita: How can I circumambulate, when there is no space with you?   
How can I bathe you, when there is no water without you?   
How can I garland you, when there are no flowers beyond you?   
How can I prostrate you, since your legs are everywhere?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, We are manifestations in our life and also during enquiry.   
We are Reality, Brahman, at the end.   
Arunachala Siva.
