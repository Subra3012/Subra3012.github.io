## Greetings, everyone.  
Author: Paul108h            Date: May 27, 2011, 11:02:03 AM

Hello. It's very nice to have found a place like this, though I haven't had  
much time to read a lot of the forum yet. I first started studying Ramana's  
teachings at the University at Buffalo, NY, around 1993. I don't know if I've  
ever told the early part of this story, and I have a few minutes so let's see  
how it went...   
I was enrolled in a hatha yoga class maybe I guess my second year of college,  
and I thought to check out the section in one of the libraries and found that  
there was a huge amount of yoga books there. I picked out a few; one that I  
remember was _The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga_ by Swami Visnudevananada.  
His physical abilities struck me as peculiar, and I thought this must be about  
more than health. The last third of the book explained the philosophy, and I  
found it fascinating. I read about 100 of the yoga books I found there, with  
my favorites being Vasistha's Yoga (It was a beautiful set of two hardcover  
books, about 8x6 inches, with fancy ribbon bookmarks) and the Talks with  
Ramana book. I remember at one point in chemistry lab mixing chemicals and  
having to figure out what they were, and wondering what is this stuff  
REALLY... So I just dove into these jnana books and was trying to get it, and  
was also practicing from Rammurti Mishra's Raja Yoga book and having to  
graduate a semester late because I stopped had my schoolwork but was able to  
finish with a course on mysticism and the yoga class for the fourth or fifth  
time.   
I also had an active social life, but my plan was that after graduation I  
would go live in a distant forest as a hidden hermit and either get  
enlightened or die trying. Funny thing, two weeks before my departure date I  
became emotionally intimate with a young lady acquaintance which ended up a  
month instead, but I was fully determined to leave everything and go, and I  
went.   
The destination was the Olympic National Forest, and I knew one friend who had  
moved to Olympia and I planned to stay with him briefly before setting out to  
the woods. One thing I had noticed was that my herbalist and foraging  
knowledge was not of much use since only maybe 15% of the plants were in  
common with the Northeast US. I arrived a Thursday night (Sept 28, 1995) and  
the next morning went to Olympia. There I bought a Bhagavad-gita by  
Bhaktivedanta Swami, thinking that its scholarly presentation could help me  
learn some Sanskrit, because I wanted to someday study Vasistha's Yoga in  
Sanskrit. However, to make a long story short (and I probably should fill in  
some more details, but I have to go to bed now), my mind was captured by this  
Bhagavad-gita and became a Hare Krishna devotee for most of fifteen years.  
Unfortunately (I suppose), I had a heck of a time dealing with too many things  
in their society that just didn't seem spiritual, scandals, corruption,   
"falldowns", conflict, etc., to the point where I decided I'd had enough and  
it was time to stop.   
That's easier said than done. According to the Vaisnava philosophy I learned,  
there are five types of liberation, and the kind of liberation that pertains  
to the advaita conception of oneness is unacceptable because it excludes the  
spiritual relationships between the Lord and the soul who gets that. They say  
there is no bliss in it and that because of that it is not eternal. They say  
that real bhakti is the only actual spiritual condition, and that it is  
achieved only in the absence of not only karma but also jnana. To go from an  
aspiring bhakta to a path of self inquiry, they say is spiritual suicide.  
However, what my experience has been lately is that thinking about Krishna is  
emotionally painful, and going back to Ramana's teachings quickly helped me to  
feel some peace again.   
I meant to also say that due to Krishna's intervention, I did not end up doing  
my hermit plan at all, and instead got married to the woman who I had left in  
Buffalo, and had five kids, one big happy family. Spiritually though, I feel  
a lot of anxiety because of such contradictory messages. I'm hopeful that  
some of you will be pleased to help me understand this better, but also please  
understand that I am not a pushover and sometimes cannot resist arguing a  
point for the sake of either understanding the other's point of view or  
getting mine across. I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss these  
matters with you and hope that I am not too much of a disturbance.   
Now I'd better get some sleep. Ramana makes me eager for it but Prabhupada  
taught that it was ignorance and a waste of time. Either way, I'm tired and  
have to get up in the morning. I suppose "I" means different things in  
different contexts.   
Also please forgive any typos or other oddities. I can't proofread now.

Dear friend,   
Prabhupada's understanding was incorrect. The individual soul [Jiva] and the  
Lord [Atma], if when united, either through devotion culminating in self  
surrender or through Vichara [Self Inquiry], the where is spiritual  
relationship? Relationship means duality. A should relate to B and vice  
versa. Relativity again talks about time and space relationships. Advaita  
talks relationship only upto the merger   
of Jiva and the Self. Thereafter there is only oneness.   
Sri Ramanuja [the founder of qualified non dualism] said: This Jiva will go to  
Vaikunta and be in the company of Narayana and after eons, will merge with  
Narayana. So he also accepts eventual non duality. Prabhupada did not touch  
about this aspect at all.   
Arunachala Siva.**

I am yet unable to discern what is actually correct, but what I was taught is  
that the distinction between jiva and Isvara is real and eternal, and to think  
otherwise, "There is no greater blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of  
Godhead." (http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/7/en "Śańkarācārya, who is an  
incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless because he is a servant carrying out  
the orders of the Lord. But those who follow his Māyāvādī philosophy are  
doomed. They will lose all their advancement in spiritual knowledge.") The  
condemnation is actually quite severe, but it is also control by fear. It was  
always a little disturbing to me, since I knew I was affected by studying  
Vasistha's Yoga and Ramana Maharshi's teachings previously. In Bhaktivinoda  
Thakur's "Vaisnava Siddhanta Mala," as I recall, he explained that the  
liberation which is achieved by the jnanis or impersonalists is like hell from  
the devotee's because it prevents devotional service. Pure devotional service  
is said to be far superior to what they would say Ramana experienced. Both  
are outside my personal experience, as is the question of whether duality is  
ultimately real in some way or not, so I am at a loss for how to view that.   
I do not know as much about the specific distinctions between the different  
Vaisnava sampradayas as perhaps I should, since I was focusing on Srila  
Prabhupada so much. But I'm not so interested in here-say lately, which makes  
a Ramana's teachings quite appealing. His explanations of self-inquiry have a  
noticeable effect on me, at least for a moment.

Dear Paul   
According to Advaita of Sri Sankara [which Sri Ramana has also adopted as the  
only true teaching] there is no difference between Jiva and Iswara, or the  
Self. The difference 'appears' due to our ego. Jnanis who have attained  
liberation even during their life time [i.e.   
Jivan Muktas] are totally egoless, which has come about through   
vichara or self surrender.   
Sri Ramakrishna also advocated Advaita though his life is predominantly of  
bhakti marga.   
For an advaitin, there is no difference between Narayana and Siva - both are  
personal gods. The Self or Atma is formless and nameless. One has to climb  
the ladder of devotion to attain jnana.   
God or the Self is Love and nothing but love. But Prabhupada's two groups, one  
in charge of Mumbai ISKCON and Bangalore ISKCON are fighting legal battles  
over their ownership of ISKCON. Where is love, where is compassion, where is  
grace towards each other?   
As Prabhupada, these two ISKCON societies are also of inadequate understanding  
of the Self. Festivals and vigorous dancing and cymbals shall not confer  
liberation. Mere tuft of hair and wearing   
dhotis alone shall not confer liberation. Liberation comes from peace within.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is no real difference. Bhakti and self-inquiry leads to one and the  
same, if others tell you otherwise, i suggest to be careful.   
Sri Ramana too showed His devotion attitude towards Arunachala.   
Sri Nissargadatta Maharaj showed His devotion towards His guru every day.   
Sri Ramakrishna, though He was totally devotion-path driven, always had  
Advaita as the meaning in His teachings.   
To my mind, what they are afraid of is losing their individuality, they want  
to retain their ego and enjoy sugar(Gods bliss). I remember one man, who  
chanted Hare Krishna for 6 months and Krishna appeared to him and he started  
teaching from there on. Once he said "why I need to lose individuality, I  
don't want to lose individuality...". This explains a lot.   
It is truly Gods Grace when a man just tries to find his own nature without  
going through all those religious cults etc.   
It may sound unbelievable, but the One who lead me to Sri Ramana was non other  
than Jesus Christ... I believe His main message was of oneness and Advaita  
too.   
By the way, you can find in this forum http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=6436.0   
There srkudai elaborates upon essence of Gita. Sri Krishna too taught Advaita,  
and actually the Gita is not about Krishna and Arjuna it is about the  
reader... so it is non understandable for me when I see scholars sitting and  
arguing about scriptures, while forgetting TO WHOM IT WAS WRITTEN.   
It all ends up with us, dropping all the knowledge that was landed upon me,  
how I feel myself? What do I believe? Why I believe? Who is this I?

Dear amiatall,   
Quite Nice. Regarding non-advaita devotees being afraid to lose individuality,  
and be always in Vaikunta in the august presence of Naryana, there is one  
story told by Sri Bhagavan: One Sri Vaishnava devotee came to Sri Bhagavan and asked Him: I am chanting Narayana's name everyday and am doing pujas for   
Narayana, will I go to Vaikunta?   
Sri Bhagavan said: Why not? You will certainly go to Vaikunta!   
The devotee: What will happen there?   
Sri Bhagavan: You will be in Narayana's presence, and several devotees would  
be singing his glory. It will all be quite pleasant.   
You can see Narayana all the time.   
The devotee: What will happen thereafter?   
Sri Bhagavan: If Narayana is very pleased, he will ask you to come   
near him and sit infront of him. You can also feast on his beauty.   
The devotee: What will happen then?   
Sri Bhagavan: Well, if Narayana is so much pleased with you, he will call you  
and whisper in your ears: Investigate yourself further   
with the question Who am I? You will merge with me.   
The devotee: I can do that here itself. Why should I go to Vaikunta?   
Sri Bhagavan: That is what I am also telling you. Do Vichara here   
itself.

LOL.   
No, they don't teach that in the Hare Krishna camp. They would think I am  
most fallen for even having the slightest desire to come here. I think it  
feels great. I so much appreciate being able to have these conversations.  
Today I've been working long and hard, and now my body needs a snack and some  
rest, so I can't type much.   
One of the first of Prabhupada's books I ever bought (there was a used  
bookstore nearby that had a few) was a separate printing of Chapter 7 of Sri  
Caitanya Caritamrta, Adi Lila, titled, "Lord Caitanya in Five Features." Here  
it is with just verses, each linking to the purports: http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/7/en   
... and here it is in book form, Chapter 7: http://files.krishna.com/en/pdf/e-books/Caitanya-caritamrita_Adi_Lila.pdf   
The main point of the chapter is Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu converting the  
"mayavadi" sannyasis to become Vaisnavas. Here is a brief excerpt: CC Ādi 7.109: "Śrīpāda Śańkarācārya has described all the Vedic literatures in  
terms of indirect meanings. One who hears such explanations is ruined.   
CC Ādi 7.110: "Śańkarācārya is not at fault, for it is under the order of the  
Supreme Personality of Godhead that he has covered the real purpose of the  
Vedas.   
CC Ādi 7.111: "According to direct understanding, the Absolute Truth is the  
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has all spiritual opulences. No one can be  
equal to or greater than Him.   
CC Ādi 7.112: "Everything about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is  
spiritual, including His body, opulence and paraphernalia. Māyāvāda  
philosophy, however, covering His spiritual opulence, advocates the theory of  
impersonalism.   
CC Ādi 7.113: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full of spiritual  
potencies. Therefore His body, name, fame and entourage are all spiritual. The  
Māyāvādī philosopher, due to ignorance, says that these are all merely  
transformations of the material mode of goodness.   
CC Ādi 7.114: "Śańkarācārya, who is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless  
because he is a servant carrying out the orders of the Lord. But those who  
follow his Māyāvādī philosophy are doomed. They will lose all their  
advancement in spiritual knowledge.   
It's pretty odd to think that God would want to promote atheism at some point,  
but that's what they say He does in this age. I figure that for Visnu to tell  
Siva to trick us just isn't fair, and I'd like to think He wouldn't do that to  
me after I've put so much into trying to serve Krishna.

Dear Paul108h,   
You talk about Sri Sankara and also say that mayavadi philosopher   
says such and such thing. It is not true. Sri Sankara only is called   
mayavadi. Here again, it is a mistake to call him as mayavadi, because he  
opposed the maya, ignorance, as anirvachaneeyam, i.e it cannot be described.  
He is in fact not a Mayavadi, because he said one should transcend the effects  
of maya, i.e. ignorance or non-Self and try to do vichara or surrender to  
merge with god, note, not to serve Siva or Krishna but to merge with Siva or  
Krishna. Names and forms are not important. Because the Brahman is nameless  
and formless.   
To serve Krishna is a incorrect attitude, as if Krishna has got no one to  
serve him. I do not marry a girl to serve me, but to have union with me.  
Merger with Krishna is advaitam and Vallabhacharya of Bengal popularised it.   
Arunachala Siva.

I've never directly studied Sri Sankara's teachings, so I'm not characterizing  
them by my view. I know of them indirectly through studying Ramana's  
teachings and hearing in his books that they are similar, and through the  
criticisms in Srila Prabhupada's books. I personally have thought the  
"mayavadi" label is used by the Hare Krishnas much more than is appropriate.   
I have also had doubt about the mayavadi label in general. In Bhagavad-gita,  
Krishna says that the reality always is, and the temporary is unreal, and  
Ramana says the same thing. Yet the Vaisnavas argue against teachings like  
Ramana's by focusing on maya. Last night I was reading a section from Sri  
Caitanya Caritamrta while composing my message here then, and I saw one line  
where Sri Caitanya said that the supremacy of the Personal form of the Lord  
over the Impersonal aspect is proven by the manifestation of so much variety  
in the world. Yet both schools call the material phenomena maya and say it is  
unreal. It does not seem fair to me to label another's philosophy according  
to what they say is unreal rather than what they say is real.   
They say the service is natural just my hands and feet serve me, and that one  
not in service is useless. Of course, the love is the real thing, but its  
expression is service. In the same chapter I mentioned above, Caitanya says: CC Ādi 7.145: "The Supreme Lord, who is greater than the greatest, becomes  
submissive to even a very insignificant devotee because of his devotional  
service. It is the beautiful and exalted nature of devotional service that the  
infinite Lord becomes submissive to the infinitesimal living entity because of  
it. In reciprocal devotional activities with the Lord, the devotee actually  
enjoys the transcendental mellow of devotional service."   
It is not portrayed like service in the material world, where people are  
forced into work they do not like to get something they want for sense  
gratification.   
Of course, if I was able to actually perceive such a relationship developing,  
and I think fifteen years of trying is a reasonable beginning, then I presume  
no doubts would have arisen.   
I'm being called away at the moment and can't proofread now, so please forgive  
if it's not very coherent.

Dear Paul108h,   
Now that you have been reading Krishna Chaitanya, you also try to   
read the abangams of Sant Jnaneswara either in Marathi or in English. He says,  
in his book Amritanubhava, the Jnana Bodham   
ie. Self Realization is experiential and cannot be fathomed by   
names and forms of god. Actually Amritanubhava is an Advaitic   
text. All Pandaripura bhaktas are treating Siva and Vishnu as inseparable and  
one should attain formless Brahman finally.   
That is why the staunch Vaishnavites do not recommend Bhakta Vijayam stories  
of Pandaripur devotees or Amritanubhava of Sant   
Jnaneswara. In fact, the Panduranga image in Pandaripur, does not have a  
conch shell and disc. On the head of the image is a Siva Linga. And if you  
see the original image without ornaments, there are huge locks of hair behind,  
indicating he is not only Siva but also Devi or Mother.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hello sirs,   
"Śańkarācārya, who is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless because he is  
a servant carrying out the orders of the Lord"   
So, if they admit that it is Lords doing, why they are not at rest? I can't  
understand that.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
There is another unique in Bhandarpur. There all devotees can touch "Vittal"  
Lord who is presiding deity there. Whoever comes to temple they sing bhajans  
because they say, if you sing vitoba comes as a person who sings along with  
us. Lord is happy to be worshiped by Nadopasana. Bhandarpur is vaikuntam on   
earth. (Bholoka vaikuntam).

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In Pandaripur, in the abangams of saints, they also say, Nateswari,   
that is wife of Nataraja, chandrachuda, one who wears chandra, moon. Like  
this, they do not differentiate between Vishnu and Siva and Devi. Devi is also  
called Gopala Sundari. Srimad Devi Bhagavatam describes Devi as Krishna.
