Dear Non-duel, I am enlightening? ha ha ha! I am a mudpot   
with some water on top, and I am reflecting the Sun, the son   
of Siva, Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, matchless after Sankara.   
Anyway thanks for being nice to me. I shall continue you write   
some nonsense, till I become silent by my Guru's Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, A day will come even everything will stop, all this writing   
coming out of ego's mischief, and from that day,Silence will prevail.   
Arunachala Siva.

All the mind's dangerous mischief stopped, albeit temporarily for me   
for about 15 days, when the computer stopped working. Silence   
prevailed. Today the mischief starts, "manam enum mayak kurangu..."   
the seemingly unreal monkey of the mind! Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyam ji,   
 Whether the mind is in agitation, calmness or otherwise how are you concerned ? Your mind is not you.   
Do you feel concerned when my mind is agitated or calm ? Same with your own  
mind, its not you.   
Be a witness like the movie screen is as the movie goes on whether its  
playing a devotional movie or an action movie, how does it matter to the  
screen ?   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, I agree with you. When the film is over, the   
Screen alone remains. There is no film, no 'seen', only the   
'seer', the Screen. Arunachala Siva.

A day will come to everybody when the notion that we are apart from the self  
is annihilated,then we will shed what we are not.
