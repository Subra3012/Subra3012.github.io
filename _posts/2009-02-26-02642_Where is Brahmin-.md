## Where is Brahmin?

There is a TV serial, definitely offbeat, in Jaya TV, Tamil channel,   
everynight at 8 PM. For a change, almost all the characters and   
families coming in the serial are brahmins by birth. Cho, the famous   
stage director, political commentator and editor of Tamil magazine,   
Thuglak, has written this story. In every episode, he comes in between and  
gives clarifications about age old practices like sacrifices, annual  
ceremonies, upakarma, celebrating Hindu festivals etc., The hero who has got a  
bend towards godhead and who lives in seculsion within a rich aristocratic  
family, goes away to Tiruvannamalai. The story has come up to this. The  
characters last night were speaking about Tiruvannamalai and Bhagavan Ramana,   
giri pradakshina etc.,   
It is definitely a different TV serial.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes , I have been watching this serial from the first episode. Finally we  
have something good in the Idiot Box. Commendable effort indeed by Cho. We  
need a lot of programs like this these days. The serial also speaks a lot  
about Ramanar whenever necessary. The story has also picked a lot from the  
story of Bhagawan as well. Like the curse of Nathan's family that each  
generation someone will become a sanyasi in their family.   
Prostrations to Bhagawan
