## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna about Faith and realization  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 24, 2010, 07:52:37 AM

**To believe that fire is in the wood is faith. This is one thing, but it is  
another thing to bring that fire out of the wood, to cook something with it,  
to eat this and to attain peace and happiness afterwards.**   
 **So to believe that God is in the world and to catch a distant glimpse of  
Him is one thing; but to come into direct communion with Him, to enjoy His  
company and taste Divine Bliss is another.** No one can set a limit to the  
various aspects of God which a Bhakta can realize. They rise ever higher and  
higher.   
A devotee: Bhagavan, why can some attain to realization more quickly than  
others?   
**Ramakrishna: It depends upon the Samskaras or impressions of previous lives.  
Nothing happens suddenly or by accident. A certain man drank an ounce of wine  
in the morning and began to act like a drunkard. People, seeing him, wondered  
why he should be drunk after taking one small glass of wine. Hearing them,  
however, another man replied: "Because he has been drinking all night." [p.  
324]**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna : As Attachment To World Grows Less, The Mind Goes Toward atman  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 24, 2010, 07:56:18 AM

**So long as there is attachment to worldliness, and thirst for objects of  
lust, so long there is attachment to the body. As attachment to the world  
grows less, the mind goes towards the Atman or the true Self and the  
attachment to the physical body becomes less.**   
When the attachment to the world has entirely vanished, Self-knowledge comes  
and the Atman is separated from the physical body.   
A man who has realized God becomes like the dry cocoanut, his soul becomes  
separate from his body and all attachment to the body leaves him. He is not  
affected by the pleasure and pain of the body; he does not seek the comforts  
of the body; he moves from place to place like an emancipated soul. "A true  
devotee of my Divine Mother attains absolute freedom in this life and is  
eternally blissful." When you notice that tears flow and the thrill comes at  
the repetition of the Name of the Lord, then you may know that attachment to  
sense-objects has become less and the devotee is on the path of realization.   
**For instance, if the match is dry it will ignite the moment it is struck;  
but if it be wet, you can strike it fifty times and yet you cannot get a  
light. Similarly when the mind is soaked in the water of lust and thirst for  
worldly objects, Divine enlightenment does not come in it, however hard you  
may try; it is merely a waste of time and labor. But when that water dries up,  
spiritual illumination comes instantly.[p. 337]**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishns says People's characters can be divided into three classes

People's characters can be divided into three classes,--Tamas, Rajas and  
Sattwa.   
**Those who belong to the first class are egotistic; they sleep too much, eat  
too much, and passion and anger prevail in them.**   
 **Those who belong to the second class are too much attached to work. They  
love nice, well-fitting clothes and are very neat; they care for a luxurious,  
richly furnished house; when they sit and worship God, they love to wear  
costly garments; when they give anything to charity they parade it.**   
 **Those who belong to the third class are very quiet, peaceful,  
unostentatious; they are not particular about their dress, they lead a simple  
life and earn a modest living**, because their needs are small; they do not  
flatter for selfish ends; their dwelling is modest; they do not worry about  
their children's dress; they are not anxious for fame, nor do they care for  
the admiration or adulation of others; **they worship God, give charity and  
meditate silently and in secret.**   
This Sattwa quality is the last step of the ladder which leads to the roof of  
Divinity. A person reaching this state does not have to wait long for God-  
consciousness. [p. 340]

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna Says What Will You Gain By Discussing Philosophy All The Time

Sri Ramakrishna: In this world of relativity, good and evil, virtue and vice,  
exist, but they do not touch the Lord. God is unattached to them--like the  
wind which is unaffected by the good or bad odor which it carries. His  
creation is of dual nature, consisting of good and evil, real and unreal. As  
among trees there are some which bear good fruits, others poisonous, so among  
human beings there are good men and wicked, sinful men. Wicked people have  
their place in the world. Do you not see that wicked people are necessary to  
govern the law-breakers and evil-doers of a community?   
Syam Babu: Sir, we are told on the one hand that man is punished for his sins,  
and on the other that God is the sole Actor, all creatures [p. 394] being  
humble instruments in His hands. How shall we reconcile these two things?   
Sri Ramakrishna: You talk like a gold merchant weighing things with his  
delicate balance.   
**Vivekananda: What the Bhagavan means to Calculating say is that you are  
talking like one intellect. who has a calculating intellect.   
Sri Ramakrishna: I say, O Podo, eat these mangoes! What is the use of counting  
how many mango-trees there are in the garden, how many thousands of branches,  
how many millions of leaves, and so on? You are here to eat the mangoes. Eat  
them and go away. (To Syam Babu) You have come into this world to realize God  
by means of religious works. Your first effort should be to acquire love  
(Bhakti) for the lotus feet of the Almighty. Why do you trouble yourself with  
other things? What will you gain by discussing philosophy? Do you not see  
that, four ounces of wine are quite enough to intoxicate you? Why do you then  
inquire how many barrels of wine there are in the wine-shop? Of what use is  
such vain calculation?**   
Doctor: God's wine, again, is beyond all measure. The supply can never be  
exhausted.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna Taught His disciples process of renunciation  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 25, 2010, 08:01:34 AM

**To destroy the pride and egotism of His disciples, Sri Ramakrishna told them  
to wear the [p. 417] seamless ochre robe of the Sannyasin and to take up the  
begging-bowl. Being Himself a perfect Sannyasin, He loved to see His disciples  
following Him in the path of renunciation. On different occasions He sent them  
out, as Buddha and Sankara had done with their disciples, to beg food from  
door to door.**   
One morning He called certain among His beloved ones,-Narendra, Sarat, Jogen,  
Niranjan, Kali,--and asked them whether they could go forth with the  
Sannyasin's begging-bowl and beg uncooked food for Him. It was indeed a great  
blow to the caste pride as well as to the sense of self-respect of these young  
disciples.   
**Obeying the Master 's wish, however, they took the beggingbowl in their  
hands, walked from door to door in the neighborhood, collected various  
articles of food, brought them before their Master and offered them at His  
holy feet. Bhagavan Ramakrishna, blessed them and rejoiced at their sincere  
and earnest devotion. This was the manner in which the Bhagavan initiated His  
disciples in the life of absolute renunciation. [p. 418]

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says He who has realized God perceives women as Divine Mother  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 25, 2010, 08:08:47 AM

**MASTER: "It is 'woman and gold' that binds man and robs him of his freedom.  
It is woman that creates the need for gold.** For woman one man becomes the  
slave of another, and so loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.   
"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion,he is no longer attached  
to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder,he is free from fear  
of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the  
other small.Which one will attract the iron? The big one,of course. God is the  
big magnet.Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can 'woman' do?"   
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, shall we hate women then?"   
MASTER: " **He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the eye of  
lust; so he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so  
many aspects of the Divine Mother.** He worships them all as the Mother  
Herself.

Sri Ramakrishna mentions about kamini-kanchanam, woman and   
gold in many of his conversations. But he took it too far, even   
not allowing women inside his room or joining the devotees.   
Only after Sri Vivekananda, women like Nivedita took up the   
path of SRK for their spiritual upliftment.   
Bhagavan Ramana, as SRK, did not ever touch the money.   
But in case of women, He did not differentiate between men   
and women. Many women devotees like Suri Nagamma, T.R.   
Kanakammal were allowed to sit inside the Old Hall and converse   
with women. He has said: Even women can take up sannyasa   
and attain their Atma Bodham. (Sri Ramana Gita). For that   
matter, Smt Visalakshi wife of Kavyakanta Ganapati was one   
of her earliest devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.
