## Who is afraid of death?

There was a concentration camp and there were prisoners during   
World War II. The prisoners were quite happy, playing cards,   
carrom and chess and laughing and giggling. One journalist came   
to interview them. He became aghast seeing the happy nature   
of the prisoners. He asked them: How come you are all extremely   
joyful. You are going to be executed in a month's time. Are you   
not afraid of the impending death?   
One prisoner looked at the journalist and said: At least our dates   
of execution are known to us in advance. But what about your case?   
You may even be shot dead tomorrow. Why should we worry about   
death at all? It may happen or it may not happen. Either way,   
we don't care. We are happy today. That is all.   
One Sanskrit pandit quoted a sloka from a scripture and said   
that we are not afraid of death because of our ajnana, ignorance.   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye! It is not due to that. It is due   
to the truth that in our intuitive knowledge, we are deathless.   
That is our real state. If this intuitive knowledge becomes, the   
experiential truth, then we shall fully understand that our intuitive   
knowledge is the truth.   
Arunachala Siva.

A logician once asked Sri Ramakrishna, "What are knowledge, knower, and the  
object known?"   
To which he replied, "Good man, I do not know all these niceties of scholastic  
learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and that I am Her son."

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to explain such things if someone asks   
with ardent interest. Otherwise, He will also keep silent.   
But if someone were to say: "I do not anything.," Bhagavan   
Ramana used to give two types of answers: 1\. He will say: "Find out who says 'I do not know'. Is it the   
Atma? Atma need not know anything. If it is your mind, when   
find out, 'What the mind is? Where is this mind when you are   
in deep sleep?'   
2. For bhaktas, who know only devotion, He would say "Then   
repeat Rama, Rama or Siva, Siva. That is sufficient. You need   
not know anything else."   
Arunachala Siva.

Within the "I do not know" expression is also hidden the "I know" expression: " _I know only my Mother Divine_ "   
That is the beauty of this sentence.
