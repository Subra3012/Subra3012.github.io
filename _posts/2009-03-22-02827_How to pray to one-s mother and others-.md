## Kavyakanta's poetry  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 22, 2009, 07:01:41 AM  
---  
Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri is known for his great poetic skills in   
Sanskrit. Once in a debate with Amba Datta in Navadweepa, he   
made the following quizzical poems: 1\. Parvati does not even see Siva's face twice in a month. Why?   
Ans: Because twice in a month, there is fourth day moon (chaturthi),   
when one should not see the moon on that day. Since Siva has got   
a crescent moon on His head, Parvati does not see Him for two days   
in a month.   
2. There is a girl is shamelssly showing her breasts to her   
father in law, on a hot summer evening. Who?   
Ans: Hitumbi, the wife of Bheema, is having persipiration on a summer  
evening. She removes her upperclothes to get some air   
by fanning with that uppercloth. Her father in law (Vayu - air)   
is seeing her bared breasts! Bheema is Vayuputra. Hence Vayu is   
Hitumbi's father in law!   
Arunachala Siva.

## How to pray to one's mother and others?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 22, 2009, 07:06:29 AM

Anyone should pray to his mother, by keeping the palms together,   
just above the stomach. This is to thank the mother for giving the   
birth to him from her womb.   
Anyone should pray to others, by keeping the palms together, on   
the chests. This is to say everyone is having the Self within the chest and  
the Self is praying to the Self.   
Anyone should pray to Guru, by keeping the palms together, on   
forehead. This to thank him for directing the buddhi in proper ways.   
Anyone should pray to God with raised hands and folded plams.   
This is to say that God should take him to the Heavens above.   
Arunachala Siva.

funny in buddhism the prostration goes the direct opposite way..hands over  
head(palm together) and then forehead chest stomach and then flat on the  
ground with the whole body and one last time raise the hands above the head...   
I do not know what this means..but sometimes I do this postration before  
buddha or Bhagawan...sometimes I also sit in meditationa nd visualize Ramana  
as my inner self sining in effulgence and then I make mental  
postrations...this always leads me to the self and sometimes to tears as well

Dear Subramanian,   
Its an excellent post!   
Really if we follow this each time the Bhavam comes automatically, for mother,  
Guru, God and others.   
Whether or not we pray intentionally or not, when we keep our palms as guided,  
the Bhavam comes automatically

## The Battle of Gods and Demons  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 26, 2009, 09:24:02 AM

Rig, Sama and Yajurveda are like the clothes of Hindu society. Those who give  
them up are in fact   
naked. This statement is endorsed by the following tale: Once upon a time, a battle occurred between the demons and the gods. It lasted  
for one hundred years at the end   
of which period, the demons defeated the gods. The humiliated gods reached  
Ksheersagar and prayed Lord   
Vishnu. Pleased by their prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared before the gods. All  
the gods greeted Him and said- "O   
Lord! In sheer violation of BrahmaÂ’s dictate, formidable demons have kidnapped  
even our due shares offered in   
the oblations. Protect us from the onslaught of the demons. We cannot fill  
them because they abide by their   
religion. Kindly show us a way to kill the demons."   
Hearing the pleas of the gods, Lord Vishnu produced Mayamoha from His body and  
giving them to the   
gods, said- "Mayamoha will cause illusion in the minds of the demons. The  
illusion will influence the   
demons to violate the path shown by the Vedas. You can kill them after that".  
Saying this, the Lord   
disappeared. The gods took Mayamoha and reached the abode of the demons.
