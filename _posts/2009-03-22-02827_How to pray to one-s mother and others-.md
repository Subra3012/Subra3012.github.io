Anyone should pray to his mother, by keeping the palms together,   
just above the stomach. This is to thank the mother for giving the   
birth to him from her womb.   
Anyone should pray to others, by keeping the palms together, on   
the chests. This is to say everyone is having the Self within the chest and  
the Self is praying to the Self.   
Anyone should pray to Guru, by keeping the palms together, on   
forehead. This to thank him for directing the buddhi in proper ways.   
Anyone should pray to God with raised hands and folded plams.   
This is to say that God should take him to the Heavens above.   
Arunachala Siva.

funny in buddhism the prostration goes the direct opposite way..hands over  
head(palm together) and then forehead chest stomach and then flat on the  
ground with the whole body and one last time raise the hands above the head...   
I do not know what this means..but sometimes I do this postration before  
buddha or Bhagawan...sometimes I also sit in meditationa nd visualize Ramana  
as my inner self sining in effulgence and then I make mental  
postrations...this always leads me to the self and sometimes to tears as well

Dear Subramanian,   
Its an excellent post!   
Really if we follow this each time the Bhavam comes automatically, for mother,  
Guru, God and others.   
Whether or not we pray intentionally or not, when we keep our palms as guided,  
the Bhavam comes automatically   
Nagaraj
