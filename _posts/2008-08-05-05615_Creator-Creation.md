Dear everyone, there is only Creator. Creation, sustenance,   
dissolution are all mental concepts, like wakefulness, dreams   
and sleep ad nauseum. Please go through Maandukya Upanishad   
and Gaudapada's wonderful Karika, verse commentary. He   
says about Ajata, which is what Bhagavan also advocated.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
Creation seen as separate from creator is maya.   
There are three things essentially : SAT (that which is always there as it IS,  
the SELF)   
ASAT(That which never was nor will ever be)   
MITHYA(That which appears to be when seen like a snake in a rope or a  
mirage.   
world is a mithya if not seen as one with SAT.   
Love!   
silence

Dear srkudai, you said it. Creation is MAYA, Creator is Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Creator and Creation, the Siva and Sakti   
(Maya) aspects, have been given by Bhagavan Ramana in   
Sri Ramana Gita, Chapter XII. All the clarifications required   
are there.   
Arunchala Siva.

Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says,   
Scriptures tells us to enquire the relationship between god and world but it  
does not tell that god created the world and etc etc... it is like  
relationship between pot and mud. mud is god and pot is world. So pot is  
neither true not false but it is dependent on mud. because pot can break any  
moment and finally only mud is remaining.   
 **Mithya means it is dependent on other thing** like pot which is dependent  
on mud.   
Ideally there is no relation between pot and mud as ideally pot is nothing but  
mud and there are no 2 entities to have relationship.Similarly between god and  
world.   
As per bhagavad gita lord krishna tells everyone/everything is in him and not  
otherwise.waves belong to ganges but not otherwise.

Dear Prasanth,i agree with your understanding.There is no creator as a noun to  
create creation.But west believes that there is   
creator as a noun and creates the world.Creator and creation are one and it is  
better to call creativity because the process is verbal in nature.What Udai  
wrote is also profound.It helps us to understand creativity.West believes that  
there is a beginning to   
creativity and they say it started 4000 yrs ago.To clear such things i started  
this thread by asking a question 'What is the relation between creator and the  
creation".
