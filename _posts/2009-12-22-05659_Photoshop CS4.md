**THE GREAT TEACHERS OF THE WORLD (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club,  
Pasadena, California, February 3, 1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses**   
Krishna teaches us not to shirk our duties, but to take them up manfully, and  
not think of the result. The servant has no right to question. The soldier has  
no right to reason. Go forward, and do not pay too much attention to the  
nature of the work you have to do. Ask your mind if you are unselfish. If you  
are, never mind anything, nothing can resist you! Plunge in! Do the duty at  
hand. And when you have done this, by degrees you will realise the Truth: "Whosoever in the midst of intense activity finds intense peace, whosoever in  
the midst of the greatest peace finds the greatest activity, he is a Yogi, he  
is a great soul, he has arrived at perfection."   
Now, you see that the result of this teaching is that all the duties of the  
world are sanctified. There is no duty in this world which we have any right  
to call menial: and each man's work is quite as good as that of the emperor on  
his throne.   
Listen to Buddha's message  a tremendous message. It has a place in our  
heart. Says Buddha, " **Root out selfishness, and everything that makes you  
selfish. Have neither wife, child, nor family. Be not of the world; become  
perfectly unselfish. " A worldly man thinks he will be unselfish, but when he  
looks at the face of his wife it makes him selfish. The mother thinks she will  
be perfectly unselfish, but she looks at her baby, and immediately selfishness  
comes.** So with everything in this world. As soon as selfish desires arise,  
as soon as some selfish pursuit is followed, immediately the whole man, the  
real man, is gone: he is like a brute, he is a slave' he forgets his fellow  
men. No more does he say, "You first and I afterwards," but it is "I first and  
let everyone else look out for himself."   
We find that Krishna's message has also a place for us. Without that message,  
we cannot move at all. We cannot conscientiously and with peace, joy, and  
happiness, take up any duty of our lives without listening to the message of  
Krishna: " **Be not afraid even if there is evil in your work, for there is no  
work which has no evil.** " "Leave it unto the Lord, and do not look for the  
results."   
On the other hand, there is a corner in the heart for the other message: Time  
flies; this world is finite and all misery. With your good food, nice clothes,  
and your comfortable home, O sleeping man and woman, do you ever think of the  
millions that are starving and dying? Think of the great fact that it is all  
misery, misery, misery! **Note the first utterance of the child: when it  
enters into the world, it weeps. That is the fact  the child-weeps. This is a  
place for weeping! If we listen to the Messenger, we should not be selfish.**   
Behold another Messenger, He of Nazareth. He teaches, " **Be ready, for the  
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.** " I have pondered over the message of Krishna,  
and am trying to work without attachment, but sometimes I forget. Then,  
suddenly, comes to me the message of Buddha: "Take care, for everything in the  
world as evanescent, and there is always misery in this life." I listen to  
that, and I am uncertain which to accept. Then again comes, like a  
thunderbolt, the message: "Be ready, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Do  
not delay a moment. Leave nothing for tomorrow. Get ready for the final event,  
which may overtake you immediately, even now. That message, also, has a place,  
and we acknowledge it. We salute the Messenger, we salute the Lord.   
 **And then comes Mohammed, the Messenger of equality**. You ask, "What good  
can there be in his religion?" If there were no good, how could it live? The  
good alone lives, that alone survives; because the good alone is strong,  
therefore it survives. How long is the life of an impure man, even in this  
life? Is not the life of the pure man much longer? Without doubt, for purity  
is strength, goodness is strength. How could Mohammedanism have lived, had  
there been nothing good in its teaching? There is much good. Mohammed was the  
Prophet of equality, of the brotherhood of man, the brotherhood of all  
Mussulmans   
 **Mohammed by his life showed that amongst Mohammedans there should be  
perfect equality and brotherhood.** There was no question of race, caste,  
creed, colour, or sex. The Sultan of Turkey may buy a Negro from the mart of  
Africa, and bring him in chains to Turkey; but should he become a Mohammedan  
and have sufficient merit and abilities, he might even marry the daughter of  
the Sultan. Compare this with the way in which the Negroes and the American  
Indians are treated in this country! And what do Hindus do? If one of your  
missionaries chance to touch the food of an orthodox person, he would throw it  
away. Notwithstanding our grand philosophy, you note our weakness in practice;  
but there You see the greatness of the Mohammedan beyond other races, showing  
itself in equality, perfect equality regardless of race or colour.   
 **Remember the words of Jesus: "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!" **This  
very moment let everyone of us make a staunch resolution: "I will become a  
Prophet, I will become a messenger of Light, I will become a child of God,  
nay, I will become a God!"

**LORD BUDDHA (Delivered in Detroit)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses  
In every religion we find one type of self-devotion particularly developed.  
The type of working without a motive is most highly developed in Buddhism. Do  
not mistake Buddhism and Brâhminism. In this country you are very apt to do  
so. Buddhism is one of our sects. It was founded by a great man called  
Gautama, who became disgusted at the eternal metaphysical discussions of his  
day, and the cumbrous rituals, and more especially with the caste system.   
Some people say that we are born to a certain state, and therefore we are  
superior to others who are not thus born. He was also against the tremendous  
priestcraft. He preached a religion in which there was no motive power, and  
was perfectly agnostic about metaphysics or theories about God. He was often  
asked if there was a God, and he answered, he did not know. When asked about  
right conduct, he would reply, "Do good and be good." There came five  
Brâhmins, who asked him to settle their discussion. One said, "Sir, my book  
says that God is such and such, and that this is the way to come to God."   
Another said, "That is wrong, for my book says such and such, and this is the  
way to come to God"; and so the others. He listened calmly to all of them, and  
then asked them one by one, "Does any one of your books say that God becomes  
angry, that He ever injures anyone, that He is impure?" "No, Sir, they all  
teach that God is pure and good." " **Then, my friends, why do you not become  
pure and good first, that you may know what God is?** "   
Of course I do not endorse all his philosophy. I want a good deal of  
metaphysics, for myself. I entirely differ in many respects, but, because I  
differ, is that any reason why I should not see the beauty of the man? He was  
the only man who was bereft of all motive power. There were other great men  
who all said they were the Incarnations of God Himself, and that those who  
would believe in them would go to heaven. But what did Buddha say with his  
dying breath? " **None can help you; help yourself; work out your own  
salvation.** " He said about himself, "Buddha is the name of infinite  
knowledge, infinite as the sky; I, Gautama, have reached that state; you will  
all reach that too if you struggle for it." Bereft of all motive power, he did  
not want to go to heaven, did not want money; he gave up his throne and  
everything else and went about begging his bread through the streets of India,  
preaching for the good of men and animals with a heart as wide as the ocean.   
 **He was the only man who was ever ready to give up his life for animals to  
stop a sacrifice. He once said to a king, "If the sacrifice of a lamb helps  
you to go to heaven, sacrificing a man will help you better; so sacrifice me."  
The king was astonished. And yet this man was without any motive power. He  
stands as the perfection of the active type, and the very height to which he  
attained shows that through the power of work we can also attain to the  
highest spirituality.**   
To many the path becomes easier if they believe in God. But the life of Buddha  
shows that even a man who does not believe in God, has no metaphysics, belongs  
to no sect, and does not go to any church, or temple, and is a confessed  
materialist, even he can attain to the highest. We have no right to judge him.  
I wish I had one infinitesimal part of Buddha's heart. Buddha may or may not  
have believed in God; that does not matter to me. He reached the same state of  
perfection to which others come by Bhakti  love of God  Yoga, or Jnâna.  
**Perfection does not come from belief or faith. Talk does not count for  
anything. Parrots can do that. Perfection comes through the disinterested  
performance of action.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda About Meditation

**MEDITATION (Delivered at the Washington Hall, San Francisco, April 3, 1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses  
There are three stages in meditation. The first is what is called [  
**Dhâranâ** ], concentrating the mind upon an object. I try to concentrate my  
mind upon this glass, excluding every other object from my mind except this  
glass. But the mind is wavering. . . When it has become strong and does not  
waver so much, it is called [ **Dhyâna** ], meditation. And then there is a  
still higher state when the differentiation between the glass and myself is  
lost  [ **Samâdhi or absorption** ]. The mind and the glass are identical. I  
do not see any difference.   
Meditation consists in this practice [of dissolving every thing into the  
ultimate Reality  spirit]. The solid melts into liquid, that into gas, gas  
into ether, then mind, and mind will melt away. All is spirit.   
I am never Râma [never one with Ishvara, the personal aspect of God], but I am  
[one with Brahman, the impersonal, all-pervading existence]. **Here is a huge  
mass of clay. Out of that clay I made a little [mouse] and you made a little  
[elephant]. Both are clay. Melt both down They are essentially one. "I and my  
Father are one." [But the clay mouse can never be one with the clay  
elephant.]**   
I stop somewhere; I have a little knowledge. You a little more; you stop  
somewhere. There is one soul which is the greatest of all. This is Ishvara,  
Lord of Yoga [God as Creator, with attributes]. He is the individual. He is  
omnipotent. He resides in every heart. There is no body. He does not need a  
body. All you get by the practice of meditation etc., you can get by  
meditation upon Ishvara, Lord of Yogis.. ..   
Meditation means the mind is turned back upon itself. The mind stops all the  
[thought-waves] and the world stops. Your consciousness expands. Every time  
you meditate you will keep your growth.. .. Work a little harder, more and  
more, and meditation comes. You do not feel the body or anything else. When  
you come out of it after the hour, you have had the most beautiful rest you  
ever had in your life. That is the only way you ever give rest to your system.   
The greatest thing is meditation. It is the nearest approach to spiritual life  
 the mind meditating. It is the one moment in our daily life that we are not  
at all material  the Soul thinking of Itself, free from all matter  this  
marvellous touch of the Soul!

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda on Concentration

_CONCENTRATION (Delivered at the Washington Hall, San Francisco, on March 16,  
1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses _   
Concentration, of course, comes from various sources. Through the senses you  
can get concentration. Some get it when they hear beautiful music, others when  
they see beautiful scenery.. .. Some get concentrated by lying upon beds of  
spikes, sharp iron spikes, others by sitting upon sharp pebbles. These are  
extraordinary cases [using] most unscientific procedure. Scientific procedure  
is gradually training the mind.   
One gets concentrated by holding his arm up. Torture gives him the  
concentration he wants. But all these are extraordinary.   
My old master used to say, "When the lotus of the heart has bloomed, the bees  
will come by themselves." Men like that are there yet. They need not talk.. ..  
When the man is perfect from his heart, without a thought of hatred, all  
animals will give up their hatred [before him]. So with purity. These are  
necessary for our dealings with our fellow beings. We must love all.. .. **We  
have no business to look at the faults of others: it does no good We must not  
even think of them. Our business is with the good. We are not here to deal  
with faults. Our business is to be good.**   
 **External purity is very easy and all the world rushes towards [it].** If a  
certain kind of dress is the kind of morality [to be observed], any fool can  
do that. When it is grappling with the mind itself, it is hard work.   
The people who do external, superficial things are so self-righteous! I  
remember, when I was a boy I had great regard for the character of Jesus  
Christ. [Then I read about the wedding feast in the Bible.] I closed the book  
and said, "He ate meat and drank wine! He cannot be a good man."   
 **We are always losing sight of the real meaning of things.** The little  
eating and dress! Every fool can see that. Who sees that which is beyond? It  
is culture of the heart that we want.. .. One mass of people in India we see  
bathing twenty times a day sometimes, making themselves very pure. And they do  
not touch anyone.. .. The coarse facts, the external things! **[If by bathing  
one could be pure,] fish are the purest beings.**   
 **Bathing, and dress, and food regulation  all these have their proper value  
when they are complementary to the spiritual.. ...** That first, and these all  
help. But without it, no amount of eating grass... is any good at all. They  
are helps if properly understood. But improperly understood, they are  
derogatory.. ..   
Another thing:. .. [Spirituality] evaporates when they say, "This is right,  
and that is wrong." All quarrels are [with forms and creeds] never in the  
spirit. The Buddhist offered for years glorious preaching; gradually, this  
spirituality evaporated.. .. [Similarly with Christianity.] And then began the  
quarrel whether it is three gods in one or one in three, when nobody wants to  
go to God Himself and know what He is. We have to go to God Himself to know  
whether He is three in one or one in three.   
Now, with this explanation, the posture. Trying to control the mind, a certain  
posture is necessary. Any posture in which the person can sit easily  that is  
the posture for that person. As a rule, you will find that the spinal column  
must be left free. It is not intended to bear the weight of the body.. .. The  
only thing to remember in the sitting posture: [use] any posture in which the  
spine is perfectly free of the weight of the body.   
Next [ **Prânâyâma** ]. .. the breathing exercises. A great deal of stress is  
laid upon breathing.. .. What I am telling you is not something gleaned from  
some sect in India. It is universally true. Just as in this country you teach  
your children certain prayers, [in India] they get the children and give them  
certain facts etc.   
Next comes **Dhâranâ** [concentration].. .. Dharana is holding the mind in  
certain spots.   
The Hindu boy or girl. .. gets initiation. He gets from his Guru a word. This  
is called the root word. This word is given to the Guru [by his Guru], and he  
gives it to his disciple. One such word is OM. All these symbols have a great  
deal of meaning, and they hold it secret, never write it. They must receive it  
through the ear  not through writing  from the teacher, and then hold it as  
God himself. Then they meditate on the word.. ..   
Then comes **meditation**. That is the highest state.. .. When [the mind] is  
doubtful that is not its great state. Its great state is meditation. It looks  
upon things and sees things, not identifying itself with anything else. As  
long as I feel pain, I have identified myself with the body. When I feel joy  
or pleasure, I have identified myself with the body. But the high state will  
look with the same pleasure or blissfulness upon pleasure or upon pain.. ..  
Every meditation is direct superconsciousness. In perfect concentration the  
soul becomes actually free from the bonds of the gross body and knows itself  
as it is. Whatever one wants, that comes to him. Power and knowledge are  
already there. The soul identifies itself with that which is powerless matter  
and thus weeps. It identifies itself with mortal shapes.. .. But if that free  
soul wants to exercise any power, it will have it. If it does not, it does not  
come. He who has known God has become God. There is nothing impossible to such  
a free soul. No more birth and death for him. He is free for ever.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Srila Prabhupada on Profit and Loss  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:44:36 AM  
---  
In the evening, Srila Prabhupada lectured again on Bhagavad-gita. He chose  
Text 13 of Chapter Two: dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara. As he  
started to explain the meaning, a child began to cry. Prabhupada chuckled.  
Generally, he became annoyed when interrupted in class. When the devotees saw  
their spiritual master take the disturbance in stride, they were relieved and  
also laughed. Prabhupada used the child's crying to make a point: "So on one  
side, profit; on one side, loss. On one side, you get a child; and on the  
other side, you cannot hear. This is the material world. **As soon as you get  
some profit here, on another side, there is loss. As soon as you want to  
construct a big skyscraper, on another side-digging earth. "**   
Srila Prabhupada derided the foolishness of modern man, who engages in  
"digging and piling," never questioning the usefulness of his endeavor. He  
never considers that he will soon have to leave his body against his will, and  
he shows no interest in the message of Bhagavad-gita that you are not this  
body, but the proprietor within.   
Prabhupada next explained that the word "occupier" is more appropriate than  
the term "proprietor": " **If you rent a house, the proprietor is a different  
man. The tenant is the occupier; no proprietorship. So I am the spirit soul. I  
am not the proprietor. I am simply an occupier. The rascal materialists do not  
know that the proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He is  
giving me a particular apartment according to my capacity for paying rent. "**   
" **This is my position; otherwise, why doesn 't everyone get a first-class  
body, a king's body or rich man's body? One child is born-immediately he is a  
rich man. So there is no arrangement? And another child born at the same  
moment is a very poor man. Why?** Because if I am able to pay more rent, I  
transfer to another, very luxurious apartment. Or if I cannot pay the present  
rent, then I have to move to another, less expensive apartment."   
 _Then Srila Prabhupada described how the environment affects our  
consciousness: "A poor man living in a poor cottage or very unclean apartment-  
his mentality is one way. Another respectable gentleman living in a very nice  
house, his mentality is different. So according to the circumstances, the  
mental changes are there, but both men are human beings. Similarly, there are  
so many apartments, or different types of bodies-8,400,000 types of bodies.  
The occupier, the living being or the soul, is of the same quality, but  
according to the apartment or body he has occupied, he has developed a certain  
consciousness and mentality."_   
Prabhupada reminded his young audience that their birth in a developed country  
such as Germany was testimony of past pious activities and offered them a  
great opportunity for self-realization: "If you have done nicely to occupy a  
first-class apartment, then nature will give you a nice body. Therefore I say  
repeatedly that you Western boys and girls-you are given a very good chance by  
nature. Once upon a time, the European people were dominating all over the  
world, because they are very intelligent. They have got good resources, good,  
nice body, beautiful body. Everything is very good. But don't spoil it; use it  
for understanding further good."   
 **He said that misidentification with one 's land of birth should not let us  
forget that God is the creator and therefore the actual proprietor of  
everything: "Why I am falsely identifying myself with the land? 'I am German  
because I am born in this land of Germany.' That is also false. No land is  
Germany or France or England. Land is land. You have falsely named it: 'This  
is Germany.' What is this Germany? Say two or three hundred years ago, there  
was no Germany. The land was created by God. So it is God's property. Where is  
the difficulty to understand? You did not create anything, not even your own  
body. That proprietor is also Krsna. Because as soon as Krsna asks you,  
'Please vacate,' you must vacate immediately. Can you remain in this body? The  
proprietor asks you to vacate. So you have to vacate. Or the proprietor does  
not repair it. Then you voluntarily vacate: 'This is not useful anymore.'"**   
Returning to the Sanskrit verse, Prabhupada illustrated another meaning of it,  
namely, the imperceptible nature of the bodily changes and how the soul, as an  
observer, is always the same: "So it is to be understood that I existed in the  
past in a different body. As I existed, say seventy years before in a  
different body, I was jumping as a boy. Now I cannot jump; now I have to use  
the cane. This is a different body. If the same body still existed, then I  
could jump like a boy. I remember that I jumped. But now it is not possible. I  
have to take the help of three men." Prabhupada laughed, and the devotees  
joined in. He was in a jolly mood, pleased to see many young faces. He hoped  
that they would take Krsna consciousness seriously before their bodies  
dwindled with old age and the great opportunity to achieve perfection within  
this lifetime was lost.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Dayananda Saraswati

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayananda_Saraswati   
http://www.satyarthprakash.com/   
Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati(February 12, 1824  October 31, 1883) **was an  
important Hindu religious scholar, reformer and the founder of the Arya Samaj,  
"Society of Nobles", a Hindu reform movement, founded in 1875.**   
**He was the first man who gave the call for Swarajya - "India for Indians" in  
1876 which was later furthered by Lokmanya Tilak.** Denouncing idolatry and  
ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards  
reviving Vedic ideologies, subsequently philosopher and President of India, S.  
Radhakrishnan, later called him one of "makers of Modern India" as did Sri  
Aurobindo.   
One of his notable disciples was Shyamji Krishna Varma who founded India House  
in London and guided other revolutionaries like Madam Cama, Veer Sawarkar,  
Lala Hardyal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Bhagat Singh and others. His other disciples  
were Swami Shraddhanand, Lala Lajpat Rai and others who got their inspiration  
from his writings.   
**His book Satyarth Prakash contributed to the Indian independence movementis  
one of his great contributions.**   
He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from his boyhood, and a scholar, who believed in  
the infallible authority of the Vedas.   
Among Maharishi Dayananda's contributions are his promoting of the equal  
rights of women - such as the right to education and reading of Indian  
scriptures - and his translation of the Vedas from Sanskrit to Hindi so that  
the common person may be able to read the Vedas.   
Dayananda was born on on February 12 in 1824, in the village of Tankara near  
Morvi (Morbi) in the Kathiawar region (present Rajkot district), of the  
princely state of Gujarat, into a affluent and devout Brahmin family of  
Krishna Lal Tiwari and Yashodabai.   
**Swami Dayananda 's creation, the Arya Samaj, is a unique contribution in  
Hinduism.** The Arya Samaj unequivocally condemns idol-worship, animal  
sacrifices, ancestor worship, pilgrimages, priestcraft, offerings made in  
temples, the caste system, untouchability, child marriages and discrimination  
against women on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. The Arya  
Samaj discourages dogma and symbolism and encourages skepticism in beliefs  
that run contrary to common sense and logic. To many people, the Arya Samaj  
aims to be a "universal society" based on the authority of the Vedas.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Secret of Eternal Youth By Param Pujya Sant Shri Asaramji Bapu  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 05:09:22 AM  
---  
First of all, let us understand the meaning of Brahmacharya.   
'Yajnavalkya Samhita' states: "Brahmacharya is abstaining from all kinds of Maithuna or sexual enjoyment  
forever, in all places and in all conditions- physically, mentally and  
verbally."   
The great sage Vyasa said: 'To abandon the pleasure gained through the sexual organs by restraint is  
defined as celibacy."   
Lord Siva said to Goddess Parvati,   
"O Parvati! What is there on this earth which cannot be accomplished if one  
has control over his sexual fluid?" That is, all powers reside at the divine  
feet of the Enlightened Urdhvareta (one who is able to sublimate his sexual  
energy through the practice of yoga). In fact, Siddhis (divine powers) become  
his facile servants. Such a Sadhaka can attain Self-Realisation within a short  
span of time. Even the gods (deities) have attained immortality through  
Brahmacharya".   
"The gods have conquered death by Brahmacharya and penance. Indra, the King of  
gods, has attained a still higher status, through the self-discipline of  
Brahmacharya." (Atharva veda: 1. 5. 19)   
 **Preservation of semen gives life**   
Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as the  
buttermilk is thinned after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned  
by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen, the more the body deteriorates  
and weakens. **The preservation of semen is the secret of good health and  
longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and  
spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of Brahmacharya will tide over  
a crisis of any disease very easily.** One who follows Brahmacharya strictly  
is usually not afflicted by any disease. That is why, in scriptures, it is  
said: "Death is hastened by letting out semen from the body. Life is saved and  
prolonged by preserving it. Semen is the real vitality in men. It is the  
hidden treasure in man."   
"There is no doubt that people die prematurely by letting the semen out of the  
body; knowing this, the Yogi should always preserve semen and lead a life of  
strict celibacy." \- Siva Samhita   
 **How is semen formed?   
According to Ayurveda, from the digested food chyle is formed. Out of chyle  
comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat  
comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. Conversion of  
Dhatu at every step takes a period of five days. Thus semen is the last Dhatu  
that is formed out of food. It takes approximately 30 days and 4 hours to  
complete this cycle. Scientists believe that an intake of 32 kgs. Of food  
produces 800 Gms. of blood, which in turn forms only 20 Gms. of semen. Now,  
you can see how precious the semen is!**   
If a man leads a life of celibacy even in householder's life and has  
copulation for the sake of progeny only, he can bring forth healthy,  
intelligent, strong, beautiful and self-sacrificing children. Higher forms of  
animals do have the sex impulse, but it becomes active only during the mating  
season; and thus they maintain health. Man, with his boasted intellect, has to  
learn lessons from birds and animals. Even animals have more self-control than  
men. It is only the so-called man who has degraded himself much by indulgence.  
At the heat of sexual excitement, he repeats the same ignoble act again and  
again. Man only violates the laws of nature and consequently suffers from  
innumerable diseases. He has degenerated to a level far lower than that of  
animals in this respect.   
Lack of self-control gives rise to diseases. **The western world has suffered  
moral and ethical degradation by following the Freudian psychology. It is  
clearly observed in statistical data. Population of India is three times that  
of U.S.A. Yet, consumption of drugs in U.S.A. is 10 times that in India. In  
New York City, a ten-year study, Mental Health in metropolis, claimed that  
approximately 80 per cent of adults showed some symptoms of Mental illness,  
with one in four actually impaired.**   
(Srole, Leo, Langer, Thomas, et al, Mental health in Metropolis, The midtown  
Manhatton Study.)   
Freudian psychoanalysts failed to give any solution to the problem of  
suppressing desires. So the people alarmed of getting mental disorders,  
continued to satisfy their desires even by illegal means. This in turn  
increased the incidence of crimes.   
On an average one case of rape is recorded per six seconds and about 2 million  
cases of pre-marietal pregnancy are recorded every year in U.S.A. Teenage  
pregnancy is a burning problem of U.S.A. Pre-marital sex is common in U.S.  
because they advocate free sex. As a result of that they compare the sexual  
gratification after marriage with the previous pre-marital experiences and  
when they find it less, they ask for divorce.   
About 65% of marriages result in divorce. As they have violated the nature's  
law of self-control, they suffer from sexually transmitted diseases. The most  
horrible is AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), which is spreading  
like an epidemic. The family life is disturbed by internal conflicts,  
dissatisfaction and rage. The social life is full of chaos, terror, insecurity  
and arrogance. This is not caused by poverty or lack of materials.   
**The U.S. has 4 % of the world 's population. They have made provisions for  
40 % of the global material productions (like cars, TVs etc.). Yet the  
criminal tendency is so high that one case of burglary is recorded per ten  
seconds. There are 425 prisoners per one lakh population whereas there are  
only 23 prisoners per one lakh population in Indian jails. In U.S.A. 14  
million cases of crime were recorded by the police department during the year  
1992. This is because the people under the influence of Freudian psychology  
try to satisfy all desires (not only sexual). The social life is degraded.  
Unchecked criminal tendencies lead to chaos, terror and insecurity.**   
 _In the present-day world, unfortunately, many people read pornographic  
literature, view sexy films on television and in theatres, view blue films in  
privacy, as a result we see all around us, the number of physical, mental and  
moral wrecks increasing every day._ Many a times such people indulge in  
unnatural sex. Masturbation or homosexual tendency lead them to wastage of  
seminal energy many times a weak. They may discharge seminal energy in bad  
dreams or wet dreams. Due to excessive loss of semen, enlargement of testes  
and sometimes pain in the testes develops. The evil after-effects that follow  
the loss of seminal energy are dangerous. Persons are physically, mentally and  
morally debilitated.   
The body and the mind refuse to work energetically, because the semen is not  
used up in the body to form Ojas that give vibrant health, strong will power  
and sound mind. Later on, such people develop impotency for the testices  
cannot produce semen with normal sperm count. Life for him loses all zest,  
zeal and charm. He becomes a victim of a number of diseases like anaemia, loss  
of memory, gloominess, palpitation of heart, pain in the back, loins, head and  
joints, weak kidneys, fickle mindedness, enlargement of testes, pain in the  
testes, debility, nervous breakdown, restlessness of mind, lack of thinking  
power, etc. He goes through hellish suffering. The scripture declares  
emphatically,   
'Atharva Veda' declares: "I have abandoned the lust that wastes my seminal energy. I throw away those  
sexual desires forever as they destroy my strength, intelligence and health. I  
will never become a victim of sexual desires' "   
But what happens to one who does not lead the life of celibacy. 'Atharva Veda'  
says,   
"The lust is the cause of diseases, dire diseases. It is the cause of death,  
fatal death. It makes one walk with tottering steps. It causes mental debility  
and retardation. It destroys health, vitality and physical well being. It  
burns all the Dhaatus (viz.chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen).  
It pollutes the purity of mind."   
Alcoholic drinks (liquor), tobacco (chewing), cigarettes stimulate passion.   
In Quran Sherifs Allaah Pak Trikol Roshal's Sipard, it is written:"O  
believers, this wine and gambling, and these arrows you use for divination,  
are all acts of Satan, so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.   
 **Ramakrishna Param Hamsa said, "Whenever you see a beautiful woman, and if  
evil thoughts crop up in your mind, visualise the 'World Mother' (Jagadamba)  
in her. She is a manifestation of 'World Mother'. That is why she is so  
beautiful. She is Divine mother blessing me with her Darshana. Entertain this  
Bhava (attitude), evil thoughts will die.**   
When Governor of Kalyana, Bahlol Khan was defeated by Major General of  
Shivaji's army, the latter presented a beautiful Begum to Shivaji. Strict  
celibate Shivaji looked at her with reverence, and said, "If I have to become  
beautiful, I will take birth through your womb, mother." Saying this he  
scolded his Major and ordered him to send her with full honour to her husband.  
**Shivaji was a strict celibate because he was a disciple of a mighty saint  
Samartha Ramadasa.**   
For protecting the semen, it is essential to wear always a strip of cloth  
(Langoti or Kaupin or loin cloth) over the private part, for there will be no  
night emission and growth of inflammation or any other disease of the  
testicles. This will help you in keeping up Brahmacharya.   
Immoral songs produce a bad, deep impression in the mind. **Aspirants should  
run away from places where vicious songs, poems, vulgar film songs, pop music  
or disco songs are sung or played on radio, transistor or cassette player.**   
Our great martyrs Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Vir Savarkar were  
inspired by patriotic literature to dedicate and sacrifice their lives for the  
liberation of India. Therefore, the glory of good literature is beyond words.  
There are so many great inspiring spiritual books reflecting the glory of  
Indian civilization viz, 'Yoga-Vagistha Maha Ramayan', 'Shrimad Bhdgavadgita',  
'Upanishads', 'Daas Bodh', 'Vivek Chudamani', 'Sukhmani', publications of Shri  
Ramakrishna mission, books by Swami Ramatirtha, etc etc.   
Make study of such literatures an indispensable part of your daily routine.  
Books that deal with love stories exciting passion and pornographic  
literatures should be either thrown into dustbin or reduced to ashes. You  
should strictly avoid these and give them not to others for reading. Reading  
of spiritual literature is of immense value in observing Brahmacharya.   
**Always read a spiritual book in the morning after taking bath (and before  
going to job) and at night just before retiring to bed. The pure, sublime-  
elevating thoughts of the book will displace the evil (passionate) thoughts of  
your mind and you will not become a victim of sexual thoughts and fantasies.**   
"Semen is brightness, strength and (Self) Atma." -(Satapath brahman).   
 **Grandsire Bhishma and the great Abhimanyu**   
There were two great battles, which took place during the war of Mahabharat.  
One is of grandsire Bhisma and the other of Abhimanyu.   
**Bhisma was a Naisthika Brahmachari, i.e. life long celibate. Therefore he  
was a man of boundless power.** Lord Krishna had taken a vow that during the  
war he would not wield any weapon. However, he was compelled to break his vow  
in the face of the allconquering and irresistible attack that Bhisma mounted  
on the army of Pandavas. Even Arjuna armed with celestial weapons could not  
combat Bhisma's onslaught and Lord Krishna was forced to take up a wheel of a  
chariot to protect Arjuna from the arrows showered by Bhisma. It was through  
the power of Brahmacharya (alone), that Bhisma could conquer death. When he  
was pierced by sharp arrows all over the body, his survival was impossible.  
Yet (god of) death could not snatch his life. **Lying on the bed of arrows, he  
gave wonderful discourses on political, philosophical, religious, social and  
moral subjects to Yudhisthira. Bhisma waited for the beginning of auspicious  
Uttarayana. Then he willingly left his body.   
The second battle was that of a charming and brilliant hero Abhimanyu.  
Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu fought single handed against the terrific strategy of  
Kauravas called Chakravyuha.** Bhima, the chief of Pandava army, was left  
behind. Abhimanyu fought with commendable valour wielding a wheel of a chariot  
all alone amidst great warriors of Kauravas. But in the end he was killed  
because Abhimanyu sowed the seed of Pandava dynasty before proceeding to his  
last battle. He had passed the night before the great battle in the amorous  
company of his wife Uttara. **Due to this act of infringement of Brahmacharya,  
he could not conquer death, unlike grandsire Bhisma.**   
 **An experiment done in U.S.A.**   
A scientific experiment was carried out in an American school of science. 30  
students were given no food for a fixed period of time. It was observed that  
their libido subsided. But when they were given food, libido increased. This  
shows that fasting gives only a temporary benefit in observation of celibacy.   
 **Techniques for Conservation of Seminal Energy**   
Tulsi (Basil) cures many diseases. Moreover, it helps in conservation of  
seminal energy. It improves power of memory. Leaf of Tulsi is an excellent  
herbal medicine. It restores imbalance of wind, bile and phelgm and thereby  
helps in cure of many ailments caused due to their imbalance. It is very  
useful in cases of blood disorders, cough, worm- infestation etc. It is good  
for cardiac disorders also."   
Herbal aid to celibacy: One can make this Ayurvedic Churna, without much cost  
at home. Take dried **Amalas** (goose berries) the fruits of a tree Emblica  
Officinalis and grind them into powder. Ready-made Amala powder is available  
in the market also. Mix two parts of the Amala powder with one part of  
powdered rock-sugar. You may get this ready-made mixture from ashram also.   
Mere thinking of a woman with sexual feelings causes a Sadhaka's downfall.  
Therefore, beware! Try to know the heart of the scriptures and saints and take  
its benefits by following it.   
"These sexual propensities, though they are at first like ripple, acquire the  
proportions of a sea on account of a bad company. **Whenever the mental image  
of a woman crops up in your mind with evil thoughts, repeat mentally "Om  
Durgaa Devyai Namah " and do mental prostrations." \- Swami Vivananda**   
"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live  
coals. From the contact comes sensation, from sensation thirst, from thirst  
clinging, by ceasing from that, the soul is delivered from all sinful  
existence." \- **Lord Buddha**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Srila Prabhupada on Profit and Loss  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:44:36 AM  
---  
In the evening, Srila Prabhupada lectured again on Bhagavad-gita. He chose  
Text 13 of Chapter Two: dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara. As he  
started to explain the meaning, a child began to cry. Prabhupada chuckled.  
Generally, he became annoyed when interrupted in class. When the devotees saw  
their spiritual master take the disturbance in stride, they were relieved and  
also laughed. Prabhupada used the child's crying to make a point: "So on one  
side, profit; on one side, loss. On one side, you get a child; and on the  
other side, you cannot hear. This is the material world. **As soon as you get  
some profit here, on another side, there is loss. As soon as you want to  
construct a big skyscraper, on another side-digging earth. "**   
Srila Prabhupada derided the foolishness of modern man, who engages in  
"digging and piling," never questioning the usefulness of his endeavor. He  
never considers that he will soon have to leave his body against his will, and  
he shows no interest in the message of Bhagavad-gita that you are not this  
body, but the proprietor within.   
Prabhupada next explained that the word "occupier" is more appropriate than  
the term "proprietor": " **If you rent a house, the proprietor is a different  
man. The tenant is the occupier; no proprietorship. So I am the spirit soul. I  
am not the proprietor. I am simply an occupier. The rascal materialists do not  
know that the proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He is  
giving me a particular apartment according to my capacity for paying rent. "**   
" **This is my position; otherwise, why doesn 't everyone get a first-class  
body, a king's body or rich man's body? One child is born-immediately he is a  
rich man. So there is no arrangement? And another child born at the same  
moment is a very poor man. Why?** Because if I am able to pay more rent, I  
transfer to another, very luxurious apartment. Or if I cannot pay the present  
rent, then I have to move to another, less expensive apartment."   
 _Then Srila Prabhupada described how the environment affects our  
consciousness: "A poor man living in a poor cottage or very unclean apartment-  
his mentality is one way. Another respectable gentleman living in a very nice  
house, his mentality is different. So according to the circumstances, the  
mental changes are there, but both men are human beings. Similarly, there are  
so many apartments, or different types of bodies-8,400,000 types of bodies.  
The occupier, the living being or the soul, is of the same quality, but  
according to the apartment or body he has occupied, he has developed a certain  
consciousness and mentality."_   
Prabhupada reminded his young audience that their birth in a developed country  
such as Germany was testimony of past pious activities and offered them a  
great opportunity for self-realization: "If you have done nicely to occupy a  
first-class apartment, then nature will give you a nice body. Therefore I say  
repeatedly that you Western boys and girls-you are given a very good chance by  
nature. Once upon a time, the European people were dominating all over the  
world, because they are very intelligent. They have got good resources, good,  
nice body, beautiful body. Everything is very good. But don't spoil it; use it  
for understanding further good."   
 **He said that misidentification with one 's land of birth should not let us  
forget that God is the creator and therefore the actual proprietor of  
everything: "Why I am falsely identifying myself with the land? 'I am German  
because I am born in this land of Germany.' That is also false. No land is  
Germany or France or England. Land is land. You have falsely named it: 'This  
is Germany.' What is this Germany? Say two or three hundred years ago, there  
was no Germany. The land was created by God. So it is God's property. Where is  
the difficulty to understand? You did not create anything, not even your own  
body. That proprietor is also Krsna. Because as soon as Krsna asks you,  
'Please vacate,' you must vacate immediately. Can you remain in this body? The  
proprietor asks you to vacate. So you have to vacate. Or the proprietor does  
not repair it. Then you voluntarily vacate: 'This is not useful anymore.'"**   
Returning to the Sanskrit verse, Prabhupada illustrated another meaning of it,  
namely, the imperceptible nature of the bodily changes and how the soul, as an  
observer, is always the same: "So it is to be understood that I existed in the  
past in a different body. As I existed, say seventy years before in a  
different body, I was jumping as a boy. Now I cannot jump; now I have to use  
the cane. This is a different body. If the same body still existed, then I  
could jump like a boy. I remember that I jumped. But now it is not possible. I  
have to take the help of three men." Prabhupada laughed, and the devotees  
joined in. He was in a jolly mood, pleased to see many young faces. He hoped  
that they would take Krsna consciousness seriously before their bodies  
dwindled with old age and the great opportunity to achieve perfection within  
this lifetime was lost.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says devotion to duty is highest form of the worship of God  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:46:31 AM  
---  
**ON KARMA-YOGA   
Volume 5, Notes from Lectures and Discourses  
Duty of any kind is not to be slighted. A man who does the lower work is not,  
for that reason only, a lower man than he who does the higher work; **a man  
should not be judged by the nature of his duties, but by the manner in which  
he does them.** His manner of doing them and his power to do them are indeed  
the test of a man. A shoemaker who can turn out a strong, nice pair of shoes  
in the shortest possible time is a better man, according to his profession and  
his work, than a professor who talks nonsense every day of his life.   
Every duty is holy, and devotion to duty is the highest form of the worship of  
God; it is certainly a source of great help in enlightening and emancipating  
the deluded and ignorance-encumbered souls of the Baddhas  the bound ones.   
 **However we may try, there cannot be any action which is perfectly pure or  
any which is perfectly impure, taking purity or impurity in the sense of  
injury or non-injury.** We cannot breathe or live without injuring others, and  
every morsel of food we eat is taken from another's mouth; our very lives are  
crowding out some other lives. It may be those of men, or animals, or small  
fungi, but someone somewhere we have to crowd out. **That being the case, it  
naturally follows that perfection can never be attained by work.** We may work  
through all eternity, but there will be no way out of this intricate maze: we  
may work on and on and on, but there will be no end.   
 **The man who works through freedom and love cares nothing for results.** But  
the slave wants his whipping; the servant wants his pay. So with all life;  
take for instance the public life. The public speaker wants a little applause  
or a little hissing and hooting. If you keep him in a corner without it, you  
kill him, for he requires it. This is working through slavery. To expect  
something in return, under such conditions, becomes second nature. Next comes  
the work of the servant, who requires some pay; I give this, and you give me  
that. Nothing is easier to say, "I work for work's sake", but nothing is so  
difficult to attain. I would go twenty miles on my hands and knees to look on  
the face of the man who can work for work's sake. There is a motive somewhere.  
If it is not money, it is power. If it is not power, it is gain. Somehow,  
somewhere, there is a motive power. You are my friend, and I want to work for  
you and with you. This is all very well, and every moment I may make  
protestation of my sincerity. But take care, you must be sure to agree with  
me! If you do not, I shall no longer take care of you or live for you! This  
kind of work for a motive brings misery. That work alone brings unattachment  
and bliss, wherein we work as masters of our own minds.   
The great lesson to learn is that I am not the standard by which the whole  
universe is to be judged; **each man is to be judged by his own idea**, each  
race by its own standard and ideal, each custom of each country by its own  
reasoning and conditions. American customs are the result of the environment  
in which the Americans live and Indian customs are the result of the  
environment in which the Indians are; and so of China, Japan, England, and  
every other country.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says devotion to duty is highest form of the worship of God  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:46:31 AM

**ON KARMA-YOGA   
Volume 5, Notes from Lectures and Discourses  
Duty of any kind is not to be slighted. A man who does the lower work is not,  
for that reason only, a lower man than he who does the higher work; **a man  
should not be judged by the nature of his duties, but by the manner in which  
he does them.** His manner of doing them and his power to do them are indeed  
the test of a man. A shoemaker who can turn out a strong, nice pair of shoes  
in the shortest possible time is a better man, according to his profession and  
his work, than a professor who talks nonsense every day of his life.   
Every duty is holy, and devotion to duty is the highest form of the worship of  
God; it is certainly a source of great help in enlightening and emancipating  
the deluded and ignorance-encumbered souls of the Baddhas  the bound ones.   
 **However we may try, there cannot be any action which is perfectly pure or  
any which is perfectly impure, taking purity or impurity in the sense of  
injury or non-injury.** We cannot breathe or live without injuring others, and  
every morsel of food we eat is taken from another's mouth; our very lives are  
crowding out some other lives. It may be those of men, or animals, or small  
fungi, but someone somewhere we have to crowd out. **That being the case, it  
naturally follows that perfection can never be attained by work.** We may work  
through all eternity, but there will be no way out of this intricate maze: we  
may work on and on and on, but there will be no end.   
 **The man who works through freedom and love cares nothing for results.** But  
the slave wants his whipping; the servant wants his pay. So with all life;  
take for instance the public life. The public speaker wants a little applause  
or a little hissing and hooting. If you keep him in a corner without it, you  
kill him, for he requires it. This is working through slavery. To expect  
something in return, under such conditions, becomes second nature. Next comes  
the work of the servant, who requires some pay; I give this, and you give me  
that. Nothing is easier to say, "I work for work's sake", but nothing is so  
difficult to attain. I would go twenty miles on my hands and knees to look on  
the face of the man who can work for work's sake. There is a motive somewhere.  
If it is not money, it is power. If it is not power, it is gain. Somehow,  
somewhere, there is a motive power. You are my friend, and I want to work for  
you and with you. This is all very well, and every moment I may make  
protestation of my sincerity. But take care, you must be sure to agree with  
me! If you do not, I shall no longer take care of you or live for you! This  
kind of work for a motive brings misery. That work alone brings unattachment  
and bliss, wherein we work as masters of our own minds.   
The great lesson to learn is that I am not the standard by which the whole  
universe is to be judged; **each man is to be judged by his own idea**, each  
race by its own standard and ideal, each custom of each country by its own  
reasoning and conditions. American customs are the result of the environment  
in which the Americans live and Indian customs are the result of the  
environment in which the Indians are; and so of China, Japan, England, and  
every other country.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna suggests to feel one is a free soul  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:48:44 AM

Sri Ramakrishna (to M.) : "Self-Knowledge is discussed in the Ashtavakra  
Samhita. The non-dualists say, 'Soham', that is, 'I am the Supreme Self.' This  
is the view of the sannyasis of the Vedantic school. But this is not the right  
attitude for householders, who are conscious of doing everything themselves.  
That being so, how can they declare, 'I am That, the actionless Supreme Self?   
 **According to the non-dualists the Self is unattached.** Good and bad,  
virtue and vice, and the other pairs of opposites, cannot in any way injure  
the Self, though they undoubtedly afflict those who have identified themselves  
with their bodies. **Smoke soils the wall, certainly, but it cannot in any way  
affect akasa, space.** Following the Vedantists of this class, Krishnakishore  
used to say, 'I am Kha', meaning akasa. Being a great devotee, he could say  
that with some justification; but it is not becoming for others to do so.   
 **" But to feel that one is a free soul is very good. By constantly  
repeating, 'I am free, I am free', a man verily becomes free. On the other  
hand, by constantly repeating, 'I am bound, I am bound', he certainly becomes  
bound to worldliness. The fool who says only, 'I am a sinner, I am a sinner',  
verily drowns himself in worldliness. One should rather say: 'I have chanted  
the name of God. How can I be a sinner? How can I be bound?'**

## Adi Sankara's Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 09, 2010, 01:27:41 PM  
---  
Please see pravachanam of **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami Garu** in **telugu**  
for Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram in the below link.   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Daskhinamurthy+Stotram+Volume1&aq=f   
 **Source** : http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sri_Dakshinamurthy_Stotram   
Translated by P.R.Ramachander   
Adhi Sankara has written very many great Stotras (prayers) but here is a  
unique prayer, which is not only a prayer but the summary of all the  
philosophy that he has taught. Even during his time, this stotra was difficult  
to comprehend and it became necessary for one of his disciples,  
Sureshwaracharya to write a commentary called Manasollasa to this stotra.  
There are large number of books and commentaries on this commentary itself.   
Mouna Vyakhya prakatitha, para,   
Brahma thathwam yuvanam,   
Varshishtha anthevasad rishiganai,   
Ravrutham brahma nishtai,   
Acharyendram kara kalihtha chin,   
Mudram ananda roopam,   
Swathmaramam mudhitha vadanam,   
Dakshinamurthim eede.   
I praise and salute that Dakshinamrthy,   
Who faces the south,   
Who explains the true nature of the supreme Brahman,   
Through his state of silence,   
Who is young in looks,   
Who is surrounded by disciples who are old Sages,   
Whose minds are fixed on Brahman,   
Who is the greatest of teachers,   
Who shows the Chinmudhra by his hand,   
Who is personification of happiness,   
Who is in the state of extreme joy within himself,   
And who has a smiling face.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Dumb people should have also  
have become gurus if by silence only doubts get eradicated. So it means we  
need to listen carefully in silent mind without having any other thoughts and  
do sravanam,mananam and nidhidyasanam by concentration.** As time is dependent  
on him so it means he looks young.   
Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram was first told to Sanaka,Sanatana,  
Sanandana,Sanatkumara who are the sons of Lord Brahma By Lord  
shiva(Dakshinamurthy).Adi Guru from which gnana started by  
Dakshinamurthy(Siva). **Please note that Gnana is never created and gnana is  
eternal.** Example: Even before newton discovered our earth is having  
gravitational force and only newton discovered it and not invented.   
In Hand as known thumb finger is very important and base and other four  
fingers have no power without thumb finger.   
 **In our hand the middle,ring and little fingers represent walking,dream,deep  
sleep states. 4th finger(Index Finger) i.e pointing finger represents  
ego(jiva).When we obverse jiva always tries to be close with the other 3  
fingers but not with thumb finger.   
Chinmudra means hand gesture in which the first finger is kept at the root of  
the thumb, the last three fingers are unfolded which means jiva mixes with  
thumb finger which is paramatma as thumb finger is required for any operation  
with hand.**   
Below article gives more information about Chin Mudra.   
http://www.hathayoga.co.za/mudras.htm   
 **Chin Mudra**   
 **This gesture symbolises the connected nature of human consciousness. The  
circle formed by the index finger and thumb represents the true goal of yoga  
â the merging of the individual soul with the universal soul, or the soul of  
God. The nail of the index finger is placed into the first joint of the  
thumb.** The last three fingers always face down towards the earth in this  
mudra. It is a gesture of receiving. When the finger touches the thumb a  
circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into  
the environment to travel back into the body, and up to the brain.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Vedanta is for one who thinks he is bound and  
no age,sex factors come into consideration.   
In dreams even though there is no external light,sun,moon and though we close  
our eyes we are still seeing our dream by our own light(chaitanyam).We are not  
the body also we are only observer of the body but not the body as we observe  
our body growing old etc...   
Viswam darpana drusyamana nagari,

Similar to the image of a town as seen in the mirror,   
When one sees the image of the world within him,   
 **The world appears as if it is outside.   
It is similar to his seeing due to illusion,   
During the state of sleep,   
That the one real fact appears as many different truths,   
And he realizes,when he wakes up and sees the reality,   
That he is really the one and only one soul.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The above stanza tells us that the world which is outside us is same as our  
soul but we see them as different entities due to the veil of ignorance. As  
soon as we wake up, we realize that the dream is false and even while seeing  
our image in the mirror, we know that we are not seeing us in the mirror but  
our image. When we get knowledge from the guru we are in the wakeful state  
without the veil of ignorance.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Seeing two different things is not  
Duality(Dvaitam) but not having bhava that all beings are one and the same is  
Duality(Dvaitam).Here in this stanza sleep mentioned is dreams.In dreams we  
also dream relations,sorrows etc.If many pots are there to know all are made  
with mud then it is advaita else if we differentiate then it is dvaita.   
As known Ramana Maharshi said many times that walking state and dream state  
are same.   
 **As sundara chaitanya swami says,in dreams we create the world(drishti-  
srishti vada) but in waking state world is already created and we see the  
world.(srishti-drishti vada).everyone dreams are different but waking state is  
same to everyone.**   
 **But our mind is the same in dreams and waking states which is important.**  
So consciousness is our real nature.Knower,known and knowledge i.e subject and  
object are all false.   
Also our body and mind and five senses are also objects which is important as  
we are knowing about changes in our body and five senses. **As in deep sleep  
we are alive though there is no mind,body,world.**   
So world is in us rather than we in the world.   
Fore more details i suggest to read Adi Shankara's Drik Drusya Vivekam.   
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2010/03/shankaracharyas-drik-drisya-  
vivekam.html   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says in english "ok" means only krishna  
:-)**

Like the germ inside the seed is its part,   
But becomes different after development   
The many places and time which are before us,   
Are drawn by illusion in the board of life in a peculiar manner,   
By a great savant or an expert Siddha,   
Who can create them as per their will,   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
When the net of illusion is lifted and when we reach the stage of  
manifestation, we would find that what we think as different is but one and  
the same.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says with Dakshinamurthy Stotram we  
are clear that time and space are not real and hence we cannot accept creation  
has been done in 7 or 6 or N number of days and that god created water on  
first day etc etc..Also it seems it was written in that book that god was not  
clear which he has created in the first 3 days and hence he was ensuring  
again.6th day it seems that god created sun.It is false theory as without sun  
if do we know that 5 days are passed? These theories and those books and  
followers are blind and wrong as known time and space are not real.Person who  
are intelligent will not believe in these false theroies.Also it seems that it  
was written that people who don 't believe will go to hell which is again  
false propaganda.**   
Because though all religions accept god is creator but no one clearly tells  
what is the material with which he created no one knows. if we accept god  
created universe with some material like plastic then we need to accept  
plastic are there before only.   
 _But if we think who created our dreams so we are clear that only our mind is  
responsible for creation of dreams and waking states but we cannot accept  
srishti-drishti vada._   
Also we cannot accept that god is changing and he has been changed to world  
etc.Because we say it is only superimposition we are seeing like rope and  
snake.So only brahman only exists and nothing exists like explained above  
already chinmudra in our hand where thumb finger is seperate and not attached  
to any states.   
Even Einstein theory also says that time and space are relative.

He who exists as the real light of truth,   
And shines in the false world of appearance,   
And He who teaches disciples the great saying,   
âThou art thatâ after realizing its import,   
Gets away from this cycle of life and death.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says âThou art thatâ is the brahmastram  
and ultimate weapon.In sanskrit it means "Tat Tvam Asi". In advaita it means  
absolute equality of 'tat', the Ultimate Reality, Brahman, and 'tvam', the  
individual self, jiva.

 **Like the light emanating from a lamp,   
Kept in a pot(kunda) with many holes,   
Goes out in all directions,   
Similarly In the person in whom the wisdom goes out   
Through the openings of ear, eye, mouth and thought,   
And when that person realizes that âI know myselfâ,   
This whole universe shines after Him alone,   
Who shines in the consciousness as the knower.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Our body prevents us from seeing the truth(the light from outside) that we are  
the Brahman and lets out light though the sensory organs and makes us deceive  
ourselves by feeling that we are happy.** This simile of a pot with holes for  
the body occurs in many places in Indian philosophy.   
 **Note** : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says who speaks spritiual technical  
terms like karma etc(edo naa karma sir ani aneevallu) without knowing meaning  
also is fine and we should never blame them.   
 **He blamed people who says all religions are same and he says people who  
tells these are one who donot know basics in religion.But he says everyone  
should live together peacefully.**

Those great philosophers, who think that,   
The body, the soul and the fickle intellect,   
The concept of emptiness and all other nothingness,   
Are nothing but themselves,   
Are similar to the women children, blind and the ignorant.   
It is only He who can destroy, this veil of ignorance,   
And wake us up from this state of deceit.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **This is a sample of the approach of negation in identifying the truth about  
the concept of self. Senses, the body etc cannot be the absolute truth as they  
are transient.**   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami strictly condemns **Carvaka** school of  
thought.He questions that if body is really atma why does the dead body does  
not speak and why cannot we stop our death?   
In budhdism one sect called "kshanikha vignana vadam" means atma is only  
temporary means if i see a flower then i get flower knowledge and later once  
we forget flower then knowledge is given and so is atma.   
In budhdism another sect called "sunyavadam" where they believe that atma is  
sunyam like deep sleep where nothing remains.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya swami condenms all sects of buddhism though he tells  
that buddhism is better when compared to other religions.

Pragaswapsaamithi prabodha samaye,   
Yaa prathyabignayathe,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 7   
Similar to the Sun when being masked by the serpent Rahu,   
Knows that it was existing, once the eclipse is over   
That man whose senses are suppressed   
When he is asleep,   
Because of the veil of illusion,   
Realizes that he was in the state of sleep,   
When he wakes up.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **Similar the sun existing even when there is eclipse, we exist when we are  
sleeping. This is denial of the Buddhist theory that, when we are asleep there  
is nothingness.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says to say we slept happily in deep sleep  
means we should have experienced it to say we slept happily so sunyam concept  
of Buddhist is denied completely.Therefore we are sat-chit-ananda as i am  
existing in all threee states i.e dream,deep sleep,waking state.Therefore i am  
witness of the 3 states.**   
 **Note : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says experience is not really required  
and only jnana is required which helps to eradicate ignorance.   
Our life is always with combination of questions and answers only.In our  
childhood our parents ask various questions like they ask us to recognise who  
is father,mother,pen...etc etc..   
Later we start asking questions like mother,where did father go outside? amma  
is food ready? or husband asks wife what is lunch today etc etc.**   
All our experiences are difference like we have diff experience when we lose  
our wealth and our experience is diff when we gain more health and our  
experience is diff when we fail in exams.But all these experiences are  
experienced by us.

Even during the changing states of childhood, youth and old age   
And even during the states of sleep, dream and wakefulness.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The truth as represented by the concept of Brahman, exists always.   
 **In dreams we have only bhokta and no kartha because it is only mind who  
dreams.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says one of the big scripture in the world is  
told in dreams by god.**   
Brahmins are called Shastri because he is the knower of Shastras.

And believes in these differences,

And also to those who examine the truth behind,

The concept of the Athma,   
Which is explained in this poem of praise,   
Hearing which, understanding which,   
Meditating which and singing which,   
One would attain the state of the godliness,   
And the great state of self realization,   
And also you would get the eight powers of occult,   
Without any problems in between.   
Appendix   
The following three stanzas as well as the first stanza are chanted after the  
main stotra:-   
Chitram Vata tharor mole vruddha,   
Sishya, Guror Yuva,   
Gurostu mounam vykhyanam,   
Sishyasthu china samsaya   
It is strange to see,   
The very old disciples,   
And the very young teacher,   
Who sit under a banyan tree,   
With the teacher always observing silence,   
And the students getting all the doubts cleared.   
Om nama pranavarthaya,   
Suddha jnanaika moorthaye nama,   
Nirmalaya prasanthaya,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the meaning of the pranava, âomâ,   
Who is the personification of unalloyed wisdom,   
Who is crystal clear in his thought,   
And who is the epitome of peace.   
Gurave sara lokaanam,   
Bishaje bhava roginaam,   
Nidhaye sarva vidhyanam,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the teacher of the entire world,   
Who is the doctor to those,   
Afflicted by the disease of birth and death,

If this forum can bring out sanskrit font it would be helpful for members.  
Along with the english verson we can go through with sanskrit letters which we  
can understand correctly. It is my humble thought

## Topic: Photoshop CS4

I am trying to make some Glowsign using PSCS4, which is 360"/28" in size.  
Certain Filter options have got disabled, and I am trying to use the  
Render/Lighting option. But what I observed is that the same feature is  
available when I make a smaller picture. I use Vista with 2GB RAM and 32 BIT  
Op System.   
Any Helpers?   
Thanks

Dear Graham,   
Thanks so much for your reply. Yes, I am trying to make a sign of 30 feet long  
by 28 inches tall. I was stuck with the understanding that effect will never  
be satisfactory after resize, but like you said, the size is designed to be  
viewed from a distance, the output should take care. I'l try this as suggested  
by you. I was stuck with this issue for some time now. I tried getting  
solution from various web related help sites which was of no avail.   
Thanks so much   
Nagaraj
