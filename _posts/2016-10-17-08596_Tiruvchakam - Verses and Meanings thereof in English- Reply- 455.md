Verse 19: தேரை நிறுத்தி மலையெடுத் தான்சிரம்   
ஈரைந்தும் இற்றவா றுந்தீபற   
இருபதும் இற்றதென் றுந்தீபற.   
He stopped his chariot and tried to uproot the Mount (Kailas)   
His heads,   
two times five,   
were crushed fly Unti !   
His twenty arms too were crushed.   
Fly Unti !   
Arunachala Siva.
