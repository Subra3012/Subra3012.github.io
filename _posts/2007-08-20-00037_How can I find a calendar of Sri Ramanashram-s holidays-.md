Per Italiani.   
verso la fine di novembre/2007 sarei intenzionato a visitare l'asram. Gradirei  
molto parlare con qualcuno che ci è già stato per qualche consiglio. Vivo a  
Roma.   
Ringrazio anticipatamente

Thank you.

The Sri Ramanasramam Book Depot has diaries on sale at this time of year that  
list all the holidays for the forthcoming year. Send an email to enquire what  
is available, and specify that you want one with all the festival days listed.
