_A devotee who had suddenly lost his only son came to Bhagavan in a state of  
acute grief, seeking relief. He asked a few questions in which his grief was  
evident._   
 **Bhagavan, as usual, asked him to enquire into the Self and find out who is  
grieving. The devotee was not satisfied. Bhagavan then said,All right. I will  
tell you a story from Vichara Sagaram. Listen.**   
TWO YOUNGSTERS BY name Rama and Krishna, told their respective parents that  
they would go to foreign countries to prosecute further studies and then earn  
a lot of money. After some time, one of them died suddenly. The other studied  
well,earned a lot and was living happily.   
Some time later the one that was alive requested a merchant who was going to  
his native place to tell his father that he was wealthy and happy and that the  
other boy who had come with him had passed away. Instead of passing on the  
information correctly, the merchant told the father of the person who was  
alive, that his son was dead, and the father of the person that was dead, that  
his son had earned a lot of money and was living happily.   
The parents of the person that was actually dead, were happy in the thought  
that their son would come back after some time, while the parents of the  
person whose son was alive, but was reported to be dead, were in great grief.   
**In fact,neither of them saw their son but they were experiencing happiness  
or grief according to the reports they received. That is all. We too are  
similarly situated.**   
We believe all sorts of things that the mind tells us and get deluded into  
thinking that what exists does not exist and that what does not exist exists.  
**If we do not believe the mind but enter the heart and see the son that is  
inside, there is no need to see the children outside.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. All miseries are in the mind. Without thoughts, there are no   
miseries and joys. When G.V. Subbaramaiah came to the Asramam,   
after the death of his dear wife and after completing the ceremonies,Bhagavan  
Ramana gazed at him with a lot of compassion and this helped to reduce his  
sorrow and bereavement. GVS said that she [his wife] was coming in his  
dreams. Bhagavan Ramana smiled and left this at that. After sometime, GVS  
said that she no longer came in her dreams. Bhagavan Ramana said: She was in  
your mind. Now she is in your Heart!   
Arunachala Siva.
