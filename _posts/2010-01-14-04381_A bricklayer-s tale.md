## A bricklayer's tale

I am a little disappointed at the posts in this section so far. There is  
nothing like a good old belly laugh to release tension and set the world to  
right.   
So here is something to get you going - an example of the British habit of  
understatement: Found at - http://www.btinternet.com/~knutty.knights/bricks.txt   
 _This is a bricklayer 's accident report that was printed in the newsletter  
of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here, thanks  
to John Sedgwick is this Bricklayer's report._   
\   
Dear Sir: I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block  
#3 of the accident reporting form. I put "Poor Planning" as the cause of my  
accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following  
details will be sufficient.   
I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone  
on the roof of a new six-storey building. When I completed my work, I found I  
had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to weigh 240  
lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a  
barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the  
sixth floor.   
Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out  
and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding  
it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will note  
on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.   
Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my  
presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I  
proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding  
downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull,  
minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident  
reporting form.   
Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the  
fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I  
mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time I  
had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in  
spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.   
At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground-  
and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks,  
the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs.   
I refer you again to my weight. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent  
down the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts  
for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs  
and lower body.   
Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed  
to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks  
and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.   
I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain,  
unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again  
lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope....

This is very British. Quite different from Asian style.   
I think I understand it should be funny for British people, but it did not  
make me laugh.   
When I was in England, a Japanese man told a joke to Enlishmen.   
 Listening to the joke, I laughed. I thought it was funny.   
But no Englishmen around him laughed. They didn't get the joke. They did not  
think it was funny.   
Different culture, different humour.

Hi Akira,   
It is not the story, but the way it is told that is at the root of British  
humour.   
Clearly the incident itself was horrific, but the writer has deliberately  
composed it with typical British understatement to make it humourous. It is  
our habit to make our disasters and mistakes appear funny.
