Today is the New Year Day, for Tamil and Malaylam people.   
The calendar adopted in Tamil Nadu and Kerala is based on   
the movement of the Sun (Souram) in the zodiac. Today Sun   
has moved into Mesha, Aries and it is the New Year accordingly.   
The month is called Chitra or Chaitra. This is the beginning of   
Vasantham, Spring, before the onset of summer. But nowadays,   
even Spring which is said to be mildly warm, is quite hot like   
regular summer!   
Chaitra is the festival month in various temples in Madurai,   
Tiruchy, Tiruvannamalai and other places.   
The Full Moon which comes after 15 days from today, is called   
Chitra Pournami, which is also the day of celebration Temples.   
Astrologically, persons who are born in Chaitra are said to be   
brave and at the same time interested in Atma Vicharam. Because   
the Sun is in ascendant in Aries and Aries is the house of Sun.   
Sun in Atma karaka, the one who confers Atma Jnana. Moon   
is mano karaka, the controller of mind. Chitra Pournami is the   
day when Sun and Moon are together in Aries.   
Arunachala Siva.

How pleasant! A year old mail from last Spring that sprouts new leaves!   
I loved in particular the humor bubbling in the choices and reasons for  
choices, but it was Subramaniam's choice of a 4th book that sparked a reply  
from me.   
D. T. Suzuki's "Essays in Zen Buddhism" was a mainstay for me for many years.  
It's odd, in a way the texts are tedious to read with words and concepts I  
could barely grasp, like a slow sonorous chanting of sutras I saw on TV once,  
then -- suddenly -- a flash of light of insight of understanding that  
disappear almost before I could recognize them.   
Then, one morning, alone on a night shift, about 3 in the morning, I closed  
the copy of the essays I was reading - suddenly, I was up out of my chair  
dancing across the room, on the floor, on the table tops, singing a song.  
Surprised, I then scratched the words down on a manila envelope I pulled out  
of a waste basket:  **You are reality, beyond all belief   
You are the living tree, nourishing my green leaf   
You are the hight, the footstep and the path   
You are the answer, with no questions asked   
You are the beauty shining in each lover's face   
You are that certain place of no time or space   
 Smaller than an atom   
 Bigger than a star   
 Able to go slowly fast,   
 You stay quickly far   
You are, you are, you are...   
You are the holy rock   
You are the distant shore   
You are life itself and even death   
 pales before   
Your emptiness   
Ah, but my books? I dunno, I really don't know, many clamor for attention,  
the thick ones claim they have more to say and the thin ones say that their  
conciseness and brevity is what increases their value -- so, a couple of  
books, one thick, one thin, and a picture of Ramana -- sigh -- but which  
picture?

I have to search for the three volumes of Essays in Zen Buddhism.   
I feel like reading them once again. I bought it in Adyar Library   
of JK in Chennai about ten years back. The new copies would cost me at least  
Rs 2000/=.

Subramiam R.,   
I just checked Amazon for the heck of it - series 3 (the three volumes) costs  
25£ (used) and series 2 (the one I have) 5£.   
A little known work which I got almost by accident is his "Swedenborg, Buddha  
of the North", goes for 3.60£ - it's one of his earliest works and  
introduced me to Swedenborg, a difficult fellow to get to know.   
love - being -aware

Dear srkudai,   
Thanks. I think some "unlearning" has already started in me!
