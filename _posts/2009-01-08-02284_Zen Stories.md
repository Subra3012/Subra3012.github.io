Hogen, a Chinese Zen Master, lived alone in a small temple in the   
country. One day four travelling monks appeared and asked if   
they might make a fire in his yard to warm themselves.   
While they were building the fire, Hogen heard them arguing about   
subjectivity and objectivity. He joined them and said: " There is   
a big stone. Do you consider it to be inside or outside your mind?"   
One of the monks replied: "From the Buddhist view point, everything   
is an objectivity of mind, so I would say that the stone is inside my   
mind."   
Hogen then observed: "Your head must feel very heavy, if you are   
carrying round a stone like that in your mind!"

nice one Subramanian Garu.   
Yes unnecessary thoughts which will implant vasanas should be removed.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Vasanas are also like stones, but these stones are very   
small, embedded in the mind. They suddenly grow big and come   
out as thoughts.   
Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 675: You should go beyond meditating at specific periods   
of the day and continuously practice Self-abidance at all times.   
This shaving of the hairs, which are itching Vasanas, so that they   
do not sprout as thoughts through the brain is the excellent   
and true shaving of the head [that is prescribed for the sannyasins.]   
Bhagavan Ramana also says in Sri AAMM, Verse 85: **How wonderful, it is that you have shaved my head clean, O   
Arunachala, and are now dancing a joyous dance in the Heart's   
vast empty space!**   
Arunachala Siva.

So this is the reason when people go to Thruppathi they shave their head? This  
is the symbol of giving up vasanas.   
 some families they offer their hair when the baby is one year old. It is  
their family practice.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 _ _   
Yes. Giving a tonsure to God, in Pazhani or Tirupati, is a symbolism   
for giving up the ego. In the same way, a Namaskaram, prostration,   
is symbolic of lowering one's ego before a Guru or God.
