## Re:[1]Love,always love and only love At Ramana Ashram: Ill-treatment of animals, sadhus and poor people

Dear Child of Arunachala,   
I am really surprised to read all this. In truth,i have already read same  
complains of some women who had visited Ramanashram,but never took it too  
seriously. Even more surprised to read about animal treating!   
Personally i feel that these things will happen always more or less,for all  
sorts of reasons,but at least,it should be put on minimum.   
When we know how Bhagavan behaved toward animals,Saddhus,women,and all people  
who came to Him,i cannot understand how that can be forgotten!??After  
all,this is the great part of His teachings. So we all,including them,should  
not forget that nothing belongs to us,and this place is also only Bhagavan's  
property. And act accordingly.   
With love,

Friends,   
Even in the days when Sri Bhagavan graced this terra firma such stray  
incidents have happened...and Bhagavan was even accused of supporting his  
authoritarian 'brother' and sarvadhikari of the asramam.   
It is not as if the asramam is a place insulated from the world and its  
people...not all the people employed as cooks,watchmen,etc are sadhakas or  
interns.   
Most of the reporting of such news would also be by people who are not  
sadhakas...and perhaps these things catch their attention, more so as they are  
looking for these.   
Bhagavan's advice was 'vanda velaiyai paar'(Attend to what you came for)...and  
this advice is still the best...and if we come across anything dire and  
unseemly, the best course would be to report to the asramam office and they  
would do the needful...There is simply no point in publishing it in a public  
forum.   
Every time that I have walked into the Asramam,I have always been greeted by  
the Strutting Peacocks, frolicking monkeys, and stray dogs which move about  
fearlessly as if to say 'Welcome to our Place'. ..and amused visitors who  
watch all these with love and awe....I have videos of these.   
By and large the asramam is well run and managed. ..and offers the best  
opportunity to one and all to bask in the spiritual ambience of Arunachala and  
Bhagavan.This is one of the very best Asramams that I have come across and if  
we deprive it of our measly so called 'donation' it would mean that we would  
only end up depriving ourselves...the Asramam would go on, as it is sustained  
by the presence and Grace of Bhagavan and not by the "dollars'.   
Namaskar

Child of Arunachala,   
I am not a user of facebook...tried searching for any information concerning  
ill treatment/killing of dogs in Sri Ramanasramam...could find just this link  
that carries a letter from Sri Ramanasramam appreciating the services of  
'Arunachala Animal Sanctuary & Rescue Shelter': https://richardarunachala.wordpress.com/tag/dogs/   
Please scroll to the end of this page....The Letter says "The Ashram supports  
the activities they are involved with and is deeply appreciative of their  
work.We encourage those who are moved in that direction to support their work"   
There is no reason to believe that the ashram management has changed its mind  
on their earlier stance.   
I went through the link that you provided and did not find anything that  
implicated the Ashram. ..If you have any other information you may share the  
same.   
Namaskar

Child of Arunachala,   
I find the usual loose talk and exchange only...Did anyone talk to Dr Murthy?  
...or Mr V S Ramanan?...What is their response?   
Please do not get me wrong...I am neither angry nor being defensive...I  
certainly will not tolerate any merciless beating and killing of innocent  
animals...but all the same I am not against some show of force if that is the  
only way an unruly animal has to be handled in a public place like the  
ashram....Please refer to my post in the Rough Note book thread(Gives a new  
dimension to the word 'Rough'. ..ha ha)   
If I encounter anything untoward, I will take it up in a forthright  
manner...and will give an objective verbatim report...and pursue it with those  
responsible.   
Namaskar

we are."   
Stopping donation is also an act as much as giving donation...The only way to  
relinquish the karmic baggage is to relinquish doership...i.e to give up the  
idea that one is the donor or otherwise...giving up the idea of 'doership'  
alone would make me a child of Arunachala.   
Namaskar

Child of Arunachala,   
No.I am not recommending to turn a blind eye...As I have said,if one  
encounters anything untoward,it may be taken up with the Ashram office  
directly...and they may do the needful.   
Did you witness these things?Did you take it up with the Ashram  
management?What is their response?   
Namaskar

Child of Arunachala,   
I am not a user of facebook...tried searching for any information concerning  
ill treatment/killing of dogs in Sri Ramanasramam...could find just this link  
that carries a letter from Sri Ramanasramam appreciating the services of  
'Arunachala Animal Sanctuary & Rescue Shelter': https://richardarunachala.wordpress.com/tag/dogs/   
Please scroll to the end of this page....The Letter says "The Ashram supports  
the activities they are involved with and is deeply appreciative of their  
work.We encourage those who are moved in that direction to support their work"   
There is no reason to believe that the ashram management has changed its mind  
on their earlier stance.   
I went through the link that you provided and did not find anything that  
implicated the Ashram. ..If you have any other information you may share the  
same.   
Namaskar

Child of Arunachala,   
I find the usual loose talk and exchange only...Did anyone talk to Dr Murthy?  
...or Mr V S Ramanan?...What is their response?   
Please do not get me wrong...I am neither angry nor being defensive...I  
certainly will not tolerate any merciless beating and killing of innocent  
animals...but all the same I am not against some show of force if that is the  
only way an unruly animal has to be handled in a public place like the  
ashram....Please refer to my post in the Rough Note book thread(Gives a new  
dimension to the word 'Rough'. ..ha ha)   
If I encounter anything untoward, I will take it up in a forthright  
manner...and will give an objective verbatim report...and pursue it with those  
responsible.   
Namaskar
