## (stupid) questions about Arunachala and chanting  
Author: Joey_               Date: February 22, 2010, 01:44:03 PM

Hi, in the past I've done a buddhist mantra and my reason for doing it was  
simply to make my voice deeper. I know that there can't be much more dumber or  
materialistic motivation, but otherwise I consider my self a serious seeker. I  
meditate atleast an hour every day and I think about Ramana Maharshi's and  
other Advaita teachers teachings almost all day long. I just suffer from low  
self-esteem and my squeaky voice makes it more difficult to be in social  
situations. So now I've been chanting Arunachala Siva recently but I'm  
wondering is it a little blasphemous to repeat God's name for such unholy  
purposes. So should I just go back to my old mantra?   
And I've been thinking about putting a picture of Arunachala mountain as my  
wall paper. But this computer screen has over 60 icons (it has other users)  
and it would be like a picture of Krishna covered in soil so perhpaps it would  
be a little sacroligous too.(?)

Dear friend,   
You can chant Arunachala Akshramana Maalai or any other works   
of Bhagavan, if it is for a purpose of your good health including good   
voice. There is no blashpemy. My wife chants within her mind, when   
she suffers a bronchial attack. This does not mean that you should   
not take medication. Medicines are given by doctors, the cure is by   
faith in Guru or God.   
If you have been initiated in a mantra, you can also continue that.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think you can have two purposes at the same time.   
To deepen your voice and to deepen your faith.   
You say it might be blasphemous to repeat God's name for such unholy purposes.   
I think Buddhist mantra is as sacred as Arunachala Siva mantra.   
As for Arunachala wall-paper, I understand your point.   
I used Arunachala photo as a wallpaper for my computer,   
in order to keep remembering it,   
but after reading your comment,   
I decided not to use it as a wallpaper.   
It is true that the holy photo seems to be contaminated with worldly  
documents.   
How you feel about this question would be different from person to person.   
You can do whatever seems to purify your mind.

I've been thinking about this too and I wonder how could something totally  
Pure be contaminated by such puny things But I've still not put it as  
wallpaper (because my sister would change it anyway).   
And btw, I also found out that chanting improves breathing which is healthy  
for the brain and the mind.   
Edit: And thank you Subramanian for your answer. I couldn't reply to it before  
for some reason, and my private message to you neither got sent.

How can Atma be contaminated? It is Absolute, nitya-suddhan,   
ever-pure, nirvikaran, ever without change and nirmalan, ever   
in uncontaminated in Itself. I have got Bhagavan Ramana's photo   
as the wallpaper in the comp. and Graham Boyd has placed the   
Hill on the website. Only we think we contaminate it, it will be   
contaminated because our mind enters the picture. The one way   
is to keep it in the photo in the Home Altar which is said to be   
kept pure. And again, it is mental play. I say my mantra Arunachala Siva, if  
I get up at 2 am., for urination and I say this   
mantra while in the toilet. Nothing happens to the Atma. It is   
ever pure.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. I agree with you. The levels of one's vasanas, good and bad   
have a role in determining the time of self realization. Vivekachoodamani  
says: "Vasana kshayam moksham."   
Arunachala Siva.

I guess it arunachala refers to the holy hill at Thiruvannamalai in Tamil  
Nadu, where the Annamalaiyar Temple, a temple of Lord Shiva is located. But i  
never been there as i wish..

Dear jpalmer,   
Yes. Arunachala is Tiruvannamalai. Siva there is called   
Arunachaleswara or Annamalaiyar. Before you decide to visit,   
kindly refer, if you want, the various guidances mentioned   
under the Topics Arunachala and Asramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Pranayams to everyone.   
Let me share the experience of arunachala.   
In April 1998, we(me and my uncle) decided to do first giripradakshanam and  
started our journey to arunachala from madras. I had a small bag with a rudram  
book, a walk-man with rudram tape, and rayban sunglasses and a a dhoti. My  
uncle had a rurdram book, some camphors and a dhoti.   
When we started our journey,I mentioned to my uncle that we need to buy some  
matchboxes for litting the camphor's when we worship the different lingams and  
he nodded on the same. In next couple of minutes a seller came in the bus,  
offering to sell cigarette lighters for Rs5 each and my uncle bought couple of  
it. I objected to this, and he argued with me that Agni is all the same,  
whether in lighter or in a matchbox.   
We reached arunachala in the evening, and being a chitra full moon on that  
day, the devotees rush was heavy. From the entrance of the temple, we took an  
auto, and he mentioned that one way trip is Rs.15 to ramanashram, and we  
agreed. All of a sudden, when we were getting down, in ramanashram, the auto  
driver mentioned that we can pay Rs25 for the round trip and he will wait in  
the gates of ramanashram to get us back to the temple. we agreed. He  
mentioned, that we can leave the bag in the auto itself, and he will take care  
of them.   
When we came back, the auto was gone. We walked back to the temple and my  
uncle was cursing the fate. I mentioned that if the belongings were us, then  
it will return else it is gone. My uncle snubbed me, that I am so much  
philosophical.   
When we reached the entrance of the temple, suddenly the same auto driver came  
in front of us and started apologizing to us and he mentioned that he got a  
trip in ramanashram and came to temple and vowed to returned back in next  
20minutes, thinking that we will stay at least an hour in ramanashram. We were  
delighted and surprised, how he could have found us in the millions of people  
on that full moon day. He brought us both of the bags and handed over and  
started leaving. In the spur of moment, I realized that we had not paid his  
trip fare, and called him again to handover his Rs15. He took and in a split  
second gone.   
Then only, we noticed that we had not checked our belongings in his presence,  
and hurriedly looking for it. Surprising mine was everything there( glass,  
walk man, book, dhoti) and also of uncles except the...   
lighter.   
My uncle was moved in tears, and he realized that even though the agni is all  
same, still the channel is most important for enlightenment.   
I have a strong prayer for arunachala, and like to see the place with  
cleanliness since it is one of the sacred places of the universe. I am eagerly  
waiting for the day, when arunachala answer's my prayers.   
I have many spiritual experiences with arunachala, and I will write in the  
blog often.

Dear Maheswaran,   
Welcome to the blog.   
Your post about Girivalam. Such miracles, big or small do happen   
in and around the Hill. The Hill itself is a mystery. Please do   
write about your experiences for us to share.   
Once I met Mr.J. Jayaraman, the Librarian in the centenary library at   
about 2.30 PM, on an afternoon, (I was given accommodation   
in the Morvi Guest House). He was talking to me for quite some   
time and told me about great advaita books written in Tamil   
Verses. Most of us know only about Vivekachoodamani and   
Kaivalya Navaneetham. Mr. J said that there are 16 such books.   
Next morning, I went for Girivalam and was seeing the Lingams   
and also went to Isanya Math at the eastern side. I went inside   
the Isanya Desikar Math and prayed to the Lingam. There, the priest showed me  
some books published by Kovilur Math and sold   
there, all brand new books. I could get three volumes and it   
contained 9 of the 16 books mentioned by Mr. J. I also purchased   
one set for Mr. J and gave it to him next morning.   
Miracles do happen __ even today!   
Arunachala Siva.
