When Sorupananda went for his meal, Tattuvaraya, who was left alone, pondered  
over the words of his Guru.   
Concurring with his remarks, he composed Sasivanna Bodham before Sorupananda  
had returned from   
eating his meal. He placed it at the feet of his Guru (when Sorupananda  
reappeared) and prostrated.   
Sorupananda was delighted at the simplicity of is style and the speed with  
which Tattuvaraya composed   
poetry.   
The next incident is the story of the Bharani that Bhagavan narrated and  
referred to. There are several   
sources of Tattuvaraya's life, and the details vary from text to text. The  
version that appears in the narrative   
is slightly different from the one Bhagavan told, and it also has a few extra  
details: Tattuvaraya composed some Vedanata Sastras, but was mostly in Samadhi. Around  
that time some   
Veerasaivas, who were on a pilgrimage, along with some pandits, came before  
Tattuvaraya, who was   
sitting in the presence of Sorupananda.   
'They read the bharani and complained: 'A bharani is only sung about some  
great heroes who have killed   
a thousand male elephants on the battlefield. How is it that you have composed  
this kind of poem on your   
Guru who has not heard of or known heroic valor even in his dreams?'   
To this Tattuvaraya replied 'As our Guru kills the ego elephants of  
disciples, I sang this way.'   
They responded, 'The ego elephant that you mentioned is not visible to the  
eye, so it is not proper to   
compose in this way. However, even to kill one ego elephant would take many,  
many days. How did   
he manage to kill the ego of 1000 disciples simultaneously?   
Tattuvaraya, thinking that they should be shown through a demonstration,  
resumed his Samadhi state,   
without replying to them.   
Under the power and influence of Sorupananda all the pandits who came remained  
in Paripuranam, (had   
the full experience of the Self) for three days, without knowing either night  
or day. On the fourth day,   
Tattuvaraya opened his eyes. All the pandits arose and prostrated to both  
Tattuvaraya and Sorupananda.   
They said, 'It was because of our ignorance that we objected.   
The power of your (Sorupananda's) presence is such that even if 10,000  
disciples happen to come, it is   
(the presence) has the ability to bring them all to maturity simultaneously.'   
Then they composed their own verses in praise of the Bharani and departed.
