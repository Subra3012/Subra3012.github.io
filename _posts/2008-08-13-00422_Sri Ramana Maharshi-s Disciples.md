Dear Friends,   
 Do you know any devotees who are still living and have met Sri Ramana Maharshi ?   
I know about David Godman mailed him and he replied.   
Who else ?   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, there are Sri V.S. Ramanan and Sri V. Ganesan   
who are Bhagavan's brother's grandsons. I am not sure   
whether Michael James and Robert Butler are still there.   
There is also one more gentleman called Dr. Venkata   
Subramanian, who co-authored David Godman for   
some books. I am not sure whether Graham Boyd or   
Graham Bell met Bhagavan when He was in His body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,

Sir, do you think they have all realized ?   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Dr. Venkatasubramanian, is not me. I am a   
little worm in the vast ocean of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
All those people whom I mentioned in the post are realized   
persons. But you can verify only if you can.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, All those people are living in Tiruvannamalai,   
either inside the Ashram or outside in the town. You can   
write to them c/o Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai - 606 603.   
They will reply if they feel like.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel, Thanks for your information on V. Ganesan's   
book BE THE SELF. I did not remember to mention it. It is   
a small but excellent book on Bhagavan. There is one more   
book called THE MOMENTS REMEMBERED, about the nicest   
moments of some devotees with Bhagavan.   
Arunachala Siva.

Anybody knows about Suri Nagamma. She used to write down all the quieries and  
replies.

Dear Ramanaduli, Letters from Sri Ramansramam, by Suri   
Nagamma, has now come as a one large volume, combining   
the earlier two volumes into one. This costs Rs 200 and Rs 250   
with courier charges and is available from Sri Ramansramam.   
Recently during my May 2008, I pucrhased it for the second time!   
This covers about 4 years of Bhagavan's life, after Day by Day   
of Devaraja Mudaliar. The earliest one is Talks, by Munagala   
Venkatramaiah. These three books cover totally about 12 years'   
of Bhagavan's court in the Old Hall! A treasure indeed!   
Arunachala Siva.
