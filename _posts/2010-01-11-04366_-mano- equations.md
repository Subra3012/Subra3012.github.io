## Tiruppavai - 26  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 10, 2010, 07:12:25 AM  
---  
Today, on the 26th day of Dhanur (Margazhi) month, the 26th   
song of Tiruppavai is sung. Here the saint-poetess AndaL asks   
for various things for doing the Pavai Nonbu, i.e the penance   
of the young girls in Margazhi.   
O Mal!* the One with hue of a gem!** The One who lies on the   
banyan leaf. We want to do the penance of Margazhi as per   
the stipulations of the learned. For this purpose, we want you   
to confer us the requirements. Please give us white conch-shells   
like your Panchajanyam, big drum, as large as your glory, the crowd   
of devotees with us who shall sing, Long Live, Long Live Narayana,   
beautiful cute lamps, a banner and a pearl-studded umbrella (to   
ward off the effect of mist falling on our heads). Please grace us.   
* Mal, or Tirumal or Perumal is the name for Narayana in Tamil.   
Mal also means mad love. Narayana is said to have great love   
for his devotees.   
Narayna is black in complexion. AndaL merely calls him as   
a gem. There is no black gem. However, the gem's colour is   
not important. He is precious like gem.   
Here, the group is ready for going to the tank or river for early   
morning bath. It is still not day. It is dark outside. Hence, they   
want lamps, they want conchshells to make sounds of their going   
for the bath. They want lamps to show light on the dark pathway   
to river. They want a pearl-studded umbrella. The umbrella is   
to ward off the chill effect of the misty morning.   
Here, in this song, Sri Vaishnava commentators speak about   
Pavai Nonbu concept. Pavai is the girl or group of girls. Nonbu   
is the penance. It is a Vratam of the girls. Srimad Bhagavatam   
calls it as Katyayani Vratham, a vratham where the girls pray   
to Katyayani or Parvati for their weddings to noble men. But   
Sri Vaishnava commentators would not like to mention Parvati   
by calling it as Katyayani Vratam. But Srimad Bhagavatam   
which has been written even before Sri Vaishanava philosophy   
evolved,(13 C. AD) had no such qualms. They mention it as Katyayani Vratam.  
Rukmini in Srimad Bhagavatam did Katyayani Vratam before her marriage,  
originally proposed to Sisupala, but later   
consummated with Krishna.   
The Katyayani Vratam, envisages certain requirements like   
conch shells, drum, umbrella, banner and drums, so that the   
girls could go as a group to the river for bath.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 27  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 11, 2010, 07:31:50 AM

Today, the 27th song of Tiruppavai is sung, being 27th day of   
Dhanur (Margazhi) month. From this day, the rejoicing starts.   
The penance, like early morning bath in cool waters, not wearing   
flowers, speaking about only Narayana, visiting temple, calling every   
sleeping girl from her bed - is all over. Narayana and Balarama had   
come with them yesterday, and they have all gone for bath, did prayers, they  
got various requirements like umbrella, lamps, drum,   
conch-shells etc., and the union is over.   
Today they sing in all the glory of union of Jivatma and Paramatma.   
This day is called Koodara Valli Day, because the phrase "koodarai   
vellum seer govinda..." occurs in the first line of the song. One   
should be in Srivilliputtur or Sri Rangam today, to enjoy the festivities!   
The song reads:-   
O Govinda, who will conquer all those who are alien to you!*   
Please give us the following for our celebrations:-   
1\. Golden Bangles.   
2\. Golden Ear studs.   
3\. Sevi-poo - a golden ornament, which is connected to ears to   
the hairs. (This you can see also in modern days.)   
4. Golden tinkling anklets.   
We shall wear these and then also wear the new clothes, like silk   
sarees and skirts that you give. Then we shall eat the sweet pongal.   
What type of sweet pongal is that? It is made of choicest rice,   
milk, jaggery, coconut water, green grams, generously mixed with   
ghee, cashew nutes, dry grapes and cardamom powder!**   
When we eat this sweet pongal, the ghee that is hiding the pongal   
should trickle down from our hand to our elbows!   
mood nei peithu muzhangai vazhi vara --   
mooda - the hiding   
nei peithu - generous quantity of ghee   
muzhangai \- elbow   
vazhi vara - trickle down from hand to elbow!   
Then we shall all be together after eating in your nice company   
and seek your continued blessings.   
With that we shall terminate the Katyayani vratham.   
* He will conquer only the alien forces, like Kamsa. But what about the devotees who join him? He will be conquered by those who join him!   
 I shall separately write about sweet-pongal preparation. Nonduel, please  
have it noted and do it at your home.   
 One gentleman who had no faith in God but great love for   
Tamil and food, was asked as to what he understands from the   
divine verses of Tiruvembavai and Tiruppavai. He said: 1. I do not believe in God. So, these do not attract me as a   
devotee, because I am not one.   
2. But I love Tamil. The Tamil verses are really heart-melting   
and melodious.   
3. And I learnt how to prepare nice sweet pongal from AndaL.   
Oh, with ghee oozing out and dripping down to the elbows.....   
I wish I should not develop high cholesterol.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 27 (2)  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 11, 2010, 07:40:11 AM

How to prepare that divine dish of sweet pongal?   
Take a copper or bronze pot. Do not for heaven's sake use a   
pressure cooker.   
Pour a little water and allow it to boil. Then put one measure of   
green grams. After a few minutes, clean the rice carefully in water   
and add three measures of rice. Allow it to boil. Then add good   
quantity of milk, say about 5 measures and one measure of coconut   
water. Add 4 measures of jaggery, after cleaning it thoroughly.   
Stir it and allow it to boil and then let it become a fluid, yellow in colour,  
but not a sticky solid. Add one measure of ghee and stir it again, till it  
becomes a coagulant fluid.   
Then, put out the fire. Roast generous quantity of cashew nuts   
and dry grapes in ghee. Add cardamom powder. Add this roasted   
cashew and grapes mixture to the Pongal and stir it again and   
then again put out the fire.   
Now serve it. No need for any side dishes.   
Eat shamelessly. Mooda nei peithu muzhangai vazhi vaara...   
Let the ghee trickle down to your elbows. No shame.   
Such a divine Pongal was served on 31st December 2009, in   
Sri Ramanasramam, for lunch.   
Arunachala Siva.

In fact Manikkavachagar's TiruppaLLi Ezhuchi and Tiruvembavai   
were composed in Tiruvannamalai. Both the poems are full of   
nature worship.   
In Verse 2, he says: Aruna has come come to the east. The darkness is slowly leaving.   
Like Your face (Siva's), the Sun rises full of mercy for living beings.   
The lotus is blooming. The six legged bee is humming around   
the flowers. O the Lord of Tiruperundurai, the Hill with full of   
ocean like grace, please wake up.   
Again, in Verse 3 he says: The cuckoo is cooing. The cocks are cooing. The red-white starks   
are making melodious sounds. The conch-shells in the temple   
are blown by the priests. The stars are dimming with the sunlight,   
like grace of other gods against your Grace. O the Lord of   
Tiruperundurai, show me your feet that are swarmed by gods.   
O the rarity among the rarities, but easy to reach for me! O my   
Lord, please wake up (and grace).   
Again, in Verse 4, he says: The veena players are playing their instruments. The Yazh players   
(guitar like instrument) are playing their instruments. The Vedic   
Brahmins are chanting Rig Veda and the Tamil devotees are chanting Tamil  
slokas. Some are with folded hands. Some others are prostrating. Some more  
weeping. Some else are melting in their   
bodies. Some more are keeping their hands over their heads and   
praying. O Lord of Tiruperundurai, please take charge of me and rule over me.  
Please wake up and grace.   
One cannot describe the Nature, the early morning scenes and   
Nature's manifestation, better than Manikkavachagar and AndaL.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 27 (3)  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 11, 2010, 07:59:33 AM  
---  
Katyayani Vratham of AndaL and Manikkavachagar is over today.   
They are rejoicing. The pongal is distributed and there is no more   
tough penances.   
Pongal which is celebrated on 14th January 2010, Makara month   
1st Day, is essentially a celebration towards Nature's bounty.   
Harvest is over. Plenty of paddy, sugar cane, turmeric and ginger   
plants, groundnuts have been harvested and brought home. The people thank Sun  
God, for the gift. Without sun, where are the rains and spronting of seeds?  
Where is life in this world? Sun is the most   
ancient god. He has got a chariot with seven white horses. It reperesents  
the vibgyor of white light, which separates into seven   
colours when sent through a crystal. His charioteer is Aruna. Aruna is a god  
in charge of early morning, before sunrise. He is red in   
colour representing the red sky, dawn before sunrise. Sun is golden   
yellow. He is Siva Surya. Siva is also golden yellow in colour. His   
seven horses also represent the seven days of a week. He whips   
the horses and drive. The whip is the primordial Time. He travels   
from east to west but siderially from south to north. He reaches   
the southmost point and moves back to north on Pongal Day, Makara   
Sankaranti. He moves towards Tropic of Capricorn. That is why,   
Pongal or Makara Sankaranti is celebrated on the day, when sun moves to Zodiac  
of Capricorn, Makara in Sanskrit.   
The Pongal should have been celebrated on 27th of Dhanur month   
itself, i.e. 2 or 3 days before Makara Sankaranti. However, it has   
been shifted to Makara 1st day, as per corrections in astronomy/   
astrology.   
Ancient Hindus knew astronomy/astrology, several centuries before   
Galielo and Copernicus found that earth is not flat and is not at the   
centre of the universe. In fact, earth is in between Venus and Mars,   
among the planets, and is revolving around the Sun once in 365.25   
days and earth is also self-rotating. It is an ideal planet for life   
evolvement. Mercury and Venus are too hot. Mars is hot without   
oxygen. Jupiter etc., are too cold for living beings.   
Arunachala Siva.

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.

Dear I,   
Quote  
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.  
The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Quote

Yes it is, it is a threat of life, or death itself for the mind, thought, ego,  
I. But some how, this mind/ego/I/thought wants to strike a compromise the best  
of both sides, it wants to continue to be there along with 'Self defined  
realisation' hence it keeps arriving at various different options and  
conclusions, because it wants to be there all the time!

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that  
thoughts can continue!

Dear Nagaraj,   
What you say is correct.   
However much we analyze with the mind, it will fall short (although it may  
give good indications).   
That is the "humour".

Dear silentgreen, Nagaraj,   
There is a book called The Chess Mind, written by Gerald Abrams.   
This book analyzes the mind of grandmasters in chess. Some   
of them like Alekine, (who became a world champion at a young   
age), was literally a madcap. He was not fit for anything else   
in life. But before a chessboard, his mind got oriented somehow   
and he played wonderful chess. The chess superstar of recent   
times, Bobby Fischer was also an eccentric. He always preferred   
a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by   
not appearing in time, he was 0-2. From the third game, he showed   
his prowess and became 12.50-6.50, (with three games to spare!)   
and became the world champion.   
In the case of some painters like Van Gogh, they were excellent   
painters. But in normal life, they were eccentric. He was not goodlooking  
but he loved a girl. When that girl said that his ears   
were not beautiful, he cut off his ears and sent them to his girlfriend.   
In case of Frederich Nietszhe, he was a madcap. But he did not   
believe in God and found a new religion with the head as Zarathustra. (This is  
not to be confused by Zorastrianism of Parsis.)   
His famous book is Thus Spake Zarathustra. In his old age he   
became sick and totally mad and was lying in bed with heavy   
medication. Someone was reading his book Thus Spake Zarathustra   
sitting at his bedside. Niteszhe told him: "What a beautiful   
writing! I have also written some books like that!"   
The great mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died   
at his middle age due tp tuberculosis, was a prodigy in Numerical equations.  
He was sent to Cambridge specially for research, though he was not even a  
graduate. Some of his theorems in his Last Note Book, are yet to be solved!  
You can read the book, The Man who   
knew Infinity to know more about Ramanujan.   
The mind is a wondrous power in Atma Swarupa..... says Bhagavan Ramana in His  
Who am I? That is why all seekers try to kill this mind or kill the thoughts  
to reach the Self. Mind manifests the world   
and until and unless the world disappears the Self will not reveal   
itself. These two are like the typical advaitic paradox, rope and the   
snake.   
Arunachala Siva.

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.

Dear I,   
Quote

The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that

a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by   
not appearing in time, he was 0-2. From the third game, he showed   
his prowess and became 12.50-6.50, (with three games to spare!)   
and became the world champion.   
In the case of some painters like Van Gogh, they were excellent   
painters. But in normal life, they were eccentric. He was not goodlooking  
but he loved a girl. When that girl said that his ears   
were not beautiful, he cut off his ears and sent them to his girlfriend.   
In case of Frederich Nietszhe, he was a madcap. But he did not   
believe in God and found a new religion with the head as Zarathustra. (This is  
not to be confused by Zorastrianism of Parsis.)   
His famous book is Thus Spake Zarathustra. In his old age he   
became sick and totally mad and was lying in bed with heavy   
medication. Someone was reading his book Thus Spake Zarathustra   
sitting at his bedside. Niteszhe told him: "What a beautiful   
writing! I have also written some books like that!"   
The great mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died   
at his middle age due tp tuberculosis, was a prodigy in Numerical equations.  
He was sent to Cambridge specially for research, though he was not even a  
graduate. Some of his theorems in his Last Note Book, are yet to be solved!  
You can read the book, The Man who   
knew Infinity to know more about Ramanujan.   
The mind is a wondrous power in Atma Swarupa..... says Bhagavan Ramana in His  
Who am I? That is why all seekers try to kill this mind or kill the thoughts  
to reach the Self. Mind manifests the world

itself. These two are like the typical advaitic paradox, rope and the

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.

Dear I,   
Quote  
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.  
The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Yes it is, it is a threat of life, or death itself for the mind, thought, ego,  
I. But some how, this mind/ego/I/thought wants to strike a compromise the best  
of both sides, it wants to continue to be there along with 'Self defined

conclusions, because it wants to be there all the time!

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that  
thoughts can continue!   
Manonasam is inevitable.

Dear silentgreen, Nagaraj,   
There is a book called The Chess Mind, written by Gerald Abrams.   
This book analyzes the mind of grandmasters in chess. Some   
of them like Alekine, (who became a world champion at a young   
age), was literally a madcap. He was not fit for anything else   
in life. But before a chessboard, his mind got oriented somehow   
and he played wonderful chess. The chess superstar of recent   
times, Bobby Fischer was also an eccentric. He always preferred   
a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.

Dear silentgreen,   
Your post.   
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.

Dear I,   
Quote  
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.  
The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Yes it is, it is a threat of life, or death itself for the mind, thought, ego,  
I. But some how, this mind/ego/I/thought wants to strike a compromise the best  
of both sides, it wants to continue to be there along with 'Self defined  
realisation' hence it keeps arriving at various different options and  
conclusions, because it wants to be there all the time!

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that  
thoughts can continue!   
Manonasam is inevitable.

What you say is correct.   
However much we analyze with the mind, it will fall short (although it may

Dear silentgreen, Nagaraj,   
There is a book called The Chess Mind, written by Gerald Abrams.   
This book analyzes the mind of grandmasters in chess. Some   
of them like Alekine, (who became a world champion at a young   
age), was literally a madcap. He was not fit for anything else   
in life. But before a chessboard, his mind got oriented somehow   
and he played wonderful chess. The chess superstar of recent   
times, Bobby Fischer was also an eccentric. He always preferred   
a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by   
not appearing in time, he was 0-2. From the third game, he showed   
his prowess and became 12.50-6.50, (with three games to spare!)   
and became the world champion.   
In the case of some painters like Van Gogh, they were excellent   
painters. But in normal life, they were eccentric. He was not goodlooking  
but he loved a girl. When that girl said that his ears   
were not beautiful, he cut off his ears and sent them to his girlfriend.   
In case of Frederich Nietszhe, he was a madcap. But he did not   
believe in God and found a new religion with the head as Zarathustra. (This is  
not to be confused by Zorastrianism of Parsis.)   
His famous book is Thus Spake Zarathustra. In his old age he   
became sick and totally mad and was lying in bed with heavy   
medication. Someone was reading his book Thus Spake Zarathustra   
sitting at his bedside. Niteszhe told him: "What a beautiful   
writing! I have also written some books like that!"   
The great mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died   
at his middle age due tp tuberculosis, was a prodigy in Numerical equations.  
He was sent to Cambridge specially for research, though he was not even a  
graduate. Some of his theorems in his Last Note Book, are yet to be solved!  
You can read the book, The Man who   
knew Infinity to know more about Ramanujan.   
The mind is a wondrous power in Atma Swarupa..... says Bhagavan Ramana in His  
Who am I? That is why all seekers try to kill this mind or kill the thoughts  
to reach the Self. Mind manifests the world   
and until and unless the world disappears the Self will not reveal   
itself. These two are like the typical advaitic paradox, rope and the   
snake.

Dear I,   
Quote  
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.  
The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Yes it is, it is a threat of life, or death itself for the mind, thought, ego,  
I. But some how, this mind/ego/I/thought wants to strike a compromise the best  
of both sides, it wants to continue to be there along with 'Self defined  
realisation' hence it keeps arriving at various different options and  
conclusions, because it wants to be there all the time!

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that  
thoughts can continue!   
Manonasam is inevitable.

However much we analyze with the mind, it will fall short (although it may

Dear silentgreen, Nagaraj,   
There is a book called The Chess Mind, written by Gerald Abrams.   
This book analyzes the mind of grandmasters in chess. Some   
of them like Alekine, (who became a world champion at a young   
age), was literally a madcap. He was not fit for anything else   
in life. But before a chessboard, his mind got oriented somehow   
and he played wonderful chess. The chess superstar of recent   
times, Bobby Fischer was also an eccentric. He always preferred   
a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by   
not appearing in time, he was 0-2. From the third game, he showed   
his prowess and became 12.50-6.50, (with three games to spare!)   
and became the world champion.   
In the case of some painters like Van Gogh, they were excellent   
painters. But in normal life, they were eccentric. He was not goodlooking  
but he loved a girl. When that girl said that his ears   
were not beautiful, he cut off his ears and sent them to his girlfriend.   
In case of Frederich Nietszhe, he was a madcap. But he did not   
believe in God and found a new religion with the head as Zarathustra. (This is  
not to be confused by Zorastrianism of Parsis.)   
His famous book is Thus Spake Zarathustra. In his old age he   
became sick and totally mad and was lying in bed with heavy   
medication. Someone was reading his book Thus Spake Zarathustra   
sitting at his bedside. Niteszhe told him: "What a beautiful   
writing! I have also written some books like that!"   
The great mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died   
at his middle age due tp tuberculosis, was a prodigy in Numerical equations.  
He was sent to Cambridge specially for research, though he was not even a  
graduate. Some of his theorems in his Last Note Book, are yet to be solved!  
You can read the book, The Man who   
knew Infinity to know more about Ramanujan.   
The mind is a wondrous power in Atma Swarupa..... says Bhagavan Ramana in His  
Who am I? That is why all seekers try to kill this mind or kill the thoughts  
to reach the Self. Mind manifests the world   
and until and unless the world disappears the Self will not reveal   
itself. These two are like the typical advaitic paradox, rope and the   
snake.

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.
