A tsunami alert was issued for Japan's northeast coast on Friday after a  
powerful 7.3-magnitude undersea earthquake struck, setting buildings in Tokyo  
swaying violently.   
Media reports said a one-metre-high wave could sweep ashore in Miyagi  
prefecture, an area badly hit by the March 2011 tsunami that devastated a  
large swathe of coast in the northeast, killing thousands.   
 **Broadcaster NHK, quoting the national meteorological agency, said the  
tsunami is expected to hit at 5:40 pm (0840 GMT).**   
The United States Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 7.3.

Is the above incident an indicator of the much talked about ending of the  
world by Dec 21, 2012 ?

No, I don't think so. Many earthquakes happen every single day around the  
world. Mayans have never talked about the end of the world but about the end  
of the age which is very different. In 21 december begins new cosmic cycle  
with its characteristics but it is nothing about the end of the world in the  
literal sense of the word.

Dear atmavichar100, I truly doubt it. I dont think the world will end.  
Something is,maybe,happening. The prophecies are telling about it too,Kali  
Yuga. But,i also doubt that particular date. I dont know how they could  
calculate so precisely something,from other tipe of calendar,and that much  
accurate.

Dear Hari, I think the same. I also believe some cults are projecting those  
ideas about world ending,to manipulate and project some sort of influence.  
What is good in spreding fear among people,and with it anarchy too?! I believe  
some fake prophets are using this kind of situation mostly.

Yes, Jewell. But in this case I don't think the Mayas have made such a  
prophecy. It is modern interpretation of their calendar.

Dear all,   
It all shows how the economic cycles find its rotations. Japan was in shambles  
after the II WW. Slowly they brought about   
prosperity. But now after 57 years the Japanese economy is slowly crumbling.  
It is all sports of god.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Krishna   
I wish human race was so deeply enlightened that it can predict the play of  
THE SUPREME MAYA exactly up to a calendar date
