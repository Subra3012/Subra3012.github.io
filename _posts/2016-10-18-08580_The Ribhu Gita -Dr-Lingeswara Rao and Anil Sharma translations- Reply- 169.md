Chapter 19: !. Ribhu: I shall expound the bliss of Brahman, which is rarely found in the  
three worlds. By hearing   
of that, one can achieve perpetual freedom.   
2. I am only the Self that is supreme bliss, ever just bliss alone. I am of the nature of absolute bliss.   
The world is fully Consciousness-Bliss.   
3. I am ever endless, unending. This world is Knowledge Bliss. I am of the nature of enlightened bliss.   
This mind is eternal bliss.   
4\. I am singular bliss alone. I am the knower of unitariness. Cultivate  
this attitude for the sure subsidence   
of the world.   
5\. I am ever the truth, the light of transcendence, ever the qualities such  
as Truth etc., ever the Self devoid   
of truth etc; ever the light, the adorable.   
6. The Self as the illusory world is naught. The illusory mind stuff is naught. The Self with the appellation   
of illusion is naught. The rogue of a mind is naught.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
