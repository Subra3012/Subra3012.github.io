Is there any speech available by ramamna maharishi which is directly delivered  
by maharishi himself? I've never heard the voice of maharishi. If anyone has  
any links pls let me know.

My dear gorak, there is no recorded speech of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. There  
are only photographs and short, black and white   
video coverages. This is our misfortune.   
Arunachala Siva.

Are you sure there are no speeches by Maharishi? I heard that there were a lot  
of europeans who visited him in the late 1940's. Not even one has recorded his  
speech? How will I ever hear Bhagavan's speech in his own divine voice? Thanks  
anyway Siva, for your quick response.

My dear gorak, to my knowledge, there is no recorded message of   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. People like David Godman, has done an   
extensive researh on this. There is no recorded message.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for your quick response again. Pls don't think "I didn't believe you".  
I was just wondering that when we have a few videos footages of Bhagavan, how  
come we didn't have an audio recording. Anyway I still have hopes that someday  
someone will be able to find it.
