## Kundalini  
Author: silentgreen         Date: December 09, 2010, 03:50:53 PM

**Kundalini** is often described from the Bhakti point of view, as the  
energetic aspect of the **Devi** or **Shakti**.   
Many sadhaks practicing Kundalini Yoga are worshippers of Devi.   
The topic is very sublime and often crowded with wrong notions. It is also out  
of the reach for many of us. It is related to mystical experience. Therefore  
it is better to understand what a mystical experience is.   
Here are some of the passages taken from the writings of **Gopi Krishna** who  
was graced by Kundalini awakening and who demystified many notions about  
mystical experiences and brought about a light of understanding regarding  
them.   
#. The class of human beings that has exerted the greatest influence on the  
thinking and behavior of mankind has been that of the prophets, saviors and  
mystics, including the founders of all current faiths. Kings, philosophers,  
rulers, scientists or scholars have, all combined, played a secondary role.  
Revealed religious teaching has held a fascination and maintained a grip on  
the human mind that is unmatched in any other sphere of life. This grip has  
persisted for thousands of years. Why? What makes millions upon millions of  
human beings believe implicitly in the words of the founder of their faith  
even in this rational age? While literally flooded by the marvels of  
technology, why do the masses still have greater faith in the ideals of their  
religion and the teachings of their prophets or saints than in the rational  
expositions of scientists and philosophers?   
Why do even distinguished scientists subscribe to faith? What is the  
explanation for this paradox? There are examples where even those rationalists  
who were atheists in their youth turned religious towards the close of life.  
Even materialistic political ideologies have not been able to uproot this  
inherent urge in the masses. No psychologist or thinker has so far provided a  
rational explanation for this apparently erratic behavior of the human mind.   
I am suggesting for the first time an explanation for the profound phenomenon  
of religion for close examination and empirical verification by scientists and  
scholars. I do so with a full sense of my responsibility and the duty I owe to  
humankind and to God. From my point of view, religious experience is not to be  
treated lightly and cannot form a subject on which everyone can write or talk.  
It is of the profoundest significance and importance to humanity. This is why  
secrecy has always been maintained in respect of the esoteric doctrines of  
faith and why the hidden truths about God and the soul were talked of with  
bated breath.   
#. It has always been felt instinctively that religion is a sacred subject  
beyond the province of the intellect. The massive Vedas of Ancient India were  
committed to memory and transmitted orally, generation after generation, for  
centuries, a prodigious feat, because there was a subconscious awareness that  
what they contained was of the utmost importance for humankind. The concern  
shown by theologians and divines for every word and line of the gospels of all  
faiths, to preserve them from distortion or interpolation, has also been due  
to the same intuitive impulse.   
The reason is that mystical vision or, in other words, the vision of God, is  
the target of human evolution. Those who had it in the right form exerted a  
tremendous fascination on the minds of others, because they were the first  
arrivals at a destination for which all of us are bound. Their teachings have  
been cherished and acted upon with the utmost care, as they contain hints and  
guidelines about the Path that all of us have to traverse to reach the same  
stage.   
#. If the race has to survive, not only political dissension but also  
religious discord must cease. But how can this concord be brought about? In my  
opinion, the only way is for science to locate the factors responsible for  
enlightenment. The illuminated founders of all faiths were human beings. They  
were born and had bodies like others. What mystery lay behind their  
extraordinary visions, the power of their words and the tremendous influence  
they exerted on countless human beings constitutes a riddle that has not yet  
been rationally answered.   
#. Mystical vision, enlightenment and prophethood are the natural endowments  
of a more evolved human brain, brought in tune with the spiritual realities of  
the universe. Dogmatic barriers to the acceptance of this position will  
gradually cease when the organic factors responsible for this transformation  
are clearly demonstrated by the objective methods of science.   
#. In the highest states of mystical ecstasy every object springs to life and  
the whole of Nature becomes alive. One incredible living, feeling Ocean of  
Being connects the mystic with every object in the universe. Mystical ecstasy  
is not an altered state of consciousness. It is not normal human consciousness  
in a state of rapture, or intense absorption in the contemplation of one  
object, or of quietude in which the mind reflects only a serene and silent  
state of awareness. It is not akin to the mental conditions produced by LSD,  
nitrous oxide, hypnosis, biofeedback, or any other artificial method or  
chemical.   
#. There is no class of books that has been preserved with such love and care  
and regarded with such veneration as the gospels of every faith. They are  
considered sacred because what they deal with has been extremely rare and the  
subject they discuss is unfamiliar to the discursive intellect.   
#. Present-day writings on altered states of consciousness only confuse the  
issue. What state of mind do they actually try to represent? If it is mystical  
experience, most of them deplorably fall short of the actual position.  
Mystical vision has nothing to do with sorcery, magic, miraculous happenings,  
weird adventures in the realm of the paranormal, bizarre visionary experiences  
or fantasies of any kind. In the genuine illuminative state, there is no  
clouding of the intellect, no riot of colors, no encounters with strange  
creatures, no weird or bizarre scenes but only an indescribable state of  
glory, happiness and love, coupled with the direct experience of an all-  
pervading, extended consciousness, or an Almighty, Omnipresent Cosmic Being.   
#. The only sources available to gain correct and precise information about  
this state are the religious scriptures and the writings of the great mystics  
of the world. Since illuminated consciousness, and not altered consciousness,  
is the goal of human evolution, it is of the utmost importance to make a  
distinction between the works of mystics and the fanciful, highly colored, or  
sensational, narratives of those who wish to create an applauding gallery for  
themselves, or who mistakenly believe that they have had the experience  
without making any attempt to confirm their belief.   
#. Augustine, quoted by Eckhart, likens it to being struck by lightning, when  
one hears inwardly the affirmation âTruth,â to put a seal of authenticity  
on the experience.   
St. Paul fell in a swoon on the road to Damascus and Moses experienced it as a  
fire in the bush.   
Mohammed saw himself carried on a winged horse, called Buraq, to the near  
Presence of God, and the experience had an overwhelming effect on his life.   
In one instant of grace, Buddha realized that he was enlightened. A long  
period of life spent before that in austerity and religious practices brought  
forth no result comparable to this flash.   
According to the papyri found in Egypt, Jesus is reported to have said,â  
_Let him not who seeks cease until he finds, and when he finds he shall be  
astonished. Astonished he shall reach the Kingdom, and having reached the  
Kingdom he shall rest._ â   
One of the Upanishads compares Brahman to a thunderbolt upraised, ruling all  
the elements of creation.   
The Sufi Bullah Shah, sings,â _To ascend the gallows is the pathway that  
leads to the love of the Lord. If you desire to have His vision, be ever  
prepared to wager your life for His sight._ â   
The Bhagavad-Gita graphically describes the impact:  _" If the splendor of a thousand suns were to blaze out together, in the sky,  
that might resemble the glory of the Mahatman.There Pandava (Arjuna) beheld  
the whole universe divided into manifold parts, standing in one in the body of  
the Deity of Deities. Then he, Arjuna, overwhelmed with astonishment, his hair  
standing on end, bowed down his head to the Shining One, and with joined palms  
spoke.â_   
#. In every case of illumination, mere visionary experience is not sufficient.  
Illumination must be attended by certain objective signs to confirm it. Why  
has mystical vision such a powerful impact on the mind of the beholder that he  
or she often becomes intoxicated with the love of God? Why does he prefer  
solitude to even the most joyous company and renounce the ordinary pleasures  
of life to revel in a delight before which all the pleasures of the earth seem  
stale?   
to be continued. ..

#. Our difficulty in explaining the nature of mystical experience stems mainly  
from the fact that we are not able to visualize a state of consciousness  
superior to our own. We cannot even imagine the state of mind of a musical or  
mathematical genius. A child cannot imagine the mind of an adult. We can  
understand the position better if we suppose that consciousness has an  
infinite series of gradations from the most strong to the most dilute.   
This we can illustrate by treating our consciousness as the faint glimmer shed  
by a spark of fire and comparing it with the blinding glare on the gigantic  
surface of the sun. The human eye cannot even bear the sight of this splendor.  
It would be struck blind even when millions of miles away. Our consciousness  
is an extremely dilute form of this splendor. Another analogy would be to  
liken our mind to a droplet of water and to compare it to an ocean of life. If  
this one small droplet of Divine Intelligence in man has been able to create  
the present amazing world of art, philosophy, science and the wonders of  
technology, what is impossible for the Almighty Ocean itself?   
#. We are not able by any means to look into the mind of another person, as we  
look into a material object. Any mind other than our own is a completely  
unknown territory to us. Each one of the six billion human minds, dwelling on  
the earth, is an enchanted island invisible to the rest. There is no  
instrument that can see, measure, touch, smell or taste consciousness. Then  
how can we be conscious of Universal Consciousness, even if all our life we  
live, sleep, think and act in it? This explains why mystical ecstasy has such  
an overwhelming impact on the mind. The visionary, for the first time,  
perceives the all-surpassing splendor of Cosmic Intelligence. This is also the  
reason why intellect and science are both lost in the labyrinth of matter, for  
they look at the universe, as it were, through a filtering glass.   
#. As the vision unfolds itself, the whole universe seems to melt in the  
splendor of the One present everywhere. In order to understand mystical  
ecstasy in its true proportion, it is necessary to mark the difference between  
the animal and the human mind. The animal mind is extremely restricted and has  
absolutely no awareness of the world of knowledge, thought, imagination and  
feeling existing in man. It has absolutely no idea of science, mathematics,  
philosophy, poetry, literature, medicine, music, painting and sculpture which,  
all together, comprise a whole world entirely out of the reach of any other  
form of life on earth.   
How has man taken this prodigious leap over the brute? How has the new world  
opened in him? Obviously it is by the addition of more brain matter and a  
difference in the quality and configuration of the brain. We are told that the  
reptilian and animal brains still survive in man. Be that as it may, it is  
clear that the undoubted superiority of the mind of man over that of the  
animal is primarily due to the superiority of the human brain. Dolphins, too,  
have large brains and as is well known, they are among the most intelligent  
creatures, below man, on earth. Here we come to a crucial point in our  
discussion. So far as science is concerned, the human brain is a sealed  
compartment and has no other potentiality present in it over and above those  
manifested so far. This is an error. So long as we continue to hold this view,  
the phenomena of mystical consciousness and extrasensory perception will  
continue to be unsolvable riddles for humanity. We have seen what a tremendous  
change the addition of some ounces of brain matter has made in the life of man  
as compared to that of animals. But the mere quantitative or qualitative  
change in the brain does not explain the whole story. Dolphins, with an almost  
parallel brain weight, bear little comparison to man. Some small species of  
monkeys have proportionately larger brains than human beings. The ant with its  
tiny brain has an organizing capacity and a social order that is amazing.   
#.. .. but there is another element in nature, imperceptible to our senses,  
which is at the bottom of all phenomena of life. We can call it by the name of  
**life-energy**. It is this force that is credited with magical or miraculous  
powers in all the occult systems of the past and is known by various names,  
such as astral light, odic force, psychic energy, orgone, supersolar force,  
chi, etc. In India, it is known as **prana** and has been universally held to  
be the lever behind mystical vision and paranormal gifts for more than three  
thousand years. Prana can well be the matrix from which even physical energy  
is born. It might be present in the atom and subnuclear particles without ever  
being detected by any means known to science. It is, no doubt, a galling  
position, but it is true. The pranic force, in combination with atoms and  
molecules, fashions the bricks as also the complex structures of life. For  
this reason it has been held to be the architect of the organic kingdom and  
the driving force behind evolution.   
#. The power of the Creator that brings the universe into existence is known  
as **shakti** in India. Shakti is both mind and matter. Gnosis, or Knowledge,  
comes from the Creator. This is the divine spark or soul in us, the Inner  
Light that illumines the mind and intellect. We sometimes become aware of this  
real "Knower" in states of deep contemplation, or in the impartial Self, which  
tells us that we are wrong when in the heat of anger or passion, or in any  
other turbulent mental state, or disturbed reason, we wrongly act or think. It  
is this **Self**, or **Atman**, as it is named in the Upanishads, that  
becomes more clear and perceptible in the mystical state. Shakti, as the power  
of the Creator, is incomprehensible to the intellect.   
#. Shakti is unconditioned and limitless, capable of creating any kind of  
world or substance one can conceive of or that is inconceivable. Prana, too,  
is a form of shakti. It is the energy behind the phenomena of life. It is the  
Power behind faith-healing and miracles, as also behind time, space, or  
causality, and also emptiness, timelessness and chaos. What amazing worlds,  
what incredible forms of life, and what unimaginable planes of existence, it  
has created or will create we can never know. The dream state is a distant  
sample to show its bewildering play. It is **maya**, the incomprehensible and  
unexplainable illusory power of the Creator, which our intellect can never  
entirely understand.   
#. Indian metaphysics is based on the experience of **samadhi** or mystical  
vision. In this state, the subtle worlds of mind and prana become perceptible.  
In the time to come, science will have to adopt the same methods to reach  
these transcendent planes. There is no other way for man to find other areas  
of creation not perceptible to our senses. It is only then that the true  
proportion of creation can be understood by the human mind, for we deal only  
with the fraction perceptible to us.   
#. The differences in our mental constitutions and character are all due to  
variations in the spectrum of each individual. In the pranic plane, human  
personalities exist as clear and distinct as their mortal frames in the  
physical world. During the course of mystical ecstasy a new, more potent  
stream of prana enters the brain, creating a revolution in consciousness. The  
flow of this new pranic current is caused by a slight but clearly marked  
activity in the brain. It looks as if a hitherto silent area has leapt to  
sudden activity, demanding a more potent psychic fuel to sustain it.   
When the available store of this new pranic fuel is spent, the mystic again  
reverts to his normal consciousness, returning, as it were, from a smiling,  
brightly lit Garden of Paradise to the humdrum existence of a prosaic world.  
No words can express the grandeur and sublimity of the experience nor the  
happiness and serenity felt during the interval. In rare cases, the experience  
can become a perennial feature of life. In India, it has been called the  
**sahaja** or **jiwan-mukta** state.

#. Mystical experience is the perception of this celestial luster as a crown  
of glory round the soul. The soul is deprived of this Robe of Glory on its  
embodiment as a human being. But it recovers this Mantle of Light with noble  
striving when it attains the Illuminated state.   
The Chinese sage,Wei-Lang, in his sutra about the indwelling Buddha, expresses  
the same idea in these lines:  _Within the domain of our mind there is a Tathagata of Enlightenment who  
sends forth a powerful light which illumines externally the six gates (of  
sensation) and purifies them. This light is strong enough to pierce through  
the six heavens of desire, and when it is turned inwardly to the Essence of  
Mind it eliminates at once the three poisonous elements, purges away our sins  
which lead us to the hells, and enlightens us thoroughly within and without_.   
The Aitareya Upanishad describes the experience:  _He is Brahma, He is Indra, He is Praja-pati (Lord of the Universe). He is  
all these gods, and these five great elements, namely earth, air, ether,  
water, light, these things and those which are mingled of the fire, as it  
were, the seeds of one sort and another, those born from an egg, or those born  
from a womb, and those born from sweat, and born from a sprout, horses, cows,  
persons and elephants, whatever breathing thing that is here, whether moving  
or flying, or what is stationary, all this is guided by Intelligence, is  
established in Intelligence. The world is guided by Intelligence. The support  
is Intelligence_.   
This passage is of tremendous importance. It is the outcome of true mystical  
experience which shows Consciousness as the bedrock of all creation, both  
animate and inanimate.   
#. A new channel of perception comes into operation. What was but a point of  
awareness before, inextricably linked to a body of flesh and bone, becomes an  
Ocean, enfolding the whole of the universe, while the body and the "ego" that  
made up the personality of the observer recede further and further away,  
leaving the way open for a Cosmic Intelligence to manifest itself. It is  
important to remember that the experience is not of an impersonal kind. It is  
not as if we are witnessing an earthly scene. In the normal experience there  
always exists the duality of the âKnowerâ and the âKnown,â of the  
subjective mind and the objective world. This distinction persists even in  
dreams. Except in deep states of absorption, or the intense embrace of love,  
this sense of duality is an inalienable part of human awareness. In the  
mystical ecstasy, the very self is transfigured. It becomes both the subject  
and the object. The titanic Presence that now dominates the scene is the whole  
universe and the soul of the individual at the same time. It is the sun and  
the atom both.   
#. It is a breathtaking experience. The narrow, individual self is swept off  
from its anchor in the body and the world, like a straw carried away by a  
tidal wave of the ocean, to be confronted by infinity on every side.   
This is what Rumi tries to convey in the Dewan-l-Shamsi Tabrez in these lines:  _Having put Duality aside, the two worlds (this world and the other) are now  
one to me. It is One I seek,One I know, One I see and One I call_.   
Shankaracharya sums up the position in this way:  _The verdict of all discussions on the Vedanta is that the jiva (soul) and  
the whole of the universe are nothing but Brahman, and that liberation means  
abiding in Brahman, the indivisible entity The Shrubs themselves are authority  
(for the statement) that Brahman is One without a Second_.   
The following passage contains an important saying of Christ,   
according to the Egyptian papyri:  _.. And the Kingdom of Heaven is within you and whosoever knoweth himself  
shall find it and, having found it, ye shall know yourselves that ye are sons  
and heirs of the Father, the Almighty, and shall know yourselves that ye are  
in God and God in you.And ye are the city of God_.   
This is one of the clearest statements to show that the human body is a temple  
of the Divine and that the aim of human life is to experience this Divinity.  
But how can it be possible to achieve the Glorious Vision without  
transformation of the Self?   
#. Evolution is the only rational explanation for this ascent from the normal  
human perception to the paranormal state where the Kingdom of Heaven becomes a  
reality through the enhanced powers of our organic frame.

Dear silentgreen,   
Thanks for the very illuminating and instructive posts on Kundalini.   
Sakti is the power of mind or rather the power of the Self. Bhagavan   
Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 6: You alone exist, O Heart, the radiance of Awareness. In You a   
POWER [SAKTI] mysterious dwells, a POWER which without You   
is nothing. From this power of manifestation, there proceeds,   
along with a perceiver, a series of subtle shadowy thoughts which, lit by the  
reflected light of mind amid the whirl of prarabdha, appear within a shadowy  
spectacle of the world and appear without as the world perceived by the five  
senses as a film is projected   
through a lens. Whether perceived or unperceived, these thoughts are nothing  
apart from You, O Hill of Grace.   
The power or Sakti is Mahamaya. Without her one cannot overcome the Maya.  
She should only give way to realize the   
Sivam. She is called Grace and Mercy.   
Once someone asked Bhagavan: "Swami, why are you not writing anything about  
Sakti? You are always speaking about Sivam. Bhgagavan said smilingly: "Without her, how can I write or speak at all? She is within me."   
Thathagata perhaps, I am not sure, is the Heart-Centre.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
As far as I have read, I found that most of the spiritual traditions accept  
the principle of Shakti but each represent it with their own words or symbols.  
There is agreement in Shakti as life principle or energy, but why represent it  
with Devi? The difference / disagreement starts here. So different traditions  
worship Shakti with their own ways. Representation of Shakti as Devi seems to  
have originated in India. The Tantric tradition have provided a firm  
foundation to it. Buddhists also have their own tantric tradition (Vajrayana  
etc) and their own symbols.

#. There is a great deal of variation in the accounts of mystical vision  
available to us for study. Apart from the traditional mystics, whose frame of  
mind was essentially religious and who underwent various spiritual disciplines  
to attain the mystical state, there have been poets, philosophers, scientists  
and scholars who had a sudden visionary experience, once or several times in  
their life, without the practice of any orthodox religious or esoteric  
discipline.   
#. There have been well known mystics in recent times in whom ecstasy started  
from boyhood, as in the case of Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharishi. In both of  
them, the state of intense absorption was, as it were, a natural state of  
mind. Guru Nanak and Jnaneshwar were mystics from birth. The former in his  
talk, behavior and poetic composition, was a religious genius from the age of  
ten, while the latter wrote his famous commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, known  
as Jnaneshwari, and considered to be a classic, at the age of sixteen. There  
is no rational explanation for these extraordinary cases of mystical  
consciousness.   
#. What physiological factors are responsible for this difference?   
No one at present is able to answer this riddle. The moment this difference is  
located, the enigma of whether the human brain is still in a state of  
evolution or not will be solved. The human mind is never able to frame a  
correct picture of the state of its knowledge even a few decades ahead.   
The top intellects of the late 1800âs could never have imagined the state of  
knowledge of the intellects alive now. Similarly, the latter can never  
correctly visualize the mind of those living in the latter part of the twenty-  
first century. There are extremely few who can think ahead of their time.   
#. The science of life has reached a stage where a breakthrough in our  
knowledge about the brain is imminent. This would show that the religious  
impulse is genetically present in human beings. Where it does not exist, a  
departure from the normal is indicated. The aim of the impulse is to effect  
coordination between the evolutionary modeling of the body and the surface  
consciousness of the individual. There is no other explanation for mystical  
experience.   
#. In dealing with mystical ecstasy we deal with a fundamental impulse in the  
human mind. Modern science has no awareness of the fact that the average human  
brain, as the result of continued evolution, is now ripe for the manifestation  
of another mode of cognition superior to the intellect. It is only through  
this channel that consciousness can be perceived as an independent reality,  
existing in a boundless universe of its own.   
This emergence of this cognitive faculty was designated by the ancient Indian  
adepts as the opening of the " **Third Eye**, " or the " **Tenth Door**." The  
Egyptians represented it by the symbol of the Serpent on the headdress of  
Pharaohs, the " **Eye of Horus**, " and by other emblems. The whole occult,  
esoteric, hermetic, and alchemic, literature of humankind revolves round this  
amazing possibility in the human brain.   
#. The life stories of saints throughout the world often contain accounts of  
their miraculous performances. How are we able to account for then? Patanjali,  
who flourished centuries before the birth of Christ and was the author of the  
first authoritative treatise on Yoga, treats psychic, or miraculous, gifts as  
an inevitable harvest of yogic discipline and divides them into eight  
categories.   
There is a close affinity between the practice of yoga and the disciplines  
followed by Christian mystics and Sufis and the Taoists of China. The  
exercises are designed to train and discipline all the constituents of the  
human personalityâimagination, will, thought, emotionâas well as the  
physical body. Concentration and self-mastery constitute the pivotal  
exercises. Discipline and mental training have been considered necessary for  
illumination, or the attainment of miraculous powers, from immemorial times.   
#. Nature has built an unscalable wall here to keep the intellect from  
intruding into a territory that belongs to a superior sense. If this wall did  
not exist, reason would continue to dominate the mind of man, and the  
emergence of a higher faculty would never be possible. The natural function of  
intellect is to help this evolution. Just as it is not humanly possible to  
arrest the normal growth to adulthood of a healthy child, except at the risk  
of malformation and distortion, in the same way it is not possible to block  
the evolution of the human mind, except by causing malformation and distortion  
of the whole personality.   
#. In the mystical state, where there occurs a more direct contact with Cosmic  
or Christ Consciousness, the warning comes as a Message, or an inspired  
composition, to draw attention to the digression. This is the secret behind  
the prophetic utterances and the predictions of upcoming disasters, made by  
prophets, oracles, and seers, throughout the past and, in our time, by  
clairvoyants like Edgar Cayce and a few others.   
#. Every human being is a ray of the Light Divine. This is what every man and  
woman needs to know and experience in themselves. This is the glorious prize  
that every one of us has come to win. This is the message that, in my own  
humble way, I have come to deliver. There is nothing new in this message. It  
is written in bold letters, and couched in forceful language, in all the  
religious scriptures of humankind.   
#. I stand before you as a living testimony to the truth of religion and an  
eyewitness to the experiences undergone by all the great visionaries,  
illuminated sages and mystics of the past. I became a recipient of this grace  
by a series of transformations that occurred with great pain and suffering for  
years. This gave me a clue to the biological factors responsible for the  
change.   
Why I was chosen for the experiment I do not know. This is a wonder and a  
mystery to me. I had no special merit to deserve the favor. Perhaps heredity  
played a more decisive role in this transformation than my own efforts. The  
laws of spirit have to be followed by both the parent and the offspring.   
#. Every mystical experience is a testament to our eternal life. Not the life  
we spend in the embodied state but a life so glorious that it ravishes our  
mortal senses and the mind - a life so transporting and sublime that the  
beholder of the vision may even swoon in ecstasy. It might be possible to  
understand this impact better with the help of the following illustration: Imagine a man in the grip of a horror dream, finding himself lost in a  
wilderness with haunting shadows and creeping horrors on every side. In this  
state of extreme suspense and anxiety, he suddenly sees a terrible lion, with  
bared fangs, rushing madly to devour him. He screams in terror, with his heart  
beating wildly and his body drenched in sweat. In that moment of despair, he  
suddenly awakens to find himself lying on his bed with cheering sunlight  
streaming into his room.   
What words can describe the relief and joy he feels at the realization that it  
was all a dream? This experience, which most of us have had in varied forms,  
one time or the other, can convey a dim idea of the relief, happiness and  
wonder felt on one's first encounter with the soul.   
#. This is exactly what happens with the first impact of the mystical  
experience - the sorrows, depressions, frustrations, disappointments, the pain  
and the suffering of the world, disappear like mists before the rising sun.   
#. It is nothing like what people are writing about: visions, and colors and  
lights and something of the sort. It is the most intense experience of love,  
of wonder, of beauty, of music that you can ever have.   
#. Every mystic has only used paradoxes to describe a condition that is  
impossible to convey. It is much more difficult to describe the state than it  
is for a dreamer to describe waking consciousness. It is something beyond the  
reach of thought and can only be experienced. Such an example has been given  
by the sages of India. Just as a maiden, or a youth, can never be made to  
understand the ecstasy of love unless she or he experiences it, in the same  
way it is never possible to make another person understand the ecstasy of  
supernal consciousness unless one experiences it himself.   
#. You are sometimes in a state of suspense, sometimes in a state of joy,  
sometimes in a state of sorrow, waiting for something or facing an unexpected  
development. Where is it now? Is there any substance of it left? It is like a  
picture. This is **maya**. There is nothing underneath. It is just an  
illusion. Therefore, the picture we should have of this life is of a dream  
that ultimately ends in nothing; in a flash of memory for all the events that  
have passed.   
#. Physical science has concluded that the principle of causality cannot be  
applied to sub-nuclear particles. You cannot predict what particle will be at  
a certain place at a certain point of time. Everything is now based on  
probability. This is called the Principle of Indeterminism.   
#. There is no causality so far as the lowest levels of matter are concerned.  
No absolute time nor absolute space. All this is an illusion created by our  
brain. Maya resides in the brain. It is the brain that limits this  
consciousness and makes it act like a human being or an ox, a monkey, or a  
bird. Actually, consciousness is beyond fetter. It is the basic substance of  
the universe.   
Just to give you another vision of cosmic consciousness, try to turn your  
attention on yourself - on this plane of consciousness or awareness - and  
suppose that you hold a coin in your hand. You are now reading the figures and  
the picture on it, and all your attention is fixed on this: Your whole  
consciousness is in the coin. Suppose you have a child in your arms. You are  
looking at its eyes and kissing it. All your attention is now on the child and  
your consciousness becomes the child; its beautiful eyes and its red cheeks.  
Now turn your consciousness to the universe, to the sun, millions of miles  
away, to the stars, thousands of light years away, to the moon, to the ocean.  
Now this very consciousness that could only see a coin is now imagining and  
picturing the whole universe. Leave this picture of the universe and turn it  
to a pin, and now it becomes a pin.   
What is this strange thing of which you never find anything similar in the  
whole of the earth? We never pay attention to consciousness. We totally  
neglect it as if it is something just common. It is just my possession. We  
never take it seriously. We are so careful of the body, but we are never  
careful about the mind.   
#. In a discussion with the late Professor Heisenberg, he said that as a  
physicist he was in complete agreement with me that consciousness was the  
basic structure and that evolution was planned. But the difficulty was that  
the biologists would not hear of it. He said that once we had a conference of  
physicists and biologists, and a physicist told the biologist,âNow look  
here, you say that the human body and the human brain have been caused by  
accident because of the meeting of the atoms and the molecules together, DNA  
or whatever they call it. Now tell us that if an accident could bring into  
existence a complicated organ like the brain, or a marvelous creature like the  
human being, why don't we find a ready-made house with a bathroom and a  
kitchen and all the utensils prepared already by nature?â   
The biologist replied, âYou can't understand this,â and ended the  
discussion.   
#. When a new channel of perception, known as the **Third Eye** in the Indian  
tradition, opens in some individuals, then a new dimension of the universe  
comes into view. Then consciousness swallows up this universe in itself, as an  
ocean swallows up the waves and the tide that flow on its surface.   
#. The experience of super-consciousness is something like this: If a crowd of  
men and women, numbering thousands, stands before me, with different hair,  
faces, clothes, smiling, talking and listening, and then all of a sudden I put  
an X-ray on my eyes, what will I see? Not the beautiful faces, the clothing,  
the hair but only skeletons sitting before me. This is exactly what super-  
consciousness does.   
#. A new form of perception comes into existence. The world loses its  
solidity. It loses its dominating character. Sometimes it loses even its  
existence, and you see that while you are still aware of the world - the  
slope, trees, faces before me - you are also aware that they are all swimming  
in a conscious ocean of light, like shadows on the wall, and that the reality,  
the connecting substance between all of them, is consciousness.   
#. It is elusive, indescribable, ineffable, totally beyond our imagination,  
but it is there. At every point, it is as full of knowledge as if the whole of  
the Encyclopaedia Britannica were contained in it. We judge Christ  
Consciousness from our own limited consciousness, but our consciousness is an  
extremely diluted beam of a sun billions of miles away, a sun that we can  
never imagine. We are an extremely dilute beam, like a speck, floating in a  
beam of sunlight, but we are one with that.   
#. This is one characteristic of higher consciousness. There is another  
characteristic also: It is a never-ending wonder. If you were to say that you  
have seen this consciousness spread everywhere, and you realize it, you know  
it, you would be speaking an untruth. It is the wonder of wonders, and that is  
what keeps the self-realized man or woman in a perennial state of happiness,  
charm and wonder.   
#. One of the most pronounced characteristics of higher consciousness is that  
you laugh at death. It is impossible for death to conquer this marvelous  
substance. You say, âCan there be a death? Can this substance die? Can I be  
no more?â For you, death is a negligible occurrence. The body will die, yes,  
but this infinity is everlasting. That is the intimation of immortality that  
you receive in this encounter.   
To overcome the fear of death, seek the light within, which is deathless.   
#. No amount of wealth, no amount of medical skill can save human beings at  
the end of life from the torture and the torment of death except through the  
awakening of the **Third Eye**.   
The ideal will be, of which there are instances in India, he or she will  
continue to live with faculties fully alert to maybe 125 years or to 150, He  
would not die a lingering death in a bed, but when he knows that the end is  
upon him, he will make the gesture of dissolution and go into samadhi, leaving  
his body as if it is a pair of old, worn out clothes.

All subfaiths of Hinduism accept Sakti, Devi or Mother as an important  
principle. Visistadvaits say Narayana is supreme but   
He has Thaayar - Mother in His chest. Saiva Siddhantam says   
that Siva and Sakti are concorporate, each sharing half of a common body.  
This is Ardhanari, the Principle of Arunachala. Saktas accept Siva, but they  
say, that Sakti or AmbaL is primordial and Siva is there along with Her.  
Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and Rudra [one aspect of Siva] are the legs of the cot  
on which She is lying. Advaitam says that Brahman is Primordial which is  
represented by Sivam [the Consciousness] and Sakti is the Power behind this  
Brahman for manifestation. Siva is achalam, non moving but Sakti moves and  
here there to create the world, sustain it and then absorb it.   
You have made mention of Third Eye with which a Jnani laughs   
at death. Yes. Very true. This is called by Ramana as Eye of the   
eye, the insight of Jnana, after realizing which, the body has to go through  
the prarabdha and be left at any place, as deemed fit by   
the prarabdha. In fact, Siva's third eye is the Eye of the eye.   
Very nice. Thank you, once again.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: silentgreen         Date: December 13, 2010, 02:06:47 PM

continued. ..   
#. I can say with confidence that I have observed myself as meticulously and  
dispassionately as an empiricist would observe an object under his study in  
his own laboratory, without allowing his feelings to influence his judgment in  
the least. But the experience is so extraordinary that I wonder whether there  
is another recorded narrative in the existing literature. In my autobiography,  
Living With Kundalini, I have refrained from narrating some of the more  
bizarre incidents, because I felt that it would be entirely unacceptable to a  
rational mind in the present materialistic climate.   
#. However, since my own experience coincided, in almost all respects, with  
the ancient traditions concerning **Kundalini** and its transformative effects  
on the human brain, I considered it a solemn duty, and a service to science,  
to make it known to the world for investigation and confirmation, in the same  
way it was practiced and investigated in the past.   
#. After the awakening of this Power within me, I oscillated between life and  
death, sanity and insanity, for nearly twelve years, experiencing the  
indescribable ecstasies of the mystics on the one hand and the agonies of the  
mentally afflicted on the other. For part of this period, my mental state  
became so acute that when retiring to my bed at night, I was never sure  
whether I would rise alive or sane in the morning.   
#. But almost by a miracle, my reason and judgment remained unimpaired. This  
allowed me to evaluate my mental condition day and night. I clearly saw my  
whole organism battling with a new situation in my interior, as if a new and  
powerful psychic energy was operating in my brain and nerves in place of the  
former, much weaker, current whose passage I could not feel at all.   
#. At the same time, I started to hear an inner cadence, varying in tone and  
pitch from time to time, that has lasted to this day. This play of sound is  
known as **unstruck melody** in books on yoga and is an unmistakable sign of  
the awakening of Kundalini.   
#. **Inner light** is an invariable feature of mystical experience and has  
been variously described by mystics throughout history. In the mystical  
trance, the subject finds his visionary experiences bathed in a heavenly  
luster and sometimes hears voices or sounds, coming out of empty space around.   
#. After those years of uncertainty and suspense, I found myself well  
established in a new state of perception, resulting from a continued  
biological transformation that had occurred during this long period.   
#. I came to realize that every panorama of nature had a beauty for me that I  
had never noticed before. Every landscape or scene that I observed, and every  
object that I saw, was bathed in a milky luster which enchanted me, and I  
could hardly take my eyes from it, so fascinating was the spectacle.   
#. My ears were always listening to a melody that enraptured me except at  
times when I had some health problem. Then the sounds became somewhat  
discordant and harsh, as if to warn me that something was amiss in my  
interior. This helped me times without number to assess the condition of my  
health and to take timely precautions.   
#. About the end of this period, I felt an irresistible urge to write in  
verse, that finally culminated in a booklet of poetry in nine languages, out  
of which four were unknown to me. I had never before written a line of poetry,  
and in normal conditions was incapable of writing even a few lines in rhyme  
and meter, even if I tried for days. But now I found that finished lines,  
whole paragraphs, or even entire poems, came to me in a flash, as if emerging  
from the surrounding emptiness. Sometimes, I found it difficult to put them on  
paper, so rapid was the flow.   
#. This new awareness invested every object and every scene with a beauty and  
a glory I had never perceived before. Instead of ceasing after a time, it  
became a more and more stable and lasting feature of my consciousness. Today I  
live in a veritable paradise in my interior.   
#. I have been led to the conclusion that Kundalini is the source of  
inspiration by comparing the creative process in myself with that reported or  
narrated by other writers, poets, painters, musicians, and others.   
#. Ancient texts on Kundalini repeatedly refer to talent and genius resulting  
from an awakening of the Power. In the **Sat-Cakra-Nirupan**, embodied by the  
nineteenth century British author, Arthur Avalon, in his book, The Serpent  
Power, there are 55 verses out of which ten refer to the development of  
surpassing intellectual powers and literary talents in the Yogi who  
successfully awakens the Power: #. _She is beautiful like a chain of lightning, and fine like a lotus fiber,  
and shines in the minds of the sages. She is extremely subtle; the awakener of  
pure knowledge; the embodiment of all bliss, whose true nature is pure  
Consciousness. The **Brahma-dvara** shines in her mouth. This place is the  
entrance to the region sprinkled by ambrosia and is called the Knot, as also  
the mouth of **Sushumna**. (V:3.)_   
#. _Here dwells the **Devi Dakini** by name; her four arms shine with beauty,  
and her eyes are brilliant red. She is resplendent like the luster of many  
suns rising at one and the same time. She is the carrier of the revelation of  
the ever-pure intelligence. (V:7.)_   
#. _Over it shines the sleeping Kundalini, fine as the fiber of lotus-stalk.  
She is the world-bewilderer, gently covering the mouth of Brahmna-dvara by Her  
own. Like the spiral of the conch-shell, Her shining snake-like form goes  
three and a half times round Siva, and Her luster is as that of a strong flash  
of young, strong lightning._   
#. _Her sweet murmur is like the indistinct hum of swarms of love-mad bees.  
She produces melodious poetry and Bandha and all other compositions in prose  
or verse in sequence or otherwise in Samskrita, Prakrita and other languages.  
It is She who maintains all the beings of the world by means of inspiration  
and expiration, and shines in the cavity of the root ( **Mula** ) Lotus like a  
chain of brilliant lights. (V:10, 11.)_   
#. _By meditating thus on Her who shines within the **Mula-Cakra**, with the  
luster of ten million Suns, a man becomes Lord of Speech and king among men,  
and an Adept in all kinds of learning. He becomes ever free from all diseases,  
and his inmost Spirit becomes full of great gladness. Pure of disposition by  
his deep and musical words, he serves the foremost of the Devas." (V:13.)_   
#. _He who meditates upon this stainless Lotus, named **Svadhisthana**, is  
freed immediately from all his enemies, such as the fault of Ahamkara and so  
forth. He becomes a Lord among Yogis and is like the Sun illumining the dense  
darkness of ignorance. The wealth of his nectarlike words flows in prose and  
verse in well-reasoned discourse. (V:18.)_   
#. _Here abides **Lakini**, the benefactress of all. She is fourarmed, of  
radiant body, is dark (of complexion), clothed in yellow raiment and decked  
with various ornaments, and exalted with the drinking of ambrosia. By  
meditating on this Navel Lotus, the power to destroy and create (the world) is  
acquired. **Vani** (goddess of speech), with all the wealth of knowledge, ever  
abides in the lotus of His face. (V:21.)_   
#. _Foremost among Yogis, he ever is dearer than the dearest to women. He is  
pre-eminently wise and full of noble deeds. His senses are completely under  
control. His mind in its intense concentration is engrossed in thoughts of the  
Brahman. His inspired speech flows like a stream of (clear) water. He is like  
the Devata who is the beloved of Laksmi, and he is able at will to enter  
another 's body. (V:27.)_   
#. _He who has attained complete knowledge of the Atma (Brahman) becomes, by  
constantly concentrating his mind (Citta) on this Lotus, a great Sage,  
eloquent and wise and enjoys uninterrupted peace of mind. He sees the three  
periods and becomes the benefactor of all, free from disease and sorrow, and  
long-lived and, like **Hamsa**, the destroyer of endless dangers. (V:31.)_

Author: silentgreen         Date: December 14, 2010, 08:22:49 AM

continued. ..   
 **Gayatri and Kundalini** : #. **Gayatri**, the essence of the Vedas, is **Kundalini**. The three strands  
of the sacred thread (Gayatri) worn by Hindus represent the three channels of  
nerve energy, **Ida**, **Pingala** and **Sushumna**. The knot, known as  
**Brahma-Granthi**, is the difficult-to-pierce knot that blocks the passage  
of Kundalini at the entrance to the Ajna Cakra. It is after this knot is  
penetrated that surprising changes occur in the mental condition of the man or  
woman who has awakened the Power.   
#. Gayatri is **Saraswat** i, the Goddess of Learning, and also **Vageshwari**  
, the Isvari of speech. In the Atharva Veda (19.71.1), Gayatri is said to be  
the bestower of longevity, prana, strength, fame, wealth and Divine knowledge.   
" _One who knows Gayatri becomes proficient in all knowledge,_ " says  
Yajnavalkya.   
" _Just as honey is the extract of flowers and butter the extract of milk,_ "  
says Vyasa, " _in the same way Gayatri is the essence of all the Vedas.  
Perfection in Gayatri is like Kamadhenu (the cow of Indra that fulfills every  
wish)._ "   
The virtues attributed to Her in the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the  
Epics, are the same as those ascribed to Kundalini in the Tantras and other  
books.   
#. The ancient work, **Panchastavi**, refers to this bloom in the mental  
faculties of a Sadhaka in several remarkable passages. Here is typical verse:  _O Saraswati (Kundalini as the Goddess of learning), Verily there pours out  
from the lotus mouths of those devotees who contemplate thy entrancing  
resplendence, spotless like unto a heap of white lotuses, irradiating the  
brain and dwelling in the forehead, akin to a stream of ambrosia, an  
uninterrupted flow of words, clear and full of deep meaning, like the  
simmering, wavy luster of the Milky Way._   
#. **Ananda-Lahari** (Wave of Bliss), is one of the most magnificent hymns  
addressed to the **Divine Shakti**. It is ascribed to the renowned  
philosopher, Shankaracharya, and consists of 41 verses, out of which six refer  
to Kundalini as the bestower of knowledge, intellectual preeminence, and  
literary talent. It is of particular interest that Ananda-Lahariâor the  
whole work, **Saundarya-Lahari**, of which it is a part - is said to be based  
on the personal experience of its great author and his Guru, Gaudpadacarya.  
But Shankara is said to have raised Kundalini to the Sahasrara himself. He was  
an intellectual prodigy, a literary genius, and one of the greatest spiritual  
luminaries India has ever produced.   
#. " _Thou art the sun which illumines the inner darkness of the ignorant_, "  
says Ananda-Lahari in verse 3. " _Thou art the channel running with the honey  
of Consciousness for the unknowing._ "   
#. **Karpuradi-Stotra** (Hymn to Kali) contains only 22 verses of which at  
least eight dwell on this aspect of Kundalini. This shows that Yoga is not  
aimed merely to procure peace of mind, a vision of God, and psychic gifts, but  
it is designed to raise one to the stature of an intellectual prodigy, blessed  
with **Vaikhari**, which means the spontaneous flow of words full of wisdom,  
whether in poetry or prose.   
#. The 125th verse of the tenth book of the Rig Veda is addressed to **Vak**,   
the deity of speech. In this hymn, consisting of eight stanzas, the goddess  
describes herself as the sustaining power behind all gods and human beings..   
" _I travel with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the Adityas and all gods I  
wander._ " She says: " _I hold aloft both Varuna and Mitra, Indra and Agni,  
and the pair of Asvins. . . Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them,  
each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken. They know it not, but  
yet they dwell beside me. Hear, one and all, the truth as I declare it. I,  
verily myself, announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall  
welcome._ "   
#. In the Tantras Kundalini is called **Vageshwari**, the Goddess of Speech.  
The whole Sanskrit alphabet is shown on the petals of the lotuses, said to be  
existing at each nerve center, or **chakra**, on the spinal axis. " _Thou art  
the Fount of Speech,O,Kundalini_, " says Panchastavi (1.18).   
#. The second part of the 6th stanza of that same hymn is significant. It  
says," _I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a rishi  
(enlightened seer) and a Brahman._ "   
#. There are other verses in the Rig Veda in which there also is unmistakable  
reference to Kundalini. These references take the form either of hints, in the  
hymns devoted to the praises of various gods, or of cleverly disguised  
allegories. For instance, the second part of the 25th stanza of the 164th hymn  
of the first book says," _Gayatri hath, they say, three brands for kindling,  
hence it excels in majesty and vigor._ " Gayatri, as has been amply shown, is  
Kundalini, and the three brands are the three channels for the flow of  
pranaâIda, Pingala and Sushumna. They can also signify the three padas of  
Gayatri, or sticks for kindling the sacrificial fire.   
#. At many places in the Rig Veda the hymns addressed to **soma** are, in  
actual fact, hymns addressed to Kundalini.   
#. What has been expressed in a veiled or enigmatic form in the Vedas has been  
explicitly brought out in the **Tantras**. For instance, let us take hymn 61  
of the tenth book of the Rig Veda. It is addressed to **Jnanam**, or  
knowledge of Brahman and the higher truths of religion. It is extremely hard  
to interpret and understand in the normal course, for it deals mainly with  
Vak, or "speech." Interpreted in terms of Kundalini, the reference becomes  
clear:  _With sacrifice the track of Vak they followed and found her harboring within  
the rishis (the illuminati). They brought her, dealt her forth in many places: seven singers make her tones resound in concert. One man hath neâer seen  
Vak, and yet he seeth: one man hath hearing but hath never heard her. But to  
another hath she shown her beauty as a fond, well-dressed woman to her  
husband.. . No part in Vak hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who  
knows the truth of friendship. Even if he hears her still in vain he listens: naught knows he of the path of the righteous action.   
_   
#. The 14th Brahmana of the Brihad-aranyaka Upanishad calls Gayatri the  
Protectress of Vital Breaths (prana). She has not merely three **padas**, but  
also a fourth one, and this is the **turiya** state, or the transcendent state  
attained in **samadhi**. The first three padas refer to the three  
worldsâthis world, the upper and the nether one.   
 _But the fourth (turiya), the slightly foot (pada), the one above the  
darksome, who glows yonder, is not obtainable by anyone whatsoever. The  
knowing of Gayatri is like fire. Verily, indeed, even if they lay very much on  
a fire, it burns it all. Even so, one who knows this, although he commits very  
much evil, consumes it all and becomes clean and pure, ageless and immortal._   
#. The 12th khanda of the Chandogya Upanishad is even more explicit. It  
proclaims that Kundalini is everything that exists:  _Verily, the Gayatri meter is everything here that has come to be, whatsoever  
there is here.Verily, the Gayatri is speech, verily, speech both sings of  
(gayatri) and protects (trayate) everything here that has come to be. That  
what this Gayatri is, that is the same as what the earth is. And what this  
earth is, that is the same as the body of man. And what this body is, that is  
the same as the heart within him. On this heart the vital breaths are  
established. These five breaths (pranas) are five Brahmamen, the doorkeepers  
of the heavenly world. The heart has five openings for the gods, four on the  
four sides and one on the upper side. These vital breaths (pranas), known as  
prana, vyana, apana, samana and udana, command these openings._

#. Although **Shakti** as Cosmic life-energy does not prominently figure in  
the Vedas, and only a few hymns are addressed to goddesses, this is corrected  
by the important position assigned to **Gayatri** and the numerous hymns  
addressed to **Soma**. It is the divine drink that leads to immortality, to  
eloquence, inspiration, longevity, success, and the vision of Divinity.   
#. It is likely that in contrast to the mother goddess cult of the Indus  
Valley, and its concomitant rituals and practices, the more virile Aryans  
preferred to honor their own gods and divinities and to frame their own  
rituals and disciplines for the arousal of **Kundalini**.   
#. In order to keep the secret shielded from the crowd, however, they had to  
devise a special terminology only those initiated in the practices could  
understand. The **soma** drink that served as a common beverage for the Indo-  
Aryans provided them with a convenient vehicle for giving tongue to their  
effusions about Kundalini. That the secret was known admits of no doubt.   
#. For instance, the second stanza of the Tenth book of Taittiriya Aranyaka  
says,   
" _I seek as my refuge the goddess Durga, who is of the color of fire, burning  
with austerity, daughter of the sun, who is sought after for the reward of  
rites; adoration be to thy energy._ "   
#. In fact, even the **homa** or the sacrificial fire of the Indo-Aryans, is a  
symbolic representation of Kundalini. The spectacle of a **leaping tongue of  
flame** in which oblations are poured to the melodious chant of hymns sung in  
unison by the performing priests, provides a most graphic picture of the inner  
fire kindled by this mechanism. The energy that rises through the spinal cord,  
like a **pillar of flame**, spreading out in the head like an effulgent halo  
of conscious light, transforms the body and all the vital organs into a  
veritable sacrificial fire, licking up with its tongue all that one eats and  
drinks, as the homa-fire consumes the libations poured into it.   
#. The Tantric concept of Shakti gradually permeated the whole structure of  
Hindu religious thought. Tantric ideas formed the background of every  
religious ritual and esoteric practice. Shiva and his consort Parvati,Vishnu  
and Lakshmi, Krishna and Radha, Ram and Sita, became popular deities in all  
parts of India.   
#. This transition from the cryptic and allegoric language of the Vedas to  
indicate the esoteric disciplines, and the altered states of consciousness  
attained thereby, to the popularization of the basic concepts underlying yoga  
is thus expressed in the Svetasvatara Upanishad:  _Following only in the footsteps of the wise, I merge you both in the ancient  
Brahman by ceaseless meditation. May the Glorious One manifest Himself. May  
the sons of immortal being listen-even those who in celestial regions have  
their abode. Where fire (the Serpent-fire) is churned out, where air (prana)  
is controlled, where soma-juice overflows there inspiration is born._ \- The  
Principal Upanishads, translated by Hume.   
#. The importance of **continence** and its bearing on the evolutionary  
mechanism is brought out clearly in the Chandogya Upanishad (3.16.1) thus:  _Verily, a person is a sacrifice. His (first) 24 years are the morning soma-  
libation, for the Gayatri meter has 24 syllables, and the morning soma  
libation is offered with a Gayatri hymn. The Vasus are connected with this  
part of the sacrifice. Verily, the vital breaths (prana) are the Vasus; they  
cause everything here to continue._   
#. The same point is brought out in the Bhagavad-Gita (6.14) while describing  
methods for the practice of Yoga, in these words: " _The self serene, fearless, firm in the vow of the brahmachari, the mind  
controlled thinking on Me, harmonized, let him sit aspiring after Me._ ". The  
close connection between brahmacharya and the practice of Yoga is clearly  
emphasized.

In reply to a question, asked by a Brahman about the nature of nirvana, Buddha  
is reported to have said:  _The subjugation of desire, the subjugation of hatred, the subjugation of  
perplexity - this, O friend, is called nirvana._   
(Samyutta Nikaya.)   
The last part of the answer is significant. The subjugation of perplexity  
implies knowledge of the Self. This knowledge cannot be imparted. Every  
aspirant must gather it for himself. Buddhist esoteric practices also rest on  
the action of Kundalini, the source of power behind all esoteric disciplines.  
Samadhi, or mystical ecstasy, is not a random product of a merely subjective  
mental effort, as is commonly believed. It has a natural organic source behind  
it. The disciplines merely stimulate this source to increased activity. The  
whole cerebrospinal system is in the process of transformation in a manner  
that can only be ascertained with exhaustive research. All great prophets and  
mystics, and all great geniuses, whenever and wherever born, have been the  
products of this unsuspected activity of the nervous system.

dear silentgreen,   
I have heard some years ago, that scientists are looking into it more closely  
- into "brain evolution" that is.   
They discovered, that during practices something happens to the brain  
actually. The brain has this part called amygdala. When brain is in fearful  
and defensive situations - amygdala pushes backwards into primitive brain  
responsible for "fight or flight". When brain is in peaceful and happy  
situation - amygdala pushes towards into frontal lobes of the brain (which is  
mostly unused part in the brain). When amygdala pushes and pushes and pushes  
toward frontal lobes - a big boom happens: frontal lobes pops. Then it is  
believed so called "enlightenment" is experienced, amygdala then fixes in  
frontal lobes never to go backwards.   
Since I am not unfamiliar with "bombardment" of the brain during practices, I  
believe that everything that happens during our spiritual practices is  
mirrored biologically too.   
If I remember correctly even Bhagavan Ramana mentioned "popping" in the brain,  
when a devotee (it was woman, well known, but I don't remember name) asked  
about uncomfortable sensations in the brain during practice.   
Though, from our stance, all is happening automatically just by abiding in  
being (whatever understanding of it may be). The mechanism of everything will  
get to be known after realization, not before it.

Dear amiatall,   
What you are saying is correct. Everything that happens during our spiritual  
practices is mirrored biologically too. What is suggested here is that the  
reverse is also true (at least to some extent).   
For example, suppose a person is suffering from cold and has nose block. His  
meditation will suffer. Taking this example a little further, suppose we block  
the nose of the person who is doing meditation with our fingers. He has to get  
up. Through the breath flows the prana and whenever prana is blocked,  
meditation will suffer. This prana is originating from cosmic prana, therefore  
this cycle of cosmic prana flowing within the individual suffers. Conversely,  
the more cosmic prana flows through an individual, the individual is  
spiritually elevated, the individuality starts fading.   
The above is a very gross example. Within an individual there are lot of  
subtle "nose blocks". The science of Kundalini prepares the individual for  
unobstructed reception of cosmic prana by clearing the blocks and invoking the  
divine prana. It is a very subtle science. It starts with the biological frame  
which is in our control. It combines physical exercises, breathing, prayer,  
meditation etc. The physical exercises clears the gross blocks, pranayama  
subtler blocks, meditation still subtler blocks etc. The final authority of  
grace is God. One cannot command Him to bestow grace. But a sincere spiritual  
aspirant puts forth so much dedication that his life becomes a prayer.   
(There are also instances where people have misused Kundalini for black magic)   
There are Yoga asanas which clears gross blocks in the body. Just by doing  
those yoga asanas with proper awareness, meditation will improve. One can then  
feel that pranic channel in the cerebro-spinal column. Kundalini is not much  
about the gross brain but the cerbro-spinal channel. Subtle chakras opens up.  
The person starts perceiving his cosmic dimension also.   
Interestingly, I find that Kundalini gives the most graphic reason why  
continence is necessary for spiritual practices. Lust makes the seminal energy  
flow downwards and makes a person worldly. Kundalini transforms that seminal  
energy into divine prana and makes it flow upwards. A person whose energy is  
always naturally upward-bound is called urdhvaretas.

Dear silentgreen,   
I am not much informed about Kundalini. But Saint Tirumoolar   
says in his book that when fire-like prana reaches the Sahasrara,   
the yogis feel the taste of milk in their tongue, listen to the   
sound of conch-shell, see golden yellow colour in front and smell   
the fragrance of magizha flowers and feels the sensation of   
ants crawling on their bodies. This is not siddhic powers but   
strange 'feelings'.   
Bhagavan Ramana has also said that after death experience,   
He felt that he was suffering from a strange but pleasant illness!   
Saint Manikkavachagar also says in his Tiruvachakam about the   
strange sensations mentioned by Tirumoolar.   
Arunachala Siva.

One of the most important points established by research would be that the  
impulse to evolve comes from within. The colossal dimension of the upheaval  
caused in the current theory of evolution, and other concepts of science, as a  
result of this verification, cannot even be imagined at present. The vital  
role played by the spinal cord and bioenergy is repeatedly mentioned in the  
ancient texts and in the utterances of Indian saints and mystics. Summing up  
his own study about the practices of the **Nath Siddhas**, S. B. Dasgupta  
writes:  _The act of combining the **sun** and the **moon** or the perfect control  
over them implies many things in practical Yoga. It implies, firstly, the  
retrogressive process of turning the cosmic manifestation back to its original  
form of rest, and is effected by the Yogins by rousing Shakti and uniting her  
with Shiva in the **Sahasrara**.   
The combination of the sun and the moon implies, secondly, the Yogic practice  
in which the male and the female unite and the combined substance of the seed  
and the ovum is sucked within by the Yogin or the Yogini, as the case may be,  
through some secret Yogic processes.   
Again the practice of purifying and controlling **prana** and **apana**,   
through processes of pranayama, is what is meant by combining the sun and the  
moon. The three important nerves, **Ida**, **Pingala** and **Sushumna** in  
the left, right and middle are frequently described in the Yogic texts as the  
nature of the moon, the sun and fire respectively. The moon is the depository  
of Amrita or ambrosia which gives immortality, while the sun is the fire of  
destruction (Kalagni). The moon is situated just below the Sahasrara or the  
lotus of a thousand petals in the cerebrum regionâit is facing downwards;  
and the sun is situated in the region of the navel or in the lowest plexus  
(Muladhara) facing upwards.   
It is held that **Bindu** which is the quintessence of the body is of two  
kinds, viz, the yellowish white Bindu ( **Pandura-Bindu** ) and the red Bindu  
( **Lohita Bindu** ) - the former is of the nature of semen ( **Shukra** )  
while the latter is of the nature of ovum ( **Maharajas** ). The Bindu (i.e.  
the white Bindu or semen) is contained in the moon in the upper region, while  
the ovum is contained in the sun in the navel. This Bindu is Shiva and that is  
the moon-and the Rajas is Shakti which is the sun. (Obscure Religious Cults,by  
S.B.Dasgupta.)   
_   
Interpreted in the light of present day knowledge, the moon in the Sahasrara  
denotes the flow into the cerebrum of the ambrosial stream, ascending through  
the spinal duct, drawn from the pranic irrigation network of nerves in the  
body on   
the awakening of **Kundalini**.   
The flow of the ambrosia into the brain at this point is likened to the union  
of Shiva and Shakti on account of the transporting sensations that attend the  
process. The Shakti is said to be residing in the **Muladhara** because she is  
the active agent in the drama of awakening. The ambrosial current normally  
starts from the base of the spine, ascending stage by stage until its  
thrilling entry into the brain.   
The conscious principle or, in other words, Shiva, which shows a phenomenal  
change in the power of perception on the influx of the Shakti, is a passive  
spectator of this entrancing, amorous play between the two polarities. Hence  
in some representations of **Shiva and Shakti** the former is shown lying flat  
on the ground in a state of complete immobility, while Shakti dances  
triumphantly on his supine form. In most of the pictorial representations of  
the gods and goddesses in India some of the hidden knowledge of Kundalini is  
graphically illustrated.   
The reason for the current lack of accurate knowledge about Kundalini,  
especially in the West, is that a huge mass of literature, extending to  
prehistoric times, still continues to be beyond the reach of the average  
seeker.   
There are so many different versions of the phenomena attending the awakening  
- on account of variations in the personal experience of the authors - and  
such a mixture of fact and fiction, science and superstition, and such a  
fantastic rigmarole of the supernatural and the occult that it is no wonder  
that modern students are lost in the labyrinth and fail to locate the nature  
of the mechanism responsible for the amazing occurrences.   
Once the basic facts about the somatic aspect of Kundalini are known, it  
should not be difficult to devise a key by which fact can be separated from  
fiction, and the enigmas, presented by the cryptic writings of the past,  
solved. There is hardly an illuminated man or woman, or a well known saint of  
India, who has not in some way hinted at some somatic aspect of Kundalini. But  
the scattered pearls must be collected before they can be strung together into  
a coherent system in order to bring the colossal implications of this divine  
mechanism into light.
