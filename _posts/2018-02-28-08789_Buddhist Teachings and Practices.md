Impulse is the compulsion to take action on the basis of your feelings of  
desire and aversion, thus accumulating karma; impulse is therefore the  
architect of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.   
Completely enslaved by impulse, you have been wandering from one life to the  
next since beginningless time. Yet if you realize that the nature of impulse  
is void, and that your endless impulses are in truth the myriad facets of  
wisdom, you will no longer be subject to their dominion.

**The Buddha 's original teaching is essentially a matter of four points --  
the Four Noble Truths:**   
1\. Anguish is everywhere.   
2\. We desire permanent existence of ourselves and for our loved ones, and we  
desire to prove ourselves independent of others and superior to them. These  
desires conflict with the way things are: nothing abides, and everything and  
everyone depends upon everything and everyone else. This conflict causes our  
anguish, and we project this anguish on those we meet.   
3\. Release from anguish comes with the personal acknowledgment and resolve: we are here together very briefly, so let us accept reality fully and take  
care of one another while we can.   
4\. This acknowledgement and resolve are realized by following the Eightfold  
Path: Right Views, Right Thinking, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right  
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection, and Right Meditation. Here  
"Right" means "correct" or "accurate" \-- in keeping with the reality of  
impermanence and interdependence.

Practice"**

**~ Thich Nhat Hanh ~**   
I think when people listen to the teachings of the four noble truths, they  
hear the words ill - being and suffering, and they think that Buddhism is only  
about suffering. But they don't know that the third noble truth is about  
happiness, the opposite of suffering. There is suffering, but there is also  
the cessation of suffering, which means happiness and there is a path leading  
to happiness. Maybe it would be good to put the second two noble truths first.  
The first truth would be happiness and the second truth would be the path  
leading to happiness. Then the third truth would be suffering and the fourth  
would be the causes of suffering.

We have a habit of running after things, and this habit has been transmitted  
to us by our parents and ancestors. We don?t feel fulfilled in the here and  
now, and so we run after all kinds of things we think will make us happier. We  
sacrifice our life chasing after objects of craving or striving for success in  
our work or studies. We chase after our life?s dream and yet lose ourselves  
along the way. We may even lose our freedom and happiness in our efforts to be  
mindful, to be healthy, to relieve suffering in the world, or to get  
enlightened. We disregard the wonders of the present moment, thinking that  
heaven and the ultimate are for later, not for now.   
To practice meditation means to have the time to look deeply and see these  
things. If you feel restless in the here and now, or you feel ill at ease, you  
need to ask yourself: ?What am I longing for?? ?What am I searching for??  
?What am I waiting for??

Bringing the mind to stillness is easy. You need only to pay attention to one  
thing. As long as your mind is listening to the rain it is not thinking about  
anything else. You don?t need to try to still your mind. You need only to  
relax and continue listening to the rain. The longer you are able to do so,  
the more still your mind becomes.   
Sitting in stillness like this allows us to see things as they truly are. When  
the body is relaxed and the mind comes to rest, we can see clearly. We become  
as still and clear as the water in a mountain lake whose tranquil surface  
reflects the blue sky above, the clouds, and the surrounding rocky peaks just  
as they are.

Liberation is only possible when we are capable of correcting our impressions.   
Teachings, ideas, are like a match. The match brings about the flame, which is  
insight. A teaching, a notion, is not the insight.   
But if we practice, we can produce the living insight, the living wisdom.   
Many of us, including quite a few Buddhist scholars, are caught by words and  
concepts. We stick to the words, the doctrine, the teaching, and we are not  
free; we become dogmatic. But once we have the insight, it burns away our  
ideas and notions, just as the flame burns the match that brought it into  
being.   
We should never consider any teaching or ideology to be the absolute truth; it  
is only a means to gaining insight. We should not kill or be killed because of  
an idea.   
If we become dogmatic, we can become a dictator, wanting everyone to accept  
what we say, believing that we have the truth and that whoever doesn?t agree  
with us is our enemy. This creates more war, conflict, and discrimination.  
Most wars have been born from fanaticism, being caught in religion or  
ideologies.   
This teaching of the Buddha, non-attachment to views, is a deep practice of  
peace. We are ready to release our view in order to gain the insight.   
That is also the spirit of science. If a scientist is attached to a finding  
and thinks it to be the absolute truth, he has no hope of finding something  
deeper, something higher.   
We have to burn up all notions, in order for the insight to be there.   
A true practitioner is never dogmatic, never clings to ideas and notions, but  
makes use of them to produce insight, Right View."

Way to Catch a Snake, 2009 Parallax Press.**

**It 's time to live well..**   
"The seven concentrations on emptiness, singleness, aimlessness, impermanence,  
non-craving, letting go, and nirvana are very practical. As we apply them in  
our daily life, we experience increasing freedom from fear, anxiety, anger,  
and despair. The insight of inter-being and interdependence helps us enjoy the  
present moment more fully, recognizing the vastness of our being and  
cherishing all our different bodies. We are able to live true to ourselves,  
reconcile with our loved ones, and transform our difficulties and suffering.   
With the insight of these concentrations, our life begins to acquire a deeper  
quality. There's more joy, peace, and compassion in whatever we do. We realize  
that we don't have to wait to go to heaven or nirvana to be happy; we can  
touch heaven and nirvana right here on Earth. When we touch reality deeply in  
the present moment, we touch eternity. We transcend birth and death, being and  
nonbeing, coming and going. We master the art of living, and we know we're not  
wasting our life. We don't just want to live. We want to live well."   
 **~Thich Nhat Hanh, The Art of Living**

A visual reminder of Thich Nhat Hanh?s teachings of Mindfulness   
Thich Nhat Hanh has been a pioneer bringing mindfulness in the West since the  
early 1970s, developing new ways to apply ancient wisdom to the challenges of  
modern life.   
Mindfulness is a kind of energy that we generate when we bring our mind back  
to our body and get in touch with what is going on in the present moment,  
within us and around us. We become aware of our breathing and come home to our  
body, fully present for ourselves and whatever we are doing.   
The energy of mindfulness helps us touch life deeply throughout the day,  
whether we?re brushing our teeth, washing the dishes, walking to work, eating  
a meal, or driving the car. We can be mindful while standing, walking or lying  
down; while speaking, listening, working, playing and cooking.   
Mindfulness is not hard work. It?s very pleasant and relaxing, and we don?t  
need extra time to do it. There?s an art to finding creative ways to generate  
the energy of mindfulness, peace, and happiness in everyday life.

?Meditation is offering the genuine presence to yourself in every moment...?   
Sitting meditation is very healing. We realize we can just be with whatever is  
within us?our pain, anger, and irritation, or our joy, love, and peace. We are  
with whatever is there without being carried away by it.   
Let it come, let it stay, then let it go. No need to push, to oppress, or to  
pretend our thoughts are not there. Observe the thoughts and images of our  
mind with an accepting and loving eye. We are free to be still and calm  
despite the storms that might arise in us.❤️   
 **~ Thich Nhat Hanh**

Deep listening is the kind of listening that can help relieve the suffering of  
another person. You can call it compassionate listening. You listen with only  
one purpose: to help him or her to empty his heart. Even if he says things  
that are full of wrong perceptions, full of bitterness, you are still capable  
of continuing to listen with compassion. Because you know that listening like  
that, you give that person a chance to suffer less. If you want to help him to  
correct his perception, you wait for another time. For now, you don't  
interrupt. You don't argue. If you do, he loses his chance. You just listen  
with compassion and help him to suffer less. One hour like that can bring  
transformation and healing.   
 **Thich Nhat Hanh**

How Can We Remain Present in Our Day-to-Day Living?   
 To be present in your day-to-day life is as simple as being present with  
whatever is before you, moment to moment. It does not matter what you are  
present with. Just notice when you are day dreaming or drifting off into  
thought and then come back to the present moment.   
Bring yourself very present with something that is here, in the moment with  
you. If you can see it, hear it, feel it, taste it, touch it or smell it, in  
this moment, then you can be present with it. And the moment you are truly  
present with something that is here in the moment with you, thoughts will  
stop. You will emerge out of the past and future world of the mind. Now you  
are awake in the truth of life, revealed through the present moment.   
As you deepen into Presence, you will begin to feel the Oneness.   
There are so many ways to be present and so much to be present with. As you  
have a shower, be present with the warmth of the water and the fragrance of  
the soap. As you eat your breakfast, be present with the taste and smell of  
the food. Be present as you raise the fork to your mouth. Be present as you  
chew your food.   
Be present as you wash the dishes. If you are truly present as you wash the  
dishes, it will be a sacred and loving experience. Be present as you walk in  
the garden. Be present with what you see and hear, moment to moment. Be  
present with your body breathing. Be present whenever it is easy to be  
present. Be present whenever there is no need to think.   
The more you remember to be present, the more that dimension of Presence will  
awaken within you.   
Of course, there are many times during the day when thinking is appropriate,  
particularly within the context of work or when you have to plan for something  
in your future. At such times, do not be concerned with being present. Think  
when you need to think, but be sure to return to Presence when you no longer  
need to think. And do not go so far into the world of thought that you get  
lost there.   
Eventually, you become so grounded in Presence that it is very easy to remain  
present, and there is an easy flow between Presence and silence and the  
movement in and out of thought. It becomes effortless and you spontaneously  
return to Presence as soon as the thinking process is completed.

In our society, we are inclined to see you doing nothing as something  
negative, even evil. But when we lose ourselves in activities, we diminish our  
quality of being. We do ourselves a disservice. It?s important to preserve  
ourselves, to maintain our freshness and good humor, our joy and compassion.  
In Buddhism we cultivate aimlessness, and in fact in Buddhist tradition the  
ideal person, an arhat or a Bodhisattva, is a business-less person?someone  
with nowhere to go and nothing to do. People should learn how to just be  
there, doing nothing.

If while washing dishes, we think only of the cup of tea that awaits us, thus  
hurrying to get the dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance, then we  
are not ?washing the dishes to wash the dishes.? What's more, we are not alive  
during the time we are washing the dishes. In fact we are completely incapable  
of realizing the miracle of life while standing at the sink. If we can't wash  
the dishes, the chances are we won't be able to drink our tea either. While  
drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things, barely  
aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the future -and we  
are incapable of actually living one minute of life.
