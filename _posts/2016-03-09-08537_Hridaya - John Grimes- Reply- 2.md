Without a vocabulary to describe what happened to Him, it took sometime for  
Him to develop one.   
He said, 'I had read no books other than Periyapuranam, my Bible lessons, and  
bits of Tayumanavar   
or Tevaram. My notion of God (or Isvara as I called the Infinite but Personal  
Deity) was similar to that   
found in the Puranas. I had not heard then of Brahman, samsara, etc., I had  
no idea then that there was   
an Essence or Impersonal Real underlying everything, and that myself and  
Isvara were both identical with   
it. (Self Realization, B.V.Narasimha Swami)   
As we know, following Sri Ramana's great awakening, He moved to Arunachala.  
After about two years   
there, due to Palaniswami, a young spiritual aspirant, Bhagavan acquired a  
familiarity with some basic   
texts of Advaita Vedanta. It was through these texts that He discovered  
corroboration of His own experience   
and a vocabulary began developing.   
Sri Ramana began to use many terms to indicate the Reality (all of which were  
synonymous). He called   
it the Self, Sat Chit Ananda, Jnana, Turiyatita, Swarupa, Sahaja Sthithi, and  
the hridaya (Heart). A   
literal translation of hridaya is, 'This is the center' (hrit /center \+  
ayam / this.) Bhagavan said, 'The   
Heart is not physical; it is spiritual;. .. It is that from which the thoughts  
arise, on which they subsist and   
where they are resolved. The thoughts are the content of the mind and they  
shape the universe. The   
Heart is the center of all.... That is the Heart. Brahman is the Heart.  
(Talks No. 97)   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
