I wrote sometime back, that Kovilur Math which is managing Isanya   
Jnana Desikar's Samadhi, in Tiruvannamalai, has approved 16   
conceptual texts of Vedanta, for their Veda Patasala. Kovilur Math   
has also brought out 12 of these 16 Vedantic texts in Tamil in three   
volumes. Kovilur Math is one of the few Maths in Tamil Nadu, which has  
adopted Advaita Vedanta for their students. But most of other   
Saiva Siddhanta Maths in Tamil Nadu, have adopted Saiva Siddhantam   
as their conceptual framework for their students. There are some   
differences between Advaita Vedanta and Saiva Siddhanta and Bhagavan Ramana  
Himself has spoken about it on one or two occasions. In fact, Muruganar was  
steeped in Saiva Siddhantam when he had come to Bhagavan Ramana and he was  
well versed   
in Saiva Siddhanta Stotrams like Tevaram and Tiruvachakam, and   
also in their conceptual framework.   
There are 14 Saiva Siddhanta texts on conceptual framework. The authors are  
called Santana Munis. These are: 1\. Tiru Undiyar \- Tiruviyalur Uyyavantha Deva Nayanar.   
2\. Tiru KaLitru Padiyar - Tirukadvaur Uyyavantha Deva Nayanar.   
3\. Siva Jnana Bodham - Tiruvennai Nallur Meikandar.   
4\. Siva Jnana Siddhi - AruL Nandi Sivam.   
5\. Iru Pa Iru Pahdu - AruL Nandi Sivam.   
6\. UNmai ViLakkam - Manavachagam Kadanthar   
7\. Siva Prakasam - Umapati Sivam.   
8\. Tiru AruL Payan - Umapati Sivam   
9\. Vina VeNba - Umapati Sivam   
10\. Potri Pahrodai - Umapati Sivam   
11.Kodi Kavi - Umapati Sivam   
12\. Nenju Vidu Dhoothu - Umapati Sivam   
13\. UNmai NeRi ViLakkam - Umapati Sivam   
14\. Sankalpa Nirakaranam - Umapati Sivam   
There are some English renderings available, through Annamalai University,  
Chidambaram and Tamizh Univresity, Thanjavur.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think Annamalai university and few other universities also have a 2 year  
correspondence course on Saiva Siddhanta.
