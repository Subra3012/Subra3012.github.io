## Tiru-Ezhu-Kootrirukkai  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 26, 2009, 02:26:56 PM  
---  
Tiru-Ezhu-Kootriukkai or Seven layered Ratha Pandham, is   
a type of song, where the numbers 1,2,3, etc., are arranged   
in ascending and then descending order, as the upper deck   
and lower deck of a Chariot, Ratha. This is one of the very   
difficult compositions. In Tamil, only Tiru Jnana Sambandha,   
Nammazhwar and Arunagiri Natha have attemped it. We   
shall now see, Arunagiri Natha's Ratha Pandham, on Muruga   
of Swamimalai. Translation is quite challenging and I have   
tried my best.   
In ONE Brahma Swarupa, which is Taraka-mantram, which   
is one without second, in that ONE Form you took TWO Forms,   
as Siva and Shanmukha. You are really ONE, but are born   
from TWO, Siva and Sakti. You are ever YOUNG, [Moova in   
Tamil which means not yet old as also THREE]. You are   
among Brahmins, who are said to have TWO births, Dwajas,   
but really, you are ONE, Eka vastu.   
Due to disrespectful behaviour [ORA in Tamil means ONE and   
also disrespectful], coming out of TWO behaviour [good and   
bad merits, punya and papa], once upon a time [MunnaL in   
Tamil means THREE as well as in olden days], Brahma's   
[Brahma is FOUR faced or Nanmukan in Tamil] tuft of hair   
was in a trice, knuckled! Then the THREE came [Indra,   
Vishnu and Siva] to you, prostrated at your TWO golden   
feet, and you released him from the ONE [solitary cell],   
prison.   
In ONE second, you mounted the TWO feathered peacock,   
and went around the world, engulfed on THREE sides by   
oceans, upon the act of which, this land of FOUR [Kurinji,   
Mullai, Marutham and Neythal - forest lands, garden lands,   
paddy fields and sea sands - types, got panicky [anja =   
panic in Tamil and also means FIVE], and you circulated   
the earth.   
The FOUR tusked Iravatham, the celestial elephant, with   
THREE frenzies [matham - frenzy juices coming from cheeks, chin and lips] and  
TWO large ears and ONE hand [trunk],   
his daughter Deyvayanai [Devayanai is the daughter of Indra and was brought by  
Iravatham] -- you married.   
In ONE form, [Ganapati =elephant] he became TWO [Ganapati and the old elephant  
which came to VaLLi' s millet fields],   
he with THREE frenzies, and you became elder to that old   
elephant, which came to the millet fields.[Because that elephant   
was formed after Skanda, but younger to Ganapati].   
He has got a hanging mouth [Nalvay = FOUR =hanging mouth],   
and is God with FIVE hands [one trunk and four hands for   
Ganapati] and wears arugu [cynadon grass and also SIX in   
Tamil] and you are younger to him.   
In FIVE lettered Panchaksharam, you reveal FOUR Vedas and   
you are THREE eyed Siva Himself [Arunagiri Natha does not   
see difference between Siva and Muruga] and TWO merits   
[papa and punya] are cured by the medicine, that is the ONE   
Guru, you, Muruga.   
ONE day, you suckled TWO breasts of Uma, became authority   
in THREE Tamils [literature, music and drama] and you   
write FOUR types of poems, Chitram, Mathuram, Vichitram,   
and Asu; you are the king of FIVE types of lands [Kurinji, Marutham, Mullai,  
Neiythal and Palai, the first four already explained, the fifth is the desert  
lands]. You are none other than SIX faced God, [upto this, the descriptions  
are to Tiru Jnana Sambandha, the saintpoet who is an avatara of Muruga.  
Bhagavan Ramana is the next avatara]. You are born in the beautiful town  
[Ezhil means in Tamil beautiful and also SEVEN in Tamil] of Kazhumalam i.e  
Seerkazhi, with all handsomeness.   
SIX stars [Karitika] suckled you with their breasts when you were young [the  
poet shifts to Muruga] and you are the king of FIVE celestial trees [in Indra  
loka, there are five trees, Karpagam, Manthaaram, Paarijatham, Santhaanam, and  
Arichantanam] and you are born as the very purport of FOUR Vedas {Pranava  
Swarupa}. In the ancient times, there was   
a THREE-summit Mountain called Krouncham [anRil =   
in Tamil = Krouncham]. It was split into TWO halves,   
with ONE shot of your Spear, Vel.   
In the northern bank of Kaveri, you are in Guru--Giri,   
Swami malai where the brahmins pray to you with six   
lettered Saravana Bhava. You are the God of Erakam,   
Swamimalai where you stay and bless us as our God.   
The same song is repeated in pictorial fashion on the lower   
deck of the chariot also. Thus one sings it twice and binds   
Muruga [bandham]! This can be seen in Patala Lingam,   
Gopura Subramanyar Shrine in Tiruvannamalai, as a beautiful   
pictorious representation.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Becoming famous after samadhi

Mostly saints become famous after their samadhi. People have doubt when they  
are living. Why does it happen. After their samadhi they built temple or  
adhistanam do puja and then slowly there will be crowd. Because people do not  
have the power to understand them. On the other hand when Bhagavan   
was alive people came from all over the world.   
2ndly, if we have a guru is it wrong to visit other guru and listen his  
discourse.   
I think saints also have destiny.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A few saints become famous even their lifetime in the world.   
Sri Sankara, Tiru Jnana Sambandha and Jnana Deva are   
such examples. Some become famous after their lifetime.   
Like Seshadri Swamigal and Polur Vittoba. It is all there   
in God's design.   
One can always go to other Guru, even if he is faithful to the   
first one. There is nothing wrong. But one has to pray to   
him treating him as his own Guru's form. Bhagavan said this   
when Kunju Swami went to Kovilur Math and came back without prostrating to  
that Guru. Bhagavan Ramana chided Kunju   
Swami and said: "What is there? You can always pray to him   
as if he is my Form. This is pure advaita."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Saints do have prarabdha, but it is only for their body.   
There is pain. But since they do not have the mind, they   
feel the pain very mildly for the sake of onlookers. Eg.   
Bhagavan Ramana during His terminal cancer time of two   
years. Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati of Kanchi had cataract   
operation and started wearing thick glasses. Seshadri Swamigal   
had a high pneumonia before passing away.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the reply. Whenever we have the chance to see other guru, we have  
to see our own guru's form in him. Very beautiful explaination.   
In the same way when we go to temple, we stand in front of each sanadhi and  
say slokam. Like Ganesha, Karthik, Dhashinamoorthy, Durga, and main god and  
goddess. But some people say, for spiritual sadhana we should keep one guru or  
one god.

I practice mostly dzogchen buddhism, wich has similarities to advaita  
vedanta..   
there exists a very important practice called "guruyoga" in short: here you  
merge with the mind of your master(s), you visualize guru padmasambhava and  
you see him as the embodiement of all your teachers that showed you the nature  
of mind or gave you other spiritual insights..   
so bhagawan is always part of the visualisation. indeed I always felt a deep  
resonance with both "padmashambava" and "ramana" I walways felt them to be  
one...and in fact I see all my teachers as manifestations of bhagawan (as he  
said me that he will bring me in contact with several teachers..and shortly  
afterwards I started to meet spiritual teachers...he is indeed a great guide,  
I feel him to be the greatest guide for our time....)

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the beginning, it is good to keep one Guru and one God   
for praying and meditation. But in due course, you will find   
all gods are your god's form and all gurus are your guru's   
form. I had a friend of mine, who used to pray to Venkateswara   
as Tirupati Muruga! It is not matter for laughing. It is true.   
Even today, I go to Murugan's temple near by every Monday.   
There, I pray to Muruga, 'Annamalai Muruga!'. In fact, the   
Muruga called Gopura Subrahmanya and Subrahmanya at   
the Pillar [from where Arunagiri Natha had a vision of   
Muruga's dancing when he was having debate with Sambandha   
Andan in Tiruvannamalai] at the Northern Towers of Tiruvannamalai are not  
different from the Bangalore Muruga   
for me. Then, I see Ganapati and pray: Annmalai Ganesha!'   
In fact, the Ganapti called Thirai Konda Vinayakar [ a small   
stone image at the Northern Towers of Tiruvannamalai; there   
is a story behind his name, thirai konda... this Ganapti took   
monthly privy purse from a robber king whom he threatened,   
when the king had come to plunder Tiruvannamalai!] This   
Thirai konda Vinayaka is the same as the Ganapati in this   
nearby temple for me. Similarly I pray to Annamalai Narayana,   
before the stone image of Narayana and Annamalai Nataraja   
before the beautiful Natarja metal icon in the same temple.   
All gurus are Ramana for me. This is a definite attitude that   
I have developed.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni sings in Sri Ramana Gita: "I pray to the Maharshi who is Skanda. He is not different   
from Skanda of Tiruttani or Swamimalai or in Tirupati. he is   
very much here in Virupaksha Cave. Why differentiate?"   
This is the Truth.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear matthias,   
Fantastic. The guruyoga is a splendid expression. What is   
yoga? It is union. All gurus are in union as one. Again you   
used the word "Padmasambahva", one who is born on lotus.   
The lotus or kamalam, Padmam, in Sanskrit is quite meaningful   
and pregnant with inner meanings too. All Gurus are called   
Padmam. Guru's feet are always prayed as lotus. They   
say in Sanskrit 'Saranaravindam - Lotus feet.' Aravindam   
is another name for lotus. Muruganar uses this word   
Aravindam, for describing Bhagavan Ramana's lotus feet   
in his various compositions. Saint poet Manikkavachagar   
uses the word lotus at least 50 times in his famous Tiruvachakam. One of  
Sankara's disciple is called Padmapada.   
Lotus or Padmam is quite insightful. It is used to describe   
the God/Guru's form, his feet, his face, his eyes, his heart,   
her breasts [if she is a goddess as in the case of Abhirami or Lalita] etc.,   
Thanks for your insights.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Actually, I have not got the opportunity to learn without any doubts from the  
learned masters. All my relatives do just all traditional pujas but none of  
them do meditation or atma vichara. I do not know why I used to get lots of  
questions from my childhood, As they do not know the answer they say, obey  
what elders they say. I started reading books for my answer. even today also  
none of my people do.They are happy what are they doing, Anyway, I am not  
blaming them. So I used to ask whoever doing pujas, and learnt little bit.  
When I met one srividhya upasaki, she said she is not supposed to go another  
guru and do namaskarams. etc etc. She also could not clear my doubts. It is  
Bhagavan's grace I got Who I am book and slowly I started following His steps  
i.e. atma vichara. It is like a k.g. student. And through this   
forum I get some clearence. Many great saints do like what you have said. That  
EKA BHAVAM should come. When I saw Shiridi baba serial there also baba showed  
the repective gods to their devotees. Akoalkot maharaji's devotee had darshan  
when he went to baba. Here baba showed all are one. Whereas you have   
that manobhavam to see Bhagavan everywhere. It is true when we see all are  
one, then there would not be another form or name.   
Thank you once again.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Ekabhavam is important.   
Regarding learning, each one's interest varies according   
to his prarabdha. There are many who do not know about   
various saints of Tamil Nadu, even though they are living   
there for generations. Secondly, questioning mind is also   
good. That is the way to know the Truth. There are many   
devotees who came to Bhagavan Ramana and asked Him   
questions day in and day out. Nobody can be as patient   
as Bhagavan Ramana. He explained everything with great   
patience. You can see, regarding mind and ego, how many   
devotees have asked questions to Bhagavan Ramana, in   
different ways and with different words. He answered   
them depending upon their state of maturity. It may look   
like different answers but Bhagavan Ramana is   
always consistent in His central theme. Only words may vary   
depending upon the questioner. If a Upasaki like your   
friend did not want to go to another guru, it is her mindset.   
Only mantras have to be learnt through a guru. This does   
not mean that she cannot go and pray to another Guru. Again,   
if she does not answer/clarify your points, this shows only   
her level of understanding of Devi Upasana. Lalita is   
guru-mantra roopini. She is in the form of Guru-mantra,   
any guru for that matter. She is the Who am I?, She is the   
Alla Malik hai, as Shirdi Sai Baba said.   
Arunachala Siva.

so bhagawan is always part of the visualisation. indeed I always felt a deep  
resonance with both "padmashambava" and "ramana" I walways felt them to be  
one...and in fact I see all my teachers as manifestations of bhagawan (as he  
said me that he will bring me in contact with several teachers..and shortly  
afterwards I started to meet spiritual teachers...he is indeed a great guide,  
I feel him to be the greatest guide for our time....)

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the beginning, it is good to keep one Guru and one God   
for praying and meditation. But in due course, you will find   
all gods are your god's form and all gurus are your guru's   
form. I had a friend of mine, who used to pray to Venkateswara   
as Tirupati Muruga! It is not matter for laughing. It is true.   
Even today, I go to Murugan's temple near by every Monday.   
There, I pray to Muruga, 'Annamalai Muruga!'. In fact, the   
Muruga called Gopura Subrahmanya and Subrahmanya at   
the Pillar [from where Arunagiri Natha had a vision of   
Muruga's dancing when he was having debate with Sambandha   
Andan in Tiruvannamalai] at the Northern Towers of Tiruvannamalai are not  
different from the Bangalore Muruga   
for me. Then, I see Ganapati and pray: Annmalai Ganesha!'   
In fact, the Ganapti called Thirai Konda Vinayakar [ a small   
stone image at the Northern Towers of Tiruvannamalai; there   
is a story behind his name, thirai konda... this Ganapti took   
monthly privy purse from a robber king whom he threatened,   
when the king had come to plunder Tiruvannamalai!] This   
Thirai konda Vinayaka is the same as the Ganapati in this   
nearby temple for me. Similarly I pray to Annamalai Narayana,   
before the stone image of Narayana and Annamalai Nataraja   
before the beautiful Natarja metal icon in the same temple.   
All gurus are Ramana for me. This is a definite attitude that   
I have developed.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni sings in Sri Ramana Gita: "I pray to the Maharshi who is Skanda. He is not different   
from Skanda of Tiruttani or Swamimalai or in Tirupati. he is   
very much here in Virupaksha Cave. Why differentiate?"   
This is the Truth.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear matthias,   
Fantastic. The guruyoga is a splendid expression. What is   
yoga? It is union. All gurus are in union as one. Again you   
used the word "Padmasambahva", one who is born on lotus.   
The lotus or kamalam, Padmam, in Sanskrit is quite meaningful   
and pregnant with inner meanings too. All Gurus are called   
Padmam. Guru's feet are always prayed as lotus. They   
say in Sanskrit 'Saranaravindam - Lotus feet.' Aravindam   
is another name for lotus. Muruganar uses this word   
Aravindam, for describing Bhagavan Ramana's lotus feet   
in his various compositions. Saint poet Manikkavachagar   
uses the word lotus at least 50 times in his famous Tiruvachakam. One of  
Sankara's disciple is called Padmapada.   
Lotus or Padmam is quite insightful. It is used to describe   
the God/Guru's form, his feet, his face, his eyes, his heart,   
her breasts [if she is a goddess as in the case of Abhirami or Lalita] etc.,   
Thanks for your insights.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Actually, I have not got the opportunity to learn without any doubts from the  
learned masters. All my relatives do just all traditional pujas but none of  
them do meditation or atma vichara. I do not know why I used to get lots of  
questions from my childhood, As they do not know the answer they say, obey  
what elders they say. I started reading books for my answer. even today also  
none of my people do.They are happy what are they doing, Anyway, I am not  
blaming them. So I used to ask whoever doing pujas, and learnt little bit.  
When I met one srividhya upasaki, she said she is not supposed to go another  
guru and do namaskarams. etc etc. She also could not clear my doubts. It is  
Bhagavan's grace I got Who I am book and slowly I started following His steps  
i.e. atma vichara. It is like a k.g. student. And through this   
forum I get some clearence. Many great saints do like what you have said. That  
EKA BHAVAM should come. When I saw Shiridi baba serial there also baba showed  
the repective gods to their devotees. Akoalkot maharaji's devotee had darshan  
when he went to baba. Here baba showed all are one. Whereas you have   
that manobhavam to see Bhagavan everywhere. It is true when we see all are  
one, then there would not be another form or name.   
Thank you once again.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Ekabhavam is important.   
Regarding learning, each one's interest varies according   
to his prarabdha. There are many who do not know about   
various saints of Tamil Nadu, even though they are living   
there for generations. Secondly, questioning mind is also   
good. That is the way to know the Truth. There are many   
devotees who came to Bhagavan Ramana and asked Him   
questions day in and day out. Nobody can be as patient   
as Bhagavan Ramana. He explained everything with great   
patience. You can see, regarding mind and ego, how many   
devotees have asked questions to Bhagavan Ramana, in   
different ways and with different words. He answered   
them depending upon their state of maturity. It may look   
like different answers but Bhagavan Ramana is   
always consistent in His central theme. Only words may vary   
depending upon the questioner. If a Upasaki like your   
friend did not want to go to another guru, it is her mindset.   
Only mantras have to be learnt through a guru. This does   
not mean that she cannot go and pray to another Guru. Again,   
if she does not answer/clarify your points, this shows only   
her level of understanding of Devi Upasana. Lalita is   
guru-mantra roopini. She is in the form of Guru-mantra,   
any guru for that matter. She is the Who am I?, She is the   
Alla Malik hai, as Shirdi Sai Baba said.   
Arunachala Siva.
