## Pirthru Dosham

one of my friend was asking me about Pirthru Dosham and few other Doshas. I  
was unable to really give a proper answer to him. Has Bhagawan told anything  
in this regard about Pithru Doshas or any remidies does it have any connection  
for not having issues?   
Prostrations to Bhagawan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
I do not know it correctly. From the name it appears, it means the curse of  
the father, for not having taken care of him, or not helping   
him in his times of distress. I do not know about the parihara, retribution.  
Bhagavan Ramana says in Arunachla Nava Mani Mala,   
about His immense gratitude towards Sundaram Iyer and his wife   
Azhagamma, who are His parents.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I feel Bhagawan would have asked such person to do Girivalam for its Agni  
itself and it will burn away all Karmas of the person. I would like to know  
your opinion. I dont remember reading in any books related to Bhagawan about  
such questions.   
Thank you   
Prostrations to Bhagawan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Yes. Girivalam can definitely be a retribution. Reading Arunachala   
Nava Mani Mala and Arunachala Askshara Mana Malai (in the Verse 2   
itself, Bhagavan speaks about His Mother and Father, Azhagu and   
Sundaram, can equally be effective.   
Arunachala Siva.
