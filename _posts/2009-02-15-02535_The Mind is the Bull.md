## The Mind is the Bull  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 15, 2009, 09:36:42 AM  
---  
A group of people came on a visit to Bhagavan Ramana. One of them   
asked: "How can I keep my mind aright?"   
Bhagavan Ramana: " A refractory bull is lured to the stall by means of grass.  
Similarly, the mind must be lured by good thoughts."   
Devotee: "But it does not remain steady."   
Bhagavan: "The bull accustomed to stray takes delight in going astray.  
However, he must be lured with luscious grass to the stall. Even so, he will  
continue to trespass into the neighbour's fields. He must gradually be made  
to realize that the same kind of grass can be had in his own place. After a  
time, he will remain in the stall without straying. Later a time will come  
when, even if driven out of the stall, he will return to the stall without  
going into the neighbouring fields. So also the mind must be trained to take  
to right ways. It will gradually grow accustomed to good ways and will not  
run return to the wrong ways.   
Devotee: "What are the good ways to be shown to the mind?"   
Bhagavan: "Thought of God."

Nice example.   
swami vivekananda compares the mind to a monkey, consumed with alcohol and  
bitten by a scorpion.   
Just a thought.

dear skrudai...   
in your last posts I see a strong nihilistic attidute towards this  
reality....please do not fall into the extrem clinging towards the absolut,  
towards light and enlightment...I do not know you personally so I can not  
judge you and how you are..so maybe my concenrs are totally useless but I  
wanted to let you know how I think and feel...   
I just wanted to remind you that this world is not an illusion, it is "like"  
an illusion.   
there is the absolute and there is the relative (traditional advaita is  
ignoring the relative, but Iam sceptical about this aproach)....the I and the  
thoughts do have power, the "ingoring" of this powers is an act of violence  
against oneself and also others...in my eyes! When you just cling towards the  
non-dual ever-present witness then youre mind will not funtion free...because  
I do not feel you to be totally free of the ego...and it is about beeing free  
of the clinging towards light and towards shadow....this is not achieved  
(again this is my attitude) with simply ignoring the relative and exalting the  
other extrem...   
I had my first mahamudra meditaiton sitting yesterday and a core sentence was  
that it is about moving free between nirvana and samasara and not about  
resting in nirvana...this is a nihilistic attitude.   
I hope you undestand and you always can proofe me wrong an what I say, I have  
a deep respect for your wods and wisdome and Iam akways delighted to read your  
posts   
love   
matthias

Dear matthias,   
 Thank you for the concern and also thanks for posting your thoughts and feelings. Unless you point out what you think is wrong there cannot be a correction and the correction may be in my attitude, yours or both. let us see where it leads to. So lets just continue this discussion a little bit.. Here are my thoughts: 1) world is an illusion. There are three words in Sanskrit : SAT, ASAT,  
MITHYA. SAT is what Eternally IS: Brahman. ASAT is what is not there at all.  
MITHYA is what appears to be real as long as you look at it as real. World is  
Mithya. Jagat mithya. The mind is mithya. .. it is there coz of the importance  
we associate with it. .. we pamper it, we try to soothe it. We try to give it  
what ever it asks for. .. riches, comforts, meditative experiences,  
intellectual experiences etc. we give it. .. it keeps asking. .. it never  
stops and one day we get tired of trying to satisfy it. And like a spoilt  
child, it starts asking and demanding everything. .. everytime. now it asks  
for meditative experiences, now it asks for exotic literature study... and now  
again it asks for a women' hug or a movie or party. Thus mind keeps on  
demanding and we succumb to it.   
Mind cannot be brought under control by giving it what it wants. withdraw.  
stop seeking mental states. stop agreeing with it. .. just ignore it.   
now this is not violence. violence means you are fighting. fighting means you  
are already giving importance to it... ignoring it. .. totally and ruthlessly  
... there is no fight. no struggle. .. you just do not participate. Please  
see... suppose someone comes to me and says : "ur philosophy is bad", i can  
accept it, reject and disagree or keep quiet... like Sri Ramana. And the  
moment i keep quiet, he will shout again and again a few times and leave. he  
cannot do anything. but if i disagree and fight... there will be tension on  
both sides. if i just keep quiet. .. he cannot do anything.   
so too with mind. mind says something. .. if i do not agree/disagree. .. but  
remain as the Self. .. where is the question of violence there ?   
2) This does not stop one from functioning in the world in any way. Please  
see... looking at the world as a mere dream. ..do what ever you want to do...  
just continue. .. but at the same time, remain conscious lest at any moment  
you take it real. everytime mind says "This experience is real". .. one has to  
see within how it is unreal and just a conditioning. this has to be done until  
one is independent of all conditionings. But, here again. .. one should never  
go into the extremes but should proceed slowly.   
Yes meditation, japa and prayer do help on the whole. but ultimately, one has  
to go beyond them all.   
Love!

dear Skrudai   
I see your points, I guess it was about words and meanings of words, that made  
me think about the posts...   
I think you are correct in what you explained here to me and I can agree..   
there was one thing I would like to talk about: mind is never happy with what it gets...this is the seeking mind...the mind  
that wants something and goes out to get it am I right? It is a state of  
mind....we know all to well, but without this state where would this world be?   
desire is a ground motivation of maya or relative reality.....and it is alife  
in all of us....we would not exist without it, noit even the saints would  
wander the planet if life itself would not desire to be alife....desire is a  
very important fact of gods creation..   
Our sadhana is also means to give te things the right place...and desire has a  
place in our society....it is an important factor...when it is healthy no  
problem..   
non seeking mind...the mind htat is at rest and happy with the mind is resting  
as the self...it is nothing but another state of mind...not even a better  
one...having no desire is not better then having desire....   
mind that seeks things is not superior then mind that is non-seeking (mind at  
peace)...who is to judge between them?   
we both know that it is about switching freely undisturbed between mind sets  
or mind states...our true self is not limited to anything or disturbed by any  
mind set....

Dear matthias,   
I saw your posts and srkudai's posts. I would only like to share   
the ideas regarding mind. First comes first. Desiring the Self is the   
only thing that the aspirant or seeker should have. Other desires   
in the objective reality, happen according to one's prarabdha. Jnanis live  
their lives, desiring the Self ever and leaving the other desires to the  
prarabdha. Such desires cannot be avoided be it a Jnani or an   
ordinary mortal.   
Then, the question arises about the 'mind' aspect. Once a Jnani   
permanently fixes his egoistic mind in the Self, it is the Self which is doing  
everything in the objective world. Or we can call it, it is the   
Suddha Manas or Pure Mind which is doing everything in the objective world.   
For example, Bhagavan Ramana used to have betel leaves and nuts for some  
years. He had even tasted Ganja (cannabis) once or twice. One day He enjoyed  
the vegetables + curd preparation, with coconut oil, it is called Aviyal in  
Tamil, so much that He asked for a second helping! For the same reason, He  
did not object to the petty picadillos of His various devotees. Some used to  
take tobacco snuff, some would constantly chew betel leaves, nuts and tobacco  
leaves, some would go for pilgrimage all over the country, some would write  
lots of poetry, some would sing melodious songs, some would ask for an extra  
cup of coffee, etc., etc., Only Ganja, He told them not to have, because it  
gives false sense of bliss and is a terrible addiction. The false sense of  
bliss would be mistaken for the Self, just as people today think that they can  
write e-posts in various blogs and attain the e-Self!   
Arunachala Siva.

It has also been mentioned in the Srimad Bhagawatam also. Veda Vyasa says that  
there are a lot of ways by which one can experience the bliss by means of  
Intoxications and others but when it is realised through means of Yoga and  
Bhakti it lasts permanently.   
A Jnaani is beyond anything. One very orthodox Brahman came to visit Shirdi  
Sai Baba and found him eating raw onions and was shocked seeing him eat  
onions. Baba could read his thoughts and said to him that one who can digest  
onions can eat them i.e. a Jnaani is beyond the effects of onions and the  
effects of onions dont trouble a Jnaani. But for us who are striving to reach  
Brahman should take care in our food habits and consume only satvic foods so  
as to develop a spiritual mind.   
Once when the ego 'I' is able to atleast see the state of Brahman or atleast  
have a feel of that state. It is like a Honey bee trapped inside a Glass  
bottle and struggling to free itself outside the non-existing glass. once this  
glass is broken the ego 'I' merges with the all pervading Brahman.

Dear Matthias,   
 A realized person is not he who has no desires. it is he who "Can-Dare-To-Desire". please try to see the point i am trying to make. Desires are there. And due to desires there are various conflicts in mind... someone who knows how to have desires without having any conflict in mind is a Saint. Who is absolutely comfortable with his mind.   
By desires i mean Dharmic desires. Adharmic desires are sure to lead to  
downfall. they are to be avoided [slowly if that became a habit in someone's  
case].   
now please see the problem... I desire something. Always a desire is a  
particular result... some money, comfortable living or a beautiful woman as  
wife. .. or some children... what ever that be. so there are desires. if there  
were no desires no problem at all. but desires are there.   
ok, suppose i could control the results through actions and make all desires  
possible. .. suppose i had aladin lamp from which a ginie would pop up and  
give me what ever i desire. .. then too there is not much problem... i can  
keep asking and getting things done. Most people think of prayers to be means  
to get things done. .. something like the ginie of aladin lamp.   
But unfortunately Bhagavad gita says : Karmanyevadikarasthe ma phalesu  
kadachana [u have right over action, never over results]. .. and that is not  
an instruction for the disciple. .. it is a statement of fact. So now is the  
problem. the desires are there but we cannot fulfill them. That is the problem  
isnt it ?   
A Jnani is someone who is able to see that the presence of a desire does not  
compel him to fulfill it. That is Jnana. An ordinary man feels that if he does  
not fulfill his desires he is incomplete and a sufferer. A Saint sees clearly  
that If desires are to get fulfilled, they will. .. if not, they wont... he  
can act in a certain way but never control the result. and therefore does not  
create mental problems coz some desires are not getting fulfilled.   
so once a person is able to see clearly that desires are mere suggestions and  
not compulsions. .. he has complete freedom whether to pursue a desire or just  
leave it. Just in order to not get cheated by mind, i suggest the person to  
"not fulfill the desire and see"... when one is able to remain totally  
comfortable without fulfilling the desire. .. he is not eligible to have  
desires . .. its like earning the capacity to have desires.   
Please comment on this piece of e-Advice to gain the e-Self that Subramanian  
ji mentioned.   
Love!

Just my thoughts: To whom are we trying to discuss here about any topic? who is actually  
listenning? and for what purpose are we actually taking all efforts to write  
whatever we want to share? Really to whom are we sharing anything? we believe  
that some one is reading what we write. actually where is that thought? it is  
all in the false 'I'   
In reality 2 people cannot meet anywhere at all. what ever I try to  
communicate - its all only based on my thoughts alone and my past experiences  
alone. and what ever another would understand is also based only on his  
thoughts and experiences alone. In one way its just a game that we are all  
playing here. 'The I' here is nothing but absolutely all thoughts alone - all  
the experiences. When we were born as a baby we did not know anything. we dint  
have any thoughts a baby is blank. when it is born, first the mother  
introduces herself to the baby - here first thoughts are born - the morther is  
born, then she introduces to the father - father is born and so on. then the  
grandmother tells the baby that the sky is blue! in reality what is blue? can  
anyone know what is blue? we are all just repeating what ever we have listened  
to so long till even now. Nothing is actually ours. can there be anything mine  
when everything what ever we know, think, do are all imitations. nothing  
original.! just some how if these imitations could just dissolve, then what  
would remain is all consciousness, awareness. what ever we may call it. even  
the term consciousness, awareness used only by others and not by the pure 'I'   
we only know what is birth and death by seeing others. We dont know them  
ourselves. when we see a baby is born we think that a baby is born and when a  
person dies, we think that is what is dying! but we can never know when  
exactly we were born and when exactly we die. because we can never experience  
both because of absence of thougts. we are never born or ever died. we cannot  
howmuch ever possible know our own birth or death. what we know about them is  
only what we have heard.   
we are all nothing but 'thought' 'ideas' alone. when what is called death  
experience occurs, these thoughts gets flushed out and what remains is a  
natural consciousness awareness untouched by any ideas thoughts or anything.   
rest in next.   
Thank you

"we are all nothing but 'thought' 'ideas' alone. when what is called death

Not having experienced a thoughtless state, or a deathlike state, "natural  
consciousness / awareness" also remains just a thought....for me.

dear ganesh,   
the videos are beautiful. i liked the shivoham video particularly....also  
because u had translatead the lyrics. the words of Shankacharya are immortal.  
Have u heard Pt. Jasraj's redition of this?   
There is something about Shunya / Nothingness that is very powerful and  
appealing, conceptually. It gives a mightly tug somewhere....   
how to experience it is the question.   
best wishes!
