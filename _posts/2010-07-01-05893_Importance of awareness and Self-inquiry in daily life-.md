## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!   
Silence

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the

walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type

for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.

 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!   
Silence

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM  
---  
Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM  
---  
Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!   
Silence

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM  
---  
Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!   
Silence

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser

No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!   
Silence

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar

he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Udai,till we go beyond the mind likes and dislikes will be there.Self-  
inquiry is the way for going beyond the mind by putting aside the ego.This is

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Raju,   
 I guess my previous post is not properly understood.   
please re-read and let me know if the explanation is incomplete at any point.   
what i was trying to convey is this: you cannot go beyond attachment and  
aversion by dealing with them directly.   
coz, they are like the branches of a tree. the root of this tree is  
"ignorance" of my true nature.   
this ignorance is to be eliminated.   
hope that makes it clear.   
to explain: the king who took himself to be a beggar... if he tries to correct  
his anxieties, worries etc without knowing his true nature. .. do you think he  
will ever become the king?   
so. .. its not the practice of remaining aware / observing the mind that is  
required. it is knowing i am the king that is important.   
Love!

Dear Udai,till we go beyond the mind likes and dislikes will be there.Self-  
inquiry is the way for going beyond the mind by putting aside the ego.This is  
what i understand.

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings  
are aimed for those but not for wise people like you who know everything.

## Importance of awareness and Self-inquiry in daily life.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 01, 2010, 04:21:00 AM

Many of us feel that we are the body.Intellectuals feel that their essential  
nature is mind.   
Truth seeker imagines that he is the Self but he has no first hand experience  
of it.   
Self,mind,body are they separate entities or do they belong to a single  
integrated being?   
How to find it out whether they are separate or integrated whole.   
Daily we walk early in the morning.It is the body that walks.But we are  
superimposing   
that activity of the body on us and say "I am walking".In vedantic jargon it  
called   
Adhyasa(defect of superimposition).Usually we walk mechanically and we usually   
go on thinking while walking.So we are not aware of walking.We are not aware  
of   
surroundings while walking.It is almost a somnambulism.Are we aware of the  
birds,   
their songs,trees with their beauty,flowers,clouds,the beauty of crane flying  
in the   
background dark clouds of monsoon,are we sensitive to all these?Majority of us  
are   
lost in our thoughts which takes us to an illusory territory.Why it is  
happening like that?   
It is because we are unaware to the present moment.If we start de-mechanizing  
the   
walking by being aware of walking thinking stops.Thinking is not needed while  
walking   
just as thinking is not needed while breathing.When there is no thinking we  
are aware   
of the surroundings,we perceive the beauty of birds,the sounds that they make,   
one bird respond to the sound made by the other bird,the beauty of  
flowers,trees,   
the smell of air while raining,we become sensitive to all these without any  
thought.   
In that thought-free state there is joy.But the mind of an average human being   
has such a momentum and rush of thoughts many times he is lost in thoughts   
missing the beauty of surroundings which is quite obvious.Unless we are aware   
to these gross aspects we cannot develop the skill to be aware of subtle  
things   
like thoughts and mental activity.Whatever we do we must do it with awareness   
then only we become aware of subtle things.If we develop the capacity to be   
aware of subtle things we develop the capacity to de-mechanize the thought   
process.At present we are thinking mechanically in unawareness.We are  
superimposing   
that activity of thought and are saying "I am thinking".   
The thought process is going on even when it is not required and has no role  
to play.   
It is just like while we are sitting if we move our hands incessantly and  
awkwardly   
without any cause it looks mad,same is the situation with thinking,at present   
its activity is out of our hands and thought is running amok.Normal human  
being   
means he is a socially adjustable being with the mask of personality with this  
type   
of perverted and uncontrollable thinking.All this is due to lack of awareness  
resulting   
in a mechanistic thinking and Self-inquiry de-mechanizes this by bringing in  
awareness.   
Awareness keeps the thought where it is expected to function and prevents  
anomalous   
thinking.If one is aware many human problems are solved.Awareness is the  
panacea   
for problems of humanity and Self-inquiry is the way for it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. What is required is only breaking the barrier of unwanted   
thinking, and remain in the beauty of the surroundings, where   
the pure mind just enjoys the nature.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai verses say: Verse 1038: Consciousness is not a quality of the Self, because the Self is  
free from qualities [nirguna]. Neither is consciousness an   
activity of the Self because the Self is free from the sense of doership.  
Consciousness is truly the intrinsic nature of the Self.   
Verse 1039: The truth of Atma Swarupam, which possesses strength and  
certainty, is indeed that powerful limitation free   
consciousness, pure being, the light which shines itself, in the Heart,  
without any obstruction, as 'I am', without requiring in the least another  
light to know its own being.   
Verse 1040: How can your truth, which shines as the light of consciousness,  
be known like a fragmented and inert sense object? If you abide peacefully in  
the Self, freed from the false nature, the ego 'I', your true nature will  
spontaneously shine forth.   
Verse 459: Through the destruction of the doltish ego, the triputis that are  
based on it fade away and end, along with sakala [the waking and dream  
states]. The pure [suddha] state [nilai] of daylight that then shines forever  
is Sivaratri, the night of Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 You are a very nice friend. So I would like to share my view on these topics without hesitation. Please give this some thought.   
If I am not wrong, this is the line of thinking adopted by JK, Echart Tolle,  
Buddhist and Zen schools of thought etc.   
I am not particularly impressed by these for a few reasons.   
Remaining Aware of our motions, thoughts etc is nice. But even without our  
notice we shall notice every now and then that we get detracked. let me give a  
small example: I start out in the morning fully aware. .. observing every  
motion, the sounds, the surroundings, my own thoughts. And then by afternoon,  
I notice that i have got detracked. some where, some time. in between.   
Its like cleaning the room [mind]. Being aware is a wonderful mechanism to  
still the mind. But the stilled mind is once again taken over by thoughts and  
lack of awareness very soon. its like this: I go home and find my room is full  
of water. I drain the water out of the room and clean it. .. make it very  
neat. and then, again water gushes in from somewhere. Again I clean it, again  
it gushes in. The solution is not cleaning. The solution is block the hole  
that is leaking the water in.   
The way is not to "Remain Aware" but to block that which is causing me to  
"Lose Awareness".   
Is this very clear ?   
Please see. My nature being awareness; why should someone tell me "remain  
aware" ? Coz I am losing it somewhere. Apparently atleast. So this is the  
source of the problem. We have to block the holes that take us away from our  
beingness, our Self. We need to block that. And thoughts are not the problem.  
Please observe within. When we are peaceful, thoughts arise, they are not a  
problem. But some thoughts have the capacity to disturb the peace. How do  
these thoughts disturb the peace ? How do these thoughts take me "away from  
myself" ? how do they do that?   
If we are in sync i shall continue the explanation.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,as you said we lose awareness after being aware for some time.This  
is because we are so used in doing things in   
unawareness.But as we persevere in being aware it crytallizes and then we act  
from awareness rather than from ego which is   
a progeny of unawareness.Losing awareness and again being aware is part of  
spiritual growth.

I'll put the question another way.   
Ramana did not " practice ", being in awareness. Buddha did it.   
And yet Ramana was ever in "Awareness"   
Are you getting this point? Ramana could remain in total Awareness without  
practising it as Buddha did it.   
What do you think is the difference?

Dear Udai,Ramana's way of enlightenment is a rare event in spiritual  
history.Heis already on the verge of enlightenment at the   
time of his death experience.Probably almost there are no tendencies to be  
spent in his mind.   
Buddha's case is different,he enjoyed life like anybody and he is a womeniser  
till 33 yrs.Even later he practiced so many   
spiritual disciplines and found none of them helped him and he lost all hope  
and then utterly relaxed in the night and when   
the last star of night is about to disappeared he is awakened to Self  
spontaneously.   
No two saints attained realization in a similar way.So i feel we should not  
compare and evaluate their type of enlightenment.

Dear Raju,   
 I am trying to convey a very interesting point. Please observe.   
Raga, Dvesha [Attachment and Aversion] are the root cause why we slip into  
unawareness.   
Please see. Ragam : attachment. Dvesham: aversion.   
So, they are like two threads pulling us. When we try being in the middle path  
... that is, when we try remaining in awareness, its like walking on a thin  
line. .. and Raga and Dvesha are pulling us from both sides. As long as one is  
able to remain uninfluenced one remains in awareness. The moment one is  
influenced by Ragam or Dvesham, one slips from the middle path of remaining in  
awareness.   
So if a person has no Ragam / Dvesham [or is not influenced by them]. .. he  
remains in that awareness or present moment and nothing can disturb him from  
it.   
The method or approach of Buddhist schools is: Everytime we slip from  
remaining in awareness, revert back to it. Everytime we get lost. .. start  
observing the breath, remain in present moment.   
This is their method.   
Sankara approaches it slightly differently. He knocks off the roots. He says  
"why is there Raga/Dvesha" in the first place?   
I have ragam towards something, coz it gives me a sense of completeness. So i  
think.   
I have dvesham towards something, coz it seems to make me incomplete.   
So the fundamental reason ragam and dvesham are there is "Ignorance of my true  
nature".   
Our upanishads do not start with observe breath, observe mind etc. They say  
You are Complete!   
So the fire of attachment and aversion is quenched. By knowledge. And this  
knowledge is obtained not by spiritual practices but from guru upadesha  
[panchadasi explains it].   
The Knowledge that i am complete, removes ragam and dvesham and hence, i  
remain in awareness always.   
its like cutting the roots of the tree... the tree can no more live.   
instead of cutting the branches of the tree.   
The buddhist way is tough... primarily coz it cuts the branches. everytime  
mind slips into unawareness, its brought back.   
The Sankara way is straight forward. .. cut the roots. Just destroy the  
ignorance.   
So one correction in mind. .. just one. And thats it. But any correction in  
mind takes time. so one is first explained how one is Complete. ..  
systematically and logically. then one is asked to meditate on it and make the  
correction complete in mind.   
You are very correct that Ramana is unique. The uniqueness is. .. he was  
convinced that he is Self and there after nothing could create a doubt in his  
mind! And consequently, in the absence of ragam and dvesham... he remained  
established as Self.   
I have deviated a little. .. when i say no raga, dvesha. .. i do not mean mind  
should not have likes and dislikes... i just mean, one does not come under  
their sway. coz one is consciousness... its like space in which various  
raga,dveshas float. .. the space itself is untouched.   
Love!

Yes even sages will have raga/dvesha and they are no exception.   
But as udai garu said they does not come under their sway.   
As Sampurnamma recalls the below incident in ramana ashramam   
Quote  
One would think that he liked good food and enjoyed a hearty meal. Not at all.  
At dinner time he would mix up the little food he would allow to be put on his  
leaf -- the sweet, the sour, and the savoury -- everything together, and gulp  
it down carelessly as if he had no taste in his mouth. When we told him that  
it was not right to mix such nicely made up dishes, he would say, "Enough of  
multiplicity, Let us have some unity".  
So in a way ramana maharshi is unique and amazing sage.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
Brahma Jnanis who have conquered the ego, have gone beyond   
the dyads and triads. These are all the knots that bind the ordinary   
mortals with a hard thick ego cover.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 80 of AAMM:-   
Mudi adi kaana mudi vidutthu anai ner......   
You have cut the knot of my ego. You have given me a glimpse   
of transcendence, a moment of nirvikalpa samadhi, of pure non-   
objective awareness. Complete the task. Make this state of   
egolessness permanent and natural, give me sahaja samadhi.   
Egoless abidance in the Self = Pure Non Objective Awareness!   
So, another discussion may start regarding this Awareness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,attachment is an attempt of mind to fulfill itself through an object  
either external or internal.There is possession implied   
in it.If the possession is not possible hatred arises.So attachment and hatred  
are part of single movement of mind.If there is neither attachment nor hatred  
mind does not exist if we take mind as thought.Mind exists between these  
antmonies.If antimonies   
are not there mind as thought does not exists.Then the vessel of mind becomes  
empty and is filled awareness only which is our   
basic nature. Attachment is the food for the mind to continue. Non-attached  
witnessing is the way to stop it without any effort to stop it. And when you  
start enjoying those blissful moments, your capacity to retain them for longer  
periods arises.   
Misery is nothing but the shadow of attachment. And hence all stagnancy. The  
attached person becomes a stagnant pool sooner or later he will stink. He  
flows no more.   
Just seeing the fact that this is an attachment, that attachment is a bondage  
a beautiful word for bondage that attachment is not love. just seeing the  
ugliness of attachment it drops; then arises love. The same energy that was  
becoming attachment, released from attachment becomes a totally different  
energy; it becomes love.

Dear Udai,till we go beyond the mind likes and dislikes will be there.Self-  
inquiry is the way for going beyond the mind by putting aside the ego.This is  
what i understand.

Dear Raju,   
 The point is we cannot go beyond the mind. Coz we are already beyond the mind.   
if you are in mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind.   
if you are out of mind. .. you cannot go beyond mind as well.   
Do you see this?   
The king who took himself to be a beggar. .. does not "Go beyond the beggar  
role".   
he is always beyond it.   
Self inquiry is not for going beyond at all.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,knowing fully well that you are the Self,you are playing the role of  
Udai in this phenomenal reality.So you are having   
Self knowledge.But vast majority of humanity identify with their role only  
forgetting their nature of Self which is their essential nature.My postings  
are aimed for those but not for wise people like you who know everything.

Dear Raju,   
 Please try to understand the mechanics of this.   
There can be three kinds of people.   
1\. Someone who is not aware that he is Consciousness [the beggar who never  
heard that he is the king].   
2\. Someone who heard that he is consciousness but is still not able to own it  
up.   
3\. Someone who has owned up his kingdom.   
The first and second type of people need just the conviction. We all fall  
under these categories. (3) is unique. like a Ramana. And what we need is no a  
new kind of practice, but the conviction that i am the king.   
This is why i specifically consider JK, Osho etc to be deviating from the  
truth and beating round the bush.   
Love!   
Silence
