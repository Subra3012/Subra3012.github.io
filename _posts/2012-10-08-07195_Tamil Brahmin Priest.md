Friends,   
very sorry to ask this question here. Have no other group of friends who can  
answer. Could you please advise me of a good Tamil Brahmin Priest in Bangalore  
who will be willing to come to HSR Layout area and do religious functions at  
home please? Preferably an Iyer priest.   
Many thanks   
Sanjay

Dear sanjya-ganeash,   
1. You may check up with Sringeri Math, Chamarajpet. They have got some in house priests who may also take up outside   
job. Their houses are near Sringeri Math itself. You can check up by going  
inside. Many of them are also Tamizh knowing   
priests.   
2\. Or you may have to go a little far off, ie to Malleswaram, 15th Main,  
where there is Kanchi Sankara Math. You may check   
up with them, fix one priest and also some advance amount for coming all the  
way to HSR lay out (travel by auto). Then   
after performance of rituals, you may pay them suitably.   
Arunachala Siva.
