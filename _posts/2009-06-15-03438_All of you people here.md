## Tenth Man-a funny tale with high philosophy  
Author: arcsekar            Date: July 19, 2009, 12:20:25 PM  
---  
There was a Guru with ten stupid students.He asked the students to cross the  
river and wait for him on the other bank.He warned them about   
the depth and current of the river. Asked them to exercise care and caution.   
The scary students mangaged to cross the river and reached the other side of  
the river.Out of anxiety,they wanted to check about safe arrival of the entire  
group of ten.The first one proceeded without first counting himself and ended  
up with ""Nine"önly.Startled, they organised recounting, but the score never  
crossed Nine ;because each of them inadvertently omitted to include himself in  
the count.They cried in chorus about the loss of one of their team members and  
cursed the river.   
At last, the Guru came on the scene.He understood their problem. He gave a  
blow to each of the students to call out numbers.One..Two..Three   
the last one shouted Ten. The total tallied.Students beamed with joy that all  
of them are very much alive and kicking.Thus the Guru solved a   
non-existent problem.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to narrate this funny story to explain the need for Self  
Enquiry.   
In the book Kaivalya Navaneetham (Tamil) published by Sri Ramanashram,the  
philosophy underlying the story is well expounded.   
 Story line Philosophy   
a)Every student forgetting to count himself  
a)Ignorance of Self -Agnanam.We disregard the Self and direct our thoughts   
 on other objects exeternal to us   
b)Tenth Man not found  
b)Illusion-Maya. Mind filters the Reality. Unreal things appear as Real   
c)Crying over the missing person  
c)Wrong identification--Vikshepa. We identify ourselves with Body/Mind   
 Jeeva Bodam- and undergo sufferings.   
d)Guru asked the students to call out numbers  
d)Indirect knowledge-Paroksha Gnanam-Guru can only give some   
 techniques to find out the Truth.Seeker has to work out the same   
e)Joy of students, when they discovered the tenth student e)Direct  
knowledge-Aparoksha Gnanam.Bliss of Self. The tenth man was   
 only a rediscovery of what was already there.We are always the Self   
 before and after realisation.When realisation dawns we regain the happy   
 state which is our Nature.   
Therefore, let us keep our attention always on the Self and be happy.

I'm not unappreciative of your presence, your posts, or your friendly  
spirit...   
But we are all just talking and repeating what we know...   
If even one of you gained deep clarity, what a benefit that would be...   
But instead, these endless speculations, repetitions, beliefs, assumptions,  
theories...   
And have any of you bothered to find out? Even if through faith, which would  
mean, complete faith... taking it all the way...   
But you don't find out. You just talk...   
This whole pursuit has cost me dearly... my worldly life went from normal and  
enjoyable to one of significant depression and loss of contact with people  
because of an inability to relate...   
I cannot even go up to another human being and really have a conversation  
anymore. They are so blinded by thier minds... it's like talking to the same  
wall, over and over again. They don't care. Not only do they not care, they  
are happily doing everything they can to fortify that wall...   
So what to do? Shall I be brutal and ruthless and get what I want in the  
world? Why not. Isn't that better than being one of you and just repeating  
words? If that's all I am, if that's as far as I can go, and I don't see why  
not if any of you good people haven't done better yourselves, then why  
shouldn't I?   
And what, you will reply to me again with second hand quotes... because you  
have nothing of your own.   
I'm not at troll. I'm not attacking any of you. I'm just at a horrible point  
in my life and I don't know what to do.

Dear Tradere,   
I understand your views and thoughts, its something which most of us face as a  
part of evolution if that is what we may want to call it.   
But, if you really stuck to your views, you wouldn't have come here to this  
forum to write your views - Infact you have just done that what you didn't  
want to do.   
The choice is yours. really, a honest opinion of mine would be, find out  
yourself, dabble with what you want to do, explore and find it out all  
yourself.   
To be brutally honest, there is no answer outside of yourself. Find it out all  
by yourself alone.   
By talking, repeating sharing anything to anybody at any place, one is just  
communicating with himself alone and no (Other) body else. There is no Other  
at all.   
Infact, your post is a post to yourself and all responses that come eventually  
are your own.   
These are your own questions and your own answers, views, posts, etc...   
You seem to have hit the nail, just go further and see for yourself what is  
there! there is no answers here or from anybody! Seek the help of the Self  
alone!   
These are my perspective which are yourself's. This post is again your own  
based on your own experiences and interpretations. I am not different from  
you, you are not different from me. I am you, you are I -   
Jump into the abyss and see and check it out for yourself, there are no  
answers anywhere except from your Self alone.   
Nagaraj

please see that your point of view is just a point of view...   
what you said is very insulting, and it hurts to read it, but it is ok..   
the people and the wall is your own projection...you have to see this, it is  
your own wall...   
if you have a depression go to a genuine and good psychotherapist...I also do  
this to aid my spritual praxis...it is not a step back in this sense...if you  
feel that you want to go through this alone, then this is also a good  
experience, maybe you make the therapy later, or never....   
I also faced such a crisis, I was totally in my own sphere, the people all  
seemed dumb, idiots, without the slightest knowledge, total stupidity...I was  
also there for some time, but just for a few month...maybe some sort of  
cleansing of society dirt...

Dear traders,   
I do not want anything than what is posted by matthias,   
and Nagaraj. If you love others, you are giving love to   
you, if you dislike others, you are giving dislike to you.   
There is no one other than You. "In the end, there will   
be time, when everything looks alike." Not a quote from   
Bhagavan Ramana but by T.S. Eliot!   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi tradere, its a fact that everyone in life is on a diffrent Spiritual path  
and by that I mean yearning for God, Self-enquiry, etc. In some the intensity  
is small in others is is large. Most people are not interested in a spiritual  
path, that makes them no lesser a person and so the majority of people you  
interact with are not that interested in things spiritual. Most of them are  
good, honest and decent people who would be more than happy to converse about  
most things. It is needed for a sense of wellbeing.Thats where you need to  
start.   
Most people on this forum are trying to practise Self-enquiry, what is wrong  
when we are not practsing it, talking about it and sharing expeiences.   
Have you read Who Am I ? (Nan Yar).   
Have you asked God for help.   
Another point to note is that spiritual success is in the hands of God. Just  
because there is no apparent improvement doesn't mean its failure. There's  
lots of stories about the length of time it takes, others may wish to  
elaborate.   
Philip Chirgwin told me to look at the sky. Why don't you go and have a look  
at it.   
Paul

Thank you for the replies. What Nagaraj in particular said resonated with me.   
There is no harm in discussing or talking. We all have to pass the time  
somehow. But you understand also how those people who are beyond discussing  
have stabilized further in what needs to happen. Many of you replied and said  
things that might have been right, but is it an actual fact for any of you?  
Do you actually see yourselves as not different from others? You may have the  
idea, but I sincerely doubt you have the experience. To speak about what one  
has seen directly is such a beautiful thing. Second hand conversation is just  
repetition without understanding. It may be of some value but it is limited.

We are not talking, it is Bhagavan Ramana who is with us and he is talking in  
this forum by using our bodies.   
Quote from: tradere on June 15, 2009, 03:43:54 AM  
But we are all just talking and repeating what we know...   
You say we are talking and repeating what we know?   
I guess you know that scientist in Geneva are still trying to understand how  
the universe begin and evolved, spending billions of dollars and scientist all  
around the world are taking part in that experiment, but still Physics is  
incomplete, their cannot still find a unified theory that could explain  
everything. Have you read Prof. Stephen Hawking book 'Theory of Everything'   
On the other side, spiritually speaking, In the book Spiritual stories as  
told by Bhagavan Ramana, in one of the stories, the sons of Brahma(hindu  
creator god) wanted to know answers for everything and they tried seeking it,  
Siva as Daskina Moorthy who appeared as sage and began answering their  
questions, then siva as Dashkina Moorthy realised that if he keeps on  
answering their questions this will not stop, he(siva) become silence, then  
only the sons of Brahma realsied their ultimate answer for all their  
questions. Silence, remain silence is also told by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Even if Bhagavan Ramana knows everything, he remains silence.   
What we are talking is only limited knowledge that is given to us by the Lord,  
No one knows everything and not one knows nothing.   
Quote from: tradere on June 15, 2009, 03:43:54 AM  
If even one of you gained deep clarity, what a benefit that would be...   
Certainly nothing will we get from this forum, only if we apply it in our  
lives practically then we will come to know about that knowledge.

OK, i presume that you are a christian, do a in depth research on the lives on  
Saints, belief and miracles by Christ, ask yourself why is Christianity still  
exist today.

Realizating the self, yes.

You say we didn't find, find out what, what do you what to find, are the still  
21st century Paul Brunton who wants to find a true yogi, a true master,  
he(20th century Paul Brunton) found one, have you? Read Paul Brunton's 'A

Why even my life is the same, i ruined my life, i failed to realizes and  
accept the truth, I failed to worship what has to worshiped. Now I'm  
worshiping what has to be worshiped and not repeat the same mistake in this

I repeat, its the same here too, but there is God, when the path is changed

Dear amiatall,   
Talking with another, even if he has not experinced, helps.   
Talking with an experienced Jnani helps a great deal. The   
first could be a disciple-disciple relationship and the second   
is guru-disciple relationship. During Bhagavan's time, apart   
from Bhagavan Himself, various devotees were talking to   
each other and got benefited in someway or other. I had   
been to Tiruvannamalai for four days from 30th June 2009   
to today, 3rd July 2009 and had some mind blowing experiences when I talked to  
Brahmasri Nochur Venkatraman. More details about him, please wait. He is  
just 30, married and has got a 2 year old boy. My talking with him for about  
30 minutes, brought the world upside down! Similarly I had talks with simple  
people like you and me, who come to Tiruvannamalai and spend 4 days by  
talking to each other and then sitting before Bhagavan's   
Samadhi silently! If one has to wait for a realized Jnani to teach you, you  
won't get him quite easily. Bogus Jnanis abound in this world of today. The  
disciple-disciple talk helps, because they are of different grades and a  
"higher grade disciple" can always help a "lower grade disciple" and even VICE  
VERSA ! This vice versa, I knew in Tiruvannamlai and it blew my ego into  
millions of atoms. The gentleman is an insider in the Asramam, doing a lot  
of odd jobs. Whenever he is free, he sits in the Samadhi Hall. He talks a  
few words to others, when one sits next to him. He explained to me what is  
total surrender like nobody in this Forum. He has thoroughly read Aksharamana  
Malai and he gave new layers of meanings, for each line. He says that one  
song wa was enough for him. He did not read any other books of Bhagavan in  
detail. He appears like a small spark but he can blow your entire stack of  
haystack in conflagration. More about him later. He says total surrender is  
enough for him   
and there is no need to bother about self enquiry. Bhagavan   
Himself has said that they are two sides of the same coin.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear tradere,   
Suppose i see a flower, a rose, say. The flower is beautiful. So when i see  
you, as a friend, i want to share the beauty of the flower with you. But you  
do not know the flower. So how do i introduce you to the flower ?   
I will have to show you the flower. .. Right? That is the only way that it is  
possible.   
Now, the "second hand quotes" are like telling "Rose is beautiful". . If you  
have not seen it, its a waste! coz whether or not the rose is beautiful. .. u  
cannot appreciate it! After some time you find it really disgusting, coz i am  
repeating the same thing and it makes no sense!   
Ok, so then, we agree we need to share the vision... i say, ok, come with me  
ill show you the rose. .. and i take you... as i walk... suddenly you turn  
away... surprised, i question you! and you say "Sir, this cannot be the way to  
roses!". Why? Coz in my school so and so person said this. ... now that is  
the first problem. you need to agree to allow me to show.   
So if these criteria are satisfied we can journey into it! and we can share a  
vision.   
Love!

Great analogy. Except, you have not seen the flower. You have heard the  
words of someone who has seen the flower. Rather than do whatever is  
necessary to see the flower, you talk about seeing flowers. Thus the obvious  
hypocrisy. I'm a hypocrite too, but I see it. Why don't you?

Dear tradere,   
How do u say that?   
**" Rather than do whatever is necessary to see the flower, you talk about  
seeing flowers"**   
And when i offered to show the flower to you. ..   
why did you not follow this advice of yours?   
Please see. .. if you think a realized person cannot be writing in here or  
that a realized person should be in himalayas or some such place. .. eating  
nothing etc. ..   
if you have some such ideas, its was totally futile to write here. u should  
have gone to the jungles or himalayas and sought.   
now suppose you thought there could be someone here. .. may be you have met  
one ! or may be not...   
We can brand ourselves. .. we can label ourselves as hypocrites, intelligent

Dear tradere,   
Seeing a flower, not seeing a flower, seeing a flower through   
someone else or the Guru: "Who is this man? Is it not our   
ego, to find these words and elaborate on these?"   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was sitting on the Hall. Devaraja Mudaliar   
asked Him: "Bhagavan! You are telling Grace is ever flowing. How   
is that I am not able to receive the Grace? Is it not flowing to me?"   
Bhagavan Ramana smiled and then said in Tamil: "Oye! Who is   
coming in between you and the guru's grace? You please keep away   
and the Grace will flow to you!" The first "you" is the ego of the   
devotee and the second "you" is the individual devotee. For all of us, mind  
jumps out earlier than the Heart!   
Arunachala Siva.

Infact many people went to Ramana himself but returned without Realization.  
Many people lived so close to Ramana and yet involved in politics etc.   
Ramana could have given any of them silent diksha [silently reveal the Self]  
... but they were not seeing. ..   
Ramana sat there silent and ever Blissful. .. and yet they were not looking at  
him.   
its like the story of two birds illustrated in the vedanta. .. Ramana was  
seated. .. people jumped from one fruit to another. .. everytime they found a  
fruit that is bitter, they looked at Ramana, went to him and stayed there for  
some time. .. and again they would move out to seek some fruit or the other  
fruit!   
Love!   
Silence

Dear amiatall,   
All of us are Self Realized. What we have not been realizing   
is the fact that clouds of ignorance, Ajnana [anger, lust, hypocrisy,   
hate verbal duels to prove a point ec.,], are hiding the ever shining   
Self or the Brahman. The Forum may, perhaps, help a few serious   
seekers to have the clouds of ignorance removed. It is like removing   
the smoke by rubbing with a cloth of a glass cover of the chimney. Then the  
chimney is pure without hiding the Light within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. The chimney is full of, say one ton of smoke that it might   
take several births to complete the polishing work, since our   
polishing work is done through a small cloth which is also full   
of smoke!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Small cloth - I meant the mind/ego. It is small because it   
is almost nothing, as Bhagavan Ramana said on another occasion.   
The mind in insubstantial.   
Yes. The mind is the policman and the thief. The policman and   
the thief example was told by Bhagavan Ramana to highlight   
the fact, that the mind cannot comprehend the Self. Because   
the Self is beyond thinking, because ratiocination, beyond books,   
and it is comprehended by anubhava, or experience. The Self   
is Experience. All that are mental products, books, logic, thoughts   
are outside. After a deep sleep, one gets up in the morning   
and says: "I had a good sleep." No one says during the sleep that   
he slept well! All descriptions of the Self in the books are all   
thoughts. All the books are all the spitted saliva of the experiencer!   
Now how the mind can enquire the mind? There is no other go.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Ashatakam Verse 5: With the mind that is stone, the Ruby has to be discovered,   
by rubbing against the mind, another stone! The mind becomes   
the Self! The stone becomes the Ruby!   
The question of polisher and the polished comes with this   
mind grinding the mind. There is really only one. The mind, the polisher  
becomes the polished, the Ruby.   
Now we know the flame in the chimney. We know the cloth. Then what/where is  
the soot or smoke? The Self is blemishless, taintless. But the Self is  
covered by the vasanas [the latent tendencies of good and bad] coming through  
several births, which are mind products. Only this soot or the smoke has to  
be polished. For that one has to use   
the mind. Again mind rubbing the mind to find it as Ruby.   
Mani Kadainthu ena manam manam ennum kallil maru ara   
kadaiya nin arul oli mevum..... A. Ashtaakam., Verse 5.   
Arunachala Siva.
