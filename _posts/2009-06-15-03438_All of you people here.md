## Krishna is black  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 14, 2009, 02:13:54 PM  
---  
There is a Marathi song, which reads as follows: Krishna asked his mother Yasoda: "Amma, why I am black   
and Radha is red?'   
Yasoda answered: "O my child, Radha was born during   
daytime but you were born in midnight, so you are black."   
Krishana pursued: "Amma, but the calf at our house was   
born at midnight, but it is spotlessly white. How come?"   
Yasoda said: " But its mother is black, don't you see? There   
will be some exceptions."   
Krishna did not leave the matter: "How come the cow eats   
green grass but gives white milk. I eat white butter but   
I am still black!"   
Yasoda has no answer. The Child is father of the man!   
[Krishna or Narayana and Uma are black or euphemistically   
green in colour. One Azhwar sings: O the Black Ruby! Uma   
is also called Syamala, meaning green. They are siblings.   
Siva and Saraswati are siblings. They are milky white in   
complexion. Brahma and Lakshmi (Radha) are red in   
complexion.]

## Siva Manasa Puja of a different kind - 7  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 14, 2009, 03:37:28 PM  
---  
Mangayarkarasi was the Pandyan King. She was born to   
a Chozha but was given in marriage to Pandyan Nedu Maran.   
Nedu Maran was only a name sake Nedu Maran, Tall Narayana,   
but he was a hunchback. He got somehow attracted to Jainism   
and Jain monks ruled over him. All pujas in Meenakshi Temple   
in Madurai and other temples were stopped. Even though the   
Queen was a pious Saivite, she could not even apply holy ashes   
on her forehead and she is said to have mixed holy ashes in   
the sandal paste and applied it on her breasts. The King's   
minister was an ardent Saivite and the King could not help   
it, because he needed Kulachirayar, the minister. The minister   
wanted to call Jnana Sambandhar to the city so that he would   
do something with the king and the Jainism. He told the queen   
to permit him to send someone to Vedaranyam to see Jnana   
Sambandhar and bring him to Madurai. As soon as the queen   
heard Jnana Sambandar's name [the saint was eight years   
old then![, her breasts oozed mother's milk. Such was her   
motherly love for the child whom she had not seen even once!   
The story goes that Jnana Sambandhar came to Madurai and   
meantime, the king developed acute colic pain and the mantras   
and peacock-feather touching of Jainism only increased the   
colic pain. He agreed to call Jnana Sambandha. The queen   
and the minister rushed to the temple and Jnana Sambandha   
was there and they respectfully invited him to the palace to   
cure the king's colic pain. Jnana Sambandha said that he   
would first see Sundareswara and Meenakshi and then come.   
The queen and the minsiter were waiting in the outer portals   
of the temple. Jnana Sambandha sang: O Siva, I have come   
with your approval and to pay heed to my mother's request.   
Please make my trip success. The queen was thrilled. Jnana   
Sambandha came and with holy ashes, he cured the king's   
colic pain and also straightened his back. As per the challenge, the Jain  
monks volunteered to go to the gallows.   
Sekkizhar says that while Bhagavati was Jnana Sambandhar's   
biological mother and Uma was his spiritual mother, [Uma came with Siva and  
gave breast milk at Seerkazhi when the saint   
was three years old], Mangayarkarasi was the saint's mother   
in all equality with Bhagavati and Uma. The queen considered   
him as his child and after wedding to Pandyan King, that is   
the only Siva Puja she did.   
Arunachala Siva.

I'm not unappreciative of your presence, your posts, or your friendly  
spirit...   
But we are all just talking and repeating what we know...   
If even one of you gained deep clarity, what a benefit that would be...   
But instead, these endless speculations, repetitions, beliefs, assumptions,  
theories...   
And have any of you bothered to find out? Even if through faith, which would  
mean, complete faith... taking it all the way...   
But you don't find out. You just talk...   
This whole pursuit has cost me dearly... my worldly life went from normal and  
enjoyable to one of significant depression and loss of contact with people  
because of an inability to relate...   
I cannot even go up to another human being and really have a conversation  
anymore. They are so blinded by thier minds... it's like talking to the same  
wall, over and over again. They don't care. Not only do they not care, they  
are happily doing everything they can to fortify that wall...   
So what to do? Shall I be brutal and ruthless and get what I want in the  
world? Why not. Isn't that better than being one of you and just repeating  
words? If that's all I am, if that's as far as I can go, and I don't see why  
not if any of you good people haven't done better yourselves, then why  
shouldn't I?   
And what, you will reply to me again with second hand quotes... because you  
have nothing of your own.   
I'm not at troll. I'm not attacking any of you. I'm just at a horrible point  
in my life and I don't know what to do.

Dear Tradere,   
I understand your views and thoughts, its something which most of us face as a  
part of evolution if that is what we may want to call it.   
But, if you really stuck to your views, you wouldn't have come here to this  
forum to write your views - Infact you have just done that what you didn't  
want to do.   
The choice is yours. really, a honest opinion of mine would be, find out  
yourself, dabble with what you want to do, explore and find it out all  
yourself.   
To be brutally honest, there is no answer outside of yourself. Find it out all  
by yourself alone.   
By talking, repeating sharing anything to anybody at any place, one is just  
communicating with himself alone and no (Other) body else. There is no Other  
at all.   
Infact, your post is a post to yourself and all responses that come eventually  
are your own.   
These are your own questions and your own answers, views, posts, etc...   
You seem to have hit the nail, just go further and see for yourself what is  
there! there is no answers here or from anybody! Seek the help of the Self  
alone!   
These are my perspective which are yourself's. This post is again your own  
based on your own experiences and interpretations. I am not different from  
you, you are not different from me. I am you, you are I -   
Jump into the abyss and see and check it out for yourself, there are no  
answers anywhere except from your Self alone.   
Nagaraj

please see that your point of view is just a point of view...   
what you said is very insulting, and it hurts to read it, but it is ok..   
the people and the wall is your own projection...you have to see this, it is  
your own wall...   
if you have a depression go to a genuine and good psychotherapist...I also do  
this to aid my spritual praxis...it is not a step back in this sense...if you  
feel that you want to go through this alone, then this is also a good  
experience, maybe you make the therapy later, or never....   
I also faced such a crisis, I was totally in my own sphere, the people all  
seemed dumb, idiots, without the slightest knowledge, total stupidity...I was  
also there for some time, but just for a few month...maybe some sort of  
cleansing of society dirt...

Dear traders,   
I do not want anything than what is posted by matthias,   
and Nagaraj. If you love others, you are giving love to   
you, if you dislike others, you are giving dislike to you.   
There is no one other than You. "In the end, there will   
be time, when everything looks alike." Not a quote from   
Bhagavan Ramana but by T.S. Eliot!   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi tradere, its a fact that everyone in life is on a diffrent Spiritual path  
and by that I mean yearning for God, Self-enquiry, etc. In some the intensity  
is small in others is is large. Most people are not interested in a spiritual  
path, that makes them no lesser a person and so the majority of people you  
interact with are not that interested in things spiritual. Most of them are  
good, honest and decent people who would be more than happy to converse about  
most things. It is needed for a sense of wellbeing.Thats where you need to  
start.   
Most people on this forum are trying to practise Self-enquiry, what is wrong  
when we are not practsing it, talking about it and sharing expeiences.   
Have you read Who Am I ? (Nan Yar).   
Have you asked God for help.   
Another point to note is that spiritual success is in the hands of God. Just  
because there is no apparent improvement doesn't mean its failure. There's  
lots of stories about the length of time it takes, others may wish to  
elaborate.   
Philip Chirgwin told me to look at the sky. Why don't you go and have a look  
at it.   
Paul

Thank you for the replies. What Nagaraj in particular said resonated with me.   
There is no harm in discussing or talking. We all have to pass the time  
somehow. But you understand also how those people who are beyond discussing  
have stabilized further in what needs to happen. Many of you replied and said  
things that might have been right, but is it an actual fact for any of you?  
Do you actually see yourselves as not different from others? You may have the  
idea, but I sincerely doubt you have the experience. To speak about what one  
has seen directly is such a beautiful thing. Second hand conversation is just  
repetition without understanding. It may be of some value but it is limited.

We are not talking, it is Bhagavan Ramana who is with us and he is talking in  
this forum by using our bodies.   
Quote from: tradere on June 15, 2009, 03:43:54 AM  
But we are all just talking and repeating what we know...   
You say we are talking and repeating what we know?   
I guess you know that scientist in Geneva are still trying to understand how  
the universe begin and evolved, spending billions of dollars and scientist all  
around the world are taking part in that experiment, but still Physics is  
incomplete, their cannot still find a unified theory that could explain  
everything. Have you read Prof. Stephen Hawking book 'Theory of Everything'   
On the other side, spiritually speaking, In the book Spiritual stories as  
told by Bhagavan Ramana, in one of the stories, the sons of Brahma(hindu  
creator god) wanted to know answers for everything and they tried seeking it,  
Siva as Daskina Moorthy who appeared as sage and began answering their  
questions, then siva as Dashkina Moorthy realised that if he keeps on  
answering their questions this will not stop, he(siva) become silence, then  
only the sons of Brahma realsied their ultimate answer for all their  
questions. Silence, remain silence is also told by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Even if Bhagavan Ramana knows everything, he remains silence.   
What we are talking is only limited knowledge that is given to us by the Lord,  
No one knows everything and not one knows nothing.   
Quote from: tradere on June 15, 2009, 03:43:54 AM

Certainly nothing will we get from this forum, only if we apply it in our  
lives practically then we will come to know about that knowledge.

OK, i presume that you are a christian, do a in depth research on the lives on

Dear amiatall,   
Talking with another, even if he has not experinced, helps.   
Talking with an experienced Jnani helps a great deal. The   
first could be a disciple-disciple relationship and the second   
is guru-disciple relationship. During Bhagavan's time, apart   
from Bhagavan Himself, various devotees were talking to   
each other and got benefited in someway or other. I had   
been to Tiruvannamalai for four days from 30th June 2009   
to today, 3rd July 2009 and had some mind blowing experiences when I talked to  
Brahmasri Nochur Venkatraman. More details about him, please wait. He is  
just 30, married and has got a 2 year old boy. My talking with him for about  
30 minutes, brought the world upside down! Similarly I had talks with simple  
people like you and me, who come to Tiruvannamalai and spend 4 days by  
talking to each other and then sitting before Bhagavan's   
Samadhi silently! If one has to wait for a realized Jnani to teach you, you  
won't get him quite easily. Bogus Jnanis abound in this world of today. The  
disciple-disciple talk helps, because they are of different grades and a  
"higher grade disciple" can always help a "lower grade disciple" and even VICE  
VERSA ! This vice versa, I knew in Tiruvannamlai and it blew my ego into  
millions of atoms. The gentleman is an insider in the Asramam, doing a lot  
of odd jobs. Whenever he is free, he sits in the Samadhi Hall. He talks a  
few words to others, when one sits next to him. He explained to me what is  
total surrender like nobody in this Forum. He has thoroughly read Aksharamana  
Malai and he gave new layers of meanings, for each line. He says that one  
song wa was enough for him. He did not read any other books of Bhagavan in  
detail. He appears like a small spark but he can blow your entire stack of  
haystack in conflagration. More about him later. He says total surrender is  
enough for him   
and there is no need to bother about self enquiry. Bhagavan   
Himself has said that they are two sides of the same coin.   
Arunachala Siva.
