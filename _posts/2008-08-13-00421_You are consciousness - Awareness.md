Dear Friends,   
 I heard and read some works by Swami Suddhananda : www.selfknowledge.in   
There is an ashram somewhere near the Arunachala Giri. Probably someone might  
be interested in visiting the ashram.   
to me he appears to have realized. Please dont miss a chance to meet him if  
you get one   
Love!

## TAT TVAM ASI You are consciousness / Awareness

Hi Friends,   
 A friend asked me about thoughts and consciousness and who am i, i explained to him what the scriptures state as follows: [Please see if it is useful]   
1) Thoughts are not bad. Mind is a beautiful instrument with out which this  
discussion would be totally futile. Now, problem is only when a thought  
happens and we unconsciously follow them without choice. Here, the problem is  
not the thought but our being unaware !   
2) So if we proceed down from body mind consciousness, these are all  
present. We can see these. The body is there when dead, brain is there : so  
hardware of the body is there but consciousness is not there in the body  
and brain. Since there is no consciousness in the body, it is a dead body.  
Since there is no consciousness in brain, there are no thoughts and hence no  
mind.   
So consciousness or life is the "alive" entity in this body.   
3) You are the consciousness. How ? let us see.   
awake, dream and deep sleep are three states of mind. you are living through  
all these three states. For example when in deep sleep, there is very little  
consciousness expressing through mind: but consciousness is still there. when  
awake and when in dream consciousness is obviously there.   
So in all three states the only live entity that exists is "consciousness"   
not only this, it is also the ultimate subject of all experiences coz a  
dead entity cannot experience ! The body, the brain are jada padartha jada  
means unmoving, unintelligent, lifeless entities.   
3a) Why can i not be body-mind-consciousness complex ?   
No. Coz body and brain are present even when dead. In the absence of   
consciousness, they become just jada lifeless entities, like a piece of  
log.   
3b) But i am unconscious in deep sleep.   
That means brain is not expressing consciousness. But consciousness is   
there. otherwise, when someone calls out, you would not respond.   
3c) May be consciousness is only a function of brain   
Not so, as consciousness is not "local" to brain. When an insect bites me on   
my hand, consciousness should be present there to carry the message to   
brain.   
3d) So, Consciousness is just the electric signals in the body.   
No. Coz an electric signal is also "jada", "life-less".   
3e) If the brain is hit with a rod, where is your consciousness?   
When brain is hit with a rod, the brain becomes in-capable of expressing   
consciousness just as when the filament of a bulb is disconnected, it is the  
bulb   
that becoems in capable of functioning -- electricity is unchanged.   
3f) So is not consciousness local to the body ?   
No. Suppose i ask a question "Is time local to body", its a wrong question coz   
time is a separate dimention independent of space. so we cannot say, here   
time is there and here it is not there. So too, consciousness being life, a   
separate entity when compared to body which is dead, is independent of the   
dead entities and hence is independent of space.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Thoughts are not bad, when these come   
from Pure Mind. It is the Pure Mind with which jnanis   
work. Again, Brain is a part of consciousness and not   
vice versa.

When self-consciousness is mixed with adjuncts a compound consciousness is  
formed which imagines itself to be the self-consciousness and body at the same  
time and it is conscious of itself as a set of adjuncts and it is basically an  
object knowing consciousness.   
Till we disidentify ourselves from the adjuncts existentially we have no  
direct experience that we are unadulterated pure conscious beings.   
Mere theoretical understanding that we are pure conscious beings takes us no  
where.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, I agree that theoretical understanding   
and imagining of the Self, will not help. But when I mentioned   
Pure Mind or Suddha Manas, which Jnanis have, is a different   
thing. It does not adulternate the consciousness of the Self.   
Brahma Jnanis, who are in Sahaja Nishta, like Bhagavan Sri   
Ramana Maharshi, used this for all their 'activity' when they   
were in the body.   
Arunachala Siva.
