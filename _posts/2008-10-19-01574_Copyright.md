Dear members,   
Please be careful when you post material from other sources, breaching  
copyright can lead to legal problems for this site.   
International Law generally permits quotes from copyright works as long as the  
post contains credit to the original source (many books/works do not even  
permit this in their copyright statement).   
You are NOT permitted to quote entire books/works or large portions from  
copyright material without permission in writing from the copyright holder.   
You can quite legally upload your own translation of original works, but not  
the original work itself unless the author has been dead or it has been out of  
print for more than 60 years.   
If you have uploaded copyright material then please remove it.   
Graham

Dear Graham,   
I had two days' powercut and low voltage problems in the city   
and I opened the Forum only today after 17th instant.   
Your message. I do not know whether Sri Ramanasramam's   
publications in Tamil and English are under copy rights. I request   
a reply from you so that I can proceed, if permitted, the Guru   
Ramana Vachana Mala. Till your reply, I am not writing anything   
from that book or any other Ramansramam book.   
Thanking you,   
Yours truly,   
Subramanian. R

My dear Graham, My e mail address is: XXXXXX.   
But, Sir, I had a different problem for the past 15 days. My

it became alright. I case I have not received your e mail, I shall send   
you a communication. Thanking you,   
Yours truly,
