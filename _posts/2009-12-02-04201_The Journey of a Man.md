He descends. Bit by bit.   
The fog has been around for some time. But slowly it is clearing. He sees  
the ground some times, in patches. What did he see ? And then the fog closes  
around him again and he can forget about it for a while. .. but something is  
nagging at him. .. he saw something ! There was something there ! It seemed  
important. .. what was it I saw ?   
As I progress on the journey books that I didn't understand before now make  
sense, somehow I have learnt the language of this book and it means something  
to me now, drawing me forward.   
Other men on this journey have written about their journey. They have written  
what they see from where they are standing, and their writings are bridges to  
walk across showing us the road home.   
I discard. Jettison. Bit by bit, I discard everything. I have come far  
enough down this road to guess what the end of the road looks like.   
It looks like Arunachala.

Dear rideover,   
Yes. When it is cloudy, we all say that Sun is hidden. No. The   
clouds can never hide the sun, which is 8 light minutes away.   
It is only our eyes that are hidden by the clouds. The journey   
is no doubt, quite tough. It is like ascending the summit of   
Arunachala, straight in a vertical climbing.   
Arunachala Siva.
