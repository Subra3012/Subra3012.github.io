Ramanaashram.

Dear Atmavichar,   
The Times of India article is only comparing idlis with what people eat in  
other regions of India. Travelling through Rajasthan and Gujarat, I found  
people eating jelabis for breakfast with their chai!!!! Definitely idlis  
would be a healthier substitute.   
So much rice can never be good. On a recent trip to India, I found ragi idlis  
and oats idli mix. I think it was MTR company that has brought it out. So I  
bought them and made them upon my return home. They were so tasty. Besides,  
one packet can feed an entire family of big eaters.   
I remember a time growing up in India, idlis were made occasionally. We just  
had brunch around 10-11 a.m. after morning hatha yoga, chanting and  
meditation. My grandparents lived well past 90 years and so did my dad -  
although he loved idlis. So this "must eat breakfast" is something being  
promoted by breakfast cereal companies in the west to boost their sales and  
Indians are picking it up. Just my opinion! So don't all pounce on me :-)

even bhagavan failed in sustaining health though he never cared for the same.   
Personally i believe imitation strategy does not work.   
So we need to look into our family and then take a wise decision with regards  
to health.   
Yoga,mediation and eating less oils,salt,sugar are very much required.   
Remember these days medical expenses are scary..   
Ofcourse my suggestions mainly are applicable to married people where we have  
some responsibility.

The essence of the above article is given above in the Highlighted text.   
 **Plus we must note the following :**   
1) Skipping of breakfast is not good for health.   
2) Eating excess of any good breakfast be it Idly, Sambar etc is also not good  
in morning.   
One Doctor told on TV couple of years back that Idly,chutney is the good  
breakfast but for that matter do not eat 10 Idlis and do not eat Idllis  
floating in a bowl of sambar ( as served in some famous Hotels in Chennai )  
and do not eat Idlis fully soaked in Oil + Chilly powder. **He told Idlis  
taken with mint chutney is more than enough and take not more than 2 Idlis in  
the morning.
