**II (At the Twentieth Century Club of Boston, U. S. A.)   
Volume 5,Questions and Answers  
Q.What is the peculiarity of the Vedas?   
A.One peculiarity of the Vedas is that they are the only scriptures that  
again and again declare that you must go beyond them. The Vedas say that they  
were written just for the child mind; and when you have grown, you must go  
beyond them.   
Q.Do you hold the individual soul to be eternally real?   
A. **The individual soul consists of a man 's thoughts, and they are changing  
every moment. Therefore, it cannot be eternally real.** It is real only in the  
phenomenal. The individual consists of memory and thought, how can that be  
real?   
Q.Why did Buddhism as a religion decline in India?   
A.Buddhism did not really decline in India; it was only a gigantic social  
movement. Before Buddha great numbers of animals were killed for sacrifice and  
other reasons, and people drank wine and ate meat in large quantities. Since  
Buddha's teaching drunkenness has almost disappeared, and the killing of  
animals has almost gone.

Dear prasanth,   
Bhagavan Ramana has also said that the Jiva is only a mind/ego   
and vasanas.   
Arunachala Siva.
