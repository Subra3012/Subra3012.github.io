Watch your mind with great diligence, for there lies your bondage and also the  
key to freedom.   
By looking tirelessly, I became quite empty and with that emptiness all came  
back to me except the mind. I find I have lost the mind irretrievably.   
...earnestness is the only condition of success.

If you watch carefully you will find that even your daily consciousness is in  
flashes, with gaps intervening all the time. What is in the gaps? What can  
there be but your real being.

Running after saints is merely another game to play. Remember yourself instead  
and watch your daily life relentlessly. Be earnest, and you shall not fail to  
break the bonds of inattention and imagination.

"Remember yourself instead...."   
In this case I believe Nisargadatta was directing the questioner to give  
attention to thoughts instead of being unconscious of them.

You begin by letting thoughts flow and watching them. The very observation  
slows down the mind till it stops altogether. Once the mind is quiet, keep it  
quiet. Don't get bored with peace, be in it, go deeper into it. The state of  
freedom from all thoughts will happen suddenly and by the bliss of it you  
shall recognise it.
