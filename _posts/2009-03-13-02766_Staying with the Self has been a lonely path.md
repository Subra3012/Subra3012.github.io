## Staying with the Self has been a lonely path

The Self is always present of course, but as my mind is active the veil is  
often present.   
In my pursuit of increasing my conviction of the teachings of Ramana I have  
been increasingly alienated from the people I commonly encounter. I live in  
Canada. It seems that the things most people love are the things that I am  
not interested in, and the the things that I am interested in are the things  
that most people want to avoid.   
It's been very hard to meet people, or maintain friendships/relationships.   
Even the Buddhist/spiritual people I've met locally seem to be just as  
confused and not interested in the kind of spirituality that Ramana talked  
about as the average person I encounter. In fact, I've often found the  
spiritual people I've met to be even more self-deceived and distorted.   
So maybe this is a call for me to pursue the Self and lessen my desire for  
human contact.   
But the fact is that that desire for human contact is there.   
I'm just venting here. But I'd be curious to hear about other people's  
experience meeting people. It seems to me that a real friend is someone who  
helps you to remove the veil.   
Whoever made this forum, and whoever is hosting/maintaining it, thank you. I  
appreciate it.

Dear Matthew,   
During self enquiry, one often desires to avoid people, not because   
he hates them, but because they do not appreciate your way. This   
alientation and identity crisis take place, in every pursuer. In place   
like India, there are many spiritually oriented people, and you may   
befriend such like minded people. But in places like Canada, there   
are not many such people and it is hard to find them. In Qubec,   
Canada, I know one person but I cannot tell you his name and address, since he  
himself does not want many people to know him.   
Anyway, this is the way of self enquiry, and the Self is all alone, since  
there is nothing other than the Self. But once you reach the goal, then   
all people around you will become interesting to you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthew,   
I have gone through and still going through a similar crises or rice pounding  
as   
we may like to call it! Yes the points you mentioned are so very true. Even I   
find it very difficult to keep in touch with people, material pursuits die,   
people find me serious, some well wishers concerns bewilder me. Have I gone   
crazy? or am I to see this difference positively? is it an advancement or is  
it a reverse?   
The BIG FACT I have come to understand is that there is no help outside! I  
have   
to unearth whatever it is all by myself, and nobody is going to confer a boon,   
etc... You get a boon when you are ready!   
I have also come to understand that there is no-other at all! everything is in   
our mind alone. there are no other persons at all. I am only in your mind. you   
are only in my mind! this way I am you, you am I   
You mentioned: In my pursuit of increasing my conviction of the teachings of Ramana I have  
been   
increasingly alienated from the people I commonly encounter. I live in  
Canada.   
The thought that you are alienated from people is within you and the people  
who   
you feel alienated you is also you (within you)! The images, the opinions of  
so called   
other people are simply within us. SO they are all you alone   
We are all nothing but thoughts. Thoughts = 'You' or 'I'   
When you say: It seems that the things most people love are the things that I am   
not interested in, and the the things that I am interested in are the things  
that most people   
want to avoid.   
the things people love is also you and the thing you are interested is also  
you.   
How do 'I' know the things other people love? its your own 'my' thought!   
and how do 'I' know what most people want to avoid? its again your own   
'my' thought!   
There is no other at all! It all only you! The one against you and for you is   
only you!   
When you say: Even the Buddhist/spiritual people I've met locally seem to be just   
as confused and not interested in the kind of spirituality that Ramana talked  
about as the   
average person I encounter. In fact, I've often found the spiritual people  
I've   
met to be even more self-deceived and distorted.   
Those Buddhist/ spiritual people are also you alone. They seem confused to you   
because, there is a confusion within, for there is no outside at all! The  
opinion   
that they themselves are confused is yours alone.   
Suppose I say something to you and you read it. you understand it based on  
your   
own thoughts, accumulated knowledge over last thousands of years. Its your own   
thoughts that interpret whatever you gather.   
Now note this: My reply to your post here is a reply to the your own (my) question.   
and when you read my response   
Its your own response to your own (my) response   
I am not there at all. I am in you, and for me you are not there at all, You  
am in I   
What you mention is true, desire for human contact is there. Let it be. Why do  
you want to get away from human contact?   
Dear Matthew   
I feel you would immensely benefit by reading one of our previous topics  
discussed here in this forum   
Arunachala Ramana > Ramana Maharshi > The teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi > Why do i not realize the Truth ?   
The best way to describe it is like this: 'I' am the biggest problem to myself. Ramana says find out this 'I' and you  
will find that this 'I' is actually non existent!

Many people can neither live with the other nor can they live without the  
other.   
When they live with someone else their presence disturbs.When one is alone one  
wants company of   
the other.This is my general observation of the people at large.

So maybe this is a call for me to pursue the Self and lessen my desire for  
human contact.   
But the fact is that that desire for human contact is there.   
Of course, it is a lonely path....   
But it also teaches us to be one with others.   
There is a negative about "loneliness", but "aloneness" in the centre of which  
is "oneness" feels positive.   
In loneliness we wither...whereas we can thrive and bloom when we are one with  
others....even when we are alone....   
Of course, whatever we "feel" is an emotion or a thought identified with "i".  
When there is no "i" is there no feeling or emotion about anything??? Since i  
have not attained such a state, i dunno!

Spiritual life is profound.   
Only in spiritual life can one discover true bliss and peace.   
In worldly life, peace is often felt only during absence of disturbance,   
and bliss only when a sorrow ends.   
In spiritual life these can be felt in absolute sense and life seems to get   
fulfilled to the very core.   
During spiritual journey it is but natural that worldly friends gradually  
recede to the   
background and one develops closeness with spiritually-oriented persons.   
It is best to leave things to God.   
God will send the right friend when one needs one.   
Om. .

Hi Matthew   
There is only my wife who knows of my spiritual quest, she is not on the same  
spiritual path as me nor me as her. It makes no difference to either of us.  
You cant force any of it onto anyone. To other people I keep quiet about it.   
When Im out walking the dog I think about and try to practise Self enquiry  
but if I meet someone I know who is walking their dog, a conversation is  
struck about the weather, their dog or something happening in the area for  
example. Thats life, most of the time social interactions are like that. I  
would be surprised if I to find some like minded person socially. And it does  
help though by engaging in those types of social interactions for a sense of  
well being. And there will be another time when Self Enquiry can be practiced  
again.   
You have said yourself that a desire for human contact is there. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Don't try to get too much out of it. I hope this is  
helpful.   
Regards.   
Paul

Thank you all for the sincere replies and for reminding me what I am.   
I understand (intellectually and maybe more) the notions of wholeness, non-  
duality, etc.. .. and I understand that all the concerns I raised are really  
only in the mind and could not rise if I was more stabilized in the Self/less  
dominated by mind. I spoke the way I did for the sake of simplicity and  
convenience.   
It's nice to know that others can relate to or understand what I am  
describing.
