## Bhagavan, Manickavachagar and Thiruvachakam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 11, 2008, 02:39:38 PM  
---  
Manickavachagar is a great Saivite saint, who wrote two groups of   
poems called Thiruvachakam and Thirukkovaiyar. The first one is   
again a collection of 51 subgroups of poems, about his life and his   
Siva-experience. Bhagavan liked this work very much and it was one   
His faourite works. He used to refer to this often in His talks and   
conversations. Bhagavan has said that Thiruvachakam has to be   
experienced and one should not try to understand this thorugh   
intellectual knowledge. I am reading Thiruvachakam since 1990.   
I had a practice of reading one sub-group per day. I went through   
David Godman's website www.davidgodman.org. today and was   
delighted to find an extensive article on the above topic, narrating   
Bhagavan's various talks which covered Thiruvachakam. Muruganar's   
Ramana Sannidhi Murai and Guruvachaka Kovai, are patterned on   
the above two groups of poems by Manickavachakar. David has also   
given a translation of Siva Puranam, the first poem of Thiruvchakam,   
after the translation of Ramana Puranam of Muruganar. I want this   
website to be seen by the members and also their reaction on   
Thiruvchakam, if some of them had read this book of divine poetry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear mick, You have yourself said that LSD and other such   
drugs will not give realization. Sadhu Om's experience and your   
experience cannot be questioned but you will agree that perhaps   
the drugs make your "way" look somewhat easier, but still the   
goal is not assured. It is like going round the Arunachala Hill,   
by car, instead of by foot. The Goal can be attained only when   
Goal wants you to attain it. Is it not? As T.S. Eliot put it: "There is a  
time, there is a time, when everything looks alike... After such   
knowledge, what forgiveness?" Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R   
I agree with you. However when we go somewhere it is helpful to have  
signposts to show us the way. Without those LSD experiences I would not have  
known that Samadhi was possible. Or that some of my troubles were Kundalini  
related.   
It isn't a quetion of making it easier, it's a question of belief. There is  
the Yoga idea of 3 types of knowledge The first type is, ,,, There is a flame  
there, you stick your finger in it. aaaargh !! it hurts, you know this, no  
one told you. The second type of knowledge is, ,,, Someone says to you, " If  
you sitck your finger in that flame it will hurt you " and you BELIEVE them  
.This is only belief, whether the belief is true or not it's still onle belief  
. The third type of knowledge comes from within.   
Belief causes all sorts of trouble, look at all the fake Gurus and religious  
leaders. Con men tricking people, read a few books and pretend to be a  
realised being. People believe all sorts of crazy things.   
So, maybe some personal experience however breif is worth more than reading  
books and believing people. Beings such as Ramana Maharishi are not exactly on  
every street corner !!!   
Ramana is/was 100% genuine, the real deal. But as he said Western people find  
it harder because they are more outward looking. So being given a doorway to  
your own interior can be very helpful [ to some people ]   
Peace

Dear mick, I can never question your belief. Bhagavan Ramana   
is a different person, when He was in body. He never wore sandals   
in His life. He never wore ochre robes. All His readings and writings   
were after He realized. It is like someone suddenly appearing on the   
top of a hill and then descending to the foothill to tell others His   
experience atop the hill. We are all on the foothills, trying various   
ways, various books, various Gurus, transcedental meditation and   
other types, shifting from one way to another and so on. Eventually,   
if the goal is achieved, the ways are forgotten. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!   
Peace

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the  
infuence of psychedelic drugs.   
 And very strange it is too!   
Definately not to be played with is the occult!!   
Has an astral quality which reminds one of the smell of sulphur!

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

WHOAAA! This discussion has been awesome guys!!! Reading your posts has been  
SO cool, just want to add a thought that was conjured up in my mind   
This is regarding the no non-existence element. I was unable to tell if it  
had been resolved but i agree with the things dedhed was saying here. Non-  
existence is still a form of existence. My understanding of this goes: Consciousness has no form.   
No form = no beginning and no end.   
No beginning and no end = infinite.   
Infinite = **infinite possibility** which includes both finite and non  
infinite possibility and of course both existence and _non-existence_, lol.   
I am sure you guys have probably already contemplated this but just thought i  
would join in.   
NICE ONE

Hiya Neil   
What if there is no such thing as possibility !   
Only actuality.   
What if what IS is all there can be. So the idea of possibilities only exists  
because we don't know everything. If we knew absolutely EVERYTHING then there  
would be no possibilities, only the ALL OF EVERYTHING !!   
If time is not real, if time and space are merely apparent relativities within  
the ALL.   
Then..   
Maybe it's like the relationship between a seed and a tree !   
The seed doesn't cause the tree the seed IS the tree at a different time in  
it's developement.   
This is true if time really PASSES   
,However if the begining and end of time exist SIMULTANEUOSLY in a non  
temporal dimenesion.   
Then we only see the passage of time because of the way our minds function.   
Like, for instance, when we watch a DVD we see the events recorded as a  
sequence of events. But all the events on the DVD exist SIMULTANEOUSLY ! The  
begining and end are ALWAYS there.   
In this metaphor the passage of time is represented by the rotation of the DVD  
disc and the tracking of the information by the Laser.   
The SELF is the whole DVD disc. It has the whole story printed on it all at  
once. This would explain predestination, and the saying that ones destiny is  
on you brow. It would also explain clairvovance, deja vu and a lot of other  
aparently occult phenomena.

Dear Mick Hutchinson and dedhead, I have been reading the   
exchange of views between both of you. I have not read David   
Chalmers. Please tell the full titles of his books and names of   
publishers. Meantime, I remember to have read "The Outsider"   
\- by Colin Wilson, a non-fiction. It does not deal with science but   
with phenomenological problems of existence. Today, I read an   
extract from Moor Nom, in internet with the title, "The Trial of Adi  
Sankara." I read only a small portion sent by my son from Singapore, as   
a part of e mail. I would, on getting the web address of Moor Nam, will   
post it through Forum. Moor Nom says, that all the world communities   
were, in the beginning, work-centric and whenever they raised their   
heads, they was the sun and started praying to the Sun. Worship-   
centric religion and with it, history-centric relgion came much later,   
with pyramids, mounains and rivers and temples. Someone like Buddha   
came later,and made it totally philosphy-oriented. This concept also   
waned in due course and there should be something which could admix   
both philosophy-orientation and history-orientation, and this is what   
Shankara did. When he allowed worship, ( He did not allow anyway,   
worship of dead man's clothes, sandals or teeth), he limited the   
work-centric behaviour to pitru-karma (No birth anniversaries!), and the  
worship to temples and chanting of mantras and slokas and went about  
elaborately to philosophy-centric methods like "Atma Vichara'. I request Mick  
Hutchinson, dedhead and other Forum-members to look into   
David Chalmers and Moor Nom, in juxtaposition and send their views.

I wonder if Ramana was Shankara reincarnated, It would explain Ramana's sudden  
enlightenment. He just allowed himself to be reborn, from compasion. Not from  
the thought" I will return ",but because it was the nature of his love to do  
so.   
Maybe we'll never know.

Dear mick, I saw your two postings. It is only for us, from Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Muni to today's Forum members, that one has to subcribe that   
Bhagavan is an 'avatara' of Shankara. Ramana Gita begins saying   
that "You are the avatara" of Lord Skanda. Ganaputi Muni also says   
that Bhagavan is an "avatara" of Jnana-Sambandha, another 7th   
century Tamil Saivite-poet. The story goes that when Jnana Sambandha   
was a three year old child, and when he was crying on the banks of a tank in  
Sirkali (a famous temple-town in Tamil Nadu), Uma appeared with Siva and gave  
Her breast-milk to the child. The three year child then   
began singing, "Oh Siva, wearing studs on your ears, you came on a bull   
with your consort and stole away my mind..." Kavyakanta gives three   
'mantras' for invoking Bhagavan Ramana:- (1) Om vacat bhuve! (the   
Effulgent), (2) Om Saravana Bhava (the god born on saravana-pond)   
(3) Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya. Kapali Sastri, who has written   
a Sanskrit commentary (which was read out in the presence of Bhagavan   
Ramana and approved by Him) on Ramana Gita, gives meanings and   
descriptions of these three mantras. In the end Bhagavan is neither   
Sankara, nor Jnana Sambanda nor Ramana. He is beyond names and   
forms. But we continue to call Him with several names, till we become   
or be Him. Arunachala Siva.

Dear mick and dedhead, Being Sunday, I was once again reading   
the complete exchange of views between you two right from Jan 2007.   
Ultimately, existence and non-existence seem to me the both sides of   
the same coin. Elders who knew it, perhaps, called it Existence   
Knowledge and Bliss, to sound more positive, because the title, Non-Existence,  
Non-Knowledge and Non-Bliss, will not matter anything to   
Existence, but only to us. Sankara did not object to Buddha calling It,   
as Maha-Sunya, but only said, that, since the Realized Souls exhibit  
absolute compassion (which can arise only out of happiness), Maha-   
Karuna (as even Zen masters say), it is better to call it as EKB. than   
NE-NK-NB. I also believe that till the end of this universe, no intelligent   
being, can discover what is Consciousness, what is its structure, formula,  
chemistry and physics of it, because Consciousness cannot be described   
or explained by anyone from outside, since it is experience not ratio-   
cination. Even under experience, one cannot reach the realms of   
consciousness through psychedelic drugs. I did not try LSD and mescaline but  
tried an Indian drug called Lorazepam. A 4 mg dose of it will give   
8 hours sleep. But I had 20 mg during day time. It did not take me any-   
where, but to sleepless stupor. People living earlier than 20th century   
had tried desi types like cannabin, ganja, "umanthankaai " etc., Why, even  
during Ramana's time, some visitors had used ganja to attain realization  
Bhagavan used to caution them against such practices! Incidentally Appayya  
Dikshitar, a great Sanskrit poet of 18th century, an ardent Shiva devotee,  
asked his disciples to give him a generous dose   
"umanthankaai " and sang 500 Sanskrit songs on Shiva during that   
near-mad state! This poem is called "Unmantha-pancha-sat" meaning   
"500 poems of a madcap". Arunachala Siva.

Hey Nell, "no beginning= no end = infinite". You have rediscovered   
Gaudapada, (Sankara's teacher's teacher)!! He said exactly the   
the same thing in his famous Gaudapada Karika, a Sanskrit verse-   
commentary on Maandukya Upanisad. This is called "no creation=   
no dissolution = Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Incidentally Maandukya   
is the smallest Upanisad with 20 verses and the commentary is of   
about 250 verses. Sankara wrote a more detailed commentary   
on MU and GK. Arunachala Siva.

Dear mick and dedhead, I had also read a lot of J Krishnamurti,   
and attended his December lectures in Madras (now Chennai). A   
news item appeared after his death telling about his relationship   
with Ms. Rosalind Rajagopal, his disciple's wife. After knowing   
that he was "mere prattle without practice", I dumped his books   
in my attic.

Nice talking to you Subramanian.   
One day the truth out, to be known by all, cannabis isn't a psychedelic drug  
,It's better than Alcohol because it makes on more inward looking but it's  
just a drug   
Are you familiar with the writings of Mouni Sadhu ?   
He was a disciple of Sri Ramana. If you read page 346 of his book Meditation  
you will see that he had the same experience looking into Ramana's eyes as he  
had when he later took LSD.   
The world that we seem to see aound us bends the floor waves, so the world  
can't be real because if what we are seeing is the solid reality that it seems  
then it could'nt change shape like that. However true mystical experience is  
rare and heaven and hell are both inner states. My only experience of Samadhi  
was in 1970 on strawberry fields LSD. a rapid and completely ecstatic rising  
of the Kundalini preceded it.   
I later took LSD about 500 times and the experience was never repeated.   
On 3 other occasions I feel that had I surrenedered it would have happened but  
I was overcome by the fear of death.   
Since the 1960s India has had people coming to find Gurus and study Yoga  
because of LSD.   
I must also say that I have had some extremely horrible experiences on LSD  
,but it's a paper tiger and does no harm.   
That was some time ago and I am getting old. I am not advising anyone to take  
it or break the law. But LSD answered all my questions and drew me to Ramana  
Maharishi. It is not for everyone and large doses first time are a very bad  
idea. It must be taken in a quiet place with friends.   
No drug even LSD can give Self Realisation but a temporary experience means  
that you know where to look to find your way back   
One day the truth will out.   
Peace. love and understanding   
M H
