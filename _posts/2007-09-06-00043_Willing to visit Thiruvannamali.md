Namaskar,   
I am planning to visit Shri Ramanaashram by third week of October. Can some  
body guide me about the exact loaction of Ashram int the town, so it will be  
easy for me to get down accordingly. I will be coming from Chennai by bus.  
Also can accommodation be booked for single in advance at Ashram ?

It is very easy to find the ashram - any rickshaw will happily take you, for  
a ride, for too many rupees, when you first arrive! But from the bus station  
it would cost about thirty rupees and even if they ask more it is very little  
in Western money. The final stop for the Chennai bus will be the bus station  
in Tiru.   
You HAVE to book ashram accomodation in advance - 3-6 months for the winter  
season, as it becomes very busy here. If you have not booked try e-mailing  
right away and then see what happens. If they still have rooms you may be  
lucky.   
Good Luck,

Ramanashramam is a serene place where spiritual halo of Sri Ramana is very  
much obvious. Rank materialists get converted into godly beings there.  
Ramana' potent presence simply transforms you.

I had little idea that Ramana presence would still be there as described. But  
it would be wonderful to be there even a few days.

Dear 'kde', I typed your name as 'kide' in some other post and   
I am sorry. Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi's Presence is very much   
there in Sri Ramanasramam and you will experience the Power of His   
Presence, when you go over there. Once you make up your mind, the   
visit to Tiruvannamalai will become a reality, sooner or later, regardless   
of distance, expenses, climate or your other preoccupations. The will and   
faith are are essential. Wish you all the best.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R   
Please do not worry about typing my name wrong, I now feel that I must visit  
but for some reason I'm scared I'm not sure why. Thank you for your post.

A Prayer   
When I left Tiru   
I forgot to take my heart   
which blossomed there.   
I know my heart   
is happy now   
next to the Sacred Hill -   
but how   
about me?   
To be apart   
from such a needful thing -   
uneasy task.   
So may I ask   
the gracious Lord,   
to show me a track,   
for this light-minded dog can bring   
again his heartless body back   
towards his heart   
which he forgot.

Dear Vladimir,   
You are always the Heart!   
Where can you leave it?   
Whee can you take it?   
What you did by going to Tiru   
Was the cleansing of the Heart   
With dirt as old as this earth.   
You are now Pure   
Thanks to that washing machine!   
Arunachala Siva.
