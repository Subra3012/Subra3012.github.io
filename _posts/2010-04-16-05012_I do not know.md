Once, two friends were going along the street when they saw some people  
listening to a reading of the Bhagavata. "Come, friend," said the one to the  
other, "let us hear the sacred book." So saying he went in and sat down. The  
second man peeped in and went away. He entered a house of ill fame.But very  
soon he felt disgusted with the place."Shame on me!" he said to himself. "My  
friend has been listening to the sacred word of Hari and see where I am!" But  
the friend who had been listening to the Bhagavata also became disgusted.  
"What a fool I am!" he said. "I have been listening to this fellow's blah-  
blah, and my friend is having a grand time."   
In course of time they both died. The messenger of death came for the soul of  
one who had listened to the Bhagavata and dragged it off to hell. The  
messenger of God came for the soul of the one who had been to the house of  
prostitution and led it up to heaven.   
 **Verily, the Lord looks into a man 's heart and does not judge him by what  
he does or where he lives.**

A logician once asked Sri Ramakrishna, "What are knowledge, knower, and the  
object known?"   
To which he replied, "Good man, I do not know all these niceties of scholastic  
learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and that I am Her son."

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to explain such things if someone asks   
with ardent interest. Otherwise, He will also keep silent.   
But if someone were to say: "I do not anything.," Bhagavan   
Ramana used to give two types of answers: 1\. He will say: "Find out who says 'I do not know'. Is it the   
Atma? Atma need not know anything. If it is your mind, when   
find out, 'What the mind is? Where is this mind when you are   
in deep sleep?'   
2. For bhaktas, who know only devotion, He would say "Then   
repeat Rama, Rama or Siva, Siva. That is sufficient. You need   
not know anything else."   
Arunachala Siva.

Within the "I do not know" expression is also hidden the "I know" expression: " _I know only my Mother Divine_ "   
That is the beauty of this sentence.
