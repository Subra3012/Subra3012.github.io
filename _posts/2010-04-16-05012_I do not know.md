ONCE Narada besought the Lord of the universe,"Lord, show me that Maya of  
Thine which can make the impossible possible." The Lord nodded assent.  
Subsequently the Lord one day set out on a travel with Narada. After going  
some distance, He felt very thirsty and fatigued. So He sat down and told  
Narada, "Narada, I feel much thirsty; please get me a little water from  
somewhere." Narada at once ran in search of water.   
Finding no water nearby, he went far from the place and saw a river at a great  
distance. When he approached the river, he saw a most charming young lady  
sitting there, and was at once captivated by her beauty. As soon as Narada  
went near her,she began to address him in sweet words, and ere long, both fell  
in love with each other. Narada then married her, and settled down as a  
householder. In course of time he had a number of children by her.And while he  
was thus living happily with his wife and children, there came a pestilence in  
the country. Death began to collect its toll from every place. Then Narada  
proposed to abandon the place and go somewhere else.His wife acceded to it,  
and they both came out of their house leading their children by the hand. But  
no sooner did they come to the bridge to cross the river than there came a  
terrible flood, and in the rush of water, all their children were swept away  
one after another, and at last the wife too was drowned.   
**Overwhelmed with grief at his bereavement, Narada sat down on the bank and  
began to weep piteously. Just then the Lord appeared before him, saying, "O  
Narada,where is the water? And why are you weeping?"   
The sight of the Lord startled the sage, and then he understood everything. He  
exclaimed, "Lord, my obeisance to You, and my obeisance also to Your wonderful  
Maya!"**

A logician once asked Sri Ramakrishna, "What are knowledge, knower, and the  
object known?"   
To which he replied, "Good man, I do not know all these niceties of scholastic  
learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and that I am Her son."

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to explain such things if someone asks   
with ardent interest. Otherwise, He will also keep silent.   
But if someone were to say: "I do not anything.," Bhagavan   
Ramana used to give two types of answers: 1\. He will say: "Find out who says 'I do not know'. Is it the   
Atma? Atma need not know anything. If it is your mind, when   
find out, 'What the mind is? Where is this mind when you are   
in deep sleep?'   
2. For bhaktas, who know only devotion, He would say "Then   
repeat Rama, Rama or Siva, Siva. That is sufficient. You need   
not know anything else."   
Arunachala Siva.

Within the "I do not know" expression is also hidden the "I know" expression: " _I know only my Mother Divine_ "   
That is the beauty of this sentence.
