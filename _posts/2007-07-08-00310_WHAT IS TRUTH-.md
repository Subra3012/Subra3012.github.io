Dear Sankar, Truth is That, in which one merges, in a deep sleep,   
where all the mind's mischief ceases. If you stop all the mind's   
mischief, by killing it, as in dreamless deep sleep, you are the Self, the  
Truth, the One without a second. There, not only the world, even   
your personal god cease to exist. Arunachala Siva.

It is the conscious space which is the base for appearence and disappearence  
of mind and the world.

When there is stilling of thought in waking state what remains in you is  
conscious space.   
For stilling of thought self-enquiry is the bet way.

Dear everyone, stilling of thought is fine. It is called   
mano laya by Bhagavan. But He said that we have to   
go one step further, that is killing of mind, the villain   
of the piece. It is called mano nasa. Most of us are   
in the first step only, and this too, not all the time!   
Arunchala Siva.

Destruction of sankalpa(volition)and vikalpa(doubt) is called  
manonasa(destruction of mind).   
It does not mean destruction of physiological functions performed by the mind.   
Once volition and doubt is destroyed mind is not a villian but best servant in  
the service of self.

Dear DRPVSSN RAJU, Your post on sankalpa and vikalpa are   
quite useful for all the member of the Forum. Again I am going   
back to Who am I? Bhagavan said: "After preventing all thoughts   
(which are volition and doubt), keep one thought: Who amI?".   
It is like the stick that is used to stir the funeral pyre. After the   
corpse is fully burnt, that stick is also thrown to the fire and gets   
burnt finally.   
Arunachala Siva.
