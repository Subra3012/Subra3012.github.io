## TAT TVAM ASI Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa

Well Friends, I always wanted to write about Sri Ramakrishna. .. but every  
time i start, i find that i cannot proceed beyond a point. for however much i  
try, i fail to describe him correctly.   
Sri Ramakrishna was perhaps one of the most profound Saints of modern times...  
but it is my honest opinion that most people mistook him.   
Sri Ramakrishna's attitude towards life can be described in a simple example  
he himself gave. He said, he was like a kitten, a kitten knows nothing more  
than its mother... if something frightens it or if it feels hungry. .. all it  
knows is to cry "meow"... and its mother takes care of it.   
He lived his whole life thus. His ego was totally surrendered to his Mother.  
His life illustrates Total Surrender. He was a child of his mother and nothing  
else. His mother took care of him, he just remains as a child, without worry  
and happily enjoying lifeat the same time illustrating how one should  
surrender to God.   
The aim of this thread is to describe his teachings and life in a systematic  
way.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and others, Mother was everything for Sri Ramakrishna.   
Once Mathur Babu, said that his wife Jagadamba is seriously ill   
and doctors could not cure her. He requested RK to pray Kali for   
his sake. RK went to Kali and prayed to Her sincerely. He took   
Mathur Babu to the garden in Dakshineshwar and showed him the   
flowers. Mathur Babu was still sceptic about RK's ability to cure   
his wife. Suddenly RK said that these plants, (which will only   
have red flowers), will have green flowers, and asked Mathur Babu   
to come and see tomorrow. Mathur Babu did not understand RK's   
behaviour, went home and came back again next day, more worried   
about his wife's health. That day RK showed him the green flowers   
from those plants, which will have only red flowers! That evening,   
Mathur Babu's wife became totally normal. RK told him that what   
cannot be done by a human being, god will do. Someone,   
who was an agnositc asked RK humourously, "What is your Kali   
doing now?" RK replied: "She is pushing an elephant through   
the eyes of a needle!" What is impossible for God or Brahman?   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, Sri Ramakrishna saw everything as unreal and as a dream. To him he only  
reality was Kali.   
Once when he was ill, one of his disciple said : why dont u ask your mother to  
cure you. So he went and asked   
his Mother : "why dont u cure me so that i can eat a little" and she showed  
him that it was he alone who was   
eating through million mouths! Not that Sri Ramakrishna did not know this  
answer. .. to sri ramakrishna it was a little different game...   
The person who spoke to him was Mother, he was the Mother and he talked to  
Mother. .. so when someone told him something, he would innocently do it. ..   
and yet, at other moments, he would act like mother and teach them!   
Of all modern saints, Sri Ramakrishna's life was perhaps the toughest to  
understand he was more like a Zen monk, who would behave differenly under  
different circumstances, but all the time direct one's attention towards God.  
He might some times scold one person and direct his attention to God... and he  
might some times, treat someone with great love and thus direct his attention  
to God. If someone takes just the external appearance, he might get deluded.  
But the one who sees every act of his was a way to show god's presence to the  
disciples, shall find his life as a beautiful illustration of love of God.   
He later said, this body is only like a pillow case, meaning, the inner  
content which is important, has no death.   
Love!

Its also very interesting to note the difference in attitude between Sri  
Ramana Maharshi and Sri Ramakrishna...   
Someone went crying for God to Ramana and he smiled at him and replied: See  
how this person is crying for God as if he were somewhere else and not here,  
right now.   
And Sri Ramakrishna would have definitely encouraged such a person to cry more  
and long more for God and would console him that God shall surely appear  
before him.   
Dear Subramanian ji, please throw some light on this difference in attitudes.   
Love!

Dear srkudai and others, Sri Ramakrishna used 'crying' as   
an expression of 'bhakti' and considered it as major tool   
for self-realization. He used to talk of 'Maha-bhava', the   
horripilation, crying, singing, dancing as indications of   
the higest devotion. Saint Manikkavachagar also sings: "Can I not get you by crying? O Siva!" in Tiruvachakam.   
Even though Jnana and advaita are the main planks of   
Sri Ramakrishna Order, many direct disciples and today's   
monks of the Order, have recommended 'bhakti', as a major   
route, for self realization. For example, Sri Ramakrishnanda,   
who started the Madras Math, was praying to Krishna and   
RK. Swami Vivekananda was not like that. He was not even   
praying before RK's picture. Later, Swami Ranganathananda   
was an exponent of pure Jnana. Swami Tapasyananda was an   
exponent of bhakti also.   
Bhagavan Ramana did not discourage crying. He told Mother   
Azhagamma, to cry, when He had chided her for a small mistake.   
Muruganar and Krishna Bhikshu have cried. Bhagavan said   
crying will help to belittle one's own ego but not to merge with   
Godhead. In fact, Arunachala Aksharamana Malai, the Marital Garland   
of Letters is full of crying, of the lover (Ramana) to merge in Godhead   
(Arunachala).   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramakrishna taught someone according to his or her capacity. He accepted  
both Bhakti and Jnana. It is my impression that Sri Ramana gave stress to  
Jnana.

Dear gangajal, You are a new member. Hearty welcome to you.   
Sri RK stressed both bhakti and jnana. Sri Ramana's emphasis   
was that bhakti is the pathway to jnana and for self realization,   
jnana alone is needed.

Dear Gangajal,   
 If we closely look at the life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Raman Maharshi there is obvious complete   
surrender.You cannot have Jnana or Bhakti without surrender.It is we from our  
point of view categorise their teaching as Bhakti or Jnana.   
Both of them pointed out the importance of Bhakti and Jnana in spiritual  
practice.Bhagawan wrote Akshara Mana Malai and other poems on   
Arunachaleswara.Is it not Bhakti? Likewise Ramakrishna told Jnana in short  
story forms many a time.Is it not Jnana?

Well Friends,   
 Sri Ramakrishna suggested a very interesting technique. .. acting out the  
Realized person...   
No other "scholar" i know suggested this. Coz it seems like imitation. I  
consider this a very potent technique...   
So this is what he did. .. he acted out the role of Hanuman. .. [But it is  
unreal someone might ask, so is this role of a person in bondage any real ?, i  
would question.] he started living out like hanuman, moving like hanuman,  
praying like hanuman etc. ..He lived it so really, that he even started  
climbing trees, and eating fruits from them.   
This attitude is called "Fake it and Make it"... initially the person starts  
acting, but that being our True nature, we eventually discover that what we  
were doing was not acting, but this what we are living is actually acting.   
young Ramakrishna used to act the role of Siva and for long long time, remain  
merged in that attitude. He used to say that acting such roles has a very  
positive effect on the person.   
Scholars might disagree with this simple trick Sri Ramakrishna proposed. Coz  
to them, it would look like imitating and they would argue that imitation  
would not help...   
But if we try, we shall see it. Try acting Ramana, Ramakrishna, Hanuman. ..  
and see yourself.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Yes. Sri RK suggested to act like noble souls,   
gods etc., Even in normal worldly life, we see mediocre students   
keeping the brilliant students as role models, following such   
pracices like studying at regular hours, doing the homework   
promptly etc., and impoving in their studies. Many Western   
devotees kept fellow seekers or Bhagavan as role models and   
stopped eating meat. Devaraja Mudaliar also adopted vegetarianism   
like that. Many ashramites got up in early mornings, which was   
not their usual practice, by following Bhagavan and other Ashramites.   
Sri RK, did that with intense bhavana. It is said that he grew   
a tail when he was meditating or acting like Hanuman. During   
his Islamic sadhana, he literally forgot Kali and other Hindu gods   
and hated idol worship. Intense conviction is essential. Ribhu   
Gita also says the same. A worm inside the cocoon, intensely   
meditated on the mother, and came out of the cocoon as a fly!   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam: "Natakathal   
un-adiyar pol nadithu, veedahathe puguvan vizhaii hindren!"   
"I am acting as your devotee and am eager to rush to Sivaloka!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Intensity of Bhavana is so deep in Ramakrishna Paramahamsa that he developed  
menstruation when he thought he was Radha longing for   
Lord Krishna.Even inspiritual history such events are rare and shows the depth  
of devotion.

He was perhaps born to illustrate all those ways to people.   
But for us, definitely our own self inquiry or surrender is important... what  
we have to learn is the kind of intensity and sincerity with which sri  
ramakrishna surrendered.   
We should have continuous self attention... and deepen it with practise.
