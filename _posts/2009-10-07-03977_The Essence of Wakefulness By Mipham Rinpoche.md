A Method in Sustaining the Nature of Awareness   
Homage to the glorious Primordial Protector.   
When sustaining the nature of awareness, the three stages of recognizing,  
training and attaining stability will   
gradually occur.   
First of all, scrutinize the naked and natural face of awareness by means of  
your master's oral instructions   
until you see it free from assumptions.   
Having resolved it with certainty, it is essential that you simply sustain the  
nature of just that.   
It is not enough just to recognize it, you must perfect the training in the  
following way: You may already have recognized the face of awareness, but unless you rest in  
just that, conceptual thinking   
will interrupt it and it will be difficult for awareness to appear nakedly.   
So, at that point it is essential to rest without accepting or rejecting your  
thoughts and to continue by   
repeatedly resting in the state of un-fabricated awareness.   
When you have practiced this again and again the force of your thought waves  
weakens while the face of your   
awareness grows sharper and it becomes easier to sustain.   
That is the time when you should abide in the meditation state as much as you  
can and be mindful of   
remembering the face of awareness during post-meditation. As you grow used to  
this the strength of your   
awareness is trained further.   
At first, when a thought occurs you need not apply a remedy to stop it. By  
leaving it to itself it is, at some point,   
naturally freed - just as the knot on a snake becomes untied by itself.   
When you become more adept, the occurrence of a thought will cause slight  
turmoil but immediately vanish in   
itself - just like a drawing on the surface of water.   
When you train in just that, you gain experience that transcends benefit and  
harm, at which point thought   
occurrences cause no problem whatsoever. Thus, you will be free from hope or  
fear about whether or not   
thoughts do occur - just like a thief entering an uninhabited house.   
By practicing further you perfect the training so that, finally, your  
conceptual thinking and the all-ground along   
with its moving force dissolve into un-fabricated Dharmakaya.   
That is the attainment of the natural abode of awareness.   
Just as you cannot find any ordinary stones on an island of gold even if you  
search for them all that appears   
and exists will be experienced as the realm of Dharmakaya.   
Attaining stability is when everything has become all-encompassing purity.   
In the same way, just as conceptual thinking gradually falls under the power  
of awareness during the daytime,   
at night you do not need to apply some other instruction, but should simply  
understand how the recognition of   
dreams and the luminosities of the shallow and deep sleep correspond.   
Until you attain stability, by all means continue with undistracted diligence  
like the steady flow of a river.   
This was taught by Mipham. May virtuous goodness increase!

Dear matthias,   
Nice. In Hindu theology it is called --   
1\. Sravanam - Listening. Listening to the oral instructions   
of Mipham Rinpoche or any other illustrious Guru. Those   
days, there were no pen and paper and hence listening was   
the most important requisite as it is also today.   
2\. Mananam - Contemplation, constantly thinking about it.   
Here the mantras can be repeated or merely contemplate   
on the Awareness.   
3\. Nididyasanam - Here, it becomes your nature to be in that,   
staying permanently in that state. Here the good forces have   
gained an upper hand and the bad forces are no longer a threat.   
Alexander Pope has sung: (This is not for the weak hearted..)   
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring;   
When the initial dozes intoxicate the brain,   
The succeeding ones sober us again!   
Arunachala Siva.

I find this a particularly pertinant post with respect to my circumstances.  
For no other reason than to share my recent experiences in a sympathetic  
arena; I have now been able to bring about a state of wakefullness in my daily  
undertakings. All questions are answered, extinguished or dismissed as  
depthless chatter in the presence and contemplation of this wakefullness.   
Thankyou Matthias and Subramanian.R for providing a reminder as to how to  
proceed,   
Love to all

Just to add - I continue with this practice - a few days ago, I reached a  
place in my meditation where I realised that the body and self were not part  
of the true self, a waking reality. Immediately after, I found my reflection  
upon this to be quite desolate, as it is the beginning of the end for "I". I  
didn't want to return to my practice, then quickly realised who felt the  
desolation, and the wisdom of this post (eternal thanks), and find continued  
practice of the utmost benefit and illumination,
