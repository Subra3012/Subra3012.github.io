In addition to the original Tamizh compositions and the anthologies he  
compiled, Tattuvaraya also   
translated Brahma Gita and Isvara Gita from Sanskrit into Tamizh.   
Despite this prolific literary output, it is fair to assume that Tattuvaraya  
regarded as his greatest accomplishment   
the state that was bestowed on him by his Guru Sorupananda: What if the world praises me henceforth or reviles me? What if Lakshmi, the  
goddess of wealth, remains close   
to me or separate from me? What if the body assuredly exists without ever  
decaying or perishes? Will   
there be any gain or loss to me on account of them, I who have worn perfectly  
on my head the twin feet   
of the immaculate Soruapananda? (Jnana Vinodan Kalambagam verse 99).   
The passing of both Sorupananda and Tattuvarya is described in the traditional  
story of their lives: Sorupananda started to wander aimlessly, leaving Tattuvaraya behind.  
Tattuvaraya followed him.   
When Sorupananda reached the sea shore, the waters separated to let him enter.  
However, when   
Tattuvaraya tried to do the same and follows him, the sea did not part.   
Tattuvaraya stood on the shore, crying loudly, like a calf separated from its  
mother. He searched for his   
Guru in all directions. Finally, Sorupananda appeared to give him ( a final)  
darshan before shining as   
Akanda Paripurna Satchitananda (the undivided transcendent fullness, being  
consciousness and bliss).   
In the context of what follows, this is the author's way of saying that  
Sorupananda took Mahasamadhi.   
After performing his Guru's Samadhi rites, Tattuvaraya was constantly thinking  
of Sorupananda.   
Either through the supreme love he felt for him, or through his inability to  
bear the separation, or   
because of the understanding that there was nothing for him to do apart from  
his Guru, he attained   
immediately Mahasamadhi.   
Tattuvaraya's Samadhi shine is located at Irumbudur, which lies between  
Vriddhachalam and Chidambaram.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
