Dear members,   
I want to say for you that we are not just this body. Only the soul is coming  
and going.So,when we die we should not worry of anything.Even our  
Father,Mother, Sisters,Brothers,Uncles,Aunts etc.Before dying we must not  
worry and if our Parents worry.We must say for them to not to cry because one  
day all will die including me. So think that only the soul goes out of our  
body and we will be happy because no trouble for the soul and for you and  
me.We will get freedom by dying.   
Yours.   
ss kannan.

The power of imagination(kalpana sakti)deludes us and makes us feel that we  
are coming in and going out.This is because we are superimposing the   
movements of the body and mind on us due to defect of Adhyasa.Actually we dont  
go anywhere.If we abide in the adjunctless self-conscious being   
we will come to know that all this coming and going are phenomena happening on  
the screen of pure self-conscious being.Once we get posited in the reality of  
pure self-conscious being,the imagination comes to a stand still by  
itself.Coming in and going out are there only when we think ourselves as   
body bound mind,otherwise there is no coming in and going out.It is only the  
thought which feels that it is coming in and going out but our nature is not   
thought but pure self-conscious being.

Dear Kannan05, we are not going anywhere. More particularly, our soul is not  
going or coming anywhere. When the body goes, it is not the body which is  
going, but the mind and prana, with all its 'vasanas'. We are here ever  
present, shining with effulgence.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Dear Kannan05 and others, we are not going anywhere.   
The soul is not definitely going anywhere. When we die,   
only our mind and prana and all the vasanas are going to   
take a new birth. We are ever present, shining with   
effulgence.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, you are correct. Keep the checklist and try how   
many one can practise.   
Arunachala Siva.

Withdrawing our attention from what we are not and paying attention to what we  
are is the qualification for self realisation.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and others, by paying attention to the   
self, we become the Self and we do not remain in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar,   
 Nice compiltion !   
Without Satva Guna one cannot find liberation.   
Rajas and tamas bind one and do not allow release possible.   
Love!   
Silence
