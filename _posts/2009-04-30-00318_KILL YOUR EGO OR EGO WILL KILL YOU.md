That state of mind is called Bhakti (Divine Love) wherein all movements of  
thought go automatically to the lotus feet of the Lord and stick to them for  
ever just as the seed of Ankola tree (on falling) gravitates to the parent  
tree, the iron needle to the magnetic stone the devoted wife to her husband,  
the creeper to the tree and the river to the ocean.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Tirupati Balaji Idol is a mystery. Learned people have written   
that it could be Muruga, (because Muruga temples are always   
on a hill), Uma (because large lock of hair is found at the back   
of the image), Siva (because even today the priests do pooja   
with bhilva and not tulsi). But no one has said that it is Buddha.   
Brahman is nameless and formless, we give name and form and   
call it as different gods. Arunachala Ashtakam, Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Bhagavan said two things, one is vichara and another   
is surrender. In both, the ego has to be annihilated. In vichara, you   
enquire within, with no thoughts, ego et all and merge in the Self.   
In surender, He meant a total surrender and a conditional surrender.   
When someone came to Bhagavan saying that he is a great sinner,   
Bhagavan said, 'then give all your sins to me and surrender without   
any qualms'. If this can happen, then it is total surrender, where also   
the ego is totally destroyed. In sum the purpose of life is to kill the   
mind and the ego either way, vichara or saranagati. Arunachala Siva.

When the basic form of exclusive self consciousness is mixed with adjuncts a  
seemingly compound consciousness appear which imagines itself to be a body so  
distorts the   
self conscious being "I am" to a limited object knowing consciousness which we  
commonly call as the mind or ego.The act of directing our consciousness  
towards something that appears other than ourself is what we call thinking.All  
objects come into existence only because of act of knowing them.Thoughts and  
images arise in our mind,they are formed by action of thinking or imagining  
them,an action that can occur only when we allow our attention to move  
seemingly away from ourself.   
Self-enquiry directs our attention selfwards and there no oscillation of  
attention and consciousness is concentrated in the core of our being as self  
consciousness.In this state of being ego is found to be nonexistent and the  
question of killing a nonexistent entity does not arise.

i'm not guilty for having no verdicts   
my discourses rivers are flowing upwards   
my temples and libraries as if made of cards   
suddenly burst into laughing at once   
i'm not guilty, not afraid anymore   
a lie does not trouble my soul as before   
i'm no longer ironic to Love   
let It break down, let It blow up   
whatever - i used to believe  was decent   
whatever  i thought  was my realization   
whatever i  i thought -- was exactly myself   
no comment  just ego annihilation

All the best. Try your hard practice of self enquiry with deep devotion and  
dedication with purity of heart.   
Dont forget the trio PATIENCE, PERSISTENT, TOLERANCE   
Id like to try --   
But why, but why?   
You tell me how    
Im happy now.   
Can ego kill the ego? No.   
My Lord just smiled and let it go.

As thorn is removed by another thorn.  
Dera SANKAR,   
Can a thorn be removed not by _another_ thorn but by itself?

yes dear   
so it becomes one as I   
siva siva   
 I don't wish it happens, but   
are you really ready to remove a thorn by the same thorn   
when you might get a splinter in your foot?

If a thorn stitches it needs to be removed by a sharp pin. But how it was done  
before pin was discovered.   
That is the way.  
Are you sure you have a thorn in your foot? May be it's just an imaginary  
thorn?

Dear Vladimir and everyone, all these thorn discussions are   
futile. There is no thorn. We 'think' that there is a thorn,   
and we 'think' some other thorn will remove it.

I-am-the-body idea is the primal ignorance.It is the vritti on which all other  
vrittis arise and so dependent on it.   
Once the mind tastes the self-knowledge there is formation of Atmakara vritti  
or Brahmakara vitti which strengthens   
day by day with spiritual practice which finally annihilates "I-am-the-body-  
idea" along with it's progeny of other vrittis.   
Once "I-am-the-body-idea" is annihilated there is spontaneous revelation of  
the ultimate reality.   
Annihilation of "I-am-the-body-idea"amounts to killing of the ego.If it is not  
annihilated self-ignorance perpetuates   
with it's consequent misery.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Bhagavan has even said: "What is   
Aham-kara-vritti? In Aham, there is no 'karam' doing or   
there is no 'vritti' or expansion or elaboration!
