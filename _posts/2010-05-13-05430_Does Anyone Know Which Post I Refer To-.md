## Does Anyone Know Which Post I Refer To.

Dear forum members, In the last couple of days I have read an article and was  
thinking about it today. Bhagavan was talking about animals / birds and how  
they should be treated. He said we do not know the souls that inhabit their  
bodies or the karma they have to work through. I think it was a post here but  
I cannot find it again. I would like to look at it again.   
Can anyone tell me which post it is from.   
Paul

I found the article I was thinking about on one the Sri Ramanasramam web pages   
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/timeline/swf/timeline.html   
Dogs, cows, cats or monkeys were all treated exactly as human beings were. In  
fact, a new visitor is likely to be misled by his reference to 'boys', for he  
would be referring to monkeys. None of the animals were treated as less than  
human  never referred to as 'it.' Nor would he allow any of the Ashram  
inmates to treat the animals rudely.   
We do not know what souls may be tenanting those bodies and for finishing  
what portion of their unfinished Karma they seek our company he had often  
said.   
The most prominent of these animal companions was Lakshmi, the cow. Her mother  
was presented to the Ashram some years earlier; and she on her part gave a  
number of presents to the Ashram. In fact, during a period of four years she  
had been presenting a calf with uncanny prompotness on the day of Sri  
Maharshis Jayanti.   
Lakshmi was believed by some devotees to be the re-incarnation of Keerai  
paatti, old lady with the greens, who used to feed Sri Maharshi about the  
year 1900. She would go round gathering greens and other edibles, beg the  
necessary sundries, cook them in her own nook at a temple on the Hill, and  
take them to the Swami. Here, I have brought just a little of greens, take  
it. It would be a good quantity and he would take it. Sometimes he would go  
to her place, cut vegetables, and assist her in the cooking. When she died her  
body was interred near the Ashram.   
Lakshmi was housed in the Goshala, the most commodious building at the Ashram;  
she had a knack of keeping herself in the limelight; and at the opening  
ceremony of the Goshala, she took a prominent part. A few hours prior to it  
she insisted on being set free, went to the Hall and declined to be taken out.   
When the inmates tried to force her out, Sri Maharshi intervened and said: 'Let her stay. She has come to invite me to her palace.'   
And at the appointed hour, she led him to the place; and when the door was  
opened, she proudly led the herd of cows into their new abode.   
Almost every day she would find some opportunity to meet Sri Maharshi, and she  
pretty well understood what was spoken to her or in her presence. She moved  
with unmistakable dignity and self-possession and would not be trifled with  
nor have anything to do with a person who ill-treated her.   
She passed away quietly on June 18th, 1948 soon after Sri Maharshi had spent  
some time by her side showing great love to her. She was given an honourable  
burial in a place opposite to Sri Bhagavans Hall. Sri Bhagavan himself wrote  
her epitaph in the form of a Tamil venba which is engraved on a slab above her  
lifelike statue raised over her grave.
