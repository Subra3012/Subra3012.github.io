## How to study Ribhu Gita

Dear devotees   
Many of you here are regular readers of Ribhu Gita. I am quite mesmerized by  
the beautiful Song of Ribhu available in Sri Ramasramam, the authentic tamil  
to english translation.   
My question is, be it Sanskrit - English or Tamil - English, what is the  
approach one should take when reading Ribhu Gita?   
I mean what will be running in teh background of your mind when reading Ribhu  
Gita? Do you do self eqnuiry or visualize some sage like Ribhu & Nidagha or do  
any affirmation bhava practice?   
What can be the best approach?   
Please elaborate   
Regards,   
Krishna

Dear Krishnan,   
It is better, in my view to read only Tamizh Ribhu Gita. It was made by  
Ulaagnatha Swamigal and it was recommended   
by Sri Bhagavan. There is one Sanskrit version by Sri Lingeshwara Rao with  
English meanings. It might be a difficult   
to understand this. You can read Tamizh Ribhu Gita along with Dr. H.  
Ramamoorthy's English versification. You can   
read side by side each sloka in Tamizh and English. The English rendering in  
free blank verses is excellent to understand.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thankyou both.   
My question is what bhava or inner attitude I have to keep while reading or  
chanting Ribhu Gita.   
Shall I have to do affimration practice type of mind-set or shall I have to do  
self enquiry while chanting Ribhu Gita (which is very tough to do enquiry  
while chanting Ribhu Gita)   
That was my doubt..

Dear Krishnan,   
The bhava for Ribhu Gita is that when you come to the lines, 'I am Brahman, I  
am Brahman' you should chant it as if   
you are already Brahman. Again when it comes 'The world is mithya; the world  
is mithya' you should immediately   
believe that the world is mithya.   
In the matter of Self Inquiry, Sri Bhagavan said that chanting Ribhu Gita  
itself is a process of Self Inquiry. If you   
chant daily you will get the result of doing Self Inquiry. There is no need  
for separate Self Inquiry. But faith is most   
important.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Krishnan,   
The following is a sample of Ribhu Gita in Tamizh, from Chapter 16: நிருமலமாய் பரப் பிரம சொருப நானே   
 நித்தியமம் பரப்பிரம சொருப நானே   
சருவமாம் பரப் பிரம சொருப நானே   
 சகலமிலாப் பரப் பிரம சொருப நானே   
கிரியையிலாப் பரப் பிரம சொருப நானே   
 கேவலாமாம் பரப் பிரம சொருப நானென்று   
அறிய திடப் பாவனையால் மனத்தை வென்று அவ்   
 அகண்ட பர வடிவாக்கிச் சாந்தமாவாய்   
If you read such slokas everyday, it will result in Self Knowledge.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Krishnan,   
This is the blank verse translation of Dr. H. Ramamoorthy of the above sloka: I, indeed, am of the nature of the immaculate Supreme Brahman.   
I, indeed, am of the nature of the eternal Supreme Brahman.   
I, indeed, am of the nature of the Supreme Brahman, which is all.   
I, indeed, am of the nature of the Supreme Brahman, which is not all this.   
I, indeed, am of the nature of the Supreme Brahman, which is actionless.   
I, indeed, am of the nature of the Supreme Brahman, alone.   
Conquering the mind by such steadfast bhava, abide as the nature of the  
undivided Supreme.   
And be at PEACE.   
Arunachala Siva.

श्रुतेः शतगुणं विद्यात् मननं मननादपि।   
निदिध्यासं लक्षगुणमनन्तं निर्विकल्पकम्॥   
'Reflection' should be considered a hundred times superior to 'listening'; and   
'meditation' a hundred thousand times superior to 'reflection';   
but Nirvikalpa Samadhi is infinitely more sacred.   
When the desire for liberation is as intense as the desire of the drowning  
person   
gasping for breath, then the student is ripe to go to a teacher for initiation  
into the   
mysteries of the Self!   
(Vivekachudamani, Shankara Bhagavatpada)   
Four Qualities of a Seeker of Self-knowledge or Truth, In an opening verse of  
the AstavakraSamhita, the sage Astavakra sums up all the prerequisites to  
spiritual liberation as follows: ―If you aspire after liberation, **shun the  
objects of the senses as poison and seek forbearance, sincerity, kindness,  
contentment, and truthfulness as nectar.** Like all proper systems of self-  
inquiry, Advaita Vedanta   
lays down four prerequisites or qualities for a seeker after Self-knowledge,  
as follows: 1\. Discrimination?viveka?between the real and the unreal   
2\. Renunciation?vairagya?of the unreal   
3\. Six Virtues/Treasures?shatsampatti?of self-control   
4\. Longing for liberation?mumukshuta   
student practices a threefold learning discipline, starting with   
**proper listening (sravana),   
supported by reflection (manana) and   
contemplation (nididhyasana).   
This process leads the student to the experience (anubhuti) of Self-Knowledge  
in due course of time.
