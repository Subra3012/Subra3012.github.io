## Dress code at Ashram?  
Author: kaleido             Date: August 16, 2009, 11:06:42 PM

Can anyone tell me the preferred dress code for ladies at the Ashram  
facilities? I already red that the Ashram grounds are to be walked barefoot.   
Grateful,   
kaleido

Dear kaleido,   
There is no dress code as such. But ladies usually wear saris   
or chudidhar. Even Western ladies wear saris and come!   
Western men wear loose trousers or dhotis. Indians wear trousers   
or dhotis.   
Arunachala Siva.

refer to Sri R S's reply,there is dress code in Asram ; i have seen even as  
announcement as a notice display,just near the entrance to sri mathru  
budheswarar, thought not found, which was found intact some months. definitely  
revealing and transparent dresses, lungis and shorts are not allowed. some do  
come with 3/4th..like but go unnoticed.   
also an amendement to his....while for tea no bell is rang. just doors to  
bhajana salai opens at 4 pm sharp.

Friends,   
Yes,drsundaram is right.Not just these but to dress minimally like Sri  
Bhagavan is also not expected,even if it be a sadhu.Yet,with all this,I have  
never found anything amiss-and visitors maintain decorum and discipline in  
Sri Ramanasramam.This is the power and Grace of Sri Bhagavan's presence or  
sannidhi.   
Namaskar

**OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA**   
Hello Krishnaji,   
How was the weather when you were there?   
I normally go during the end of August or early Sept and the weather is  
generally good- not too hot or wet.   
The last time I went in April and got fried!   
I shall be going end of July and wonder what the weather will be.

Dear Sir,   
The weather is now far better, there are heavy winds without rain and not  
storm like. In July it will further improve.   
I am a AC addict. But when I bear the heat in thiruvannamalai, it is a  
divine prasad, a burning brazer of our bad karma.   
Arunachalam.

dear sundaram sir,   
I saw in this forum private message that you have written to my gmail. But in  
office I could not open that mailbox. I am waiting for the weekend to open it  
as I am all the more eager and dont have internet connection at home.   
Will soon have the blessings to hear your voice sir.

Thanks Krishnaji for the information. I like your viewpoint about the  
Tiruvannamalai heat - so optimistic and positive! That's what they call  
"turning defeat into victory" and "turning pain into ectasy"!!

all said and done i wish to submit that whatever be the inherited whether  
conditions to be, say,even in acute summer, it is a fact one can not feel heat  
when one is in Ramanasramam and around in that sober, sacred, ambiance.
