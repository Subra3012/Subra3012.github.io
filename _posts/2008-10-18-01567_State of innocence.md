## State of innocence

When Paul Brunton came to Bhagawan for the first time at the suggestion of  
Paramacharya he had an experience in the Bhagawan's presence which he   
described in deatail,somebody told Bhagawan that Brunton had an experience  
because of you.Bhagawan immediately told them "I dont know".In his   
presence many things happened and he never claimed they are because of  
him.This is the real state of innocence in which there is no relic of  
doership.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Bhagavan was in a state of total innocence, not claiming   
anything miracles to be His, when they happpened in His Presence.   
Brunton was given a glimpse of Bhagavan several times. But I   
would say that he did not pursue it further. He has to be thanked   
for making the western seekers to know about Bhagavan Ramana,   
through his great book, A Search in Secret India. But later, he   
was even not permitted inside the Asram, because, he was claiming   
several of his own ideas as Bhagavan's through his other books   
or articles and this irritated the Asram. Of course, Bhagavan had   
no opinion, as usual, on this issue.   
Arunachala Siva.
