Aayurvarshashatam nrunaam parimitam raatrau tadardhan gatam   
tasyaardhasya parasya chaardhamaparam balatvatvrdhatvayoh   
sheham vyaadhiviyogadukha sahitam sevaadibhirniyate   
jeevo vaaritaranchachalatare soukyam kutah praaninaam   
The life of a man (as ordained) is limited to one hundred years; half of it is  
spent in night, and out of the other half one half again is pased in childhood  
and old age and the rest which has its illness, bereavements, and troubles is  
spent in serving (others). What happiness can there be for mortals in a life  
(again) which is even more uncertain than the ripples (on the surface) of  
water?

## Six internal enemies  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 27, 2009, 02:17:54 PM

Any living being has got six external enemies. But the human   
being alone, which can think and consequently create problems   
for him, has got six internal enemies.   
Kamba Ramayanam and Villiputturar Bharatam, two Tamil rendeings   
of Ramayana and Mahabharata speak of six characters who represent   
each, one internal enemy.   
Kama - This is only undeserving desire. Not sexual desire per se.   
An undeserving desire is something like Sanjay Dutt wanting to   
become Prime Minister! Sisubala in Mahabharatam is the example   
for this. In the Rajasuya Yaga, of Dharmaputra, when he wanted   
to give the first offering to Krishna, Sisubala said that he should   
be given the first offering, and quaralled with both Dharmaputra   
and Krishna. He was killed.   
Kobha - unbridled anger. The example is Hiranya Kashyap. He   
got angry with Narayana and got killed by Narasimha who came out   
of the pillar.   
Lobha - not giving even a small portion of one's wealth and riches   
to others. Duryodhana is the example. He did not even want to spare five  
houses to Pandavas. And he died later due to this.   
Matha - limitless arrogance - bloated egoism. Kamsa. Knowing that   
only Vasudeva's eighth child would kill him, he imprisoned Devaki   
and Vasudeva and killed every child from the first child.   
Moha - this is morbid sexual desire towards women other than one's wife.  
Ravana is the unbeatable example.   
Mascharya - enmity towards anyone other than one's enemy. This is Aswathama,  
who killed Pandavas' harmless young children and also tried to kill even  
Utthara's child in the womb. He was killed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, there is only one Master. He is not known to us, nor   
can he be seen or touched by us. This Master, the Causeless Cause,   
causes many masters in different times, as times demand. These   
masters are 'avataras', who are equally capable to take the seekers   
in the path and show the goal. Remember, the Master can only show the   
goal and it is for you to reach it merge with it. Please read Who am I?   
by Bhagavan written in 1902, at the age of 21. The Master need not   
be living in a body and it is left to you to call him, Sadguru, Parama Guru,   
Parameshti Guru, or Brahma Guru. After all, what is there in a name?   
Bhagavan also has said that the seeker can know the Guru is he   
gets immense peace in his presence or through his books, his words,   
his name etc., Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir   
I was told that the person who gives and shows the path he is a teacher or  
guide. whereas the Master will give   
real experience there and then which never fades away. It is the ultimate. In  
front of Bhagavan many were so fortunate even people did not know what is  
meditation or sadhana. Same thing happened to Vivekananda with Ramakrishna  
paramahamsa. It depends on our luck to have such a Master in our live time. As  
Subramaniyan ji told Bhagavan's books are there for us to show the path.

Dear Ramanaduli, I used the word Master, to indicate the Adi-Guru,   
Sri Dakshinamoorthy. The word can also be used for a Guru who   
is a Brahma-Jnani. As you rightly said, teachers give scriptural knowledege  
only, the Jnana Guru confers liberation, with or without scriptural knowledge.  
In Ramanasramam, the Guru-paramapra is chanted as: Sri Dakshinamoorthy  
prarambe, Sankaracharya madhyame,   
Sri Ramana Guru. Skanda, the son of Siva, is called Parama Guru,   
the one who taught the pravana mantra purport to Siva Himself!   
In Sri Ramana Gita, Bhagvan says to Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni: The Guru is one in whose Presence you get immense peace.   
Arunachala Siva.
