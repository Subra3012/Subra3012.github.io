The albino gene reasserts itself in Sri Ramanasramam with the birth of a white  
peacock more than 50 years after the first one was gifted to Sri Ramana  
Maharshi by the Maharani of Baroda in the 1940s. Tiruvannamalai, India.  
02/08/2010   
The handsome young bird is beginning to grow his feathered plumage and is an  
attractive and unusual contrast to the other peacocks who roam freely about  
the ashram premises. The Ramana Maharshi ashram draws visitors from all over  
India and abroad. It is one of the few places where humans and peacocks share  
the same space in close proximity and in an a safe and peaceful environment.   
This white peacock born a few years ago has since been followed by a few other  
albino chicks, part of the growing population of peacocks on the premises,  
thanks to a successful breeding programme by the ashram management. Many of  
the birds have, in fact, adopted gardens and neighbourhoods as far as six  
kilometers distant, happily adding to the biodiversity of the rapidly  
expanding town.   
The original gift was immortalized in a black-and-white photograph by the  
legendary French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, when he visited Sri  
Ramana Maharshi in 1947. He âshotâ the white peacock at the peak moment of  
its mating dance, its long white plumage spread in a wide fan, with the holy  
mountain Arunachala rising in the background.

Dear Nagaraj,   
During my visits to the Asramam, I have seen only female white   
peacocks, with no feathers. To see a white male peacock, with   
white feathers and white blooms will be really a great sight.   
Arunachala Siva.

They are such an integral part of the Ashramam. This time, in the old hall, i  
noticed that the windows were covered with a net to prevent insects such as  
mosquitoes etc.. from entering the old hall. I also noticed the roof, where  
many birds used to come and build nest and not to forget the playful squirrels  
that used to play with Bhagavan and used to bite Bhagavan's fingers. I noticed  
that today, no such entry is possible in the old hall.   
Then, Bhagavan was there to fight for their rights, now who is there to fight  
for their rights? infact, i felt it would be difficult to protect them  
properly.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
