## Bhagavan Ramana and Sankara  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2008, 04:28:30 PM  
---  
When I read Sri Ramana Ashotra (hymn of 108 names of Bhagvan   
by Viswanatha Swami, describing His life), daily in the morning, I   
am not but able to compare Bhagavan Ramana, with Sankara. Sankara   
lost his father, Siva Guru, before he was six. Bhagavan Ramana also   
lost His father when He was about twelve. When Sankara went for   
begging food, one poor lady gave him a gooseberry fruit, Sankara   
made golden gooseberries rain in her home, through his famous   
Kanakadhara Stotram. When Bhagavan went for alms, one gentleman,   
who was playing cards on the portals of his house gave Him food, and he   
was blessed later with a famous Upadesa called Vichara Sangraham. He   
is none other than Gambiram Seshayyar. Sankara went to Kaladi, his   
village in Kerala, skyward, and gave salvation to his mother. But in   
the case of Bhagavan, since He was Unmoving, Arunachala, He made   
His mother come to Him. The poor lady came not once but 4 times and   
on the fourth occasion, after placing her on probation and removing   
all the false prides of caste, creed, and 'achara' and after removing   
all the knots of karma, He bestowed her salvation, with the merager   
of "i" with the Absolute. As in case of Jnana Sambandha, who had   
milk from Goddess Uma on the banks of a tank in Sirkali, Bhagavan   
was offered with the milk of Goddess Unnamualai in Tiruvannamalai   
temple through the temple priest! Arunachala Siva.

Dear Graham,   
I had two days' powercut and low voltage problems in the city   
and I opened the Forum only today after 17th instant.   
Your message. I do not know whether Sri Ramanasramam's   
publications in Tamil and English are under copy rights. I request   
a reply from you so that I can proceed, if permitted, the Guru   
Ramana Vachana Mala. Till your reply, I am not writing anything   
from that book or any other Ramansramam book.   
Thanking you,   
Yours truly,   
Subramanian. R

When the mind is killed, you are the Self. Satyam-Nyayam-Dharmam,   
Satyam-Sivam-Sundaram, Prajna Parimita, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss,   
Maha Sunya, ALL these are names. Who cares? If one becomes   
the Sugar candy, what does it matter to you, if one calls it sweet, another   
sour and the third bitter? If you are the Rose, what does it matter to   
you, if one calls it pink, another green and the third black?

Dear Sankar, the Eye, the limitless eye, as Bhagavan said,   
will be known to you only when you go past the organic   
eye, not only eye but all the cognative and contative senses.   
Till such time, you will only be eyeing for the Eye, which is   
within you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Truth is That, in which one merges, in a deep sleep,   
where all the mind's mischief ceases. If you stop all the mind's   
mischief, by killing it, as in dreamless deep sleep, you are the Self, the  
Truth, the One without a second. There, not only the world, even   
your personal god cease to exist. Arunachala Siva.

When there is stilling of thought in waking state what remains in you is  
conscious space.   
For stilling of thought self-enquiry is the bet way.

Dear everyone, stilling of thought is fine. It is called   
mano laya by Bhagavan. But He said that we have to   
go one step further, that is killing of mind, the villain   
of the piece. It is called mano nasa. Most of us are   
in the first step only, and this too, not all the time!

Destruction of sankalpa(volition)and vikalpa(doubt) is called  
manonasa(destruction of mind).   
It does not mean destruction of physiological functions performed by the mind.   
Once volition and doubt is destroyed mind is not a villian but best servant in  
the service of self.

Dear DRPVSSN RAJU, Your post on sankalpa and vikalpa are   
quite useful for all the member of the Forum. Again I am going   
back to Who am I? Bhagavan said: "After preventing all thoughts   
(which are volition and doubt), keep one thought: Who amI?".   
It is like the stick that is used to stir the funeral pyre. After the   
corpse is fully burnt, that stick is also thrown to the fire and gets   
burnt finally.   
Arunachala Siva.
