## The feeling of being  
Author: shadak              Date: June 01, 2009, 01:53:30 PM

Feeling of just being is not a sensation coming through physical senses, it is  
discerning what belongs to the physical aspect I.e: body, emotions, thoughts  
and so on, from what is consciousness non dependent on anything to be felt. On  
the contraire, it is only when all emotions, thoughts and sensual perceptions  
are removed that it can be felt. The word feeling is used to clarify this  
discerning. It is just a word pointing to something, it is not the thing  
itself but mind reacts to words according to its conditioning and then accepts  
or refuses them depending on if mind´s ideas, believes or understandings are  
reaffirmed or contradicted by those words. If we can´t go beyond words  
because we get stuck by them, how can we go beyond feelings, in the  
conventional meaning of this word? I wonder, because these feelings are  
generated by words most of times. If there is not discernment, how can we know  
that we are feeling the pure being or we are just taking the idea of what is  
the self by the self itself? Mind can do this, and it does; it lives from  
ideas, ideas feed the mind and it feels fine with that: the idea of self,  
peace, silence and so on. The word feeling is used to point to what is  
beyond ideas, to what can´t be questioned by mind. In fact, when mind feels  
or touches the being through discernment it becomes what it perceives because  
all its movements get suspended by that touch or feeling and there is only  
being. Simply. Easily. Difficulty is in going on through the jungle that is  
the mind, avoiding all its intelligent tricks in order to deceive itself, only  
with the help of discernment. But it is only discernment what gives to the  
mind a subtle quality that enables it to Know; no people, no books, nor even  
a guru. So many people went, and goes, away from Bhagavan without feeling a  
single thing   
Well, I´m sorry if I perturbed this site somehow. I´ll just leave this post  
here for those who may be interested and can understand what one means when  
one talks on feelings, as I do understand them. Beyond readings, prejudices,  
words and ideas. Thanks.

Dear shadak,   
Nice. Becoming takes one to Being. Becoming is full of   
emotions. Being is just experience.   
Sri Ramakrishna told this story. Once a group of friends,   
climbed the ladder one by one, to see what is on the other   
side. Each one climbed up and came back saying: It is wonderful. It is  
wonderful!" One fellow climbed the ladder   
and simply jumped to the other side. He did not come back   
to describe anything. Describing, I think, is all feeling.   
Jumping to the other side is the experience.   
Saint Tayumanavar says in one poem. Girls who were to be   
married soon were all describing what it would be to get   
married and have conjugal life. One girl got married. She   
went into the nuptial room. Next morning, she came out,   
did not utter a word. Even to her mother, who was anxiously waiting outside,  
she simply smiled and rushed into the bathroom to have a face wash!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Yes. The more you talk on the self the more you move away from yourself. I´ve  
realized that it is good to be alone regarding to this issue and that there is  
not reason for complaining about it. Thanks to Bhagavan for the trip   
This site is nice, anyway, and you seems to be a good man. Best wishes.

Dear shadak,   
Thank you. I am repeating what Muruganar said, he wrote   
30,000 verses on Bhagavan Ramana. He said: "I am only   
a pen, my Master writes everything." Nowadays I feel   
that unless Bhagavan Ramana writes everything, I cannot   
do. How can the pen write by itself?   
Arunachala Siva.

**Sorrow**   
People complain about their griefs and sorrows and how they pray to God but  
find no relief from pain. But grief itself is a gift from God. It is the  
symbol of His compassion.   
\-- Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi   
Om Shanti. .

But wouldnt inviting sorrow be sadistic? If it is for testing oneself from  
time to time it is fine. Spirituality should cultivate equanimity and joy in  
the midst of any situation for it to be true. Wasnt Lord Krishna smiling his  
way all through his life? Saints and sages of earlier yugas were healthy and  
comfortable and lived for many many years. Only in this Kali yuga we see even  
sages getting diseases. As long as we dont get carried away from our Self at  
times of happiness and luxury, we dont need to invite sorrow.

Dear Mohan,   
Actually, in case of Kunti, she is not at all affected by grief, infact, her  
devotion is so emotional that she is enjoying every but of her compay wit the  
Lord through her prayers. hence by inviting sorrow she is not at all being  
sadistic. she feel its a great platform for her to remain in Bhakti Bhava. But  
you see, its a common tendency among people to pray very intensely in times of  
trouble but seldom pray at times of Happiness!   
Pain is a fact that you are living. Painful living is actually goos for your  
consciousness is more potent and alive during testing times than during  
regular happiness derived form worldly pleasures. Consciousness is mostly  
absent during such happy moments.   
Sorrow again is only mind made. It may look only outside that Kunti is  
inviting sorrow, but she is in ecstasy. Infact there is no sorrow at all.   
Nagaraj

For enlightened souls every thing is same. But for others life is different.   
Kunti must be enlightened therefore she was happy during the difficult times.

Dear all,   
First of all, pains and sorrows, pleasures and happiness   
do not come from God. They are earned by us with our   
prarabdha. Kunti perhaps was self realized. She asked   
Krishna to give sorrows, only to get her tested by such   
travails. Equanimity is the virtue. But it comes not so   
easily, but by practice. Perseverence is the key.   
In Nazi concentration camps, the lives of prisoners were   
virtually hell everyday. But they put up with them. When   
they came out of the prison after the War, many people   
became ascetics in their lives. Those who could not put up   
with them, died in prisons.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am not sure under what context mother has said these words.   
It may mean that pains in life often has a good part....it often makes people  
more compassionate.   
When one experiences pain and sorrow oneself, one feels compassion for others  
who is under similar sorrow. This transformation to a better person is as if a  
gift from God.   
Swami Vivekananda said:  _As pleasure and pain pass before his soul, they leave upon it different  
pictures, and the result of these combined impressions is what is called man  
's "character". If you take the character of any man, it really is but the  
aggregate of tendencies, the sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find  
that misery and happiness are equal factors in the formation of that  
character. Good and evil have an equal share in molding character, and in some  
instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness_.   
So misery often makes man better.   
From the Advaitic point of view....the power of the Self is behind  
everything...both happiness and sorrow.   
When one remembers this during sorrow, one can feel that God (Self) is still  
with me, and this sorrow is a gift from God.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen,   
Mother Saradamani's view point is also correct. To have   
pain and sorrows, makes one show compassion for other's   
pains and sorrows. Saint Tayumanavar has sung in a   
composition: I became parched and tired, whenever I see paddy plants   
and trees are parched due to hot summer.   
This is compassion. Sri Ramakrishna said it in some other   
way: When he was having throat cancer and could not   
eat anything, devotees asked him to pray to Kali. He said   
Kali told him: While you are eating with sixty mouths,   
[meaning devotees], why should you eat? This is Universal   
Consciousness. Once Vivekananda had a restless sleep and   
next morning he told his devotees, that there might have been   
something wrong in the world somewhere. Next day morning   
papers informed that there was an earthquake in South   
America in midnight and many people had perished!   
Arunachala Siva.

Compassion is fine, but would not empathy for all living beings affect one's  
sadhana and disturb our mind every second as something will be going wrong in  
this world somewhere every second? Then we can never ever remain in peace !!!  
After enlightment all this is fine, but till then should not compassion be  
first towards oneself or our own poor mind? How does equanimity and empathy go  
hand in hand? Please advise.

Dear mmohan,   
Yes. Saint Tayumanavar, Sri Ramakrishna, Saradamani and   
Bhagavan Ramana displayed that universal compassion,   
after merging in the Self. Till such time, one can be compassionate to fellow  
beings, only to some extent. But   
I do not feel that showing compassion, will hinder our   
self enquiry. Siva is not only Sivam (Consciousness) but   
also Love. Anbe Sivam, Love is Siva-Consciousness,said Tirumoolar.

Thanks Subramanian. I feel at least in the initial stages one should take care  
of himself first as there is enough work to do with our own mind and not to  
get lost in all the service and compassion shown to the world. It is like  
cleaning up our home first and putting things in order before start looking  
into neighbouring houses. Maybe that's why in olden days the sadhaks went to  
isolated places and immersed themselves in self enquiry and did not come back  
to society till they were ripe enough.

Dear mmohan,   
Yes you are correct. We should clean up our house first.   
But whenever compassion is required when you are out,   
on the streets, [say an accident, or a dog having been   
hit by a lorry], I think it is necessary to show compassion.   
Going to jungles, was to keep you away from outside influences.   
But where can you keep away your mind?

I feel that as one progresses in spiritual practice, compassion starts  
unfolding in the heart by itself.   
This will happen even without doing any external social service.   
As ego starts fading and one expands, compassion starts unfolding from the  
deeper self.   
It may not be of such great magnitude as manifested by Lord Buddha, but will  
depend upon the individual's progress.
