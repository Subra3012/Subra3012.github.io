**Sorrow**   
People complain about their griefs and sorrows and how they pray to God but  
find no relief from pain. But grief itself is a gift from God. It is the  
symbol of His compassion.   
\-- Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi   
Om Shanti. .

In mahabharatha Kunthis says to Lord Krishna to give more sorrow so that she  
would not forget Him.

But wouldnt inviting sorrow be sadistic? If it is for testing oneself from  
time to time it is fine. Spirituality should cultivate equanimity and joy in  
the midst of any situation for it to be true. Wasnt Lord Krishna smiling his  
way all through his life? Saints and sages of earlier yugas were healthy and  
comfortable and lived for many many years. Only in this Kali yuga we see even  
sages getting diseases. As long as we dont get carried away from our Self at  
times of happiness and luxury, we dont need to invite sorrow.

Dear Mohan,   
Actually, in case of Kunti, she is not at all affected by grief, infact, her  
devotion is so emotional that she is enjoying every but of her compay wit the  
Lord through her prayers. hence by inviting sorrow she is not at all being  
sadistic. she feel its a great platform for her to remain in Bhakti Bhava. But  
you see, its a common tendency among people to pray very intensely in times of  
trouble but seldom pray at times of Happiness!   
Pain is a fact that you are living. Painful living is actually goos for your  
consciousness is more potent and alive during testing times than during  
regular happiness derived form worldly pleasures. Consciousness is mostly  
absent during such happy moments.   
Sorrow again is only mind made. It may look only outside that Kunti is  
inviting sorrow, but she is in ecstasy. Infact there is no sorrow at all.   
Nagaraj

For enlightened souls every thing is same. But for others life is different.   
Kunti must be enlightened therefore she was happy during the difficult times.

Dear all,   
First of all, pains and sorrows, pleasures and happiness   
do not come from God. They are earned by us with our   
prarabdha. Kunti perhaps was self realized. She asked   
Krishna to give sorrows, only to get her tested by such   
travails. Equanimity is the virtue. But it comes not so   
easily, but by practice. Perseverence is the key.   
In Nazi concentration camps, the lives of prisoners were   
virtually hell everyday. But they put up with them. When   
they came out of the prison after the War, many people   
became ascetics in their lives. Those who could not put up   
with them, died in prisons.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am not sure under what context mother has said these words.   
It may mean that pains in life often has a good part....it often makes people  
more compassionate.   
When one experiences pain and sorrow oneself, one feels compassion for others  
who is under similar sorrow. This transformation to a better person is as if a  
gift from God.   
Swami Vivekananda said:  _As pleasure and pain pass before his soul, they leave upon it different  
pictures, and the result of these combined impressions is what is called man  
's "character". If you take the character of any man, it really is but the  
aggregate of tendencies, the sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find  
that misery and happiness are equal factors in the formation of that  
character. Good and evil have an equal share in molding character, and in some  
instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness_.   
So misery often makes man better.   
From the Advaitic point of view....the power of the Self is behind  
everything...both happiness and sorrow.   
When one remembers this during sorrow, one can feel that God (Self) is still  
with me, and this sorrow is a gift from God.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen,   
Mother Saradamani's view point is also correct. To have   
pain and sorrows, makes one show compassion for other's   
pains and sorrows. Saint Tayumanavar has sung in a   
composition: I became parched and tired, whenever I see paddy plants   
and trees are parched due to hot summer.   
This is compassion. Sri Ramakrishna said it in some other   
way: When he was having throat cancer and could not   
eat anything, devotees asked him to pray to Kali. He said   
Kali told him: While you are eating with sixty mouths,   
[meaning devotees], why should you eat? This is Universal   
Consciousness. Once Vivekananda had a restless sleep and   
next morning he told his devotees, that there might have been   
something wrong in the world somewhere. Next day morning   
papers informed that there was an earthquake in South   
America in midnight and many people had perished!   
Arunachala Siva.

Compassion is fine, but would not empathy for all living beings affect one's  
sadhana and disturb our mind every second as something will be going wrong in  
this world somewhere every second? Then we can never ever remain in peace !!!  
After enlightment all this is fine, but till then should not compassion be  
first towards oneself or our own poor mind? How does equanimity and empathy go  
hand in hand? Please advise.

Dear mmohan,   
Yes. Saint Tayumanavar, Sri Ramakrishna, Saradamani and   
Bhagavan Ramana displayed that universal compassion,   
after merging in the Self. Till such time, one can be compassionate to fellow  
beings, only to some extent. But   
I do not feel that showing compassion, will hinder our   
self enquiry. Siva is not only Sivam (Consciousness) but   
also Love. Anbe Sivam, Love is Siva-Consciousness,said Tirumoolar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian. I feel at least in the initial stages one should take care  
of himself first as there is enough work to do with our own mind and not to  
get lost in all the service and compassion shown to the world. It is like  
cleaning up our home first and putting things in order before start looking  
into neighbouring houses. Maybe that's why in olden days the sadhaks went to  
isolated places and immersed themselves in self enquiry and did not come back  
to society till they were ripe enough.

Dear mmohan,   
Yes you are correct. We should clean up our house first.   
But whenever compassion is required when you are out,   
on the streets, [say an accident, or a dog having been   
hit by a lorry], I think it is necessary to show compassion.   
Going to jungles, was to keep you away from outside influences.   
But where can you keep away your mind?   
Arunachala Siva.

I feel that as one progresses in spiritual practice, compassion starts  
unfolding in the heart by itself.   
This will happen even without doing any external social service.   
As ego starts fading and one expands, compassion starts unfolding from the  
deeper self.   
It may not be of such great magnitude as manifested by Lord Buddha, but will  
depend upon the individual's progress.   
Om Shanti. ..

Compassion emanates from Grace, who is Uma or Sakti.   
It is inseparable part of Siva, the Self.

It is true. All great bhaktas say, we are not doing anything. It is all God's  
grace.   
AVAN ARULALE AVAN THAZH VANAGI. Avan arulate we should have bhakti, compasion.   
In this world we can get other things very easily but it is very difficult to  
have God's grace.

Without God or Guru's Grace, one cannot even a open   
a book on spiriutality or visit Temples. I could not   
visit Tiruvannamalai for 4 long years. From May 2008   
to May 2009, I could visit Tiruvannamalai five times. I   
can go to Him again only when He calls. Our faith is
