But Dasar had levitated and was slowly coming down, doing his yogic practice,  
and hence could not   
respond to their calls. Getting no response after repeated knocking and  
shouting, his worried in laws   
and others broke down the wall near the door. This commotion unsettled the  
single pointed mind of   
Achutha Dasar who at that moment was still descending to the ground, causing  
him to fall with a thud   
instead of landing smoothly. Due to this, the breath, which he had held while  
doing the exercise and which   
should have been exhaled, settled in his system and became too heavy for him  
to bear. His suffering   
was colorfully described by his biographer as lie that of a worm in the hot  
sun. In unbearable pain he cried   
loudly.   
His relatives were at a total loss, not knowing to help Adigal in his  
predicament. Dasar told them unless   
someone rushed to Pottharai and brought his yoga guru Ammaiyar, he would get  
no relief. A suitable   
person,'who went like the wind', found Ammaiyar and reported the situation.  
Ammaiyar immediately   
came to Kasthampadi and ordered everyone out of Dasar's room. She commanded  
Dasar to re-start   
his yogic exercise and to levitate as usual and then come down. When Dasar  
did so, all the breath,   
which had been locked in a tight knot, got released and he was relieved us of  
all discomfort. Dasar   
prostrated at Ammaiyar's feet in gratitude. She advised him, 'Dear son! May  
you live long! Henceforth   
be alert and don't let us such distrubance happen again.', and then left for  
her village immediately.   
So the day ended without planned conclusion of the Shanthi muhurtham (nuptial  
night) ceremony.   
On the same day, Dasar completely gave up the yogic levitation practice.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
