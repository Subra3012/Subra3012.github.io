More than 25 years back i was introduced to the Ramana Kendra off Lodi Road in  
Delhi. The Kendra has a meditation hall with a huge portrait of Ramana  
Maharishi. Behind him is a wooden form of Arunachala.   
i was drawn to the eyes of Ramana Maharishi. For some reason my eyes would  
always water when i looked at his portrait.   
i was also drawn to Arunachala. Those days every Saturday or Sunday there used  
to be a Satsang. I remember some beautiful songs sung in praise of Arunachal.  
Though i could not follow the words, the melody was very haunting. All this  
generated an inner longing to visit this sacred hill.   
That longing came to fruition on 30th January this year....almost 28 years  
after i first came to know about Arunachala.   
i was introduced to Mr Palani Velu as if by sheer good fortune and he was kind  
enough to accompany me for the last 70 kms. of my journey to Thiruvannamalai.  
He told me that he had been doing Pradikshana since 2002 at least twice every  
month and specially on Purnima.   
We decided to do Pradikshana at 4 a.m. the next morning.   
On the night of the 30th i had gone to the temple of Arunachala and had a  
beautiful darshan of Arunachaleshwar, Parvati Devi and other deities. Felt  
very moved in the temple. Maybe that was the reason why i could hardly sleep.   
Not used to getting up at 3 a.m. i threw up. Though i had had a very light  
dinner at the Ashram, my stomach was completely emptied. i remembered how  
Pradikshana had to be done on an empty stomach. After taking a head bath i was  
ready and excited at the prospect of starting the walk.   
Mr.Palani Velu reached in time and both of us started from the Seshadri Ashram  
at the appointed time. My first glimpse of Aruchala was when we came to a  
clearing and saw a large imposing hill half clouded at the peak. Though dawn  
was some hours away, there was still some faint light which made the dark  
clouds lighter at the edges. i could only fold my hands in reverence at this  
sight.   
Initially there were a number of trucks on the main highway but then the road  
turned into a queiter part and we could walk with less of disturbance.   
We visited all the lingams on the way. i think the first one was Yama lingam  
and the last one the Agni Lingam.   
After covering about 10 kms. i found that my feet became very sensitive to the  
gravel on the road. Gradually the sensitivity increased and each step became a  
source of discomfort. The discomfort turned into pain and all my consciousness  
then turned to the feet. i realised how tied i was to bodily comfort. The last  
3-4 kms. were covered at a crawling pace.   
Mr. Palani Velu was always by the side. i am truly grateful to him for  
accompanying me and guiding me all along the way. i think i saw a bit of Siva  
in him.   
When we entered the gates of the Ashram i knew that the Pradikshana had  
finally been concluded. Though i felt a sense of relief the thought crossed my  
mind that i would like to do it all over again...and again...and again...   
Yes, this has to be the power of Arunachala.......

Dear Vinita,   
Congrats on your first Giri Pradakshina.   
My personal opinion is that we can do giri pradakshina with slippers or shoes  
and after having food.   
I did go without shoes couple of times but the mind was always on the path and  
the discomfort.   
Now a days I take breakfast or some fruits before I start and with  
shoes/slippers.   
Probably we are not used to walking barefoot.   
Bhagavan also says that we need not torture ourself for attaining God or to  
attain self-realization.   
Regards,   
Sambu

Dear Sambu,   
i think it is important to go through the discomfort so that it makes us  
conscious of the fact that we are too much attached to the body.   
if only i could have surrendered to the pain and not identified myself with  
it, it would have been so much the "better".   
i suppose it needs a lot of sadhana to reach that stage....or alternatively, a  
hardenng of the sole   
we city bred creatures are much too spoilt   
best wishes...

Once Bhagavan and a devotee were walking on the Hill. It was   
blistering hot. The devotee could not walk even ten metres.   
Bhagavan Ramana gave His towel and said: "Please stand on this   
for sometime and then walk." Slowly the devotee bore the heat and   
walked barefoot and from that day, he never walked with slippers on. When some  
other person asked this devotee, he said: "You do   
not know. Bhagavan has given me 'ravi raksha' (protection from the   
heat of the sun!). Bhagavan Ramana never wore slippers in His life,   
even during His days in Tiruchuzhi and Madurai. Once another   
devotee had a thorn stuck to his sole and he was limping. Bhagavan Ramana  
told him, to lift his leg and slowly take out the thorn. He   
then asked Bhagavan: "O Bhagavan! Are you not having thorns in   
Your sole?" Bhagavan Ramana said: "Which thorn are you mentioning? Today's  
or yesterday's or last week's? The devotee raised the leg of Bhagavan Ramana  
and saw on His sole countless thorns sticking all over His sole.   
Of course, it takes one birth or several births for us to be like Him.   
In today's world where Gurus distribute wooden slippers, used   
by them, to devotees, for 'pada pooja' and all that crap, Bhagavan   
Ramana is unique, the One without a second!   
Arunachala Siva.

Walking without slippers, fasting, taking bath in cold water etc will  
strengthen the mind to some degree.   
But they are not indispensible for self-realization.   
King Janaka attained self-realization when he still a king.   
Buddha sacrificed everything to attain self-realization.   
We cannot be indifferent to pain as Ramanar and Sadasiva Brahmendra were.   
Once we reach their level we can also be like them.   
I believe that we have to accustom ourself to all types of life styles.   
Walking without slippers on some occassions and living in an a/c room on other  
occassions is not going to benefit us spiritually.   
We have to let go all comforts at once or keep your comforts and not be  
attached to it mentally.

Sambu

Dear munagala,   
Yes. You are correct. Nothing is required to realize the Self excepting  
desiring the Self. This is the only desire that Bhagavan   
has prescribed. All other desires have to be left as and when   
prarabdha is finished. Bhagavan Ramana willing, I am planning to   
visit Tiruvannamalai in March 2009. I know the heat, I know the   
power cuts in Tamil Nadu during those times and I know that I have to walk  
without sandals. But Bhagavan Ramana will take care and   
give me enough strength to put up with all these. Saint Manikkavachagar says  
in Siva Puranam, " With His grace, I shall prostrate His feet."   
Arunachala Siva.

i feel fortunate to have u sharing your thoughts on this. yes, if we are free  
of attachment to comforts whether we walk with slippers or barefoot is of no  
consequence. but then we are attached to comforts at this particular stage of  
our journey.   
let me share with u some fears that i had when i first thought of doing  
girivalam. i thought of the thorns and wondered if i would have the strenght  
to go on if my feet bled or if the thorn irritated me. since i like to indulge  
in fantasy i even thought that i would hurt myself on broken glass imagining  
that such things do keep lying on the road.   
actually while visiting one of the lingams during the girivalam i did find a  
number of glass pieces strewn around. somehow i saw them in time and could  
negotiate them without getting hurt.   
however, it is possible that one could hurt oneself. i do want to progress to  
a stage when even if it hurts physcially the surrender is so complete that  
such things do not matter.   
dunno whether it will happen in this lifetime or the next or the next.   
afterall these are only the first few faltering steps on a journey which may  
be a long one.

Dear Subramanian,   
I have performed Girivalam without slippers in the month of May in mid day.   
This was before I became a follower of Master's teaching.   
After reading Bhagavan's teachings I decided wearing sandals or not is  
immaterial to spiritual growth   
and then I started wearing sandals during girivalam.   
When given choices I always pick the easier route   
I guess these are personal preferences. Let us do whatever pleases us but not  
miss the central theme of our struggle.   
Regards,   
Sambu

Dear Vinita,   
your snaps were really good, I liked the monkeys, the dog and the peacock very  
much. Always there is some innocence in the animals which we lack because of  
our intelligence. It was nice to read your experiences. read in some book -  
Once a devotee came to meet Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana Maharshi asked him to  
do Girivalam. The devotee started the Girivalam next day at around 3:30 am or  
so. after finishing the Girivalam, he came and prostrated to Bhagwan. Bhagwan  
asked him if he had finished the Girivalam and he acknowledged and told  
Bhagwan that his foot had a lot of burns and cuts because of the girivalam and  
that he found it very difficult to finish the Girivalam. Bhagwan asked him to  
do the Girivalam again, So he set forth again and came back and prostrated to  
Bhagwan. Bhagwan asked him about Girivalam, this time the devotee said that  
it was much easier this time and that he did not have any problem at all.   
Bhagwans grace is not describable.   
How fortunate all those devotees are who were able to really see him  
physically in flesh and bones and got the opportunity to talk to him and  
listen to his necter like voice full of love and grace. Oh Bhagwan I love you.

Even thinking about Ramana Maharshi and Sadashiva Brahmendral, I get  
goosebumps. In which birth or how many more births I will have to take to  
become one with Ramana Maharshi or Sadashiva Brahmendral. I can just cry and  
pray to Bhagwan for now.

It is true that it might take one birth or many births to attain the state of  
Bhagavan.   
Let us not be negative about the timeline. Who knows? Your vasanas may be good  
and you would get realized in this birth.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj attained the state of samadhi after 3 years of practice  
of self-inquiry.   
Once Mr.Ganesan ( I guess he is cousin of current president of the Ashram)  
visited Nisargadatta and the latter said he would put   
Mr.Ganesan in the same state as Bhagavan if he stayed with him for just 3  
days.   
Vivekananda says if someone had the will he can attain perfection is a very  
short time.   
It all depends on how well we have understood the path and following the path  
without any deviation whatsoever.

Sambu

Dear munagala,   
No doubt each one has to make sincere efforts making surrender and   
self enquiry as twin engines. But it all depends also on the carrybag   
of merits and demerits that we have on our back. Sri Sadhu Om, who   
spent only 5 years with Bhagavan Ramana living in His body, was   
asked by someone as to how he could interpret Ramana with greter insights than  
others, Sri Sadhu Om replied: "To say, that I had spent five years is itself  
certificate for my impurity. It needs only   
one look of Bhagavan, if your carry-bags are okay!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Pranam,   
As the thread of this post has taken a new turn, I would like to relate a  
story I had read.....   
Once the Sage Narada was going around the earth singing the praises of the  
Lord Narayana. He came across a man doing sadhana and asked him what he  
desired, as he would be meeting Lord Narayana soon. The man said that he had  
been doing intense tapas for a long time and wanted to know when he would  
become one with the Lord. Sage Narada assured him of an answer from the Lord  
and went ahead on his way.   
A little further Narada came across another man doing sadhana and asked him  
also what he desired. The second man also wanted to know when he would attain  
the Lord.   
Narada returned to earth after some time and came across the first person and  
told him that the Lord had said he would attain liberation in the next birth.  
The man flew into a rage and said that he had been practising his sadhana very  
intensely and had undergone great hardships and tapas. He was furious that he  
was not going to achieve his goal in this life time and so he told Narada that  
he was going to stop all his practices and he felt that he had wasted his time  
undergoing all the hardships, and from now onwards he was just going to  
indulge and enjoy life.   
Narada then came across the next person who was meditating under a tree.  
Narada told him that he would achieve liberation after as many births as there  
were leaves on the tree he was sitting under. The man was overjoyed and  
started dancing in ecstasy and told Narada that the Lord at least had told a  
definite number to his number of births.   
Such was the person's surrender to the Lord that he became liberated at that  
very moment.   
This story gives us good teaching as to the attitude one should have towards  
sadhana and the importance of surrender.   
Om shri Ramana
