PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO OBTAIN BHAGAVAN'S BOOKS &  
MOUNTAIN PATH JOURNAL. AM STAYING IN KWT.I don't know any devotee of Bhagavan  
who are staying in Kwt. Am like fish out of water now. Once I had been to  
Ashram, I really enjoyed the stay.

Dear telluravi,   
Bhagavan Ramana was living in a hut near the thatched shed   
over Mother's Samadhi. The devotees did not want to keep the   
Samadhi under open sky and so a thatched shed was put up.   
There again, was built a hut where Bhagavan Ramana and a few   
others (perhaps Kunju Swami ) were staying. It is in the year   
1922. The Old Hall and kitchen were done with Annamalai Swami's   
supervision a little later. The photograph is available in Osborne's   
book.   
Arunachala Siva.
