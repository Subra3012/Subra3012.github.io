Ramanaduli garu,   
Correct pronunciation is Subha kamkshalu and not Shubha kanchalu   
May guru ramana blessings be with everyone of us.

But who says mind has to be merged?   
1\. he whose mind is merged, cannot say.   
2\. he whose mind is not merged... how does he know what happens when mind is  
merged? how can he say whether mind has to be merged?   
and this argument can also be found in panchadasi ! its not mine own.   
jeevan mukthi is not videha mukthi.

Dear Nagaraj & viswanthan,   
I shall cover only the explanation given for "Echil", the Tamizh word.   
This word is used in both occasions, i.e. 1) referring to the saliva that is  
coming out of the mouth and 2) the left-overs of the food [perhaps since it  
contains a touch of saliva while eating]. A Guru's or Jnani's left over of  
the food is considered sacred and it is called Ucchishtam. This is taken by  
the devotees. This Ucchishtam also   
includes the drinking water from a tumbler partly used by the guru.   
[An extreme case of Ucchishtam is taking the water from a basin,   
where guru's pada were cleaned with water while entering the house. This  
water is consumed by the devotees!]   
In Bhagavan Ramana's time, this taking of left over food was   
practiced by some devotees in the early years. They were also taking the  
water from the tumbler which Bhagavan Ramana had used while taking food. This  
is was found out by Bhagavan, from a little girl who was waiting for Bhagavan  
to finish His lunch and get up, so that she could take the water from the  
tumbler. After this, Bhagavan Ramana saw to it that there was no water left  
behind. He chided the devotees also.   
The food ucchishtam again was observed by the devotees, in a SELECTIVE way!  
That is, in the lunch when Mudaliar Patti's food was served on Bhagavan's  
leaf, it was considered "not suitable" for devotees to sit at the same leaf  
and eat food. So they were doing this at night-meals. Bhagavan Ramana also  
noticed this and started taking the leaf Himself and placing it on the  
dustbin.   
Once Muruganar wanted to take this Ucchishtam. When he went for in the  
morning for sitting before that leaf of Bhagavan that had contained left  
overs, he was prevented saying the Mudaliar Patti's food had been served there  
and so it was 'unsuitable'!   
Muruganar felt bad. While dogs are eligible for that food, I am not. What a  
pity?   
He wrote a poem which reads roughly as-   
This Brahma does not know, not even Vedas but   
Also how to give births to jivas.   
If he had given me a dog's birth, I would have eaten   
 that food!   
He has made me a Brahmin and thus disqualifed me for this great   
 fortune!   
This song is in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. It starts as Thachariyatha  
chaturmari paarpaan....... It is a single verse, and titled as Ucchishta  
Vaibhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ramana also mentioned that he had pain!   
without thoughts can Ramana had pain. .. !!??!!??!!   
As Consciousness Ramana or u or me. .. we do not have a body also. so no pain  
or thought.   
This is so even now.   
and in the relative sense the body and thoughts are there.   
coz the relative is mithya, they are said to be non-existent.   
being mithya, they continue to appear, but we know they are like mirage.   
that's jivan mukthi.   
not absence of perception.

Excellent discussion.   
I agree with Udai garu.   
Guru ramana has thoughts and felt pain many times and even he was given  
anaesthesia in few instances.   
Quote  
Once ramana maharshi had toochache problem and a The dentist came, stayed here  
three days, charging Rs.300-0-0 for his stay and did nothing substantial,  
except cleaning his teeth, pulling out one tooth and a part of another.   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=5176.0  
 **But his overall detachment to his body and his non-cooperation towards his  
body are amazing and are the key points we need to implement.**   
 **As guru ramana says Insensibility to pain cannot be Jnana.**   
Key point to know is mind/body are mithya i.e dependent on our real nature  
sat-chit-ananda.

Its not that i have no pain.   
But when the sensation of pain is there,   
i do not give it importance... do not pay attention to it.   
do not fight with it or do not welcome it.

well said udai garu.   
Moreover manonasha is not absolute destruction of mind as few people  
misinterpret guru ramana's teachings saying that he meant absolute destruction  
of mind.Killing of ego is the main key point and there is no need to stop and  
kill thoughts but control of thoughts is required and as lord krishna says in  
bhagavad gita it is possible by constant practice and detachment though it is  
very very difficult.   
Lets say i feel hungry and ask for food if someone comes and say that is only  
your thought so please remove that thought. How do i feel :-)   
Quote  
D: That means the manonasha or the ahamkara nasha. **The destruction of the  
mind or of the ego you speak of is then not an absolute destruction.   
M: Yes. The mind gets clear of impurities and become pure enough to reflect  
the truth, the real Self.This is impossible when the ego is active and  
assertive.**
