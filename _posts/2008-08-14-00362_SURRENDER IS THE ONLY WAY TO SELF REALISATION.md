## FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE  
Author: KANNAN05            Date: August 14, 2008, 03:37:13 AM

WHAT IS REAL FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.   
As a spiritual seeker when we get rid of this bodily consciousness is the  
freedom.   
The day we reach it and remainn is the independence.   
Am I right. This is my imagination.   
siva siva arunachalasiva.

Dear Kannan05, There is no freedom no bondage, no   
independence, no dependence, if one could shed   
all thoughts that bind people.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Disease as Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi says is,   
dis-ease, that which makes you to lose your 'ease' or happiness.   
Not only bodily ailments, but even those which robs your happiness   
is disease. Our anger, hate, pain, anxiety, disappointment are all   
diseases. These diseases can be cured by the medicines like,   
patience against anger, love against hate, perseverancce against   
pain, courage against anxiety and being without any expectations   
against disappointment. These are again possible only with doing   
our duties and surrendering to the Guru. Or by 'vichara' or enquiry,   
asking within us: To whom are these anger, hate etc., It is for me.   
Who am I? I am not the mind which creates all these.   
Arunachala Siva.

Getting entangled in the imaginations o the mind is disease.   
Positing oueselves in the reality i.e our "self"which is the space or base   
for appearence and disappearence of the mind and the world is the cure.

Dear Subramanian.R   
I'm not sure I see the mind as the villain here but the ego, But not the  
function of the ego which includes mind and body thought. Can the mind be said  
to be bad, can reason and intellect be bad? How can we know the world without  
the use of mind? Its the false identification with the ego with the body and  
mind that is where we find the problems.

Dear kde, the mind and the ego are the branches of the   
same organic tree. In fact, there are 4 things as books   
on Advaita state: The mind, the ego, the intellect, and   
the mind-stuff (chit). The mind is necessary for knowing   
things about Bhagavan Ramana, but if this mind is in the   
path of self-enquiry, then it is suddha-manas or Pure Mind,   
which is helpful not only for reading books but also for   
all worldly activities.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, Suddha manas or Pure Mind is like a mirror where   
one can see the reflection of the objects kept in front of it.   
Viveka Choodamani says that suddha manas is necessary   
for the seekers and jnanis to do work in this world without the sense   
of doership. Bhagavan says it is like a burnt rope! It just is there,   
but does not do anything that we ordinary mortals do!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Yes. Self enquiry and Atma Samarpana lead   
to self realization. Self realized Jnanis, have surrendered   
their individual soul and have merged into the Self.

Dear Sankar, Surrender or 'Saranagati' is the key to realization.   
But surrender is not an easy thing. It is quite difficult, as difficult   
as Enquiry or 'Vichara' as is evident from the story of the King and   
Ashtavakra. The Ramayana speaks only about 'saranagati' or   
surrender. Poet Muruganar has written about saranagati or surrender,   
in many verses in his Ramana Anabhuti or Ramana Experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Practise surrender and that will do. I am repeating,   
surrender is not easy as we think. Regarding books, do not worry   
about any book. If you could get hold of English version of Who am   
I?, read it everyday, till you understand every word of it. This is   
a small book, running to 8 pages and it will take half an hour. If   
you practise every word of it, that is more than adquate.   
Arunachala Siva.

At present you have the experience that you are a finite being and from that  
state you imagine an all powerful God and try to establish a relationship   
with that imagined God thinking that he is separate from you.Such relationship  
is dualistic and always there is an element of conflict in it.In such   
circumstances surrendering to an imagined God is never complete.On the  
otherhand if you do self-enquiry and experience self for yourself,it amounts   
to experiencing God as he really is in nondualistic manner and there will be  
no conflict,surrender is complete and mind subsides by itself.

Vichara is very hard to do every moment of every day, But it can be done for  
one moment each day, Sri Ramana has said grace is the beginning, middle and  
end. I would say faithfully do your best, no more can be asked.

Dear nonduel   
There's a thin line here where one has to cross over, an easiness, effortless  
attitude of resting in the Self. Because all "doing,"trying", "difficulties",  
"doing our best", can only be from the ego   
Its so true and really helpful I'M being duellist again.   
Is it difficult to be aware of existing, of being? Is it difficult for a man  
to know he is a man?   
When put as well as that, no how can it be, the simple truth is made such hard  
work of. Be your Self how can that be hard!   
Thank you nonduel for your clear sight.

Dear Sankar, Nonduel and PKSSVN Raju are both correct.   
Pedantics and semantics will take us nowhere. Surrender   
or self-enquiry will help you only when there is limitless   
Grace of the Guru. All book knowledge is a waste, beyond   
certain point and one has to 'unlearn' to realize the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar,   
Self Surrender, in my opinion is not something you "do".   
When you recognize that right now here, this very moment, God is to our left,  
right, top, bottom in and through us we suddenly see that we are  
actually in total embrace of God. And there is no place for an individual any  
more. This recognition is true Surrender.   
So we do not stand apart and try to surrender to god; that way, it is  
difficult.   
But this can be done here and now remember we are totally in the ocean of  
God and totally allow the individuality to dissolve. This is easy. All that is  
to be done is, each time we forget this, remember this until it becomes  
completely natural.   
The body is a part of the whole body whole space.   
The mind is a part of the whole mind.   
Where do "I" exist ??   
That is why our mantras are also like that OM (The ultimate; anahata sound   
unstruck sound.) Namo [na-mah ; not me] narayanaya [God alone IS]. ..   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, Thanks for your nice post. Atma Samarpana   
or Self-Surrender is no dual. There is no surrenderer and   
surrendered. Incidentally, I have not still replied to your
