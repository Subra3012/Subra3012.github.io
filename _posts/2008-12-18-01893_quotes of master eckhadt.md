Master eckahrdt was the most important and missunderstood mystic of medi evil  
age in germany and europe in general.....   
please enjoy his timeless advaita knowledge (Ken Wilber, refers to master  
eckardt for the causal state of conciousness and he refers to ramana maharshi  
for the nondual state....the last two chapters of his book: eros kosmos logos)   
Whoso is unable to follow this discourse, let him never mind.   
While he is not like this truth he shall not see my argument.   
۞   
Merchants go when the truth appears,   
for the truth needs no merchanting.   
Behold thy temple cleared of merchants.   
۞   
Had I a God whom I could understand,   
I would no longer hold him for God.   
۞   
Man has to seek God in error and forgetfulness and foolishness.   
۞   
It must be understood that this is all the same thing: knowing God and being known by God,   
and seeing God and being seen by God   
۞   
If a man's spirit were always joined to God in the same Power, he could not  
age.   
For the now wherein God made the first man and the now wherein the last man  
disappears   
and the now I speak in, all are the same in God where there is but now.   
The man in Truth has motion taken from him and all things stand intrinsic in  
him.   
Nothing new comes to him from future things nor yet by accident for he dwells  
in the now   
ever new and unceasingly renewed.   
۞   
The happenings of a thousand years ago, days spent millenniums since, are in  
eternity no further   
off than is this moment I am passing now; the day to come a thousand years  
ahead or in as many   
years as you can count, is no more distant in eternity than this very instant  
I am in.   
۞   
We feel an inkling of the perfection and stability of eternity, for there is  
neither   
time nor space, neither before nor after, but everything present in one new,   
fresh-sprinkling now where millenniums last no longer than the twinkling of an  
eye.   
۞   
The happiness he (Christ) brought was our own.   
۞   
To one who even for an instant has seen into this ground,   
a thousand ducats of red beaten gold are worth no more than a false farthing.   
۞   
We might question life for a thousand years: Why dost thou live?   
It would only say, if it replied at al: I live because I live.   
For life lives in a ground of its own, wells up out of its own.   
It lives without a cause for it lives itself.   
۞   
Things are all made from nothing;   
hence their true source is nothing.   
۞   
But God is truth, and things in time, the things that God created, are not  
true.   
۞   
There all too few who are fully ripe for gazing in God's magic mirror.   
۞   
Aye, in this power is such poignant joy, such vehement, immoderate delight as  
none can tell   
nor yet in truth reveal. I say, moreover, if once a man in intellectual vision  
did really glimpse   
the bliss and joy therein, then all his sufferings, all God intends that he  
should suffer, would be   
a trifle, a mere nothing to him, I say more; it would be pure joy and  
pleasure.   
۞   
The more we can impute to Him (God) not-likeness, the nearer do we get to  
understanding Him.   
۞   
In unknowing knowing shall we know God.   
۞   
Verily I say, the soul will bring fourth Person if God laughs into him and she  
laughs back to him.   
۞   
God is beyond all name, none can express him.   
۞   
Seeing nothing he saw God.   
The light which is God is flowing and darkening every light.   
۞   
The body is much rather in the soul than the soul is in the body.   
۞   
God is the Word which pronounces itself.   
۞   
God's exit is his entrance.   
He broke in to let us out.   
۞   
God is simple presence, a stay-at-home in himself   
۞   
Real knowledge, even in this body, is intrinsically so delightful   
that the sum total of created things is nothing to the joys of pure  
perception.   
۞   
Dedicate all acts to God.   
۞   
I am certain as I live that nothing is so close to me as God.   
God is nearer to me than I am to my own self; my life depends upon God's being  
near me,   
present in me. So is he also in a stone, a log of wood, only they do not know  
it.   
If the wood knew of God and realized his nearness like the highest of the  
angels does,   
then the log would be as blessed as the chief of all angels.   
۞   
A life of rest and peace in God is good;   
a life of pain in patience is still better;   
but to have peace in a life of pain is best of all.   
۞   
If we are more conscious of God being in a quiet place,   
that comes of our own imperfection and is not due to God,   
for God is the same in all things and all places.   
۞   
God is near to us, but we are far from him.   
God is in, we are out;   
God is at home, we are strangers.   
۞   
I never give God thanks for loving me,   
because he cannot help it.   
۞   
This spirit knows no time nor number: number does not exist apart from the malady of time.   
۞   
He rejoices all the time who is rejoicing above time and timelessly.

Dear Matthias,   
I read the quotes of Master Eckhardt, posted by you. Incidentally,   
Arthur Osborne, who came to Bhagavan Ramana after his ineternment   
in Thailand, in 1945, says about one French philospher Rene Guenon.   
Osborne has been influenced by Guenon's books and his theories,   
which helped him to understand Bhagavan Ramana better later.   
Guenon has written a few books, the most important being,   
1\. Introduction to General Doctrine of Hinduism.   
2\. The Symbolism of the Cross.   
3\. The Orient and the Occident.   
4\. The Modern Crisis.*   
(* Osborne has translated this from French to English.)   
The salient aspects of Guenon's theories are: a. Being is One and our entire life is to understand that We are the One.   
b. One needs a Guru invariably and the Guru must have vertical and   
 horizonatal authenticity.   
By vertical authenticity, Guenon refers to the lineage from which Guru   
has come. By horizontal authenticity, he means that he should himself   
be self-realized.   
Arunachala Siva.
