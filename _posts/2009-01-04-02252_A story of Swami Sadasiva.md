## A story of Swami Sadasiva

Sadasiva like Trailanga Swami wore no cloth. One morning the nude yogi  
absentmindedly entered the tent of a Moslem chieftain. Two ladies screamed in  
alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust at Sadasiva, whose arm was  
severed. The master departed unconcernedly. Overcome by awe and remorse, the  
Moslem picked up the arm from the floor and followed Sadasiva. The yogi  
quietly inserted his arm into the bleeding stump. When the chieftain humbly  
asked for some spiritual instructions, Sadasiva wrote with his finger in the  
sands: _" Do not do what you want and then you may do what you like."[/**i]   
The Moslem was uplifted to a purofied state of mind and understood the  
paradoxical advice to be a guide to soul freedom through mastery of the ego.  
So great was the spiritual impact of those few words that the warrior beacme a  
worthy desciple; his former haunts knew him no more.

My dear goshorasit,   
Your post on Sadasiva Brahmendra. This great Jnani has composed a   
small book of verses called Atma Vidya Vilasam. This is a great text   
on advaita and has been praised by Bhagavan Ramana. Bhagavan   
Ramana had translated a couple of verses of Sadasiva Brahmendra   
and this is included in Reality in 40 Verses - Supplement. Sad Darsanam   
\- Anubhandam in Sanskrit.   
Incidentally Parahamsa Yogananda the author of An Autobiography of   
a Yogi had visited Bhagavan Ramana when He was in the Hills.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to tell a story about two great yogis. The story   
is available in Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi by Sri Munagala   
Venkatramaiah. One yogi was encountered by a solider who tried   
to pierce the yogi with his sword. The sword made a sound as if it   
had met a metal vessel and it came back rebounding. The soldier   
was wonderstruck. Then the yogi said: There is one more like me,   
who is greater than me, in such and such a place. Go and do the same   
valour with him. The soldier went to the second yogi and thrust the   
sword on him. The sword went past his chest and came back from the   
back, as if it has gone through a huge mass of butter! No bleeding!   
The soldier, again a Muslim, became his ardent disciple.   
The devotees of Bhagavan Ramana, whenever they went near Him,   
had exprienced heat as if they were standing near a burning oven!   
Just Be Still. You are self-actualized!   
Arunachala Siva.

My dear goshorasit,   
Atma Vidya Vilasam, the work of Sri Sadasiva Brahmendra, has been   
rendered in English by me and posted in this Forum, a few months   
back. Kindly see the old posts.   
Arunachala Siva.
