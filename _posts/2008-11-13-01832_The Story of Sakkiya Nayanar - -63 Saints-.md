## The Story of Sakkiya Nayanar - (63 Saints)

Sakkiya Nayanar, one of the 63 saints, was from Tiru Changa Mangai,   
a village in Tamil Nadu. He was born in an aristocratic agricultural   
family. He was sent to Kanchipuram to study Buddhism and realize   
the Truth. He lived with Buddhist monks, in the university* in   
Kanchipuram. Soon he found out that Buddhistic principles did not   
take him anywhere near the Truth. Then he studied secretly Saiva   
Siddhantam and found that Siva Jnana could take him to the Truth.   
He went everyday to a street temple before food, and flung stones   
towards Siva Linga as if these were flowers! Because of his devout   
intention, Siva accepted these stones as flowers! Soon, the monks   
understood the ways of Sakkiya Nayanar and rushed towards him with   
swords to kill him. Sakkiya Nayanar clung to Siva Linga and prayed   
intently Siva and He came with his bhuta ganas, fought the monks   
and took him to His Abode!   
One later devotee later sang like this: O Siva, one fellow flung KAL at you, (KAL - Stones - Sakkiya Nayanar.)   
Another fellow used to VIL at your, (VIL - Bow and arrow - Arjuna)   
One another, flung SOL at you, (SOL - angry abusive words - Sundara   
 moorthy.)   
A fouth fellow used PAL for your worship (PAL - teeth to bite the animal   
 flesh - Hunter Kannappa)   
O! You graced them, no doubt, people call you a mad cap!)   
(Source: Periya Puranam - Tamil Verses - Saiva Siddhanta Book   
Publishing House, Chennai.)   
Periya Puranam, an epic of 4000 verses was written by Sekkizhar,   
and was read out in Chidambaram, under the aegis of Anabhaya Chozhan. When  
Sekkizhar prayed for Siva's Grace, for starting   
the epic, in Chidambaram. Nataraja, Siva. gave the first word to   
start the epic, by the sound, Ulahelaam..... meaning, All this world!)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Does this Periyapuranam contain the stories of 63 Nayanmars? Then what is  
Thruvilaiyadal Puranam? This means Sekizhar's period is after all the 63  
Nayanmars? I request you to post on this matter.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Periya Puranam, or the Great Epic, is by Poet Sekkizhar and it   
narrates the stories of 63 Saiva Saints. This was written about   
8th century AD, and after the 63 saints' period.   
Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam, speaks about the 63 divine plays of Siva,   
in Madurai, during the period of Varaguna Pandyan. This is different   
from Periya Puranam. It was composed by Paranjyoti Muni, around   
10th century AD.   
Arunachala Siva.
