The Question of Self Knowledge: In Yoga, knowledge alone is said to bring about the liberation of  
consciousness, specifically self knowledge   
or the knowledge of our true nature in the Purusha. When we speak of self  
knowledge for the personal   
for the personal mind, we are mainly referring to knowledge of one's personal  
history, habits and inclinations.   
Self Knowledge for the inner Being, however, consists of understanding the  
essence of awareness beyond   
thought and personal history. Though our thoughts are constantly changing,  
our inner Being remains the same.   
True Self Knowledge is a matter of Being, not of thought or emotion. It is a  
state of Being, not of events,   
experiences or ideas known. Our inner Being has no conceptual content, nor is  
it conditioned by time and action. It is a state of openness, surrender and  
presence like a steady thread through all our experiences.   
Contacting it brings us into a state of peace, in which the mind and its  
psychology are naturally put to rest.   
To reach our inner Being requires a different orientation of our  
consciousness, a willingness to let go of our   
personal history and dive into the great Unknown within.   
From the standpoint of the Purusha or true Self. one could say that you cannot  
know yourself. There is no   
self or personal history to be known which could define you. From the  
standpoint of the true Self, you can   
only be your Self. But in being yourself, you become one with all Being. You  
come to know all things within   
yourself, in which he mind becomes but an instrument to be used at will or  
put to rest.   
Our inner Being exists beyond time and space, birth and death, mind and body.  
Yet it is present within us   
as the ground of Being which is the same in all. In that awareness, the mind  
becomes quiet and passive   
and the personal self loses its relevance.   
In that Inner Reality, the mind loses its importance. This is just as when the  
Sun is shining, one no longer   
notices the Moon. The reality is self evident. Nothing needs to be said,  
discussed or argued about. And the   
reality is so vast it can never be described. One merges into the experience  
only.
