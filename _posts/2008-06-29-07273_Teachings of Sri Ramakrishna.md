## Maandukya Upanisad and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 29, 2008, 12:50:06 PM  
---  
Maandukya Upanisad which comes in Atharvana Veda, comprises   
only 12 verses. Gaudapada, guru of Sankara's guru, has written   
a verse commentary on this, and it runs to 215 slokas, and is called,   
Gaudapada Karika. It speaks of Ajata Vada, "the theory of no creation-no  
cessation-no liberation". Many devotees of Bhagavan ascribe Him to ajata vada.  
The Upanisad speaks of 'vichara' as the only sure way to merge in Self.  
Sankara has written a commentary to the Upanisad and also to the Karika.  
Perhaps no other Upanisad has given rise to so much   
controversy as Maandukya Upanisad. Dr. S. Radhakrishnan has said   
that the philosophy of Gaudapada and Sankara are different from each   
other and this point has been discussed in "Talks" No. 383 and 399. Day Day,  
entry of 21.11.1945 (Night) also mentions about a discussion on   
this. Prof. Das Gupta, who wrote elaborately on Indian Philosphy said   
that Gaudapada was a Buddhist and he borrowed the ideas from   
Nagarjuna Karika and Lankavatara Sutra! The Upanisad and Karika,   
discusses the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep (each one   
is given a symbolic Sanskrit name) and the state of 'turiya' or 'turiyateeta',  
the fourth. Advaita Ashrama (of Sri Ramakrishna Math), Kolkata has brought a  
beautiful English translation of MU and Karika   
by Swami Nikhilanada. The fourth chapter of Karika, tells about   
'alata shanti', that is, quenching of the firebrand. If one takes a firebrand  
and rotates it, one sees the 'circle of light' around it. If the   
firebrand is quenched, the circle also disappears. Thus, all the world   
is the 'circle' made out by the firebrand, that is, mind. If the mind is   
killed, the world also no longer appears. Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagraj and Subramanian,   
Nice passages. Now we will move to business, because the disciple is now  
interested in business.   
d: My business has come to a standstill. Can I get some help from God?   
cguru: Yes, but God will help the businessman.   
d: If the businessman is helped, the business is automatically helped, right?   
cguru: Listen to this story and decide for yourself.   
A person heard that his friend made a profit of Rs 25000 in business by taking  
the name of God. Hearing this the man invested a lot of money in stocks by  
taking the name of God. When his friend heard this he said: fr: Why did you do that without knowing my full story?   
man: I have full faith on you and on your faith on God.   
fr: Then listen to this and see if you can still have the faith.   
man: Not required but your wish.   
fr: When I started business 2 years ago I had almost no capital. By my hard  
work in 1 year I took the business to Rs 1 lakh (100,000). In the second year  
I thought that along with my hard work I will take the name of God. So did I.   
man: Then what happened?   
fr: I made a huge loss and my business reduced to Rs 50,000.   
man: (alarmed) But you said that you made a profit of Rs 25,000.   
fr: By God's grace the loss turned into a profit.   
man: My faith has redoubled.   
fr: Listen to the rest of the story and see whether you can still retain the  
faith.   
man: I don't understand why you want to scare me. Or is it for fun?   
to be continued. ..

... continued   
fr: So as I said I made a huge loss in business in the second year and my  
business reduced to Rs. 50,000. Then I thought as follows: In the second year also I had put the same hard work as the first year, still  
I had to face a loss. Therefore everything is not in my hands. There is a  
grace of God in it also. Now I am left with Rs 50,000. If I take it that as  
much as 50% is due to my own hard work, then the remaining 50% is due to God's  
grace. So I said that I gained Rs 25000 in business. That gain is from God.   
man (jumping up): What a convoluted logic.   
He ran to the phone and tried to contact the stock broker to sell all his  
stocks. The stock broker was no where to be found and it was Friday evening.  
The stock exchanges have closed. He left an urgent message to the broker to  
sell his stocks first thing on Monday morning. Throughout the weekend the man  
anxiously paced on the balcony and tossed on the bed. On Monday morning he  
again tried to contact the stock broker. By some strange fate the stock broker  
was not to be found. At afternoon the worst happened. His stocks took a  
downward turn and nose dived. And the man was down on a sofa on his friend's  
house, the friend trying to console him with little success.   
to be continued. ..

silentgreen,   
My sympathies are with that man!He has not put in any effort,so, as such he is  
down by 50%;He has depended on his friend's word and so may not be entitled to  
the Remaining 50% as well!Most important is that he has totally missed the  
point of his friend,that God helps the Businessman and has taken it to mean  
that God helps the Business.He has taken outer success as a measure of inner  
contentment and Happiness,and is measuring God's help through outer success.If  
he wins a lottery,God Is Great and kind;If he Loses, God is heartless and  
utterly not dependable!   
Please continue the Story;I am sure that it may bring in other dimensions as  
well.   
Namaskar.

Dear silent green,   
Moorti dhyna is not inferior. Name and form will be with you and finally only  
name will remain and the name will finally   
shine as Swarupa, only Effulgence, with name also disappearing. (Sri  
Bhagavan)   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, Sri Ravi, the condition of the man became pitiable and pain even to write  
about him.   
(There was a stone image of God in that room. Everybody considered it as a  
stone and it remained as a stone, still and unmoved. Then Mr Subramaniam  
suddenly posted that Moorti dhyana is not inferior. Perhaps because of this,  
the state of the stone got elevated to a divine stone. The image could no  
longer remained unmoved. )   
The telephone rang. The stock broker on the other side said that he was on  
vacation and forgot to take his mobile phone. He returned late in the morning  
and after getting the urgent message immediately set out to sell the stocks.  
The stock prices rose briefly in the morning and then had a sharp fall. He  
sold the stocks during the peak price. The gain is Rs 25,000. He had never  
seen anyone gain so much money in the matter of a few hours.   
Life came to the man. He sprang up and said: Henceforth business is business  
and God is God.   
Many years later when steadiness came to his life he used to say: Those few  
days will ever remain in my memory. My friend actually lost money but gained  
faith in God. I actually gained money but lost faith in God. Even with the  
loss my friend kept his composure and could see God behind it. He was  
prepared. And his future life was characterized by that composure in the face  
of ups and downs. I had to suffer quite an agony but more than compensated by  
the huge gain. But still I could not see God's hand behind it. And my future  
life was characterized by tension and mental agony. But today things are  
becoming clear to me. Now I understand, whose gain it was and whose loss it  
was.   
cguru: What do you think of this?   
d: God's ways are strange.

Dear silentgreen,   
Once a devotee came to Sri Bhagavan and told Him to give permission to leave  
his family and lead a life on the Hill.   
Sri Bhagavan said: The family is in your mind. Even if you leave the family  
and live on the Hill, the mind will be thinking   
about your family. Further, leaving the family is not in your hands. It is in  
the hands of God. See my case, I left the family   
and came to Tiruvannamalai. See what has happened? There is bigger family  
around me now. I have to take care of their   
food, stay, safety etc., God's ways are strange.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am completely in tune with these words of Sri Ramakrishna. This reminded me  
about everlasting disputes about what is the nature of Brahman - is It/He/She  
Nirguna or Saguna. I like most the description of Sri Ramakrishna and Sri  
Ramana. Sri Ramakrishna has said: Quote  
> That which is the Absolute (Nirguna), impersonal beyond all attributes, is  
> also the same as the Personal God who is with all attributes and blessed  
> qualities. The Absolute Brahman again is inseparable from the Divine energy  
> (Sakti). The term "Brahman" refers to that aspect of Divinity which is  
> impersonal and which is beyond all activity. But when we think of Him as  
> creating, preserving and destroying all phenomena, then we call Him the  
> Personal God, Divine Mother or KÃ¢li. Brahman and Sakti are one.In reality  
> there is no distinction between "Brahman," or the Impersonal Absolute, and  
> "Sakti," the Divine Mother. The Brahman and the Sakti are one just as fire  
> and its burning power are one. As by the word fire we understand its power

The next stories are a bit too light, so was hesitating to post.   
One day the disciple bought a few books under the tree and was busy writing  
something.   
cguru: What are you doing?   
d: Writing a thesis.   
cguru: On what?   
d: God, soul and the world.   
cguru: ok   
Silence for some time.   
d: Do you have a story on thesis writing also?   
cguru: yes.   
d: What happens to the thesis writer finally, good or bad?   
cguru: Good only.   
d: But I will not listen to your story, else I won't be able to write my  
thesis.   
cguru: ok   
Both were doing their own work. The disciple was writing the thesis and cguru  
was preparing a strange garland, with flowers, cut fruits and cut vegetables.   
d: Why are you adding fruits and vegetables in the garland?   
cguru: To offer everything to God in one place.   
d: How strange!   
Again both continued to do their own work. The disciple was occasionally  
looking at the strange garland.   
Finally,   
d: Anyway, as long as you prepare that bizarre garland, I won't be able to  
concentrate on my thesis.   
So let me listen to your story.   
cguru: Then listen carefully.   
There were two pundits who wrote individual thesis which came to the following  
conclusions: 1st pundit: I live as I work.   
2nd pundit: I work as I live.   
Each of them insisted that his thesis was correct.   
They also insisted that the conclusions are not the same and only a very  
knowledegable and discerning person can follow their thesis. They decided to  
go to the king who was known for his wisdom and decide which thesis was  
correct.   
The king listened to both the thesis intently.   
After that the king made the pundits stand side by side with the outstretched  
left hand of one touching the outstretched right hand of the other; and their  
other two hands vertically upwards.   
In that posture the king pronounced a fine of Rs 1000 on each of them.   
The king gave seven days to arrange for the money.   
The pundits were shocked but could not say anything to the king.   
When they came out of the palace they discussed: What a mistake we made. What  
was the necessity of going to the king. After all, how much could have been  
our differences. We could have sorted it out ourselves. Now what trouble we  
have got into. Now we need to jointly work together and arrange for the money.   
After seven days, they arranged the money and came to the king's court.   
to be continued. ...

Very interesting story.Looks like cguru is fond of villupAttu and expects a  
few sideKicks who will prod him every now and then to come out of his silence  
and continue the story.Please permit me to be one the sidekicks.

reachâwhen we keep our feet firmly on the physical. âEarth is His  
footing,â (pAdOsya viswA bhootAni-Ravi)says the Upanishad whenever it images  
the Self that manifests in the universe. And it is certainly the fact that the  
wider we extend and the surer we make our knowledge of the physical world, the  
wider and surer becomes our foundation for the higher knowledge, even for the  
highest, even for the Brahmavidya._

To all the above wonderful posts, I add this of Tagore titled "Aanandadhara  
Bahiche Bhubane": Streams of Bliss are flowing across the Universe,   
Day and Night so many Nectar-like essence (of that Bliss) are overflowing the  
endless Sky,   
The Sun and the Moon drink handfuls of that (and Shine),   
And its undecaying Illumination remains always Luminous. ..   
... and fills the Earth with eternal Life and Light,   
(O Friend) Why are you sitting enclosed within your own thoughts?   
Why are you immersed within your little self?   
Look around expanding your heart,. ..   
... considering the little sorrows as trivial,. ..   
... and Fill your empty Life with that Bliss of Love, O Friend, fill your  
empty Life with that Bliss of Love.

_With the realization of Satchidananda one goes into samadhi. Then duties drop  
away. Suppose I have been talking about the ostad and he arrives. What need is  
there of talking about him then? How long does the bee buzz around? So long as  
it isn 't sitting on a flower. But it will not do for the sadhaka to renounce  
duties. He should perform his duties, such as worship, japa, meditation,  
prayer, and pilgrimage.   
If you see someone engaged in reasoning even after he has realized God, you  
may liken him to a bee, which also buzzes a little even while sipping honey  
from a flower_.

I never accepted then what he (Sri Ramakrishna) said. But, as time passed on,  
more and more did I understand from experience that what the Master said was  
right and what I had thought was wrong.   
As soon as I went to Dakshineswar, the Master gave me those books, which he  
forbade others to read. Among other books, a copy of the Ashtavakra Samhita  
was in his room. When the Master found anyone reading that book, he would  
forbid him and would give him instead such books as ?Mukti and How to Attain  
It?, the Bhagavad Gita, or some Purana. But, scarcely had I gone to him, when  
he took out that book and asked me to read it. Or, he would ask me to read  
some part of the Adhyatma Ramayana, which is full of non-dualistic ideas. I  
would reply, sometimes bluntly: ?What is the use of reading this book? It is a  
sin even to think: ?I am God?. The book teaches this blasphemy. It should be  
burnt". The Master would smile and say: ?Do I ask you to read it for yourself?  
I ask you to read a little to me. Please do it. In that case, you will not  
have to think that you are God?. So I had to read a little for him at his  
request.   
The magic touch of the Master [one] day immediately brought a wonderful change  
over my mind. I was astounded to find that really there was nothing in the  
Universe but God! I saw it quite clearly, but kept silent to see whether the  
impression would last; but it did not abate in the course of the day. I  
returned home, but there too, everything I saw appeared to be Brahman. I sat  
down to take my meal, but found that everything - the food, the plate, the  
person, who served, and even myself - was nothing but That. I ate a morsel or  
two and sat still. I was startled by my mother's words: ?Why do you sit still?  
Finish your meal", and then began to eat again. But all the while, whether  
eating or lying down, or going to college, I had the same experience and felt  
myself always in a sort of trance. While walking in the streets, I noticed  
cabs plying, but I did not feel inclined to move out of the way. I felt that  
the cabs and myself were of one stuff. There was no sensation in my limbs,  
which seemed to be becoming paralysed. I did not relish eating, and felt as if  
somebody else were eating. Sometimes I lay down during a meal; after a few  
minutes I got up and again began to eat. The result would be that on some days  
I would take too much, but it did no harm. My mother became alarmed and said  
that there must be something wrong with me. She was afraid that I might not  
live long. When there was a slight change in this state, the world began to  
appear dream-like. While walking in Cornwallis Square, I would strike my head  
against the iron railings to see if they were real or only a dream. This state  
of things continued for some days. When I became normal again, I realized that  
I must have had a glimpse of the Advaita state. Then it struck me that the  
words of the scriptures were not false. Thenceforth I could not deny the  
conclusions of the Advaita philosophy.
