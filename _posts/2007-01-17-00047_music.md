Namaste,   
Does anyone know where I can get a CD of the music file "Arunachala Siva" that  
was available on the older version of the website?   
In Bhagavan,   
Steven Jobe

Are these recordings actually of Bhagavan himself?

Bhagavan never gave permission to have his voice recorded, although he seemed  
more than willing to have people take his photo or make short home movies of  
him. There are no recordings of his voice in existence.
