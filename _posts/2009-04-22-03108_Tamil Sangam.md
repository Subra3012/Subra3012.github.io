## Sigmand Freud's Unconscious in the Light of Vedanta  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 21, 2009, 02:25:47 PM  
---  
The Mandukya Upanishad is one of the briefest expositions on   
Vedanta and is yet considered to be one of the most significant   
treatises. Its definitvely and authoritatively describes the structure   
of human being and the entire universe as being fourfold in nature.   
The first 'pada' (or quarter) is called Vaisvanara or Viswa, is   
the amalgamation of all the three energies, physical, vital and   
mental. The first part of the human system is amenable to   
observation by others in the form of its actions, expressions   
and general behaviour. This is called the waking state.   
This part of the human personality is the easiest to study and hence   
Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) termed it the 'Conscious" aspect   
of the human personality. As a medical practitioner and scientist,   
he commenced his study from this part.   
The second part is the mental aspect of the human being. While   
the 'mind' is present in the first part in a muted and invisible form,   
in the awakened body, in the second part everything is mental.   
The Upanishad calls the second part as 'of the nature of light' or   
Taijasa. The mental part of the human personaltiy reproduces all   
the experiences of the first part in a subtle or 'illumined' form. It   
is akin to a movie or video record of real-life experience. The waking state  
experiences the latter, while the mental state reproduces the former. This is  
why the purely mental state is called 'dreaming state' or Swapna. The  
dreaming conditions in the human being best delineates the mental state. The  
Upanishad calls it the 'inward consciousness' or Antar Prajna. This  
condition has all the characteristics of the waking state because it simply  
reproduces   
the stored memories of past experiences   
Sigmund Freud was fascinated by the dream state. He carried out a careful  
study of the dreams of his patients as also his own dreams. He noted, as the  
Upanishad indicates, that past experiences are replayed in dreams. He  
concluded that the dream is an important means of ventilating stored memories.  
He theorized that such stored memories could be said to have "an energy level"  
of their own.   
Negative energies could be said to have higher energy levels than   
normal or positive memories. One could say that the more difficult   
or traumatic the experience, the higher the energy required to store   
or suppress the energies. These energies forced itself out even in the waking  
condition in the manner of strange emotions and behaviour,   
which he termed as 'hysteria'.   
The Upanishads do not classify specifically dreams as negative or   
positive but state that they had the same characteristics as the waking state,  
except that they are in a subtle form. Both come out   
from the original cause, called chitta aham-kara.   
In his seminal work, titled The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud   
called it as 'Unconscious'. He said that that human being is not   
aware of this storehouse, but it had the tremendous capacity to create  
internal and external problems for the person. The Upanishad said that these  
memories relate even to the previous births of a   
person.   
Freud analyzed these dreams selectively. Modern existentialism   
has given a free reign to the expressions of these memories in   
various forms. [ e.g., surrealistic paintings]   
Freud stopped with analaysis of dream state. But the Upanishad,   
went further to the deep sleep state. Mandukya Upanishad gives   
this aspect a great deal of importance. This is called the third pada, or  
Sushupti state. It is a state of bliss, marked by the total absence of  
sensory phenomena and the absence of mind in all its aspects. The only  
consciousness in the deep sleep state is of a state of bliss.   
The Upanishad posits that the bliss of deep sleep condition is only a  
reflection of the blissful nature of Reality or Brahman. But in this deep  
sleep state, the jivatma no doubt experiences bliss but it is   
steeped in ignorance of Reality and does not recognize Brahman.   
Thus the state of deep sleep is one of blissful ignorance.   
However, the Upanishad goes on to state that "This Atma is Brahman." When  
that realization is achieved, the jivatma becomes Paramatma. The transition  
from the third part, represented by deep sleep state, to the fourth part or  
level that is realization of Brahmanhood is the most difficult sadhana.   
The Upanishad promises peace, auspiciousness and non duality or unity, as the  
resultant condition that is achieved by sadhana. One is advised to look into  
this deep sleep condition seriously and continuously and recognize the broad  
contours of one's soul,   
and yearn and struggle and contemplate union with Brahman.   
There is indeed no other path! i.e Nanyah pantha ayanaya vidyate!

What is Tamil Sangam ? who were the poets, were they Buddhists or Jains or  
Hindus?   
Acccording the Thiruvanaikaval history Kocengannan existed earlier in 1st  
millennium BC, one of earlier Cholas kings and at the same time great temples  
were already existed that time. The question is did hindusim was in decline  
period with the rise of buddhist and jains. Were Pallavas in fact earlier  
hindu and later jains then to back to hindus.

## Re:[1] Tamil Sangam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 22, 2009, 03:35:16 PM

Dear karthikeyan. M   
1\. There were three Tamil Sanghams. The first one was supposed   
to be existing around 2nd Century BC. The place was the then   
capital of Pandya Kings, which is called South Madurai. This is not   
today's Madurai. This was somewhere very much down below in the   
south, which portion was called Lemuria in Greek stories. There   
was a tsunami and much of the deep southern Tamil Nadu was   
engulfed by seas. In this first Tamil Sangam, Siva and Muruga   
themselves were supposed to be the leading poets in human forms.   
There is an old Tamil poem which says: "The God with matted locks   
who burnt Tripura with his third eye, and Kumara, the god who pierced the  
mountain (Krouncha) with his spear, were the first Tamil   
poets.   
2\. The second and third Tamil Sanghams were in Kapadapuram, which is again  
extinct and today's Madurai. This was between 2nd   
Century AD and 5th Century AD.   
3\. Tamil Nadu witnessed the rise of Buddhism and Jainism around   
4th Century AD. Whenever kings were supporting these faiths,   
Siva temples were in disrepair. No proper poojas were held. When   
Tiru Jnana Sambandhar took birth (he is again Skanda), he vanquished these  
faiths and restored Saivism to its pristine glory.   
This was around 6th century.   
4\. The later kings including Pallavas, who ruled the northern Tamil   
Nadu from Cuddalore to Madras, were also frequently switching   
over their faiths and they were brought back to Saivism by some   
miracles. Saivism had no quarrel with Advaita, in fact it is Siva-   
Sakti qualified non dualism. Hence Sankara's avatara in 7th century   
did not make much difference even though Advaita took roots slowly   
due to its pre-eminent approach. Vaishnavism and Saivism both thrived in  
Tamil Nadu. There were quarreling over philosophy, and   
supremacy of Siva over Narayana and vice versa, but the temples were not  
affected.   
5\. Saivism spread to Sri Lanka during Saint Manikkavachagar's   
time. But this Saint's period is a historical mystery. Many hold   
a view that he lived around 9th century. But I believe that he   
lived before the great three, that is around 3rd Century AD. He   
told pure Jnana Marga in his works, whereas the other three spoke   
of bhakti marga even though they admitted Jnana Marga as the final  
destination.   
For further details, if you want you may read "The rise of Tamil   
literature" by Vaiyapuri Pillai. The name in Tamil is Ilakkiya   
Udhayam. It is available in Saiva Siddhanta Book Publishing House,   
Raja Annamalai Puram, Chennai.
