Today I read in Bangalore newspaper, that Mr. Vatal Nagaraj,   
the leader of one party called Kannada Chauluvalikar has announced   
that he will do 'pada poojas' for donkeys and then proceed for   
his campaigning. He has also assured that, if elected, he will   
work for estabishing a Donkey Development Authority and he   
will also declare a weekly holiday from work for donkeys. Any   
such declarations from any other States?

Dear Sankar, there are two posts from you, one on 'Stay' and another   
on 'Stay at Ashram'. In this connection, one 'seeker' has already asked how  
to go to Tiruvannamalai. Several forum members have given replies   
about going to Tiruvannamalai and staying in the Asram. I have also given my  
replies on 28th June. Please see that post from 'seeker' for details. The  
topic heading is: How to go to Tiruvannamalai?'

Dear Sankar and others, I have already given details regarding   
stay in the Ashram, to various seekers, under "Asharam" head   
of the forum. Please look into that.

Dear Sankar, Once you confirm your trip, please tell me two days   
before the travel and I can give you certain finer tips to observe   
in Tiruvannamalai.
