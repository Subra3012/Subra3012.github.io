I think, it is more than 3 weeks. I hope and pray that the   
Temple authorities lift the ban and permit cameras which   
are sending the photographs of the Hill every 60 second.   
I request fellow Forum members to join the prayer.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Graham, I am seeing image of Arunachala in webcam,   
in replacement of the notice about police ban. When has it   
been restored? I am very happy. Arunachala Siva.
