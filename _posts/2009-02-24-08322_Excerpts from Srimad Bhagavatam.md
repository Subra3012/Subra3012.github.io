King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
otherâs glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunterâs net, she was  
overwhelmed with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried  
out to her in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound  
by the ropes of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by  
anguish. Being in the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot  
herself, and rushing forward to her helpless children, she was immediately  
bound in the hunterâs net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to  
him than life itself, fatally bound in the hunterâs net along with his  
dearmost wife, whom he considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male  
pigeon began to lament wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunterâs net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: âThe party will detect, by the noise of the  
bangles, that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to  
engage others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on  
each handâ. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand.  
Even those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each  
hand. There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt  
from the girlâs experience the following: Living among many would create  
discord, disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might  
be unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain  
alone in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisanâs mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kingâs passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberationâ.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

**_Nanda Recapitulates the Words of Garga Before the Puzzled Gopas_**  
 **Suka said:  'The gopas witnessing this kind of activities of Krishna, had no idea how He  
could have done this and most astonished approached Nanda saying to him:  'How could the boy, considering His extraordinary activities, deserve a birth  
among simple worldly men, that for Himself is not worthy of respect? How can a  
boy of seven years old, playfully with one hand hold up the best of all hills,  
just like a mighty elephant holds up a lotus flower? As a young child with  
hardly His eyes open, He sucked [the poisoned milk] from the breast of the  
greatly powerful Putana, in the process also sucking away her life air, just  
like the force of time sucks away the youth from a body. When He, a few months  
old lying beneath a cart was crying, He with His legs turned over the cart.At  
the age of one, while sitting peacefully He was taken up into the sky by the  
demon Trnavarta. But baby Kṛṣṇa grabbed the demon?s neck, causing him great  
pain, and thus killed him. One day His mother tied Him to a large mortar  
because He had stolen butter. He [crawling with the mortar] on His hands moved  
between the two arjuna trees and caused their crash. He together with  
Balarama and the boys grazing the calves in the forest, with His two arms tore  
apart the beak of the enemy Baka(demon,bird of deceit) who wanted to kill Him.  
Vatsa, [another demon] desirous to kill Him, in the form of a calf hid among  
the other calves. Krishna killed him and sportively [throwing the corpse in a  
tree] made kapittha fruits fall down. Together with Balarama killing the  
jackass demon [Dhenuka] and his jackass companions, He secured the safety of  
the beautiful Talavana forest that was full of ripe fruits. After arranging  
that the terrible Pralamba would be killed by the most powerful Balarama, He  
released Vraja's gopas and their animals from a forest fire.**   
 **Subduing the most venomous chief of the snakes,Kaliya, by climbing on top  
of him, He managed to defeat his pride and with force send him away from the  
lake of the Yamuna, the water of which thus was freed from its poison. Dear  
Nanda, how can it be that all of us inhabitants of Vraja cannot give up our  
feelings of love for your son, who on His part is just as natural towards us?  
The fact that He as a boy of seven years old has lifted the big hill, has oh  
master of Vraja, raised questions about your son. '   
Nanda said: 'Please listen to my words dear gopas. Let go of your doubt  
concerning the boy. This is what Garga in the past has told me referring to  
this child: And this one, the son of Yas'oda,has according to the yuga accepted forms with  
a white, a red or a yellow color. Now He is Krishna [of a dark complexion].  
This child previously was born somewhere else as the son of Vasudeva and  
therefore the ones who know this will speak about this child of yours as the  
glorious Vasudeva. There are many names and forms according to the qualities  
and activities of His appearances. These are known to me, but the common  
people do not know them. Being a Nanda-Gokula cowherd this child will always  
act to what is most beneficial to all of you. With His support you will easily  
overcome all dangers. Oh King of Vraja, in the past, when there was a faulty  
regime, He has protected pious souls who were disturbed by rogues so that  
they, with those bad elements defeated, could flourish. Just like the ones  
faithful to Vishnu have nothing to fear from the Asuras, those who are as  
fortunate to associate with this child in love and affection, will not be  
overcome by enemies. Therefore, oh Nanda, take the greatest care raising this  
child. As for His qualities, opulences, name and fame this son of yours is as  
good as Narayana!' After Garga had pointed this out to me, he went home. Ever  
since I consider Krishna, who frees us from all obstacles, an expansion of  
Supreme Lord,Narayana.'   
Having heard Nanda's words about what Garga had said, the residents of Vraja,  
enlivened by him and with their perplexity gone, worshiped Lord Krishna. The  
demigod [Indra] who caused the rain, made in his anger about the loss of his  
sacrifice, the cowherds, animals and women suffer by engaging lightning bolts,  
hail and winds. Krishna considering Himself their only shelter smiled out of  
compassion and in order to protect the cowherd community picked up the hill  
with one hand the way a small child picks up a mushroom.   
May He, the Lord of the Cows, the destroyer of the conceit of the great king  
of the sky, be satisfied with us!'

**_Lord Rishabhadeva 's Teachings to His Sons_**  
 **Lord Rishabha said: 'My dear sons, this body you carry along within this material world, does not  
deserve it to suffer under the difficulties of a sense gratification of dogs  
and hogs. It is rather worth the trouble of undergoing the divine austerity by  
which the heart finds its purification and one thus achieves infinite  
spiritual happiness. Serving the great souls, so one says, is the way of  
liberation and to seek the association of those who are attached to women is  
the gateway to darkness. Truly advanced are they who have an equal regard for  
all, are peaceful, take no offense, wish all the best and know how to behave.  
They who are eager to live in a loving relationship with Me, and who are not  
so attached to people only interested in the physical aspect of life  
consisting of a home, spouse, children, wealth, friends and making money,  
engage only in the world insofar it is necessary. I consider the madly being  
engaged in unwanted activities,for the sake of this material satisfaction,as  
not befitting the soul who therefrom arrived at this temporary body despite  
the misery associated with it. As long as one does not want to know about the  
reality of the soul, as long as one's mind is absorbed in worldly activities,  
one is factually defeated by one's own ignorance, for being entangled in one's  
karma,one is bound to this material body. For as long as unto Me, Vasudeva,  
there is no love, a soul thus being ruled by ignorance will have a mind  
following the lead of fruitive activities, and as long as that is the case one  
will not be free from the miseries of the body one is identified with. When  
one even properly educated does not see how inefficient and inappropriate the  
endeavor of gratifying the senses,in an unregulated manner, is, one will, not  
thinking properly about one's self-interest, very soon be crazy about it and  
as a fool find nothing but material miseries in a homely existence ruled by  
sexual intercourse. Because of the sexual attraction between man and woman  
both their hearts are tied together and therefrom they call for a home, a  
territory, children, wealth and relatives. That is the illusion of the living  
being known as 'I' and 'mine'. The moment the tight mental knot in the heart  
of such a person, bound by the consequences of his karma is slackened, the  
conditioned soul turns away from this false conception of 'us' and then,  
forsaking that cause of egoism, being liberated returns to the transcendental  
world. With the use of one's intelligence one can give up the false  
identification with the material world, the cause of material bondage, by  
following a spiritually advanced person, a Guru as also by devotional service  
unto Me, by not desiring, by exercising tolerance with the dual world and by  
inquiries; by realizing the truth of the miseries of the living beings  
everywhere; by practicing austerities and penances and by giving up on sensual  
pleasures; by working for Me, listening to stories about Me as also by always  
keeping company with the ones devoted; by singing about My qualities, by  
freedom from enmity, by being equal to all, by subduing one's emotions oh  
sons; by trying to forsake the identification with one's home and body, by  
studying yoga literatures; by living alone, by entirely controlling the  
breath, the senses and the mind; by developing faith, by continually observing  
celibacy, by constant vigilance, by restraint of speech; by thinking of Me,  
seeing Me everywhere, by developing knowledge and through wisdom in being  
illumined by the practice of yoga; and by being endowed with determination,  
enthusiasm and goodness.  
**When one by means of this yoga practice,completely being liberated from  
desiring results, as I 've told you, has untied the knot of the bondage in  
one's heart that was caused by ignorance, one,finally also, must desist from  
this method of detachment,this yoga,itself.   
 The king or Guru who desiring My abode considers reaching Me to be the goal  
of life, should in this manner relating to his sons or disciples, be of  
instruction not to engage in wordly activities,but not get angry with them  
when they lacking in spiritual knowledge want to. For what can one achieve  
when one engages someone simply in laboring for the profit? In fact such a  
king or Guru would cause the ones whose vision is clouded,by material motives,  
to fall down. On other hand,ignorant ones should be instructed not to refrain  
from work and duty completely,but to work only in the spirit of devotion and  
detachment.   
 People who obsessed in their desire for material goods have lost sight of  
their real welfare, live with their efforts for the sake of temporary  
happiness in enmity with each other and run, foolish as they are, without  
having a clue, into all kinds of trouble. If someone is ignorant and addicted  
to the path of samsara(ocean of birth and death), how can one who is actually  
learned, merciful and advanced in spiritual knowledge engage him in fruitive  
activity and thus further entangle him in material existence? If a blind man  
is walking down the wrong path, how can a gentleman allow him to continue on  
his way to danger? How can he approve this method? No wise or kind man can  
allow this. Someone not capable of delivering his dependance from the cycle of  
rebirth must not evolve into a father, a mother, a spouse, a spiritual teacher  
or a worshipable godhead. I who am inconceivable have a heart of pure  
goodness filled with dharma. Because I left adharma far behind Me the  
faithful ones truthfully call me The Best One or Rishabha. You are all born  
from My heart, therefore try with a pure intelligence to be of service to your  
brother Bharata, he who rules the people as the most exalted one.   
Among the manifested forms of existence the living ones are superior to the  
ones without life(dull matter), and among them the ones who move around are  
far superior to the plants. Of those the ones who developed intelligence are  
better and the best ones among them are the human beings. The ghosts are the  
better because they have no material bodies,and the singers of heaven [the  
Gandharvas] are superior to them again. Next one finds the perfected ones [the  
Siddhas] above whom the superhuman beings [the Kinnaras] are situated. The  
unenlightened ones [the Asuras who can master the ones before mentioned] are  
dominated by the gods lead by Indra and above them the sons of Brahma, like  
Daksha,are situated. Lord Shiva is the best of them and above him we find Lord  
Brahma from whom he originated. He on his turn is a devotee of Mine, I, the  
God of the Gods of rebirth. Because I am inclined to the brahmaṇa, the  
brahmana is best of all. I do not know oh learned ones, anyone who is superior  
to him. With him I eat with more satisfaction from the food that by the people  
with faith and love in proper ceremony was offered, than from the food which  
was offered in the fire. It is the brahmin who maintains my eternal and  
shining body [in the form of the Vedas] in this world. In him one finds the  
belief and authority of the [eight brahminical] qualities of supreme goodness  
[sattva], purification [pavitra], control over the mind [s'ama] and the senses  
[dama], truthfulness [satya], mercy [anugraha], penance [tapasya] and  
tolerance [titiksha]. From Me, the One of unlimited prowess who higher than  
the highest is capable of redemption and bestowing all the heavenly happiness,  
they want nothing at all. To whom else would they who perform their devotional  
service without claiming worldly possessions turn to then? My dear sons, with  
your vision cleared be at all times of respect for all living beings that move  
and not move, for I reside in all of them. That is the way you should respect  
Me. Engage all of your mind, your words and the perception of all your active  
and receptive senses directly in My worship, for without doing so a person  
will not be able to free himself from the great illusion which is Yama's  
deathtrap.'   
5;5**

**Jnana Yoga or the Denomination and the Real**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'When one understands that the world, this combination of matter and person,  
is based upon one and the same reality, one should refrain from praising and  
criticizing someone else's nature and activities. He who praises or criticizes  
someone else's nature and actions quickly strays from his [real] interest,  
because he thus adheres to the falsehood [of the world of opposites]. A person  
aware of the objective diversity is just as an embodied soul whose senses,  
overcome by sleep, experience the illusory reality of a dream, or the  
deathlike state of having lost consciousness. What would be good or what would  
be bad in this unreal, deceptive material duality that, considered by the mind  
and put into words, results in a false image of reality? Even though shadows,  
echoes and mirages constitute mere suggestions, they create motives; the same  
way the body and what belongs to it gives rise to material conceptions  
[identifications] that create fear until the day one dies,for they offer no  
firm hold. The Master, the Lord, the Soul alone, manifests this universe and  
Himself, protects all that exists and Himself,and withdraws both the creation  
and Himself. Apart from the Soul, outside of Him, hence no separate living  
being can be found, just as no other basis can be found for this, within the  
Self perceived, threefold splendor of the gunas - that you must know as the  
threefold manifestation generated by the illusory energy of maya. Someone who,  
perfectly conversant and experienced, is well aware of what I have now  
described, does not blame or praise, and wanders the earth as free as the sun.  
When one by direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural truth and one's  
self-realization knows that that what is inessential has a beginning and an  
end, one should move around in this world free from attachment.'   
Uddhava said: 'My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to  
be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which  
is the seen object. On the one hand, the Soul is innately endowed with perfect  
knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living  
entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain? The  
inexhaustible soul, free from the modes, is pure, self-luminous and uncovered  
just like a fire, while the material body is like firewood that is without  
understanding. To which of the two belongs the experience of a material life  
in this world?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'As long as the soul is attracted to the body, the  
senses and the life force, material existence will continue to flourish,  
despite being meaningless. Even though not having a purpose of its own, the  
course of mundane existence [the 'wheel'] does not cease to exist; one keeps,  
like being caught in a dream, contemplating the objects of the senses and the  
meaninglessness arriving with it. Although while dreaming a person  
experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused  
by the dream experiences. Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion,  
hankering and such, one observes with the birth and death of the false ego  
[ahankara] and is not seen with the soul, that does not take birth or die. The  
Soul,Jiva,who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and  
who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially  
conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the  
total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he  
is forced to run here and there within material existence. Although the false  
ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms - as the functions of  
the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of  
transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of spiritual Master, a Sober  
sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from  
all material attachment. Spiritual knowledge [jnana] is based on  
discrimination of spirit and matter and is nourished by scripture and penance,  
personal experience, historical accounts and logical inference. It is based  
upon that what is there in the beginning, what stays the same in between and  
what remains in the end of this creation, Ultimate Cause, Brahman,Absolute  
Truth. Just like gold alone being present before it is processed, when it is  
processed and in the final product of the processing, I am present in  
different disguises of this creation. While manifesting itself in the form of  
the three modes as the causing [of rajas], the caused [of tamas] and the  
causal agent [of sattva),(the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of  
perception),in its three conditions of wakefulness, sleep and unconscious  
sleep, this spirit of condensed knowledge,my dearest Uddhava,this  
transcendental intelligence, constitutes the fourth factor [the 'gold' or  
turiya], that as an independent variable stands for the single, Absolute Truth  
of each of them. That what was absent before, is absent afterwards and is not  
there in between, is but a designation, a reference. Whatever that was created  
and is known by something else, is actually only [a reference to] that  
something else - that is how I see it. Although thus not existing in reality,  
this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears  
real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits  
Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects,  
the mind and the elements of physical nature. When one by discriminating this  
way has achieved clarity about the Absolute Truth, one must wisely speak  
against the opposite [of falsely identifying oneself], cut with the doubt  
regarding the Soul and in the contentment of one's own spiritual happiness  
desist from all lusty matters.   
 The body made of earth is not the true self, nor are the senses that, their  
gods or the life air, the external air, water, fire or a mind only interested  
in matter ['food']; nor is the intelligence that, material consciousness, the  
I that thinks itself the doer, the ether, the earth, material things or the  
restraint [the universal primeval state of equilibrium]. For one who has  
properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme, what credit is there if  
his senses - mere products of the material modes - are perfectly concentrated  
in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses  
happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds  
come and go? Just as the sky itself is not affected by the coming and going  
qualities of the atmosphere, fire, water and earth or by the qualities of the  
seasons, also the Imperishable Supreme remains free from the influence of  
sattva, rajas and tamas, the modes that constitute the cause of the I-concept  
of material existence. Nevertheless, until one by steadfast devotion to Me has  
banned all the impurity of passion from one's mind, one must avoid the  
attachment with the modes that was produced by the deluding material energy.  
The same way a disease that was treated imperfectly time and again returns and  
gives a man trouble, also a mind not purified of its karmic contamination will  
torment an inexperienced yogi who is still of all kinds of attachment.  
Imperfect yogis who are commanded by impediments in the form of the human  
beings [family members, disciples etc.] sent to them by the demigods will, by  
their perseverance in their previous life, once again [in a new life] engage  
in the practice of yoga, but never more be entangled in fruitive activities.  
An ordinary living being performs material work and is transformed by the  
reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue  
working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however,  
having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires  
and does not engage in fruitive work. Someone whose consciousness is fixed in  
the True Self does not give it a moment's thought whether he is standing,  
sitting, walking or lying down, urinating, eating food or doing whatever else  
that manifests from his conditioned nature. When one is intelligent one does  
not take anything else [but the soul] for essential. Whenever such a one faces  
the not really existing matters of the senses, he from his logic denies them  
their separateness, so that they are like the things of a dream that disappear  
when one wakes up. The soul is not something one accepts or rejects [that  
comes and goes], but the ignorance [resulting in a material body] that you in  
many forms,under the influence of karma and guna accepted as an inextricable  
part of yourself, My best one, [ultimately] dissolves again in that knowledge.  
Just as the rising sun puts and end to the darkness in the human eye, also a  
clever and thorough search for My pure truth puts an end to the darkness of  
someone's intelligence. The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and  
immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives  
everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words  
cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.  
Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of  
the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from  
one?s own soul. The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in  
terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are  
pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.   
The body of a yogi who with a lack of experience tries to engage in the  
practice of yoga, may be hindered by rising disturbances. In that case the  
following rule of conduct is prescribed. Some disturbances may be overcome by  
postures [asanas] combined with concentration exercises [dharana], others can  
be defeated by penances [tapas], mantras and medicinal herbs. Certain  
inauspicious matters one can overcome step by step by constantly thinking of  
Me, by [loudly or silently] honoring My names and such [japa, sankirtana] and  
by following in the footsteps of the masters of yoga. Some [yogis] keep their  
bodies under control and make them fit by focussing on health, employing  
different methods and exercises for the sake of material perfection [siddhis].  
It goes without saying that good health should not be worshiped when such an  
endeavor is useless, for in matters of the body one is, just like a fruit on a  
tree, subject to decay. Although the material body of someone regularly  
practicing yoga will attain fitness, being intelligent My devotee does not put  
faith in such yoga and will give it up. The yogi who, free from desires takes  
to My shelter and practices this process of yoga, experiences the inner  
happiness and accepts no defeat by disturbances.'**

**_Bhakti Yoga: the Most Auspicious way to Conquer Death_**  
 **Uddhava said:  'This process of yoga is, I think, most difficult to execute for someone not  
spiritual. Please oh Acyuta, tell me in simple terms how a person may easily  
succeed. Generally oh Lotus-eyed One,yoga practitioners get frustrated trying  
to unite the mind and, unable to find absorption, grow weary of subduing their  
thoughts. For that reason oh Lotus-eyed Lord of the Universe, the swanlike  
delight in taking to the shelter of Your lotus feet that are the source of all  
ecstasy, while they who take pride in the results of their yoga, do not and  
are defeated by Your material energy. It comes as no surprise Acyuta, that You  
as a friend to all servants with no other shelter, are joined in intimacy with  
them, You who as Rama were affectionate with the animal-like,Vanaras, while  
the edges of Your footstool were covered by the effulgent helmets of the great  
controllers [like Brahma]. Knowing the benefit You offer,oh Supreme Soul,  
Bestower of All Perfections and dearest Lord to those seeking shelter, who  
would reject You or ever be devoted to anything else and forget about You in  
exchange for some opulence? What would not be granted to us when we serve the  
dust of Your feet? O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual  
science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were  
endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahma, for You appear in two features-  
externally as the Guru, and internally as the Supersoul-to deliver the  
embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.'   
Suka said: 'Thus questioned by Uddhava, who in his heart was most attached to  
Him, the Lord of all Lords spoke lovingly with an attractive smile, He who-  
with the universe as His plaything - by His energies assumed His three  
[principal] forms [the guna-avataras].'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'I shall explain to you My most auspicious dharma by means of which, with  
faith executed, a mortal being may defeat unconquerable death. He whose mind  
is attracted to My devotional service and has offered his heart and  
intelligence unto Me, should remember to perform step by step all his  
prescribed duties for My sake. One should take shelter of the holy places  
frequented by My saintly devotees and follow the example of the conduct of My  
devotees among the demigods, humans and demons. Either alone or in  
association one should with respect for the position of the moon, at special  
occasions and at festivals engage in singing and dancing and so on, with royal  
opulence and generous contributions. With a pure heart one should see Me, the  
Supreme Soul free as the sky, as being present within and without oneself and  
all living beings Oh brightest spirit, when one with My love thus is of  
respect for all living beings, one with such an approach has the highest  
possible knowledge, the absolute unity of spirit. This way regarding the  
brahmin and the outcast, the thief and the man faithful to the brahminical  
culture, the sun and the spark, the gentle one and the cruel one equally, one  
is considered a wise person. Of the person who constantly meditates upon My  
presence in all men quickly the rivalry, envy, disdain and false ego will  
disappear. Ignoring the laughter of one's friends and without being  
embarrassed about outer appearances one should throw oneself like a rod to the  
ground and offer one's obeisances to all, even to dogs, outcasts, cows and  
asses. With that what one says, thinks and does, one this way will have to be  
of worship as long as one has not developed the vision of Me being present in  
all living beings. For the one who by knowledge and realization sees the  
Supreme Soul everywhere, everything is based upon the Absolute Truth. Thus  
free from doubt he should desists from material striving, karmic activities. I  
consider this - with the functions of one's mind, words and actions seeing Me  
within all living beings - the most appropriate of all processes. My dear,when  
one thus tries to be of service unto Me Uddhava, because of this perfectly  
established method,free from the modes and without ulterior motives,there is  
not even the slightest loss. Oh best among the pious souls, when one is  
capable of performing one's duty free from ulterior motives for the sake of  
Me, the One Supreme, fear and such, will be futile. Activities offered to Me  
without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to  
the actual process of religion. This process is the supreme intelligence of  
the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one  
can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to come to Me, the  
eternal reality.   
This survey both in brief and in detail I thus explained to you, constitutes  
the complete science of the Absolute Truth,that even for the demigods is  
difficult to access. With clear, logical arguments I repeatedly explained to  
you the spiritual knowledge; properly understood this will put an end to the  
doubts a person may have and liberate him. He who concentrates on this  
question of yours as also on My clear reply, will attain the eternal secret of  
the Vedas, the Supreme, Absolute Truth. I shall naturally, give Myself to  
that person who without reservation passes on to devotees this traditional  
instruction of Mine, this knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He who repeats [for  
others] this Supreme Knowledge, that is so sanctifying and clear, reveals My  
presence with the lamp of knowledge and will find purification day after day.  
The person who attentively and with faith regularly listens to this and is of  
transcendental devotional service unto Me [is a bhakta], will not get  
entangled in karmic activities. Do not share this with a hypocrite, an atheist  
or a cheat, nor with someone not willing to listen, a non-devotee or an  
obstinate person. Share it with a person free from these bad qualities,  
someone virtuous and pure, kindly disposed and dedicated to the welfare of the  
brahmins, as also with laborers and women if they are of devotion. For the  
inquisitive one fully understanding this, there is nothing further to know;  
once one has drunk the nectar of this palatable beverage nothing will remain.  
Everything that people of success with the four goals of life may find in  
knowledge, fruitive labor, mystic yoga, ordinary activities or in political  
ruling, you can equally find in Me My best one. When a mortal surrenders  
himself to Me and forsakes all his fruitive labor in his desire of service, he  
at that time attains freedom from birth and death and qualifies for sharing in  
My nature.'   
11;29**

**_The Deliverance of Mucukunda_**  
 **Suka said: 'Seeing Him coming out of the city like the rising moon, most beautiful to  
behold, with a dark complexion, a yellow silk garment, the S'rivatsa on His  
chest, the brilliant Kaustubha gem decorating His neck, His mighty, long four  
arms and eyes as pink as newly grown lotuses, His always effulgent, clean,  
joyful smile to His beautiful cheeks, His lotus like face and the display of  
His shark-shaped earrings, he,Kalayavana, thought: 'This person indeed,with  
the S'rivatsa, the four arms, the lotus eyes, wearing forest-flowers and with  
a great beauty, must be Vasudeva. Considering the marks as mentioned by Narada  
He, going there without weapons on foot, can be no one else. I'll fight Him  
without weapons!' Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back  
and ran away. Kalayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogis  
cannot attain Him. With every step He seemed to be within the reach of his  
hands, but after thus being taken a great distance by the Lord, the leader of  
the Yavanas was led to a mountain cave. In his pursuit he insulted Him with  
words like 'Fleeing does not behove someone like You born in the Yadu  
dynasty!' Yet he, whose mischief had not found its end, could not get hold of  
Him. Despite being insulted this way, the Supreme Lord entered the mountain  
cave. The Yavana followed Him, but saw another man lying there. 'And now,  
bringing me this long distance, He is lying down here like a saint!' Thus  
erroneously thinking that the man was Acyuta, he struck him full force with  
his foot. The man woke up after a long period of sleep and slowly opened his  
eyes. Looking around in every direction, he saw him standing at his side. Oh  
descendant of Bharata, by the glance the angered man cast on him, he was  
instantly burned to ashes by a fire that was generated from within his own  
body.'   
The honorable king Parikchit said: 'Who precisely was that person oh brahmin,  
of which family was he and of what powers? Why had he retreated into the cave  
to sleep and from whose seed was that destroyer of the Yavana born?'   
Suka said: 'He is known as Mucukunda. He was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty as a  
son of Mandhata. He is a great personality devoted to the brahminical order  
and someone true to his vow in battle. On the request for help of the gods  
headed by Indra who were terrified because of the Asuras, he for a long time  
was of service to assure them their protection. After having secured Guha [  
Skanda or Karttikeya] as their guardian of heaven, they said to Mucukunda: 'Oh  
King, please desist from the difficult task to protect us. Forgetting all your  
personal desires, you oh hero, with the abandoning of a kingdom in the world  
of man, have removed those asura thorns for our protection. Your children,  
your queens and your other relatives, ministers, advisors and subjects do not  
live anymore. Time has swept them away. The Supreme, Inexhaustible Lord of  
Control is the Time itself, more powerful than the most powerful ones, who,  
playing a game of herdsman and flock, sets the mortal beings in motion. We  
wish you all good fortune, please choose today any benediction from us, except  
for the boon of liberation that can only be conferred by the Supreme  
Inexhaustible Lord.'   
He who for his great fame thus was addressed by the demigods, respectfully  
saluted them and entered a cave to enjoy the sleep the gods had granted him.  
After the barbarian was burned to ashes, the Supreme Lord, the great hero of  
the Satvatas, revealed Himself to sage Mucukunda. He as dark as a cloud, was  
clad in a yellow, silken garment, carried the S'rivatsa on His chest and the  
brilliant Kaustubha gem that radiated. With His four arms and the beautifying  
Vaijayant? garland, with His attractive, calm face and glittering shark-shaped  
earrings, with His affectionate smile appealing to all mankind and His glance,  
with His youthful handsome form, His noble gait and His fire that was like  
that of a lion, He formed an appearance of an overwhelming effulgence. Facing  
this unassailable splendor he who was highly intelligent, filled with awe  
hesitantly posed a question.   
Mucukunda said: 'Who are You to join with me in the wilderness in a mountain  
cave, while You with Your feet, that are like the petals of a lotus, walk the  
thorny ground? Maybe You are the Supreme Lord, the origin of all empowered  
beings, or else the god of fire, the sun god, the moon god, the king of heaven  
or perhaps a ruler from another planet. I think You are the leading godhead  
among the principal demigods, the Greatest One, for You dispel the darkness of  
this cave [the 'heart'] like a lamp with its light. Oh Most Eminent Among All  
Man, if You like, please describe truthfully for us eager to hear, Your birth,  
activities and lineage. We from our side oh tiger among men, are descendants  
of Ikshvaku, a family of kshatriyas(warriors). And I was born from the son of  
Yuvanas'va and am called Mucukunda oh Lord. Because I remained awake for a  
long time and my fatigued senses were overwhelmed by sleep, I for my comfort  
laid down in this solitary place. Then I was awakened by someone. That person  
because of his sinful mentality turned to ashes. Immediately thereafter I then  
saw Your good Self so glorious, oh Chastiser of the Enemies. Because of Your  
unbearable effulgence we, being diminished in our faculties, cannot behold You  
oh most Gracious One, You deserve it to be honored by all embodied beings!'**   
 **Thus being addressed by the king, the Supreme Lord and Origin of the Entire  
Creation replied with a broad smile using words rumbling as deep as the  
clouds.   
 The Supreme Lord said: 'There are thousands of My births, activities and names My dear one, limitless  
as they are, they cannot even be enumerated by Me! Some time, after many  
lives, one may succeed in counting all the dust particles of the earth, but  
that will never be accomplished with My qualities, activities, names and  
births. Not even the greatest sages enumerating My births and activities that  
take place in respect of the three aspects of time [past, present, future] oh  
King, can reach the end. Nonetheless oh friend, just listen to what I have to  
tell you about My current birth. In the past I was beseeched by Lord Brahma  
to secure the dharma and destroy the demons who constituted a burden to the  
earth. Thus I descended into the Yadu dynasty in the home of Vasudeva and  
because of that fact the people call Me Vasudeva, the son of Vasudeva. I  
killed Kalanemi, as also Kamsa, Pralamba and others who were hateful with  
the virtuous souls. This Yavana oh King, was burned by your scorching glance.  
I, the one person caring for the devotees, approached this cave for the sake  
of favoring you, for in the past you have often prayed for it. Tell Me what  
blessing you want from Me oh saintly King, I will fulfill all your wishes. Any  
person who has satisfied Me, will never again need to lament.'   
Suka said: 'Thus being addressed Mucukunda bowed down to Him and spoke.  
Knowing He was Narayana, the Godhead, he filled with joy remembered the words  
of Garga. Mucukunda said: 'Man being cheated by Your bewildering potency maya  
oh Lord, is not of worship for You. Not understanding the true purpose of life  
he - whether he is male or female - seeking his happiness gets entangled in  
household affairs that make him unhappy. That person has an impure mind who,  
despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly  
evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal  
that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness  
of a material home. Oh Unconquerable One, I thus have wasted my time with  
building a kingdom and acquiring opulence, which now is all gone. Intoxicated  
like an earthly ruler who mistakes his mortal frame for himself, I suffered  
endless anxieties because of having gotten attached to children, wives, riches  
and land. Minding this body, which is a confinement like a pot or a wall, I  
thus thought myself to be a god among man. Surrounded by chariots, elephants,  
horses, infantry and generals I traveled around on this earth, but, in my  
great pride, I never seriously regarded You. Forgetful about what needs to be  
done, hankering for sense objects and endlessly ruminating with an ever  
growing greed, one is suddenly placed before You, who are as attentive as a  
hungry snake licking its fangs to kill a mouse. The same vehicle of time, the  
body that first was called 'the king' riding in chariots furnished with gold  
or on fierce elephants, is unavoidably in the course of time named 'feces',  
'worms' and 'ashes'. Full circle having conquered the directions, without  
further conflicts, being seated on a throne and praised by rulers alike, the  
person in his home is led about like a pet animal while deriving his happiness  
from intercourse with women oh Lord. A king who desires even greater power  
than he already has strictly performs his duties, carefully practicing  
austerity and forgoing sense enjoyment. But he whose urges are so rampant,  
thinking ?I am independent and supreme,? cannot attain happiness. When the  
wandering person reaches the end of his material existence, he oh Infallible  
One, will find the association of those who are good and honest [the sat-  
sanga]. Thereupon the devotion for Him will come about, He who, as the Lord of  
the Higher and Lower, is the only object for the pious souls. Oh Lord, I  
think that with the spontaneous disappearance of my attachment to my kingdom,  
You have shown me Your mercy. For that is what the saintly rulers of endless  
stretches of land pray for when they enter the forest in want of their  
solitude. I do not desire anything else but to be of service at Your feet,  
for they are to those not desiring a material life the object of desire, the  
boon that is sought oh Almighty One. Which faithful man of worship for You,  
the Bestower of the Path of Emancipation oh Lord, would choose as a boon for  
that which causes his bondage? Therefore oh Lord, entirely putting aside the  
worldly blessings because of which one is entangled in the modes of passion,  
ignorance and goodness, I approach You, the Original Person of Pure Knowledge,  
who free from mundane designations and duality, is transcendental to the  
modes. Tormented by disturbances I, for a long time, was full of sorrow being  
distressed in the world. With my six enemies [the senses and the mind] never  
being satisfied there was no way to find peace oh Bestower of the Shelter.  
Please oh Lord, protect me who, facing these dangers oh Supreme Soul, has  
approached Your lotus feet, the Truth that is free from sorrow and fear.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh great King, emperor of all, you have a pure and  
capable mind, for, even though you were tempted to ask for benedictions, you  
were not spoiled by desires. Please know that I tempted you with benedictions  
to ascertain whether you are free from bewilderment. The intelligence of the  
ones devoted to Me is never diverted by material blessings. Those not devoted  
to Me who occupy themselves with breathing exercises and such,but did not  
diminish their material desires [the vasanas] oh King, so that one sees that  
their minds again assert themselves. May you wander this earth at will, with  
your mind fixed on Me, and may for you thus always be an uninterrupted  
devotion unto Me. Following the dharma of the ruling class you have killed  
living beings when you were hunting and with other actions. That sin you  
should now uproot completely by fully immersing yourself in penances with Me  
as your shelter. In your birth following this one oh King, you, becoming a  
supreme well-wisher to all living beings, will be a fine brahmin and attain Me  
for certain.

## Re:[35]Love,always love and only love Excerpts from Srimad Bhagavatam

**_The Bhagavatam is the Answer to all Questions_**  
 **Suka said:  'In this [book, the S'rimad Bhagavatam] the following ten subjects are  
discussed: primary creation [sarga], how the interactions of life and the  
lifeless came about [visarga], the planetary order [sthana], the maintenance  
of belief [poshana], the impetus for action [utaya], the administrative eras  
[manvantaras], stories about the Lord's appearances [is'a-anukatha], returning  
to God [nirodha], liberation in devotional service [mukti] and the summum  
bonum [the life of Krishna]. The great sages reduce the purpose of the first  
nine characteristics of this Bhagavatam to the clarification of the summum  
bonum. This they deduced from either the words themselves used in the text or  
from their purport. The [sixteen elements of the five] gross elements, the  
[five] sense objects and the senses themselves including the mind, constitute  
the manifestation that is called the creation of the creator [sarga] and that  
what resulted from their interaction with the three modes of nature [the  
gunas] is what is called the secondary creation [visarga]. The stability of  
the worlds [sthana] is the victory of the Lord of Vaikunthha and His mercy is  
the maintenance of belief [poshana]. The reign of the Manus [during the  
manvantaras] settles the perfection of the dutifulness that constitutes the  
impetus for action with the karmic propensities [utaya]. The different stories  
about the Lord [is'a-anukatha] describe the activities of the avataras of the  
Supreme Lord and the persons who are His followers. Returning to God  
[nirodha] pertains to the resigning of souls to the Original Person and His  
energies, while liberation [mukti] is concerned with forsaking other ways [of  
living] in order to get established in the Original Nature. He who as the  
source from which the cosmic manifestation takes place also stands for the  
return to God, is for that reason called the reservoir [the as'raya] of the  
Supreme Spirit or the Supersoul.   
The individual person in possession of his senses [adhyatmika] is both the  
controlling deity [adhidaivika] and the person who separate therefrom is  
perceived as another embodied living being [adhibhautika]. All three of the  
above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the  
absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees  
every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and  
therefore He is the supreme shelter. After separating the different universes,  
the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Viṣṇu], which came out of the  
Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puruṣa-avatara, entered  
into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created  
transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. Residing in these waters of His own  
creation for a thousand celestial years He became known by the name of  
Narayana ['the way of Nara'] because these waters that originated from the  
Supreme Person [from 'Nara'] are called Nara. The material elements, karma,  
time and the conditioned living entities all exist by His mercy and cease to  
exist on His neglect. Where He laid in His mystical slumber He was all alone.  
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal  
symbol, golden in hue, through external energy out of His desire to manifest  
varieties of living entities from Himself alone. Just hear from me how the  
potency of His Lordship divides one into three, called the controlling  
entities, the controlled entities and the material bodies, in the manner  
mentioned above.   
From the ether within the body of the Original Person, with His wish, the  
power to sense, the power to mind and the power for physical action generated,  
after which next the life breath [the prana] came about as the principle  
ruling over each and all. Like the followers of a king, the senses follow the  
life force of prana that is active in all living beings and when the life  
force is no longer active all the rest stops also. The life force that was  
generated [from the ether] made the Almighty One hungry and thirsty and to  
quench that thirst and satisfy that hunger, first of all the mouth was opened.  
From the mouth the palate was generated whereupon the tongue manifested and  
the various tastes to be relished by it. With the need to speak from the mouth  
of the Supreme One [the presiding deity of] fire originated as also the organ  
of speech and speech itself, but because He was at rest in the waters, they  
for a very long time remained suspended. Desiring to smell odors the nose  
with its sense of smell developed together with the nostrils to rapidly inhale  
the air that carries the smell. Being by Himself in the darkness He desired  
to observe Himself and the rest of creation. For the sake of His vision the  
sun then separated that gave the eyes the power of sight. When the Lord  
decided that the sages should understand the Supreme Being also the ears  
manifested themselves including the authority of the wind directions, the  
power to hear and that what could be heard. From His desire to experience the  
hardness, softness, lightness, weight, heat and cold of all matter, the sense  
of touch was distributed over the skin along with its bodily hair, the plants  
and trees. That sense of touch of the skin rose from the objects that were  
perceived within and without.   
From His desire for different types of work the two hands manifested, but to  
give strength to the manipulation that depends on them [viz. on the gods who  
are His hands], Indra, the king of the gods, found his existence as the  
manifestation of both. Desiring to control movement the legs manifested, for  
the purpose of which the Lord of Sacrifice [Vishnu] Himself manifested [as  
their presiding godhead] who motivates the different human beings according to  
the duties of their fruitive actions [karma]. Desiring to taste the nectar of  
sexual enjoyment the genitals of the male and female organ appeared and the  
lustfulness found its existence that is the shelter cherished by the both of  
them [controlled by the Prajapati]. Desiring to evacuate the refuse of  
eatables first the opening of the anus and then its sense and substance came  
about after which Mitra, the controller over the excretion, appeared to offer  
the protection of both. Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to  
another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created.  
The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force. In  
want of food and drink the abdomen with the intestines and arteries originated  
to which the rivers and seas are their source of sustenance and metabolism.  
Desirous to know His own energy the heart [as the seat of thought] manifested  
after which the mind, Candra the controller [the moon] appeared as also  
determination and all desire. The seven elements of the nails, skin, flesh,  
blood, fat, marrow and bone are predominantly of earth, water and fire whereas  
the life breath is a product of ether, water and air.   
The senses of the material ego are attached to the modes of matter. Those  
modes influence the mind and all the feelings belonging to it because of which  
for the individual the intelligence and the realized knowledge assume their  
form. Of all this is external feature of the Lord, as I explained to you,  
known in the eight elements [of earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,  
intelligence and false ego] of all the worlds and such, that make for an  
unlimited external covering. Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a  
transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning,  
no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of  
expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.  
None of these two [material and verbal] forms of the Supreme Lord as I  
described to you are, because of their externality, by the scholars of  
consciousness ever taken for granted. He who in fact does nothing [who is of  
akarma] manifests in the form of the word and in that what the word denotes: the different appearances of the Absolute Truth and the Supreme Lord, while He  
in the pastimes of His forms and names engages in the work of transcendence.  
Oh King, know that all the happiness and distress and their mixture is there  
as a result of profit-minded labor [of karma]. This is the experience of all  
the members of the family of Brahma, the Manus, the godly ones, the wise, the  
inhabitants of Pitriloka [the forefathers] and Siddhaloka [the perfected  
ones]; the Caranas [the venerable ones], Gandharvas [the singers of heaven],  
Vidyadharas [the scientists], Asuras [the unenlightened ones or the demons],  
Yakshas [treasure-keepers or evil spirits], Kinnaras [of superpowers] and  
angels; the snake-like, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the  
inhabitants of Matriloka [of the place of the mother], the demons and Pis'acas  
[yellow flesh-eating demons]. This includes the ghosts, spirits, lunatics and  
evil spirits, devils taking possession of people and the birds, the forest-  
dwelling and domestic animals, the reptiles, the ones of the mountains, the  
moving and immobile living entities, the living entities born from embryos,  
from eggs, from heat [micro-organisms] and from seeds, and all others, whether  
they are of the water, of land or the sky.   
According to the different modes of material nature - the mode of goodness,  
the mode of passion and the mode of darkness -there are different living  
creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living  
entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other  
two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is  
influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also. Evidently the  
Supreme Lord, the maintainer of the universe, after having created the  
universes, assumes for the purpose of maintaining the dharma [and redeeming  
the living beings] the forms of gods, human beings and lower creatures. Like  
the wind dispersing the clouds He in the form of Rudra [S'iva the destroyer]  
at the end of the era by fire will completely annihilate all. The Supreme  
Lord is by those who are not conversant with His essence described with the  
notion of these characteristics [of creation and destruction], but the wise  
and the teachers must not deign to regard the supreme glory as only this.  
There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of  
the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct  
interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the  
creator. That what is summarized here by me concerns the generation of the  
entire expanse of material creation. I only dilate on this now to illustrate  
the regulative principles of importance for the process of creation during a  
day of Brahma [a kalpa] and of destruction during an intermediate period [a  
vikalpa].

**_Mura and Bhauma Killed and the Prayers of Bhumi_**  
 **Suka said: 'Bhauma had stolen lord Indra's Varuna umbrella, the earrings of his relative  
[his mother Aditi] as also a certain location [called Mani-parvata] on the  
mountain of the gods [Mandara hill]. Lord Indra then informed Lord Krishna  
about what Bhaumasura all had done. Together with His wife Satyabhama, seated  
on Garuda, He thereupon traveled to the city of Pragjyotisha [Bhauma's  
capital, now Tejpur of Assam], which lay protected surrounded by mountains and  
weapons, fire, water and wind. The place was fortified by a fence consisting  
of tens of thousands of tough and dreadful wires on all sides. With His club  
He broke through the rock fortifications, with His arrows He defeated the  
weapon systems, with His disc He forced a way through the fire, the water and  
wind defenses and with His sword He likewise got through the fence.  
Resounding His conch shell He broke the seals of the fortress, as also the  
hearts of the brave warriors, and with His heavy mace Gadadhara broke through  
the ramparts. Hearing the vibration of the Lord's Pnccajanya that sounded like  
the thunder at the end of the universe, the five-headed demon Mura rose up who  
lay asleep in the water. With his trident raised and with an effulgence as  
terrible as the fire of the sun most difficult to behold, he, as if he with  
his five mouths would swallow the three worlds, launched his attack the way  
the son of Tarkshya [Garuda] would attack a snake. Whirling his trident he  
threw it with all his strength at Garuda with such a tumultuous roar from his  
five mouths, that the earth, the sky and the outer space in all directions of  
the egglike shell of the universe reverberated. Lord Krishna then with two  
arrows broke the trident flying at Garuda in three pieces and next with great  
force hit his faces with more arrows. The demon furiously hurled his club at  
Him. That club flying at Him on the battlefield was by Gadagraja [Krishna as  
the Elder Brother of Gada] broken into thousands of pieces by His own club.  
But when he next with his arms raised rushed forward at Him, the unconquerable  
One with ease sliced off his heads with His disc. Lifeless he with his heads  
severed fell into the water, as if Indra with his force had split off a  
mountain peak. His seven sons, feeling greatly distressed upon their father's  
death, thereupon angrily moved into action to retaliate.   
Incited by Bhaumasura, T?mra, Antariksha, S'ravana, Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan  
and the seventh son Aruna with their weapons stepped forward on the  
battlefield headed by their general Pithha. In their attack they furiously  
used swords, clubs, spears, lances and tridents against the Invincible One,  
but the Supreme Lord of Infallible Prowess with His arrows cut their complete  
mountain of weapons into tiny pieces. Cutting off their heads, thighs, arms,  
legs and armor, He sent the ones who were headed by Pithha all to the abode of  
Yamaraja. Bhauma, the son of mother earth, who saw that his army and leaders  
succumbed to the arrows and disc of Krishna, could not accept that and marched  
forward with elephants in rut that were born from the milk ocean. Seeing Lord  
Krishna with His wife sitting on Garuda like a cloud with lightning sitting  
above the sun, he released his S'ataghn? [spiked missile] at Him while at the  
same time all his soldiers attacked. The Supreme Lord, the Elder Brother of  
Gada, turned their bodies as also the bodies of the horses and elephants of  
Bhaumasura's army, with differently feathered sharp arrows into a collection  
of severed arms, thighs and necks. Each of the sharp and shafted weapons that  
the warriors employed oh hero of the Kurus, were by Krishna with three arrows  
at a time cut to pieces. Garuda who carried Him, stroke the elephants with his  
two large wings and thus defeated them. Harassed by his wings, beak and talons  
they moved back into the city while Naraka ['hell' or Bhauma] continued with  
the battle. Bhauma, annoyed to see his army forced in retreat because of  
Garuda, struck him with the spear that withstood the thunderbolt of Indra.  
But he was not shaken more by it than an elephant being hit with a flower  
garland. Bhauma, frustrated in his endeavors, next took up his trident to  
kill Acyuta, the Infallible One, but before he could even release it, the Lord  
with the razor-sharp edge of His cakra cut off the head of Naraka as he was  
sitting on his elephant. That head, complete with its brilliant, shining  
decorations of earrings and a nice helmet, fell to the ground. There were  
exclamations of 'Alas, alas' and 'Bravo bravo!', while the the sages and  
ruling demigods showered Lord Krishna with flower garlands.**   
 **Mother earth thereupon approached Krishna and presented golden earrings  
glowing with shining jewels and a Vaijayant? garland of forest flowers. She  
gave Him the parasol of Varuna and the Great Gem [the peak of Mandara]. Oh  
King, the Goddess with a mind full of devotion then folded her palms, bowed  
down and praised the Lord of the Universe who is worshiped by the best of the  
demigods. Bhumi said:  'I offer You my obeisances oh God of Gods, oh Lord, oh holder of the conch,  
the disc and the club who to the desire of Your devotees have assumed Your  
forms oh Supreme Soul. Let there be the praise unto You. I worship Him with  
the lotus-like belly, my reverence for the One with the garland of lotuses,  
my respects for He whose glance is as cool as a lotus, my praise unto You who  
have feet that are like lotuses. My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Lord,  
Vasudeva, Vishnu, the Original Person, the Primeval Seed and the Complete of  
Knowledge, unto You my salutations. May there be the veneration for You, the  
Unborn Progenitor, the Unlimited Absolute, the Soul of the higher and lower  
energies, the Soul of the Creation, the Supersoul! Desiring to create oh  
Master, You stand out as being the Unborn One [as Brahma], for the purpose of  
annihilation You adopt the mode of ignorance [as Shiva] and for the sake of  
maintenance You are [manifested as] the goodness [as the Avataras] of the  
Universe. Yet You are not covered by these modes, oh Lord of Jagat [the Living  
Being that is the Universe]. Being Kala [time], Pradhana [the unmanifested  
state of matter, the primal ether] and Purusha [the Original Person] You  
nevertheless exist independently thereof. This self of mine, the earth, the  
water, the fire, the air and the ether, the sense objects, the demigods, the  
mind, the senses and the doer, the total material energy - in sum everything  
that moves around or does not move around, constitutes the bewilderment oh  
Supreme Lord [when one supposes that it would exist independently of You].  
Everything after all resides within You, the One Without a Second ! This son  
of him [called Bhagadatta, son of Bhauma, Bhumi's grandson] has in his fear  
approached the lotus feet of You who removes the distress of those who take  
shelter. Please protect him and place on his head Your lotus hand that  
eradicates all sins.'   
Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, with these words being entreated by Bhumi with  
devotion and humility, took his fear away and entered the residence of Bhauma  
that was equipped with all conveniences. The Lord found there sixteen thousand  
maidens of the royal order who by Bhaumasura by force were taken away from the  
kings. When the women saw Him enter, the most excellent of all men, they  
enchanted chose for Him, who by fate was brought to them, as the husband of  
their desire. Absorbed in Krishna they thought: 'May providence make that He  
becomes my husband.' Thus contemplating they, one after the other, all  
installed Him in their heart. After they were properly washed and clad in  
spotless clothes, He sent them off in palanquins to Dvaraka together with the  
enormous treasure of chariots, horses and a great number of other valuables.  
Kes'ava also dispatched sixty-four swift white elephants with four tusks from  
the family of Airavata [Indra's elephant]. Thereupon He went to the abode of  
the king of the gods and gave Aditi her earrings. Then He together with His  
beloved Satyabhama was worshiped by Indra, the head of the thirty chief  
demigods, and the great king's wife. Urged by His own wife He uprooted the  
heavenly tree, the parijata and placed it on Garuda. He defeated the demigods  
including Indra [who wanted to prevent that] and brought it to His city. All  
the way from heaven being followed by the bees that were greedy for its sweet  
fragrance and juice, the tree beautified the garden of Satyabhama's residence  
after being planted there. Indra that great soul among the demigods, had bowed  
down, touched His feet with the tips of his crown and begged Acyuta to fulfill  
his desire, but now that he had achieved his purpose, he nevertheless started  
to quarrel with Him about the parijata. To hell those demigods with their  
wealth, what an ignorance ! The Supreme Lord then properly married with all  
those women, at the same time living in various residences with them and for  
that purpose the Imperishable One assumed as many forms. Happily engaged with  
the women who were eager to please Him, He who performs the most inconceivable  
deeds, never left their unequalled and superior palaces. Even though He is  
perfectly satisfied within, He carried out His duties as a householder and  
enjoyed life like any other man. The women shared in an ever-increasing  
pleasure the always fresh, loving attraction of associating with Him in smiles  
and glances, intimate talks and bashfulness. Thus having obtained the Husband  
of Rama they this way managed to attain Him in a manner that is not even  
available to Brahma and the other gods. Even though they had hundreds of  
maidservants, they were personally of service to the Lord by approaching Him  
to offer a seat, be of first-class worship and wash His feet as also to serve  
Him with betel nut, massages and fanning, fragrances, garlands and dressing  
His hair, arranging His bed, bathing and presenting gifts.'

**_The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond_**  
 **The Supreme Lord said: 'Oh best of persons, try to understand what I am about to say concerning the  
way someone is influenced by a certain mode of My material nature. With the  
mode of goodness one finds equanimity, sense control, tolerance,  
discrimination, penance, truthfulness, compassion, remembrance, contentment,  
renunciation, freedom from desire, faithfulness, modesty and pleasure within.  
With the mode of passion there is lust, endeavor, conceit, dissatisfaction,  
false pride, a desire for blessings, separatism, sense gratification,  
rashness, love of praise, ridicule, display of valor and hard sanctioning.  
With the mode of ignorance one runs into intolerance, greed, deceitfulness,  
violence, attention seeking, hypocrisy, listlessness, quarrel, lamentation,  
delusion, the suffering of depression, sloth, false expectations, fear and  
indolence. These, one after the other described by Me, constitute the majority  
of the effects of the modes. Hear now about their combinations.   
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the  
mentality of 'I' and 'mine.' The ordinary transactions of this world, which  
are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the  
senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the  
combination of the modes. When a person devotes himself to religiosity,  
economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual  
enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes  
of nature. When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family  
life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and  
occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest. A  
person exhibiting qualities such as self-control is understood to be  
predominantly in the mode of goodness. Similarly, a passionate person is  
recognized by his lust, and one in ignorance is recognized by qualities such  
as anger. Any person, whether man or woman, who worships Me with loving  
devotion, offering his or her prescribed duties unto Me without material  
attachment, is understood to be situated in goodness. When a person worships  
Me by his prescribed duties with the hope of gaining material benefit, his  
nature should be understood to be in passion, and one who worships Me with the  
desire to commit violence against others is in ignorance. The three modes of  
material nature - goodness, passion and ignorance - influence the individual  
but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to  
become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the  
living entity is bound up. When the mode of goodness, which is luminous, pure  
and auspicious, predominates over passion and ignorance, a man becomes endowed  
with happiness, virtue, knowledge and other good qualities. When the mode of  
passion, which causes attachment, sense of separateness and activity, conquers  
ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and  
fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle. When  
the mode of ignorance conquers passion and goodness, it covers one's  
consciousness and makes one foolish and dull. Falling into lamentation and  
illusion, a person in the mode of ignorance sleeps excessively, indulges in  
false hopes, and displays violence toward others.When consciousness becomes  
clear and the senses are detached from matter, one experiences fearlessness  
within the material body and detachment from the material mind. You should  
understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of goodness, in  
which one has the opportunity to realize Me. You should discern the mode of  
passion by its symptoms - the distortion of the intelligence because of too  
much activity, the inability of the perceiving senses to disentangle  
themselves from mundane objects, an unhealthy condition of the working  
physical organs, and the unsteady perplexity of the mind. When one's higher  
awareness fails and finally disappears and one is thus unable to concentrate  
his attention, his mind is ruined and manifests ignorance and depression. You  
should understand this situation to be the predominance of the mode of  
ignorance. With the increase of the mode of goodness, the strength of the  
demigods similarly increases. When passion increases, the demoniac become  
strong. And with the rise of ignorance, O Uddhava, the strength of the most  
wicked increases. It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from  
the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep,  
dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness  
pervades these three and is transcendental. Learned persons dedicated to Vedic  
culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions.  
The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into  
lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues  
transmigrating through human bodies. Those who leave this world in the mode of  
goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of  
passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of  
ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all  
modes of nature come to Me.Work performed as an offering to Me, without  
consideration of the fruit, is considered to be in the mode of goodness. Work  
performed with a desire to enjoy the results is in the mode of passion. And  
work impelled by violence and envy is in the mode of ignorance. Absolute  
knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the  
mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of  
ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be  
transcendental.   
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in  
the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of  
ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental. A worker  
free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal  
desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten  
how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has  
taken shelter of Me is understood to transcendence the modes of nature.  
Faith directed toward spiritual life is in the mode of goodness, faith rooted  
in fruitive work is in the mode of passion, faith residing in irreligious  
activities is in the mode of ignorance, but faith in My devotional service is  
purely transcendental. Food that is wholesome, pure and obtained without  
difficulty is in the mode of goodness, food that gives immediate pleasure to  
the senses is in the mode of passion, and food that is unclean and causes  
distress is in the mode of ignorance. Happiness derived from the self is in  
the mode of goodness, happiness based on sense gratification is in the mode of  
passion, and happiness based on delusion and degradation is in the mode of  
ignorance. But that happiness found within Me is transcendental. Therefore  
material substance, place, result of activity, time, knowledge, work, the  
performer of work, faith, state of consciousness, species of life and  
destination after death are all based on the three modes of material nature. O  
best of human beings, all states of material being are related to the  
interaction of the enjoying soul and material nature. Whether seen, heard of  
or only conceived within the mind, they are without exception constituted of  
the modes of nature. O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of  
conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The  
living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate  
himself to Me by devotion and thus attain pure love for Me. Therefore, having  
achieved this human form of life, which allows one to develop full knowledge,  
those who are intelligent should free themselves from all contamination of the  
modes of nature and engage exclusively in loving worship of Me. A wise sage,  
free from all material association and unbewildered, should subdue his senses  
and worship Me. He should conquer the modes of passion and ignorance by  
engaging himself only with things in the mode of goodness.   
Then, being fixed in devotion, the sage should also conquer the material mode  
of goodness by indifference toward the modes. Thus pacified within his mind,  
the spirit soul, freed from the modes of nature, gives up the very cause of  
his conditioned life and attains Me. Freed from the subtle conditioning of the  
mind and from the modes of nature born of material consciousness, the living  
entity becomes completely satisfied by experiencing My transcendental form. He  
no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he  
contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.

**_Draupadi Meets the Queens of Krishna_**  
 **Suka said: 'The Supreme Lord, the spiritual master and goal of the gop?s who thus showed  
His favor, then asked Yudhishthhira and the rest of His good-hearted relatives  
about their welfare. They,who by seeing His feet were freed from their sinful  
reactions, felt very honored thus being questioned by the Lord of the World  
and gladly replied:  'How can they be unhappy who ever drank the intoxicating nectar of Your  
lotus-like feet that is poured out by the minds and mouths of the great souls?  
O master, how can misfortune arise for those who have even once freely drunk  
the nectar coming from Your lotus feet? This intoxicating liquor pours into  
the drinking cups of their ears, having flowed from the minds of great  
devotees through their mouths. It destroys the embodied souls' forgetfulness  
of the creator of their bodily existence. By the light of Your personal form  
we are released from the bonds of the three [states] of material consciousness  
[wakefulness, dreaming and sleeping]. Being totally immersed therein, we are  
of spiritual happiness having bowed down to You, the goal of the perfected  
saints [the paramahamsas], who by the power of Your illusion have assumed this  
form for the protection of the unlimited and ever fresh Vedic knowledge that  
is threatened by time.'   
 The great sage said: 'While the crest jewel of all personalities who is  
praised in the scriptures thus was being glorified by His people, the women of  
the Andhaka and Kaurava clans met to discuss with each other the stories about  
Govinda that are sung in the three worlds. Please listen as I describe them to  
you.   
Draupad? said: 'Oh Vaidarbh? [Rukmini], Bhadra, Jambavati and Kaushala  
[Nagnajiti]; oh Satyabhama, Kalinda, S'aibya [Mitravinda], Rohini and  
Lakshmana [Madra] and other wives of Krishna, please tell us how it came to  
pass that Acyuta, the Supreme Lord Himself, by the grace of His mystic power  
lived the way one lives in the world and got married to you?'   
Rukmini said: 'Like a lion taking his share from a herd of goats and sheep He,  
who puts the dust of His feet upon the heads of invincible fighters, took me  
away when the kings, with their bows ready, were about to offer me to  
S'is'upala. May the feet of Him, the abode of Sri, be my object of worship.'  
**Satyabhama said: 'Being accused by my father King S'atrajit He, in order to  
clear His name, defeated the king of the bears Jambavan and brought the jewel  
back to my father whose heart was distressed about the death of his brother  
Prasena. Afraid about this accusation he offered me to the Lord, even though I  
was spoken for.'   
Jambavati said: 'The creator of my body, not realizing that He, the Husband of  
Sita, was his master and worshipable deity, fought for twenty-seven days with  
Him. After he recognized Him he came to his senses, took hold of His feet and  
presented me to Him together with the jewel. I am His maidservant.'**   
 **Kalindi said: 'Knowing that I was executing penances with the desire to  
touch His feet, He came together with His friend [Arjuna] and took my hand. I  
am the one cleaning His residence. '   
Mitravinda said: 'During my svayamvara He came forward and stole me away the  
way the enemy of the elephants [a lion] claims his share amidst a pack of  
dogs. After having defeated the kings and my brothers who insulted Him, He  
took me to His capital where sri resides. May I there, life after life, serve  
Him with washing His feet.'   
Satya said: 'Seven great, strong and vital bulls with the sharpest horns, that  
by my father were arranged to test the prowess of the kings, destroyed the  
pride of the heroes. But they were quickly subdued and tied up by Him with the  
ease of children playing with young goats. This way with His valor paying for  
me, He defeated the kings on the road with an army of four divisions and took  
me, being protected by maidservants, with Him. May there be my servitude unto  
Him.'   
Bhadra said: 'With me in love with Him oh Krishn?a[Draupadi], my father on his  
own accord invited my maternal cousin Krishna and gave me to Him together with  
a retinue of female companions and a military escort of one akshauhini. May  
there for me, birth after birth wandering because of my karma, be that  
betterment of myself in touching His feet.'   
Lakshmana said: 'Oh Queen, because I repeatedly heard the glorification by  
Narada of Acyuta's births and activities, my heart became fixed upon Mukunda,  
He who by her holding the lotus after due consideration was chosen in  
rejection of the [demigod] rulers of the world. My father, also known as  
Brihatsena oh saintly lady, knew my state of mind and out of love for his  
daughter arranged for means to meet this end [of marrying with Krishna]. Just  
as with your svayamvara oh Queen a fish was used [hung high as a target] that  
had to be won by Arjuna, also in my case there was such a target. Hidden from  
sight however, it could only be seen as a reflection in water [in a pot  
below]. Hearing about this, from everywhere all the kings expert in the art of  
archery and wielding other weapons, came to my father's city together with  
their thousands of teachers. My father honored all of them with full respect  
for each his strength and age. Then they, who had set their minds upon me,  
took up the bow and arrows to pierce [the target] in the assembly. Some of  
them after lifting [the bow] were unable to string it and gave up and some,  
having pulled the bowstring, fell down because they were hit by it. Other  
heroes like the kings of Magadha [Jarasandha], Cedi [S'is'upala] and  
Ambashthha as also Bhima, Duryodhana and Karna, managed to string the bow but  
could not locate the target. Arjuna managed to locate it and, aiming carefully  
while looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, took a shot, but the  
arrow did not hit the target, it just brushed it. After the kings were  
defeated in their pride and had given up, the Supreme Lord playfully took up  
the bow and managed to string it. At the moment the sun was situated in  
Abhijit [in 'victory', or at noon] He fixed an arrow on it and pierced, with a  
single look in the water, the fish with His arrow so that it fell down.  
Kettledrums resounded in the sky and on earth the sounds of 'jaya' were heard  
while the demigods overwhelmed by joy released torrents of flowers. Next, with  
a shy smile on my face and a wreath of flowers in my hair, I entered the arena  
with gently tinkling ankle bells on my feet, a golden necklace with brilliant  
jewels around my neck and a pair of fine silken, new garments held together by  
a belt. I lifted up my face encircled by its many locks of hair and with my  
cheeks effulgent because of the earrings and looked all around at the kings.  
With a cool smile casting sidelong glances I slowly placed my necklace around  
the neck of Mur?ri who had captured my heart. At that moment conch shells,  
mridangas, tabors, kettledrums and war drums and such instruments resounded  
while the singers sang and male and female dancers danced. The leading kings  
could not accept the choice I thus made for the Supreme Lord as my master oh  
Draupad?. Upset and with a heart full of imprecation they became quarrelsome.  
Faced with that situation He lifted me on the chariot with its four excellent  
horses. He prepared His S'arnga, donned His armor and stood firm to offer  
battle with His four arms [displayed in full]. Daruka drove the chariot that  
was trimmed with gold oh Queen, while the kings looked on as if they were  
[startled] animals seeing the lion king. Like village dogs with a lion the  
kings went after Him. Some of them then tried to block His way by raising  
their bows against Him. Because of the floods of arrows shot from the S'arnga  
some of them fell with their arms, legs and necks severed, while others gave  
it up and fled. Like the sun god reaching his abode [or the western horizon]  
the Lord of the Yadus then entered Dvaraka, His city, that is glorified in  
heaven and on earth, that was profusely decorated with wonderful archways and  
banners on flagpoles blocking the sunlight. My father honored his friends,  
immediate relations and other family members with the most valuable clothing  
and jewelry, with beds, seats and with other furniture. In his devotion he  
presented the most valuable weapons to the Lord of the Complete [Purnasya], as  
also maidservants endowed with all riches, infantry, elephantry, chariotry and  
cavalry. By abruptly breaking off our material bonds and doing penances, we  
have all become the maidservants of His household, of Him, the One Satisfied  
Within Himself.'   
 The other queens said [as expressed by Rohini]: 'After He in battle had  
killed the demon Bhauma and his followers, He discovered that we, the  
daughters of the kings that the demon defeated during his conquest of the  
earth, had been imprisoned by him. Because we constantly had remembered His  
lotus feet as the source of liberation from a material existence He, the One  
All of whose Wishes are Fulfilled, married us after our release. Oh saintly  
lady, we do not desire rulership over the earth, a heavenly kingdom, unlimited  
pleasures or mystic power. Nor do we strive for the supreme divinity, to  
achieve immortality or the abode of Hari. We [just] want to carry on our heads  
the dust of the divine feet of the Wielder of the Club that is enriched with  
the fragrance of the kunkuma from the bosom of Sri. We desire the same as what  
the Pulinda women [the gopis] desire, as what the grass and the plants and the  
grazing cows and gopas of Vraja desire: to be touched by the feet of the Supreme Soul.'

**_' Oh kurari you are lamenting!   
Deprived of sleep you cannot rest while the Controller tonight is sleeping   
somewhere in the world at an unknown place.   
Can it be that your heart, just like ours oh friend,   
was deeply pierced by His smiling and the munificent,   
playful glance of His lotus eyes?   
Oh cakravaki, having closed your eyes for the night,   
you nevertheless are crying pitifully for your unseen friend.   
Or do you perhaps, after having attained the servitude,   
just like us desire to carry in your braided hair the garland   
that was honored by Acyuta's feet?   
Oh dear, dear ocean, you are always making such a noise,   
never getting any sleep. Are you suffering from sleeplessness?   
Or were, maybe, your personal qualities stolen by Mukunda   
so that you also got into this hard to cure diseased condition?   
Oh moon are you, in the grip of the fell disease of consumption,   
so emaciated that you cannot dispel the darkness with your rays?   
Or are you maybe dumbstruck oh dearest, because you, just like us,   
 cannot remember what Mukunda all said?   
 Oh wind from the Malaya mountains, what have we done that displeased you   
so that our hearts are led by Cupid [Kamadeva],   
hearts that are already torn apart by Govinda's sidelong glances?   
 Oh honorable cloud, you surely are a friend most dear to the Chief of the  
Yadavas   
with the S'rivatsa on His chest. We are, in our meditation on pure love,   
just as bound to Him as your good self is.   
Your most eager heart is just as distraught as ours.   
We just like you, remember Him over and over.   
And that results in torrents of rain with you,   
just as it time and again makes us shed streams of tears.   
It can be so hurtful to associate with Him!   
Oh sweet-throated cuckoo, please tell me what I should do   
to please you who vibrate His so very dear sounds,   
in this voice that is capable of reviving the dead.   
Oh mountain with your broad-minded intelligence, you do not move or speak.   
Are you preoccupied with great matters or do you maybe, just like us,   
desire to hold on your breasts the feet of the darling son of Vasudeva?   
 Oh [rivers,] wives of the ocean, your lakes have alas lost their wealth of  
lotuses   
that shriveled away now that they dried up, just like us,   
 who grew very thin because of not obtaining the loving glance of our beloved  
husband,   
the Lord of Madhu, who so often stole our hearts?   
Oh swan, be welcome and sit down,   
please drink some milk and tell us the news oh dear one,   
for we know you to be a messenger of S'auri.   
Is the Unconquerable One all well? Does He who is so fickle in His friendship,   
still remember that He talked to us a long time ago?   
Why should we [run after Him to] be of worship oh servant of the campaka?   
Tell Him who raises the desire, to visit us without the goddess of fortune.   
Why should that woman have the exclusive right of devotion?'   
Lord Krishna's Queens

**_The Hamsa-avatara Answers the Questions of the Sons of Brahma_**  
 **Uddhava said: 'When and in what form dear Kes'ava, have You instructed  
Sanaka and the others in this yoga? That is what I would like to know.'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The sons headed by Sanaka who took their birth from  
the mind of him who originated from the golden egg [Hiranyagarbha or Brahma],  
inquired of their father about the so very subtle, supreme goal of the science  
of yoga. Sanaka and the others said to him: 'The mind is directed at the  
gunas, the qualities of nature, and the gunas impose themselves on the mind.  
Oh Master, what is for someone who desires liberation, for someone who wishes  
to cross over this material ocean, the process of breaking away from that  
mutual effect ?'   
The Supreme Lord said: 'The great self-born godhead, the creator of all  
beings, thus being questioned, seriously pondered over what was asked but  
could not find the words to describe the essential truth, for his mind was  
bewildered because of his creative labor. With the desire to find closure he  
remembered Me, the original godhead, and at that time I became visible in My  
Hamsa form [the Swan]. Seeing Me they, headed by Brahma, approached Me,  
offered their obeisances at My lotus feet and asked: 'Who are You?'   
Thus being questioned by the sages interested in the ultimate truth, I spoke  
to them. Please Uddhava, hear now what I said to them that moment.   
Oh brahmins, relating to the one true essence,in the concept of  
nonindividuality of the jiva soul,how is your question possible or  
appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of  
yourselves and of Me?   
If by asking me "Who are you?" you were referring to the material body, then I  
must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements,  
namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, "Who  
are you five?" If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one,  
being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is  
still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one  
body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking my identity, you are merely  
speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.   
Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other  
senses is me alone and nothing besides me. All of you please understand this  
by a straightforward analysis of the facts.   
Dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense  
objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this  
material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the  
spirit soul, who is part and parcel of me.   
A person who has thus achieved me by understanding that he is not different  
from me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects  
because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are  
existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood my  
transcendental nature, he gives up both the mind and its objects.   
Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence  
and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the  
body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three  
states and thus remains us a witness to them.   
The soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him  
constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage  
of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming  
situated in me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness.  
At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense  
objects and the mind.   
The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him  
exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent  
person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain  
situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.   
According to my instructions, one should fix the mind on me alone. If,  
however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather  
than seeing everything within me, then although apparently awake, one is  
actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one  
has wakened from a dream.   
Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Lord have  
no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the  
Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities  
and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the  
Lord's existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities,  
thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.   
While awake the soul enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting  
characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys  
similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such  
experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the  
succession of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can  
understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is  
transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.   
You should consider how, by the influence of my illusory energy, these three  
states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially  
imagined to exist in me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul,  
you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical  
reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to  
completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts.  
All of you should then worship me, who am situated within the heart.   
One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the  
mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are  
here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line  
created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the  
single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many  
different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul's  
consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such  
varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a  
dream.   
Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus  
having pulled one's vision away from illusion, one should remain without  
material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give  
up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the  
material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and  
therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time  
of death, one will not again fall into illusion.   
Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt,  
similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved  
his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or  
standing. Indeed, if by God's will the body is finished or if by God's will he  
obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken  
man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.   
The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and  
therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as  
one's karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to  
the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of  
yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold  
manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.   
Dear Brahmins, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of  
Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of  
astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I  
am the Lord, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your  
actual religious duties.   
Best of the Brahmins, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga  
system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles,  
power, beauty, fame and self-control.   
All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of  
nature, detached, the well -wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally  
situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement - all such qualities,  
free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter in  
me.   
Dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were  
destroyed by my words. Fully worshiping me with transcendental love and  
devotion, they chanted my glories with excellent hymns.   
11/13;15-42**

**_But know that by whom the entire physical body is pervaded   
 is indestructible.   
No one is able to cause the destruction of the imperishable soul.   
Chapter 2, verse 17_**  
_The soul never takes birth and never dies at any time   
nor does it come into being again when the body is created.   
The soul is Birthless, Eternal, Imperishable and Timeless,   
and is never terminated when the body is terminated.
