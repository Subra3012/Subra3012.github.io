 **Appayya Dikshita 1520â1593 CE, was a performer of yajnas as well as an  
expositor and practitioner of the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy  
but however, with a focus on Shiva or Siva Advaita.**   
Appayya Dikshitar was born as Vinayaga Subramanian in Adayapalam, near Arani  
in the **Tiruvannamalai district**.   
Appayya studied the Hindu scriptures under his Guru, Rama Kavi. He completed  
the fourteen Vidyas while he was quite young.   
Dikshitar travelled widely, entering into philosophical disputations and  
controversaries in many centres of learning. He had the rare good fortune of  
being revered and patronised in his own life-time by kings of Vellore,  
Tanjore, Vijayanagara and Venkatagiri.   
In addition to his poetic skills and achievements on the philosophical  
propagations and Saivite missionary work, Dikshitar was a great Siddha-yogi.  
One of his yogic experiments was as great as it was thrilling. In the later  
years of his life, he was subject to attacks of colic pain. He was convinced  
that it was due to his Prarabdha and past karma. Whenever he wanted to  
meditate deeply or worship the Almighty, he made a bundle of his towel and put  
it in front of him. By his yogic power he transferred his malady to the towel  
and sat in meditation. His disciples watched the towel jumping about the  
place. To them he explained later that he transferred his ailment which was in  
the form of an evil spirit to the cloth and then took it back soon after his  
meditation was over.   
He was well read in every branch of Sanskrit learning and wrote as many works,  
large and small. Only 60 of them are, however, extant now. These include works  
on Vedanta, Siva-advaita, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, Kavya vyakhyana, Alankara, and  
devotional poetry. By conviction he was an advaitin and true worship of Lord  
Siva was the religion of his heart. Though the followers of the Siva-advaita  
school claim him as belonging to their school, it is not so easy to determine  
whether he was more inclined to Sivadavaita or advaita. Sivadvaita is very  
much akin to Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja, except for the role of Vishnu being  
taken by Shiva.   
As an advaitin, Dikshitar saw no differences between the different  
manifestations of the Supreme Absolute. Partly because of Vaishnavite attacks  
on Shaivism during the previous century, one of his missions was a  
reconciliation of creeds, cults, and philosophy. He did not think that rival  
interpretations of the Vedas and Puranas were entirely in the wrong, asking: Who can prevent different interpretations when the Brahma Sutras themselves  
are capable of different meanings?   
He wrote the Chatur-mata-sara to illustrate the philosophical thoughts of the  
four prominent schools of interpretation of Brahma sutras. The Naya-manjari  
deals with advaita, the Naya-mani-mala with Srikanta mata, the Naya-mayukha-  
malika with Ramanuja's philosophy, and the Naya-muktavali with Madhva's  
philosophy. His remarkable catholicity of outlook, his thoroughness in  
writing, his impartiality, his unerring sense of values, and his concern for  
truth are all so evident in these writings that the Vaishnavas have adopted  
the Naya-Mayukha-Malika as their manual for study, and the Madhvas the Naya-  
Muktavali.   
 **Dikshitar graphically describes dvaita as the lowest step, vishishtadvaita  
as the middle step and sivadvaita and advaita which are very close to each  
other as the highest steps.** He makes it clear in his work that Srikantha-  
Bhashya on the Brahmasutra has been written in very close approximation to the  
trend of thought of Adi Sankara in his own bhashya.

Dear prasanth,   
Appayya Dikshitar was an erudite scholar with a lot of kavya-rasa   
appreciation in his ideas. Once he went with a king to a temple   
in Thanjavur district. One Veera Vaishnava scholar also went with   
them. The king saw an idol of Harihara putra [Ayyappa] and in the   
image, Ayyappa was placing his right index finger on his nose. This   
is a pose for showing astonishment or doubt. There was a general   
belief among the people in that place, that, when correct answer is given by  
anyone, Ayyappa would take away his index finger from   
the nose!   
The Vaishnava pandit was asked to explain, by the king.   
He explained in with all his anti-Siva feelings: "Ayyappa is telling Vishnu: O Narayana! You are so handsome.   
How come your brother in law [Siva] is very unclean with kabala   
garlands, begging bowl and serpents and holy ashes all over the body?"   
Ayyappa did not remove his index finger.   
Then Appayya Dikshitar's chance came. Appayya Dikshitar sings: "O Ayyappa, are you now astonished with this fact? You think,   
'I can call Siva as my father and Vishnu as my mother. But how   
can I call Lakshmi? How can I call my Mother's wife?' "   
Ayyappa immediately removed his index finger from his nose!   
Arunachala Siva.**
