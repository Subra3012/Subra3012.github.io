dear Friend,   
It is a sign of approaching self realization.The ego is unwilling to  
relinquish its 'hold'.   
Alan Chadwick had a similar experience. Suggest to read a Sadhu's  
Reminiscences of Ramana Maharshi(Alan Chadwick's narration of his remembrance  
of BHAGWAN)., .   
Trying to bring focus on 'I' by saying who is having the fear is the solution  
as Shri Anil repetedly emphasizes on this forum as a cure for all ills. It  
should be gently done focusing once again on the 'I'.   
The fear will go away and peace will take its place.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Ignore the comment, " _It is a sign of approaching self realization_ ", it  
will only fatten the ego.   
If you are sincere about self-inquiry and not merely attemting to attract  
attention   
do as Ramana Maharshi says and find the the Source of the 'i' that claims all  
these experiences,   
experiences of mind, body and world are all egoic and not-Self, disregard them  
and attend to the Source

I quite agree with James.Quite often self indulgence is mistaken for serious  
sadhana......For almost 99.9999........ % of seekers,it is important to first  
plant their feet firmly on terra firma......face the situations that are out  
there....live out life,earn a living honestly,take charge of one's  
life.......and one can and should carry out sadhana amidst these  
activities......If one is ripe enough,the outer activities will fall away  
without one having to desert it........the hollowness of the 'i',the doer has  
to be seen through these activities,and this in itself would bring about the  
desired ripeness.   
A life of 'exclusive meditation' may only lead to idleness and  
confusion......The solitude that one yearns for has to be found amidst  
carrying business in the world.Ashrams or retreats may be resorted to for  
gathering inspiration,serious introspection,etc.....but the same has to be  
leavened through active and purposeful striving in the world stage.   
Vairagya is not detachment but non attachment.Viveka is discrimination and  
this is to sift things that are temporal from that which is Essential,paying  
attention to both.Bhakti(Devotion) is to keep the inner flame alive even when  
one is caught up in outer activities and Jnana is when the Bhakti matures as  
total freedom from the temporal(inwardly).These four aspects are best served  
by living a life with earnestness and unflinching sense of purpose,even if it  
demands a plunge into so called hell.   
To keep things simple.....examine if there is any sort of shying away from  
everyday living......and put the house in order.......sadhana is essentially  
an inner change in attitude and sense of values,not a withdrawal from everyday  
living.   
Namaskar

Most often this is a sign of forcible suppression of thoughts and emotions and  
is to be avoided.....The mind has to calm down and not slow down.....and when  
the mind calms down,the breath will be very light and one may not perceive  
whether one is exhaling or inhaling unless one pays attention to it.....and  
the breathing will be long,deep and even and rhythmic......the body also will  
be felt quite light and nimble.....importantly the mind will not be empty but  
steeped in calm and contentment.....will be serene like a flame in a windless  
place.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Yes, there is no doubt about the verity of the observations you have made as  
above. However, I wish to respond to your post in detail under the thread  
'Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan.......', for I do not have any wish to  
engage in discussion in any other thread in this forum, because I never  
considered myself competent to advise or teach anyone.   
However, as for breath getting shortened, I wish to say that this is sometimes  
caused by the fear which one experiences when one has the momentary glimpse of  
the Infinite Reality during Sadhana, and one is not yet ready to steady such  
divine experiences. In such circumstances one needs to push the Enquiry  
further deeper by asking, 'To whom is the fear?', and thus keep the focus of  
the entire attention onto oneself, with love for the Self. However, I agree  
that when one attempts to suppress the thoughts and emotions forcibly, ego may  
panic resulting in shortened breath. I do not know what exactly has been Sri  
'Whom's mode of practice which caused panic and shortened breath. Enquiry as  
taught by Sri Bhagwan is a gentle method, and, in my view, if one adheres  
strictly to that, questions of panic or shortened breath cannot arise at all.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

This. It was the infinite, it was the unchanging. it was also an intense  
pressure in the head but I was too afraid it was death, and I had to stop it.  
With a great spark of fear I threw my arms up into the air so as to snap out  
of it.   
The conditions was a new devotee walking into the ashram sitting area and me  
sitting with purpose in his being. As other thoughts arose, one pointed  
control with repeating who am I.   
Sat sang contact and attention on a single thought were the conditions.   
My mind has a burning desire for contact with spiritual devotees, and it got  
it.   
I cannot share in personal stories or small talk. I need the conscious  
presence of the spiritual human being. With enough attraction, my being can be  
brought immediately into the greatest depths of stillness.

It was momentary, mind was stopped because it met its desires of being in an  
ashram and having presence contact with a spiritually attractive devotee. It  
did not need to think any more about planning future to achieve sat sang,  
vasanas were gone, it was not possible to put attention on an object, It was  
most striking how beyond impersonal it was, it was as if I died but death did  
not mean the end of existence. I didn't want to hold it steady because it was  
too scary, it was like the feeling of my foot falling asleep, but it was my  
existence falling asleep, and with such intense fear and dissapearance of any  
sense of I, I had to jerk myself out of it.

Fear is a thought and if one has stilled thought where is the question of  
fear?

" _do nothing_ " is the highest teaching. Ramana Maharshi demonstrated this  
through Silence. A rare few, by merely being in His presence, and the Silence  
would deliver them.   
However, Maharshi was aware that " _do nothing_ " was not suited to most  
people, they required words and practices: be still, self inquiry, meditation,  
japa, prayer, yoga etc.

I agree Ravi and Sadhak, these are only when the ego is active. Ramana  
Maharshi suggested we should ignore all such experiences, and direct attention  
to the Source from whence it arose. Namely, the space between thoughts.
