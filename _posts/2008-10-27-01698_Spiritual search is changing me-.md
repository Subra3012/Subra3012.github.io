Dear sirs.   
We all human beings got body. Take it commonly, irrespective of the sex. We  
know common man how he would take this body. We need not go to his views. But  
some sages they say it a obstacle for liberation, Bhagavan also says it is a  
curse, birth place for all disease having a body itself is a disease. On the  
otherhand many sages praise God for giving such a nice body. where they can  
see Him, talk sing and dance His glory. Can others give their own views.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 The human body is both. It is a curse because it is subjected to sufferings like old age, death etc.   
It is a blessing because it allows us to gain moksha.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Human body is the vehicle for a person to attain liberation. As   
Gangajal said, it is a blessing. At the same time, if you understand   
the stages of a human being, birth, growth, disease, senility, and   
decay, then it is a curse. It is left to us to convert the curse into   
blessing.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Human body gives an opportunity for us to do spiritual practice.With Jnanendriyas we can perceive Lord's manifestation.   
With karmendriyas we can adore the Lord.This body and mind is not ours,it is  
his property, so we must utilise it for his service only.   
Then the body is a benediction rather than a curse.

Who is it a blessing or curse for?   
Find out who then see. Such would be Ramana's answer.

Sri Sadhu om swamigal in "Path Of Ramana",says that only human beings can  
attain moksha since they alone have the capacity to experience all three  
states,ie waking state (Jagrat), dream state(Swapna) and deep sleep  
state(sushupthi). Aftere realising that that these three states are not real,  
they can realize the fourth state, that is Turiya or Samadhi state which is  
a state of realization..In the case of Deavas, they can experience only  
waking state, In the case of animals, they can experience only sleep state  
whereas plants can experience states only between waking and sleep state  
.If Devas, animal and plants have to attain moksha, they also have to born  
as human beings. **Hence of all the births, to be born as human being is a  
great blessing.**

Dear Subramanian,   
 You are right that human body is necessary to attain moksha.However,If you want to practice sadhana, you have to take care of the body.If the body is afflicted with disease and suffers from pain due to disease, then in that state it is very difficult to practice sadhana..Not only we have to keep our body healthy but we should have healthy mind.As Swami Suddhananda says, if we are in the state of agitation from morning to evening and if we sit for meditation in the evening, then instead of meditation, we will get only agitation.If a person is struggling to get even one meal a day, and suffers due want of food,then any amount of preaching about spirituality to a starving person will not go into his ears.I am able to practice sadhana, because i am reasonably healthy and there is no need for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing etc.In this context, it will be of interest to read the philosophy Mr.Hugo Meier, a staunch devotee of Bhagavan who started Shantimalai Trust which is doing a yeomen service to people around Tiruvannamalai.When he saw poor people around TVMalai, his heart melted and his first task was to raise the standard of living of poor people around TVMalai by imparting skills,providing Cows for livelihood, starting schools and providing health care which are all necessary to keep the body healthy..After meeting their basic needs, he started preaching spirituality and the people accepted his teachings since their basic needs have been met.   
I am convinced that if I am not healthy and hungry, I cannot receive  
spiritual instructions because the pain to my body due to hunger and disease  
will not allow me to turnto spirituality

Dear viswanthan   
You are correct. That is why I had stated "body with great care".   
Perhaps the phrase "body with more than necessary care" might   
have been better. Bhagavan Ramana used herbal medicines and   
English medicines to the extent necessary. To take more than   
necessary care, like inessential vitamins, face lifting measures   
like cosmetics, or costly soaps and hair oils, daily shave to look   
more handsome \-- He did not do all these things.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes body care is very much required but it should not be the sole motive of  
our life.   
I find Sri Sadhu Om example as described earlier very apt.   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4466.0   
Without 'I am the doer' attitude Charity is very necessary and even bhagavan  
ramana used to feed poor people and he never used to take food before sadhu's  
are feed properly.   
Somehow whenever i recollect these type of incidents i really get frustation  
why is that i never got a chance to meet our bhagavan.   
Just a glimpse of his physical appearance once is enough for me please god  
please...   
Glory to Guru Ramana.

Dear viswanathan,   
Of all births a human birth is the most essential to work out attainment of  
moksha. I agree. But there are a few rare examples   
in the history of civilization, like cactus bush which was given mokshsa by  
Umapati Sivam, and Cow Lakshmi, VaLLi, the deer,   
Jackie the dog and a crow by Bhagavan Ramana. Some great saints   
had to take one more birth as living beings but not as humans, like  
Jadabharata, who had to take birth as a deer.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 I agree with you that Bhagavan led a simple living with minimum requirement for sustenance and his life was his message.I have never seen Bhagavan wearing chappals in any photos or videos..Also there is no photo showing garland around his neck nor he wearing flower crown (Malar kridam)around his neck nor rudraksham mala around his neck which are all common with modern gurus.In the group photos of Bhagaan, we can see devotees sitting along with him side by side whereas wrt modern gurus, deotoees will not be allowed to sit in same level along with gurus. **Bhagavan fits hundred percent wrt to qualification prescribed in scriptures for Jeevan Muktas**. **. Now a days,there are many gurus and the devotees are confused whether the guru is real or fake and the devotees fall into trap.Such devotees can easily recognize a real guru if they compare the life of such gurus with that of Bhagavan to conclude whether such guru is real or fake.Bhagavan Ramana is a Gold Standard.**

Dear Ramanaduli, Human body is only a blessing. Every exsistence is blessing  
anyway. Even,human or not,everything will reach same goal sooner or later. If  
this body is illusion how it can be a curse?! Yes we sufer. But,we are part of  
Him. And we will exsist always. How glorious! Even without realisation human  
body is a blessing. We are realised anyway. We exsist,that is the best  
blessing we can have,i believe. And dont stop asking question if you have  
them. It is the way. The time will come when questions wont come anymore,by  
itself. With Gods grace.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. Human body is a blessing, no doubt. But one should not take   
more than necessary care towards the body. Bhagavan Ramana   
is, as you have said, Gold Standard. He never wore any sandals   
in His 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai. He never accepted garlands. No  
one must have seen a photograph of Bhagavan Ramana with a garland at anytime.  
He was wearing only a codpiece and in some rare cold days in winter, He used  
to have a shawl around His chest. There was one priest in Asramam doing pujas  
for   
Ramaneswara Maha Lingam. He fell sick and had a serious problem   
on his feet and that made him immobile. When Sri Ganesan came   
to see him and regretted why should Bhagavan Ramana give him   
such an immobility, the priest answered: "Do not worry. I am okay. Only one  
quarter is bad. Three quarters are good." This is   
the extent, one should have consideration for the body.

Dear Subramanian, Thats true. We should take care of body only that much to  
keep it healthy. And,what is very important,without atachment. When i said  
body is a blessing i ment that everything God gave us is a blessing. With body

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. That is the correct approach. Saint Tirumoolar says in his   
Tirumandiram: After realizing that Siva is in me, I start taking   
care of my body. Thus I take care of the body only to take care   
of my God. In another song, Tirumoolar says that: "This ULLam,   
[Heart] is a great Temple. This body made of flesh and bones and   
blood is also His Temple. Whatever I drink or eat, is the abulations for Siva  
in me. My five senses are the five lamps for Him!"   
He says in another song: I am doing Agni Karyam i.e., fire sacrifices daily.  
What is the fire sacrifice? What are the items   
that I put on the fire? [In the olden days, they used to put   
ghee, oil, sandal wood, dried cow dung, wood pieces etc.,].   
I am putting good food, good water and breathe in good air,   
to make this fire glow for ever!   
Tirumoolar was a Siva Raja Yogi. He is said to have lived for 3000 years. He  
took care of his body for the sake of Sivam inside.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. Human body is a blessing, no doubt. But one should not take   
more than necessary care towards the body. Bhagavan Ramana   
is, as you have said, Gold Standard. He never wore any sandals   
in His 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai. He never accepted garlands. No  
one must have seen a photograph of Bhagavan Ramana with a garland at anytime.  
He was wearing only a codpiece and in some rare cold days in winter, He used  
to have a shawl around His chest. There was one priest in Asramam doing pujas  
for   
Ramaneswara Maha Lingam. He fell sick and had a serious problem   
on his feet and that made him immobile. When Sri Ganesan came   
to see him and regretted why should Bhagavan Ramana give him   
such an immobility, the priest answered: "Do not worry. I am okay. Only one  
quarter is bad. Three quarters are good." This is   
the extent, one should have consideration for the body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, Thats true. We should take care of body only that much to  
keep it healthy. And,what is very important,without atachment. When i said  
body is a blessing i ment that everything God gave us is a blessing. With body  
or not we exsist. We are part of something beautiful. And thats only metters.  
That doasnt mean one should be concerned to much with body. It is only just  
the way to realise the Self.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. That is the correct approach. Saint Tirumoolar says in his   
Tirumandiram: After realizing that Siva is in me, I start taking   
care of my body. Thus I take care of the body only to take care   
of my God. In another song, Tirumoolar says that: "This ULLam,   
[Heart] is a great Temple. This body made of flesh and bones and   
blood is also His Temple. Whatever I drink or eat, is the abulations for Siva  
in me. My five senses are the five lamps for Him!"   
He says in another song: I am doing Agni Karyam i.e., fire sacrifices daily.  
What is the fire sacrifice? What are the items   
that I put on the fire? [In the olden days, they used to put   
ghee, oil, sandal wood, dried cow dung, wood pieces etc.,].   
I am putting good food, good water and breathe in good air,   
to make this fire glow for ever!   
Tirumoolar was a Siva Raja Yogi. He is said to have lived for 3000 years. He  
took care of his body for the sake of Sivam inside.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A Self Realized person (Brahma Jnani), will not have any doubts   
and he will not ask any questions. Bhagavan was in that state.   
Sometimes He would put a counter-question or ask "Find out who   
is the questioner?" or 'Doubt the doubter,' etc., These are all not   
questions but only to seek the stand of the questioner, more clearly.   
But the fact is all of us ask questions. Have doubts. This shows   
we are all not self realized though our levels of maturity to attain   
the goal may be different.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in His song Atma Viddai:-   
Verse 4: Of what avail is knowing things   
Other than the Self? And the Self being known   
What other thing is there to know?   
That One Light that shines as many selves,   
Seeing this Self within   
As Awareness' lightning flash;   
The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized person my have some doubts also   
for example if he does not know the way to a particular place... he may ask  
"what is the way to this place ?"   
and he may also have other doubts "where are you coming from? "   
or "how come u r doing this like this"   
lot of doubts can be there!   
why should a Self Realized person not have doubts?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Such simple doubts may arise in a Jnani too. It is like a Jnani   
eating, drinking water, attending to natural calls.   
But what is amazing in Bhagavan Ramana's life is He did not even   
ask these simple doubts! When He was traveling to Tiruvannamalai,   
it is one Moslem Moulvi who had said that He should get down at   
Tindivanam and catch a another train. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai and  
so He had no doubts as to the places where He   
had to go further. Whenever some new visitors came, He NEVER asked wherefrom  
he was coming or to which place he was going further.   
Narayana Guru came to see Bhagavan Ramana. He was in Virupaksha Cave.  
Narayana Guru saw Him from outside by looking into the cave. After some time,  
Bhagavan came out. Then He   
simply said "Let us take our lunch!" While Bhagavan took His usual   
ganji [rice gruel] served by Pazhaniswami, Narayana Guru took his special food  
brought by his disciples. They looked at each other for some minutes. Then  
Bhagavan Ramana simply left for stroll on the   
Hill!   
Narayana Guru was amazed. Here is a person, who does not   
ask wherefrom I am coming, what is my name, whereto I am going, what is my  
job, what is my caste.... He is ever in Nirvirtti! He   
is the Self which does not ask questions or doubts. This Narayanana writes  
this poem in reverence to this great Jnani!   
Like this he wrote five verses titled Nirvritti Panchakam, with a   
paper and pencil brought by his disciples and left the poem to   
Pazhaniswami. After this historic meeting, Narayana Guru stopped   
asking questions to his visitors and whenever someone had gone to Kerala from  
Tamizh Nadu, he only used to ask: "Did you meet   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi? Without meeting such a person,   
what is the point in running around to places and meeting gurus?"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
These story's of Ramana's life are excellent.   
There are many gurus and realized people, but none can compare to the effect  
Ramana had and still has on people.   
I wonder why Ramana is such a great force.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it  
something really like that,or not. I can ask "What is the soul?". Without  
expectation. Just ask. And i can ask "Is it soul that,or is it maybe something  
else?"

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, You are correct. Only,the point is sometimes just in  
different looking on things. Without hate or love. But,i will say you are  
correct. Humility is needed. And dear Srkudai, Thank you for the link you sent  
me!
