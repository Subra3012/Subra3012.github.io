Dear Marjan, Bhagavad Gita commentary by A.C. Prabhupada,   
the founder of ISKCON movement is a Krishana-advaiti. That is,   
he believes in One without a second, but that One is Krishna!   
This where the trouble starts. When Sankara said that there is One   
without a second, Sri Ramanuja said that the One is Narayana and   
Sri Madhva that the One is Krishna. Saiva Siddhantis say that the One   
is Siva. This is how Philosophy gave in to Religion.   
So, in Atharva Veda and Gopala Tapani Upanishad, the Brahman is   
called as Krishna. Prabhupada said the same thing.   
But what is there in a name, Marjan? The rose is always a rose,   
in whatever name you call it. Names and forms do differ, but the Self   
remains the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 ISKCON does not really appreciate calling Krishna as the one.   
To them Krishna is different from Ganesha, Hanuman, Kali or Siva. So one who  
worships one of these other deities is supposed to be not on the correct way.   
And they believe that Advaita is wrong sankara was, they believe, siva  
trying to cheat us all by preaching advaita and not preaching dvaita /  
vishishta advaita.   
I have some friends who follow ISKCON!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, if Krishna is different from Ganesa, Siva,   
Uma and Skanda, then Krishna is not One without a   
second. If there is more than one, why not someone   
else going for the second or third or fourth? This is   
where Philosophy was interpreted as religion and   
then the whole lot of trouble started.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Vaishnavaites do not have a separate concept   
of Ganesa. They have got a deity called Thumbikkai Azhwar,   
who is the foremost devotee of Narayana, a devotee with   
a trunk like elephant! Do not laugh. In Srirangam, Tamil   
Nadu, you can see a sculpture of him!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar and others, When one starts unlearning,   
the Truth will shine. Any amount of book knowledge   
will not help. In Viveka Choodamani, Sankara speaks   
about 'three sticking'. The sticking to the body, the   
sticking to wife, children and family and the sticking   
to books! This Eeashana thrayam should go.

Instead of scrutinising the available present moment why you think of birth  
and death.   
You are escaping from the present life and attending unnecessary things.   
If you are sincerely interested in "who am i"scrutinise the present with  
uninterrupted awareness.

Dear Sankar and others,   
Do not 'think' about birth and death. Birth and death are only   
for those who are bound in body, world and ego. If you can   
cease to 'think' and be in the 'present', you will conquer   
both and birth and death. See Bhagavan's Ulladu Narpadu   
and Ulladu Narpadu (Anubandam), that is, Forty verses on   
Reality and Supplement to Forty verses on Reality.
