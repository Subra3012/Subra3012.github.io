**Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses**   
This world is a relative world, a shadow of the real; still, being the plane  
of equipoise where happiness and misery are about evenly balanced, it is the  
only plane where man can realise his true Self and know that he is Brahman.   
 **The greatest teacher of the Vedanta philosophy was Shankaracharya.** By  
solid reasoning he extracted from the Vedas the truths of Vedanta, and on them  
built up the wonderful system of Jnana that is taught in his commentaries. He  
unified all the conflicting descriptions of Brahman and showed that there is  
only one Infinite Reality. He showed too that as man can only travel slowly on  
the upward road, all the varied presentations are needed to suit his varying  
capacity. We find something akin to this in the teachings of Jesus, which he  
evidently adapted to the different abilities of his hearers. First he taught  
them of a Father in heaven and to pray to Him. Next he rose a step higher and  
told them, "I am the vine, you are the branches", and lastly he gave them the  
highest truth: "I and my Father are one", and "The Kingdom of Heaven is within  
you." Shankara taught that three things were the great gifts of God: (1) human  
body, (2) thirst after God, and (3) a teacher who can show us the light. When  
these three great gifts are ours, we may know that our redemption is at hand.  
Only knowledge can free and save us, but with knowledge must go virtue.   
 **Do not pity anyone. Look upon all as your equal, cleanse yourself of the  
primal sin of inequality.** We are all equal and must not think, "I am good  
and you are bad, and I am trying to reclaim you". Equality is the sign of the  
free. Jesus came to publicans and sinners and lived with them. He never set  
himself on a pedestal. Only sinners see sin. See not man, see only the Lord.  
Spirit is not in time, nor in space. Realise "I am Existence Absolute,  
Knowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute -- i am He, I am He". Be glad at birth, be  
glad at death, rejoice always in the love of God.   
 **Thought is all important, for "what we think we become". There was once a  
Sannyasin, a holy man, who sat under a tree and taught the people. He drank  
milk, and ate only fruit, and made endless "Pranayamas", and felt himself to  
be very holy. In the same village lived an evil woman. Every day the Sannyasin  
went and warned her that her wickedness would lead her to hell. The poor  
woman, unable to change her method of life which was her only means of  
livelihood, was still much moved by the terrible future depicted by the  
Sannyasin. She wept and prayed to the Lord, begging Him to forgive her because  
she could not help herself. By and by both the holy man and the evil woman  
died. The angels came and bore her to heaven, while the demons claimed the  
soul of the Sannyasin. "Why is this!" he exclaimed, "have I not lived a most  
holy life, and preached holiness to everybody? Why should I be taken to hell  
while this wicked woman is taken to heaven?" "Because," answered the demons,  
"while she was forced to commit unholy acts, her mind was always fixed on the  
Lord and she sought deliverance, which has now come to her. But you, on the  
contrary, while you performed only holy acts, had your mind always fixed on  
the wickedness of others. You saw only sin, and thought only of sin, so now  
you have to go to that place where only sin is." The moral of the story is  
obvious: The outer life avails little. The heart must be pure and the pure  
heart sees only good, never evil. We should never try to be guardians of  
mankind, or to stand on a pedestal as saints reforming sinners. Let us rather  
purify ourselves, and the result must be that in so doing we shall help  
others.**   
The satisfaction of desire only increases it, as oil poured on fire but makes  
it burn more fiercely. Only through renunciation of this life and of all life  
to come (heaven etc.), can we reach the point where we stand firmly on the  
true Self. While we hope for anything, desire still rules us.   
_Buddha and Christ are the two greatest "bubbles" the world has known. They  
were great souls who having realised freedom helped others to escape. Neither  
was perfect, but they are to be judged by their virtues, never by their  
defects. Jesus fell short, because he did not always live up to his own  
highest ideal; and above all, because he did not give woman an equal place  
with man. Woman did everything for him, yet not one was made an apostle. This  
was doubtless owing to his Semitic origin. The great Aryans, Buddha among the  
rest, have always put woman in an equal position with man. For them sex in  
religion did not exist. In the Vedas and Upanishads, women taught the highest  
truths and received the same veneration as men._   
 **Both happiness and misery are chains, the one golden, the other iron; but  
both are equally strong to bind us and hold us back from realising our true  
nature. The Atman knows neither happiness nor misery.** These are mere  
"states", and states must ever change. The nature of the soul is bliss and  
peace unchanging. We have not to get it; we have it; let us wash away the  
dross from our eyes and see it. We must stand ever on the Self and look with  
perfect calmness upon all the panorama of the world. It is but baby's play and  
ought never to disturb us. If the mind is pleased by praise, it will be pained  
by blame.

Dear prasanth,   
Bhagavan Ramana, however said that our primal sin is Ego. It is the   
ego, which makes differences, creates inequality, caste differences,   
color differences etc. When Adam and Eve were there in the Garden   
of Heaven, God told them only one thing. Do not eat the forbidden   
apple. They however ignored God's advice and took it. Then the   
ego came and with that ego, they started understanding their sexual  
differences of male and female and tried to cover their private parts.   
Thus the ego comes first and from it comes all the differences. The ego is  
the original sin.   
Arunachala Siva.
