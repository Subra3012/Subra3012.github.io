Body is a flux,continuously changing,moving.I t has nothing of eternal in it.   
If you are identified with the body through 'I" thought ufcourse the fear of   
death will be constantly there.You can live but you can live only in fear.   
In fact, the body is dying every moment.The body dies every day.   
Death is a process.Death is not an event; it is a long process.   
By and by, the body comes to a point where it cannot hold itself.   
It disintegrates.How can one live? How can one celebrate?   
How can one dance and sing and be? Impossible.   
The death wonÂ’t allow it. The death is too much and too close.   
So Bhagawan faced this fact of fear there and then when he had   
intense death fear at the age of 16 in Madurai.He has great Sankalpa bala.   
He felt now this body is dead,it will be taken for cremation to the burial  
ground.   
With the death of the body am i dead.His body is really dead and developed   
Rigor mortis.But he observed that his awareness survived the death of the  
body.   
So he existentially came to know that his essential nature is awareness but  
not   
the body-mind complex with which we are identified with and feel that we are  
that   
body-mind complex.What Bhagawan did is is real Self-inquiry.Death is a concept  
of   
"I" thought.In death of physical body "I" thought becomes fearful of losing  
identity   
with the body and feels "I am dying".So death is concept of "I" thought.   
In Self-inquiry we witness everything consciously.That which is witnessed is  
not you.   
You are the witnessor.So the world of objects,body,mind is not you.   
One who is capable of witnessing life is also capable of witnessing death.   
In death your awareness don't die,the awareness that is imprisoned in   
body-mind complex is released.If you don't die rightly i.e if you don't  
achieve   
the total orgasm that death is,you will be born again you missed it and you   
have to be given another opportunity.   
A life of awareness is a real life.A life of mind is a dead life.The one who  
identifies   
with the mind thinks continuously,brooding,playing with words.Life is an  
opportunity   
to be here and now but he always thinks of somewhere else.   
This is utopia which means "that which never comes".   
Movement of mind is just an animation of the contents of the mind on the   
background of screen of awareness.We are identified with the animation and we   
completely forgot the screen of awareness.To shift our attention from this  
animation   
to the screen of awareness Self-inquiry is the way.If we don't give energy to  
this   
animated movement by just being aware of it like a mirror,the movement of the  
mind   
stops.In Self-inquiry which is done with awareness we no longer give energy to  
such   
outgoing mind and so the awareness is not directed and so there is no apparent   
movement of it through mind,awareness falls on itself and when this happens  
for the   
first time we taste the nature of life and we receive something unknown,   
unbelievable,unexpected,never even dreamed of and we don't feel like leaving   
that state like Bhagawan.It is so blissful,tranquil,serene,without any  
pain,sorrow,limitation.   
This light of awareness is called Purusha by Hindus.The word Pur u sha means  
the dawn   
in the city(body-mind complex filled with the light of awareness),he who is  
filled with light,   
he who is filled with wisdom and eternal happiness,a citizen of heaven.   
It can be also pronounced as Pu rhusha which means whose passions are purified   
and who has become deathless.All these qualities are there in Bhagawan and he  
is   
the Purusha mentioned in Bhagawad Gita.Our material nature is body-mind  
complex(Prakruti)   
in which light of Purusha is reflected and makes our material nature to get  
animated.   
Our essential nature is Purusha which can be discovered through Self-inquiry  
like Bhagawan.   
We just forgot our nature of Purusha due to superimposition of our material  
nature on Purusha.   
This is due to the defect of superimposition(Adhyasa).To claim back our  
Purushahood which is   
our essential nature and   
which is birthless and deathless, Self-inquiry is the way.There is death only  
to our   
material nature of body-mind complex when the energy of reflection of Purusha  
is withdrawn from it.   
Death can exist only in the ignorance of what life is and we taste life which  
is   
existence plus awareness i.e Pure awareness,   
Purusha, in Self-inquiry.So in Self-inquiry we go beyond the concept of death   
because we go beyond the the concept of "I" thought and we   
attain to the state of immortality.This is Asatoma Sadgamaya,Tamasoma  
Jyotirgamaya,   
Mrutyorma amrutangamaya.So let us practice Self-inquiry sincerely and attain  
to this eternal   
state of being.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Excellent. The body is constantly dying. Many many cells are   
dying within our body and many many cells are growing anew.   
In seven years they say that the entire body has got new sets   
of cells. So we are all constantly dying, our eye sight is getting   
dimmer, the ear is losing its power to listen, teeth are falling,   
hairs are falling and growing but at one stage they stop growth,   
the liver is losing its digesting capacity.   
A lamp is burning. There is oil, there is a wick. One can say   
that the lamp is burning or the better way is to say that the   
lamp is extinguishing. So also with camphor arti. The arti is   
glowing or the arti is slowing dying.   
Then what is the way out? One should first attempt and succeed in the death  
of the ego. The ego's death is deathlessness.   
What is this way? The way is, since death is a process of time, where the  
future and past are related, one should meditate solely   
and wholly on the "now".   
GVK Verses: 746: If you want to attain the eternal glory of deathlessness, that is devoid  
of the ignominy of death and birth, the proper means is to meditate solely and  
wholly on the "now", which is without even a trace of the motions of coming  
and going.   
747: Only those who, after first seeing time as themselves, then   
abandon that vision completely are the Jnanis, who have gained immortality  
upon this earth. All others fall under the eroding saw of time and perish.  
{This is also described by Bhagavan Ramana   
in Verse 16 of ULLadu Narpadu}.   
748: Those who are firmly anchored in the state of the Self   
will see only the Self, and no such thing as time. Much less will they see  
the one principle, that [apparently] ripens into time as three different  
times.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Talks No. 625: The idea of time is only in your mind. It is not in the Self. There is no  
time for the Self. Time arises as an idea after the ego   
arises. But you are the Self beyond time and space. You even   
exist in the absence of time and space.   
Arunachala Siva.
