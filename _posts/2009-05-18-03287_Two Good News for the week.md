## Two Good News for the week

There are two good news for the general public in India.   
One is the renewal of democracy and parliamentary process,   
after a very carefully organized elections through which one   
party without begging other small parties for forming the govt.   
has been able to form a stable govt. The second is the killing   
of Velupillai Pirabhakaran, the Chief of LTTE, in an ambush,   
by SLA inside the New Safety Zone, this evening, to bring the 30 year old war  
to an end. Restoration of land mass of entire Sri Lanka is now controlled by  
the government. LTTE was occupying   
one fourth of the land mass of that country. LTTE is the most   
feared terrorist group in the entire globe, owning even small warships and  
light figher aircrafts. They have been operating   
since 30 years. They are the inventors of human bombs, which   
were earlier called belt bombs. Pirabhakaran killed Mayor Doriayappa the then  
Jaffna Mayor, from a distance of 20 feet with one single bullet shot. He was  
by then 16 only. This happened in 1988 and it was his first murder and he  
overnight became the leader. He killed all the leaders of splinter groups,  
ruthlessly. He arranged the killing of PM of India, Rajiv Gandhi and the PM  
of Sri Lanka Premadasa, in 1990s. He arranged the killing of Dharmalingam, a  
soft line Tamil political leader of Sri Lanka, who was holidaying in Chennai  
in his residence, in point blank range. He distributed cynaide capsules to  
the cadres,   
and were asked to bit them if they are caught alive. But he   
was afraid to bite it himself.   
There is a misconceived notion from some Indians that   
all Tamilians are supporters/sympathsizers of LTTE. Nothing   
is farther from truth. When the real purpose of equality for   
Tamils in Sri Lanka with Sri Lankans was lost sight of by the terrorist  
groups particularly LTTE, all sympathy had been lost.   
However all political parties in Tamil Nadu were projecting   
this as the only election issue, which is a pity. The most   
vociferous speaker Vaiko himself lost his election!   
Arunachala Siva.

I wonder about the kind of karmic burden that mass murderers carry...How many  
lifetimes would it take to get rid of the effects of such karma?

Dear nobody,   
I do not really know. We know Ravana who did just one   
mistake and got killed by Rama. Sisupala did 100 mistakes   
and on his 100th mistake he was killed by Krishna. Daksha   
did one mistake of not inviting Siva for the sacrifice and he   
was ruthlessly killed. What will happen to such perpetrators   
of mass killing, like Hitler and Prabhakaran? I do not what   
God wills for them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
In many books it is written that, Lord Krishna says, I am in everywhere and in  
everyone. If so, in spite of Lord is living within Prabhakaran, kamsa, Hitler   
why this type of bad things is taken place. As because they have not realaised  
that God is there.   
In tamil it says, KOLVAVANUM AVANE KOLAPPADUVAVANUM AVENE) if it is so, then  
who we are>   
Just witness?

Dear ramanaduli,   
The Self or Brahman is everywhere, in every living being   
and also in inanimate objects. But why human beings   
alone have these vengence, murderous intentions etc..?   
A Hill does not smash up another hill. A river does not   
fight with other river. Any dog chases another dog only   
when its food or security is threatened. But human beings   
are the highest evolution of god but at the same time, it   
is full of ego. It is all ego's murderous dance. Is it not?   
Even in olden days, one king fought with another in a formal   
manner, but not through insurgency. Even an unarmed solider   
is not killed by another soldier. Rama asked Ravana to go back   
and come next day. But these are all lost in the modern insurgency and  
warfare. Unarmed civilians are killed. Soft   
line politicians are killed. Hotel inmates were killed in Mumbai   
massacre. When this ego is overcome or when the mind is   
killed, the man becomes god. Krishna said that all have been killed already  
because he was speaking from god's point of view and not from a man's point of  
view.   
Arunachala Siva.

Which is powerfull? The "Self or Ego"   
If eerything is created by God, then why He has to create Ego whcih is the  
root cause for everything.   
Understanding the ego and rremoving it, needs so many births. Is not it?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Obviously the Self is more powerful. Even to say 'more' is   
incorrect, because there is nothing other than the Self. Wherefrom the ego,  
then comes? Ego comes from the mind.   
Who creates the mind? The mind is not created, but it is   
part of the Self. How then mind becomes a monkey? It   
is because of man's karmas, in the previous births. So,   
when the mind is dirtied by ego which is the product of karmas,   
how can the Self be blamed? The bhoomi, the earth, is one of   
the five elements and is God. Bhoomi is by itself good. But   
who plants ' Clayormon mines' on the earth, which makes another man blow up in  
pieces, when stepped on. The God definitely did not plant 'Clayormon mines'.  
It is LTTE which   
plants and according to one estimates, 10000 people have died   
only because of 'Clayormon mines' and 'phosphorous bombs'   
in the battle Kilinochi in Sri Lanka.   
Arunachala Siva.
