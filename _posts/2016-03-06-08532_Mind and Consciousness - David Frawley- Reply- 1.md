Modern science similarly identifies mind and consciousness, equating the  
faculty of thinking with the power   
of awareness. It takes us back to the basic Cartesian dictum, 'I think  
therefore I am'. It regards consciousness   
as primarily self consciousness, the activity of the personal self as, for  
example, the ability to recognize ourselves   
in a mirror, which capacity animals, except possibly for some primates, do not  
seem to have.   
On this basis, modern science identifies consciousness with the mind and the  
mind with the brain. This   
identification as resulted in seeking to improve our mental and emotional  
functioning through altering   
brain chemistry with pharmaceutical preparations. Mainstream science usually  
does not recognize consciousness   
as a spiritual or cosmic principle apart from the mind, though some trends in  
the new physics are beginning   
to suggest this. It is still a largely a physical view of the mind that we  
find in medicine today.   
The Yogic view of the mind, however, is very different. It is based on  
meditation and inner experience,   
rather than outer experimentation. It tries to understand the mind through  
introspection or turning   
our awareness within, rather than by analyzing outer mental patterns. It  
encourages us to observe the   
mind rather than follow its reactions. It teaches us to understand the process  
of perception and how it   
conditions us, rather than to merely examine our memories.
