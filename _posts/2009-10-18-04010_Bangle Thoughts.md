## Sri Dakshinamurty - the Formless and the Form  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 16, 2009, 08:35:17 AM  
---  
Sri Dakshinamurty is actually a Formelss Self. A spiritual guru   
who looks at his right chest from the north pole facing south.   
It is dakshina-amurty. South facing formless god, a paradox.   
Spritual North Pole, the Deathless, looking at the south, the   
traditional direction of death, god of death, Yama, in Hindu   
pantheon.   
For people, who like forms to do meditation, he is described   
as follows: The Sages of Namisaranya forest came to him. His body is   
cool and has the coolness of a marble, spotless white, with   
white holy ashes. His feet are like red corals and his four hands   
are like four lotuses. His mouth too is like a red lotus. The   
upper right hand has got a rudraksha bead, strings of beads that   
came from his tears for the downtrodden. His right eye represents   
sun and the left the moon. The third eye represents the Fire,   
fire of knowledge for people who understand him and the fire   
of destruction for the ignorant. His lower right hand shows the   
chinmudra the hand-pose. The forefinger is the Jivatma and the   
thumb is the Paramatma. When the index finger stoops to the   
bottom of the thumb, leaving the remaining three fingers representing, ego,  
desire, and karma, the Jivatma gets united   
with the Paramatma.   
His left upper hand shows a pot of nectar, that liberates the   
Jivas. The dark patch of poison on the throat shows that   
one should not swallow the poison of death but retain to   
wait for the grace of Guru. He is the guru sitting at a stone   
like banyan tree, the stone structure reminding us that he   
is ageless, unlike trees that grow and wither. He is ever   
youthful, showing that the Self is every young, nitya, eternal,   
without old senility, disease and death.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Bangle Thoughts  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 18, 2009, 07:25:54 AM

Right from antiquity, Indians are wearing bangles. Even men   
wore bangles in the olden days. The bangles were originally   
made with conch-shells, then with gold and silver and copper.   
With the discovery of glass, glass bangles became popular.   
This gave place to plastic bangles.   
In Srimad Narayaneeyam, there is one story. There was a girl   
staying in a house. Her parents had gone for some purchases   
outside. Suddenly, the party who wanted to give their son   
in wedding to the girl came to the house. The girl had to quickly   
pound the paddy grains, to make rice and then prepare some food   
and other items for their lunch. She started pounding the grains.   
The bangles on her wrists made noices. She removed one by   
one. Still, there was some noise. She had now only two bangles.   
Even these made noice. She removed one. And there was only   
one bangle, and there was absolute silence, and she started   
pounding the grains without distracting the guests! She felt   
that one should be silent in life to 'realize' and this demands being   
single, all alone, without any noise.   
Chidambaram Ramalinga Swamigal says: Pasithiru, Vizhithiru,   
Thanithiru. Be always hungry, Be always awake, Be always alone.   
If one is hungry, (somewhat), then he will not get sleep. This   
will help him to be awake. And he must be alone, to make   
meditation or Japa. Two is a crowd, distracting Sadhana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Goddess Parvathi was relaxing a while on her sides, her hand bedecked with  
golden bangles resting on her bossom and her elbow on her waist.Lord Siva drew  
her attention by gently stroking the bangles which produced a jingling sound  
. This melody and the posture of Goddess Parvathi created a beautiful  
impression in the mind of Lord Siva and that's how the music instrument Veena  
was conceived and created.

Dear arcsekar,   
Very nice. There are several imageries in Indian literature with   
bangles. In Tiruvilayadal Puranam, describing the holy sports   
of Siva in Madurai, the young girls throw their pearl-bangles to   
drive out the doves and parrots from their play-yards! In Srimad   
Ramayanam, it is said that when Hanuman was flying skyward   
to Lanka from Kishkinta, he found young women throwing pearl-   
bangles to drive out the birds. Then he guessed that that, land   
must be Pandya Kingdom, where the rich Pandyan kings were   
ruling from Madurai.   
Arunachala Siva.   
In Tiruvachakam, Saint Poet Manikkavachagar says: "He has first taken my bangles and then I became ruled by Him.   
Then He has also taken away my mind!   
The bangles are taken away by Siva, because the girl (the poet)   
has become so lean with her parting pangs, without union with   
Siva, that her bangles fell off from her thinned wrists! Then   
her mind is also taken away, mano-nasam has occured and she   
has united with Siva, as Sivam, the One without a second!   
The situation is something similar to what Bhagavan Ramana   
sings in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 2. Kandvan evan ena   
karuthinuL nada, kandavan inrida ninrathu kanden.....

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Do you know the story where Shiva sold bangles in Madurai. You mentioned the  
thruvilaiyadal happened in Madurai but not about Shiva. If you know   
please post the story.   
In the same way in Tamil Literature there are 5 kapiyam. One of the kapiyams  
is valaiyapathi. I have not read about this epic. If you know you can also   
write briefly,.   
I heard that why we are having bangles. They say that we have got some  
accupressure point on our wrist, The bangles always makes some pressure   
which is good for health.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam, there is a story where Siva came as   
a bangle seller, and touched Meenashi's wrists to fix bangles   
on her hands. She, by the mere touch of Siva, knew that the   
bangle seller is Siva. This story is called Chetty Valaiyal Vitra   
Padalam, the story of Chetty (trader) selling bangles. This   
is one of the 64 holy sports of Siva in the Puranam.   
Regarding Valaiyapathi, this is one of the 5 great epics   
(Kaappiyam) of Tamil, dating from 3rd C. AD to 7th C. AD.   
Of the five great epics only two are available, viz., Silappadikaram,   
the story of Kannagi and Manimekalai, the story of Madhavi's   
(the woman of Kovalan) daughter, who embraced Buddhism.   
The Valaiyapati epic is not available. There are some stories   
and that is all. So also, Jeevaka Chintamani, and Kundalakesi.   
These two are also not available excepting some stories.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the information of 5 epics. They say our Tamil thai has got these 5  
Abaranam. All these are Kundalakesi, valaiyapathi,manimegali,Jeevaka  
chithamani and last is chilapadhikarams. I have not read except  
chilapadhikarams. Now a days very few people are interested in these Tamil  
illakiyam like old people 50 to 70.   
As they are going to English medium school they miss lots. Our whole illakiyam  
talks about Atma and paramathma only. Our days education was food for atma   
gyanam whereas modern education gives comfort and luxury life.   
Yesterday was Annaabishekam in our Shiva temple. It was so nice and we chanted  
Thruvachagam. Going to the forum and reading thruvachagam gives a new   
dimension and clarity. Especially I have to thank Udaiji's astavakra geetha  
which hooks me always.   
It is all His grace.

My dear Ramanaduli,   
Annabhishekam for Siva lingam is done on Pradosham day of   
Tula month. The steam cooked rice with ghee is prepared in   
huge quantities and the rice is kept around Sivalingam in such   
a way that the Lingam is covered totally, showing only the   
round seat, which symblizes Mother. This is avadai in Tamil.   
I watched Annabhishekam in some Siva temples of Tamil Nadu,   
in Sri Sankara TV.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam: Annam Balikkum anikoL thillai kandane.... (Kanda Pathu)   
I saw the Annabhishekam in Thillai or Chidambram.   
OR   
I saw Thillai which serves cooked rice all times whenever   
devotees go there.   
Siva is abhisheka priya, the one who likes abhishekam or abulations. He does  
not want ornaments. The serpents,   
skull garland, tiger's skin and elephant's skin, the crescent   
moon and the Ganga are enough for him. Narayana however   
likes ornaments, pearl garlands, peacock feather as head ornament,   
kaustubha garland, tulsi garland, yellow silken robe and a flute   
on his hand!   
Arunachala Siva.
