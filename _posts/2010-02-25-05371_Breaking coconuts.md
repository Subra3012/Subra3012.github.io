## Learning Silence  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 25, 2010, 10:22:54 AM

Silence can be learned from gods as well as dogs (god spelled reversely).   
Everyone knows how silence is learned from gods.   
This is how silence is learned from dogs.   
When dogs bark at you in the streets, they expect you to become afraid and run  
for life; then they can chase you in herds and bark more and more; you run  
faster for life and they bark louder to death.   
If you are not afraid, the dogs feel insulted. If you throw stones at them,  
you may hurt them and also make them angry. If you please them and run, they  
will chase you to the point of biting. So you are locked in both ways.   
So the best course is to be silent.   
You can learn silence from gods at holy places.   
Perchance you will also learn silence from dogs there itself.

Long back I also had a dog. The relationship was, I was the master and the dog  
was the servant. The situation was wagging and "flagging". The dog wagged and  
rolled on the ground with half-down ears and it rained bliss.   
To a visitor (unknown) the relationship was, the dog was the master and the  
visitor was the servant. The situation was fly or die. At least cry, for dog's  
sake.

Very true. Also the dogs do not seem to possess any inner enmity towards any  
stranger even when they bark and pose threatening, for after a couple of days  
when the stranger is seen as friend the dog behaves as if they are known for  
ages. It is more of guarding and also sometimes showing their prowess. Human  
beings build stages to display their skills. For street dogs, street is the  
stage and strangers are welcome to play the opposite role.

Just a small pointer I felt to share - The more we try to learn about silence,  
the more we are going away from it! Who is the 'I' that has come about to  
learn Silence. Who am I to whom these thoughts are arising to?   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Bhagavan Ramana has used the dog-simile in one or two places. He says   
"Just as dogs know their Masters, the ego knows its Master, the Self, by   
keeping silent and simply smelling the bliss of the Self in total silence.   
With Bhagavan Ramana, dogs have behaved more strangely than humans.   
One dog accompanied the devotee, who was afraid of the loneliness during   
circumambulation, a dog appeared suddenly and led him through the pradakshina,  
for some distance. After some time, when the devotee came   
back to the Old Hall, the dog was waiting already to ensure that the devotee   
had completed the pradakshina safe and returned to the Asramam.   
The stories of Jackie I and II etc., should be known to the members.   
Arunachala Siva.

Our all Hindu God has animals and birds for their vehicle. Why? Human beings  
are not worth to be their vahanas.Or to learn some good things from them?   
In villages when the dog barks, people say loudly Bairava. They believe the  
barking dogs will become silent.   
Dogs are Bairavas vahanas. Saint Manikkavachakar always compares himself with  
dog. Can Subramaniyan ji give the detail. Manikkavachakar says NAYEN.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the olden days, dogs were considered very lowly. There were   
no pet dogs, travelling in cars and perambulators. So, Saint Manikkavachagar  
used the dog simile to equate him. He even   
says that he is "a dog lowlier than dog" meaning a sick dog or so.   
He considered himself as a blind cow. As the blind cow goes behind   
another cow (with good eyes), merely by listening to the sound   
of the latter, Ammaa.... he would reach Siva by going behind   
other mature devotees! For Siva all living beings are the same   
fit for liberation. So Siva likes even a dog that is doing its   
'karma as per its birth. Further dog is considered a faithful animal. Faith  
to the Master. Such total faith in god is needed by devotees!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[1] Professional singing!  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 28, 2010, 03:02:03 PM

Dear SLakshmi,   
Many singers and great poets have become dumbfounded in the   
presence of Bhagavan Ramana. Not because they are afraid.   
They only become choked with emotions. They could not sing   
or read their poems. It is like lighting a candle before the Sun.   
However, Bhagavan Ramana encouraged them all. He told   
Sampurnamma: Even if you do not understand head or tail, it   
does not matter, please read Ribhu Gita. Muruganar, the great   
poet (he was a Tamil teacher) came with a poem before Bhagavan   
Ramana when he came for the first time. It was Desika Padigam   
in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. Muruganar could not read even   
one line properly. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye, please give that   
paper to me." And then He read the poem written on Himself by   
Muruganar.   
Many great Tamil pandits cannot read the first Benedictory Verse   
of ULLadu Narpadu in one stretch without getting stuck. The words   
are closely packed and reading is very difficult. Understanding it   
is much more difficult.   
There is also one story about Professional Wailers. About this   
later....   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
You know when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Hill, in total mounam,   
someone broke the coconut on His head also. This incomparable   
Brahma Jnani was keeping silent and enjoying the cool coconut   
water dripping from His head to the cheeks.   
In Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there is one practice. When a Sri   
Vaishnava sannyasi (they call them Jeers, as you might have heard   
in Tirupati). When they leave the body, the devotees break a coconut on his  
head. If the skull breaks quickly, even before the   
coconut breaks, with one or two blows, it is said, that the   
particular Vaishna Sannyasi has attained realization!

Bhagavan Ramana was achalam, non moving. Muruganar says: Even Arunachala, the non moving Hill is quite shameful to see   
your greater non moving capacity! Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
1\. Some urchin passed urine on His back.   
2\. Some other fellow threw cowdung or some excreta on His back.   
3\. Some urchins pelted stones at Him.   
4\. Some bogus sadhus moved the rocks from higher level of the   
Hill so that these would roll down and hit Him.   
5\. Some sadhu applied green chilli paste on His body.   
6\. Someone tried to drop the cactus plant juice on His open   
eyes with a vacant gaze. (of course, this was not done).   
7\. One boy wanted to take His torn towel saying wittingly, "The   
Governor wants Your towel. Please give."   
8\. Only one boy saw Him and wept and then told Him to come to   
his boss so that he would give a job to Him, for the fees of 1   
paise per day! (That was the coolie fees in those days for child   
labour per day!)   
Bhagavan Ramana stood as achalam. Achalame NaaNa achalamai

I read some books where it is said, when the life force leaves through the  
skull it is called KAPALA MOKHAM.   
Some sadhus know their ending so they would tell their followers what should  
done when he sits in samadhi.   
Some rare cases the skull would split then immedietly their followers put  
vibudhi, pachai karpuram etc. etc.   
then they close with mud and install Lingam. For some reason when it does not  
split followers would break   
coconut as desired by the sanyasis. Main dying will take place when our mind  
dies. That is important. It happened for Bhagavan Ramana.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What you say is true. In Yoga marga, the prana power breaks   
open the crown and leaves and there will be breaking of the   
skull. Saint poetess Avvaiyar says in her Vinayakar Ahaval: "Karuthinil kapal vayil kaatti...."

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What you say is true. In Yoga marga, the prana power breaks   
open the crown and leaves and there will be breaking of the   
skull. Saint poetess Avvaiyar says in her Vinayakar Ahaval: "Karuthinil kapal vayil kaatti...."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
You know when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Hill, in total mounam,   
someone broke the coconut on His head also. This incomparable   
Brahma Jnani was keeping silent and enjoying the cool coconut   
water dripping from His head to the cheeks.   
In Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there is one practice. When a Sri   
Vaishnava sannyasi (they call them Jeers, as you might have heard   
in Tirupati). When they leave the body, the devotees break a coconut on his  
head. If the skull breaks quickly, even before the   
coconut breaks, with one or two blows, it is said, that the   
particular Vaishna Sannyasi has attained realization!   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan Ramana was achalam, non moving. Muruganar says: Even Arunachala, the non moving Hill is quite shameful to see   
your greater non moving capacity! Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
1\. Some urchin passed urine on His back.   
2\. Some other fellow threw cowdung or some excreta on His back.   
3\. Some urchins pelted stones at Him.   
4\. Some bogus sadhus moved the rocks from higher level of the   
Hill so that these would roll down and hit Him.   
5\. Some sadhu applied green chilli paste on His body.   
6\. Someone tried to drop the cactus plant juice on His open   
eyes with a vacant gaze. (of course, this was not done).   
7\. One boy wanted to take His torn towel saying wittingly, "The   
Governor wants Your towel. Please give."   
8\. Only one boy saw Him and wept and then told Him to come to   
his boss so that he would give a job to Him, for the fees of 1   
paise per day! (That was the coolie fees in those days for child   
labour per day!)   
Bhagavan Ramana stood as achalam. Achalame NaaNa achalamai

I read some books where it is said, when the life force leaves through the  
skull it is called KAPALA MOKHAM.   
Some sadhus know their ending so they would tell their followers what should  
done when he sits in samadhi.   
Some rare cases the skull would split then immedietly their followers put  
vibudhi, pachai karpuram etc. etc.   
then they close with mud and install Lingam. For some reason when it does not  
split followers would break   
coconut as desired by the sanyasis. Main dying will take place when our mind  
dies. That is important. It happened for Bhagavan Ramana.
