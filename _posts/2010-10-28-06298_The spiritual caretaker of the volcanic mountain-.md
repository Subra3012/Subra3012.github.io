When volcano erupted from the Indonesian mount Merapi, its spiritual guardian  
Maridjan, who was conducting ceremonies for over 30 years to appease the evil  
spirits of the mountain, refused to leave and embraced death boldly. His  
sincerity and determination are laudable though we may or may not agree with  
his action.

Yes. A Brahma Jnani is fearless. Brahma Jnanam is not for the   
feeble minded. During Bhopal tragedy, when everyone was fleeing   
Bhopal, one agni-hotri was doing homa in full swing, without moving   
a bit. Nothing happened to him and his family members.   
Arunachala Siva.

Every where people are praying for the welfare of the world. Still calamities  
are taking places. No body knows the divine plans.   
Brahma jnani sees as a play whereas ordinary people can not accept it and  
blame God.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Very true. Only a Brahma Jnani sees the whole thing as a play.   
Sukam and dhukkam do not affect him. During Tsunami, when the   
news reached Chennai and Pondicherry, people rushed to all sorts   
of interior Tamizh Nadu. Many came to Tiruvannamalai. They know   
that Bhagavan Ramana is the refuge for all miseries. People thronged the Old  
Hall and were sitting or standing close to Him, seeing His eyes in the  
photograph which is telling Abhayam, Abhayam. On that day, during lunch, 3000  
people were fed by the Asramam.   
Gaudapada says: Abhayam bhaya darsine.... People see the fearless   
with fear. We should see the fearless without fear. The fearless   
is the refuge of all.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a prediction. In 2012 major part of tamilnadu may be perished by  
another Tsunami. They said it is better to move towards   
Kanchipuram. But the real estate people are building big houses on the beach  
of East coast in Madras. Why does Mother of Nature become Kali to perish Her  
children.. It is a question.   
Ramanaduli.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Such predictions may or may not come true. Our prayers are only   
to Bhagavan Ramana to avoid such disasters for Tamizh Nadu.   
It is His grace only. All worldly magics are Sakti's. But if Siva   
wills, he can tell Sakti to keep quiet.   
If it happens, Bhagavan Ramana forbid, one can expect thousands   
of people taking refuge in Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
