## Bhagavan Ramana's Photographs  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2008, 03:28:16 PM

Bhagavan Ramana was easily the most photographed Jnani upto   
His times. There are innumberable photographs of Bhagavan.   
There are also phtographs of the Temple, Cow Lakshmi, Asram, photographs of  
Tiruchuzhi house and Madurai house, His father's and mother's photographs, His  
paternal uncles' photographs etc.,   
Mr. Sodousky, (Mouni Sadhu) mentions in his book three photographs.   
The best was, according to him, the one that was taken around 1934   
or 1935. It shows His face against the background of a kind of   
luminous cross, formed by the reflection of light.   
Another one, well-known to all readers of books on Bhagavan   
Ramana, shows Him in a classical yogic postrure, sitting cross-legged   
on a platform covered with a tiger skin. It was probably taken after   
His monthly shaving, for the features are free of the white beard.   
Here, both the purity of line and expression of incomparable power   
are emphasized more than any other picture. It shows, for a true   
seeker's contemplation, the face of the Saint, who has for long   
left behind Him all the weaknesses, imperfections and miseries   
that reign among us. It shows one who has forever transcended   
all ignorance, now faces the highest realtiy where no doubts or   
fears can exist.   
The third well known photograph represents the face of the Master   
in a halo of white hair and beard, with a soft smile of ineffable   
tenderness.   
(This is probably the one which is available in all Ramansramam   
books.)   
M. Sodousky says that this third photograph remained with him   
for ever engraved on his heart, not only in its outward appearance,   
but infinitely more.   
Every Ramana devotee may like a particular photograph of   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. They may post their feelings about   
their Guru's particular photograph. I for one, who likes the third   
one mentioned above as also His photograph that was taken   
when He was 21, while Sivaprakasam Pillai met Him, in Virupaksha   
Cave, during 1901-1902.   
Arunachala Siva.

Major A. W. Chadwick, later Sadhu Arunachala was a very rare   
Western devotee. There are a number of special things about him.   
His name and incidents connected with his life and his experiences are   
narated in a number of Ramanasramam books, including Talks.   
He has also written a book tiitled: A Sadhu's Reminiscences.   
A few rare things about this great seeker are:-   
1\. He came to Bhagavan in 1936 and never returned to his place   
or country.   
2\. He showed great interest in Veda Parayana, Sri Chakra Pooja   
and other ancient rituals.   
3\. After Bhagavan's Maha Nirvana, he used to sit between 8 a.m   
to 10 a.m. and again between 5 p.m to 7 p.m. in front of Bhagavan's   
Samadhi and meditate.   
4\. He was helpful in organizing a Veda Patasala inside Ramanasramam   
and also organized Sri Chakra Pooja in Mathrubhutesvarar Temple.   
5\. He used to delight in Narayana Suktam of Maha Narayana Upanishad,   
which was chanted in Asram.   
A few more things/incidents, I shall post in due course, with due   
credit to books of Sri Ramansramam and Sadhu Arunachala's   
own reminscences.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Bhagawan indirectly indicated to his close disciples that Major Chadwik is his father.

Dear Raju, Thanks. I have no heard about this. It could have   
been mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
