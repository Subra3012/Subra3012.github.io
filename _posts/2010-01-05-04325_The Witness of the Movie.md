## An incident of Lord Buddha  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 05, 2010, 04:08:12 AM

This is an incident in the life of Lord Buddha.   
Lord Buddha went for begging in a house. The householder instead of giving any  
alms starting scolding Lord Buddha in various ways like: such an able-bodied  
person who is a prince and could have done great good to the world by working  
is now begging. Its a shame, etc.   
Lord Buddha listened to him calmly and after he finished, asked whether he  
(Buddha) can ask a question. The person allowed. Lord Buddha asked that if a  
parcel is sent to somebody and the receiver does not receive it, to whom does  
the parcel belong to? The man said that in that case the parcel should come  
back to the sender. Lord Buddha said that he had not received whatever the  
person has said, and left.   
This incident is quite well-known and although humorous is at the same time  
profound.   
When a person thinks ill of others, the person should first need to create  
that "ill" in his own mind.

## TAT TVAM ASI The Witness of the Movie

I was watching a movie and during the process, forgot that i am the one  
watching and took myself to be a character in the movie!   
Bhagavad Gita says "Dhyayathe vishayan pumshah". .. by meditating on the  
objects of senses. .. this whole world came into existence.   
So too. .. by meditating on the movie character as myself, i started  
identifying myself constantly with the movie character. ...   
The "I" of the mind is this character.   
And now. .. I need to practice. .. everytime i fall into the "movie" [mind], i  
need to see the source of "me"... the Witness, Pure Consciousness!   
Love!

Is it possible having the true "I"ness and watching the movie. I think it is  
possible before watching the movie or at the end. Otherwise we do not remember   
the story or the actions of the characters. Because mind cannot do two things  
at one time. I may be wrong.   
There is the proverb. when we see the statue of the elephant we cannot see the  
stone in which the elephant was made. But when we see the stone   
we cannot see the elephant.

Dear ramanadulli,   
 How are you watching the movie? Are you getting lost in emotions and crying ?   
Some kids do that. Once, when i was a kid, i thought the hero is really dead.  
Then i asked my father in the next movie "How come he is here, when he is dead  
in previous movie?"   
Do you get that?   
I do not ask it now. Coz i am now not taking it to be real.   
The world, as long as one takes it as real, is bound to cause suffering!   
Love!

So in every moment we should not forget that whatever we are seeing,  
hearing,tasting,smelling and feeling is not real. Even my breath also not  
real?. Ok fine.   
I also tried no, of times. Before seeing the movie or Tv, I remember it is not  
real. But in middle I forget and sometimes I cry also. At the end I and my  
mind will argue for my actions. It is not only in movie. It happens in every  
moment. So far practicing atma vichara, i will be clear after sometimes. but  
previously I never used to be. the impact is less now. It looks like daily I  
am writing one examination. Previously I had been doing without knowing how to  
face the problem.   
Now I find difficult to deal with people like servants and relations. The  
opposite person is doing on the basis of her mind because she does not belive  
any vedanta or atma vichara. When I give answer to the person, she or he does  
not expect such answer from me, and says it is wrong statement and sometimes  
they say   
it is waste to talk to me. As I understand now clearly as you said so many  
times in your post. the consiousness cannot be touches by any one. now I  
remember these words, so I do not get angry but still some funny feeling is  
arising from my heart. Sometimes I think whether am I making the other person  
unhappy by not accepting their views. But after one month if i remember it  
does not look same because the time does the healing.   
While making big decisons we cannot sit by witnessing. Is there any way?

Dear srkudai,   
Excellent.   
Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes, this is what Ribhu Gita says. Everything is unreal and   
I am (Brahman) the only Reality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
I'd like to make a small change here.   
Everything is illusion, everything is unreal, etc... is also an illusion. The  
one that is discriminating this is illusion himself. because everything cannot  
be illusion, everything cannot be unreal. We cannot define the "everything",  
it is illusion to even continue something after "everything......"   
There is only Atma, Brahman, or there is nothing and everything alone and the  
one that is telling this is again Illusion itself. The very effort to affirm  
that everything is illusion is illusion. I just re-iterate this statement that  
"Thinking Maya as Maya is the greatest Maya"

Dear Ramanadulli,   
 The world & all that is relative. .. big decisions, small decisions. .. everything belongs to the world of mithya.   
You being Self, cannot be touched by them! So where is the problem?

There is a difference in between with the non living things and living things.  
The world contains living and non living things. If the chair is neglected by  
me there is no one being affected but on the other hand if I make a person  
(living thing) unhappy then it is a sin. When people are suffering or being  
unhappy, how we can be a witness. My mind is geting confused.

Dear I,   
Being a witness helps quieten the mind, its just like a praanayaama. It stops  
you from jumping about like a monkey. But also, we should be aware   
that the Self is Non Witness. The Self is not a witness. Enquire if there is a  
witness and a witnessed!   
Bhagawan says: "All that you have to do is to give up being aware of other things, that is of  
the non-self - 'ego'. If one gives upbeing aware of them then pure awareness  
alone remains, and that is the Self"   
Once a devotee asked Ramana Maharshi - "I do not know how to worship, please  
tell me, how do I worship?" Bhagawan replied replied - "enquire if there is  
Worshiped and a worshiper"   
So never give any scope of duality.   
Actually many Sadhanas or methods are only a quick solution to quietining the  
mind but not themselves an end to itself to the Self. It sometimes may make  
one stay put.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 Being a witness is not an activity. You are the witness... you do not "be" it! There is no choice here.   
The world that you see. .. what ever you see. .. there is no choice there  
either. You see all this! No choice!   
You are Self! no choice.   
The witness, witnessed are one! No choice here either!   
You see. .. not out of choice. .. you see. thats it. and what you see and the  
one who sees. .. both are mithya jagat. .. like mirage... still they appear.  
that is why they are called mithya. .. mithya is what appears to be there, but  
not there. Like blueness of the sky. you know sky is not blue. .. still it  
appears blue. .. and you do not try to change that. You cannot.   
You are not trying to do it... It is It. Thats how it is!   
Please note that Self inquiry is also a sadhana. Its important & not a quick  
fix. Pranayama is. Pranayama leads to mano laya. Self Inquiry leads to  
manonashanam.   
Manonashanam [and by that i do not mean absence of thoughts], ie brought  
about by Self Knowledge [Panchadasi] & Self Knowledge alone. Self inquiry or  
meditation on Self is the way [Panchadasi. .. it leads to Self Knowledge. Self  
inquiry is the best means to it, one who cannot should do meditation on Self].   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
The very word "manonasham" itself means destruction of mind. When there is  
destruction of mind how can there possibly be any thoughts. If there are  
thoughts, then there is perception, at least the perception that these  
thoughts do not affect me. Mind or Manam itself is thought.   
How can there possibly be thoughts after Manonasham?   
Manonasham is absolutely no thoughts at all.

Nagaraj,   
 Just see. ..   
Ramana himself had thoughts. He even said that he dreamt.   
And Janaka managed a whole kingdom.   
how is it without thoughts.   
And tell me... whose thoughts? see if you sit and stop thoughts in your mind  
... but my mind has thoughts. .. can you say you do not have thoughts? if so,  
you are identifying with that mind, isnt it ?

Dear I,   
How can we know if Ramana Maharshi had thoughts? is it not us who are  
assuming? and similarly with Janaka as well. It is the reader, who is  
imagining about the state of Ramana or Janaka.   
Pls see, who is it that is questioning - "how is it without thoughts" is  
nothing but a thought. You are just a thought!   
The idea that they had thoughts and functioned is our own thought again.   
To your last question, you ask "whose thoughts? see if you sit and stop  
thoughts in your mind. .. but my mind has thoughts. .. can you say you do not  
have thoughts? if so, you are identifying with that mind, isnt it ?"   
You yourself are just a thought. How can thought kill thought?   
You - I are nothing but just a thought!   
Manonasham is destruction of You - I.
