## be you, be true A New Calmness

Greetings to you all,   
I am new to the teachings of Ramana, and am currently reading about His Life  
through a book written by Gabriele Ebert. What I would like to say is that I  
have noticed a change within myself, a new calmness; and my outlook on life  
has become more positive too. The front cover of the book is a wonderful  
photograph of Ramana, and when I look at Him, I experience a beautiful warmth.  
Its as though He is actually looking at me! I am awaiting a book by Arthur  
Osbourne and am hoping it will arrive in the morning!   
Also I would like to say a big thank you to Graham for running this wonderful  
forum, and to the members who post, this forum is a truely positive place to  
visit.   
Namaste,   
revzen

Dear revzen,   
I am happy that you have started feeling the calmness or Peace within. Peace  
or Atma is our natural state. Peace is another name for Atma or Brahman or  
the Self. We lose it due to our mind going   
outwards to the world. Whenever we read a book on Sri Ramana or   
look at His photograph or visit Tiruvannamalai, we feel the Peace   
because our minds are inward turned. Bhagavan Ramana has said: It is like a person coming to the shade under the tree, on a hot   
sunny day. A true devotee or Jnani is ever under the shade. The   
world is hot, the inturned mind enjoys the shade, the peace or calmness.   
Please continue to read Sri Ramana's life and teachings. This shall  
positively bring inner peace and calmness, When the calmness abides  
permanently within, one can do any work in the outside   
world without mental turmoil.   
The Forum is again a place where we are with Sri Ramana.   
Please also look at the Hill through webcam a few times a day.   
This also gives you Peace that passeth understanding.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
I shall indeed continue to read about Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings! I  
wasn't aware about the webcam to look at the Hill, can you please give me the  
link for that.   
Namaste,

Dear revzen, in the same Forum in which you are posting letters,   
on the front page at the bottom there are several links like Arunachala  
Property, Arunachala Webcam etc., If you click the   
webcam, you shall see the Hill's photograph in a few seconds.   
It is the camera on the Hill, managed by Graham Boyd which gives   
the alluring pictures of the Hill every minute, say from 6 a.m. to evening 6.  
p.m. If it is full moon day, photographs keep changing even late at night.  
The time I have mentioned is Indian Standard   
Time.   
Arunachala Siva.
