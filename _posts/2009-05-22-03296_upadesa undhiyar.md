## Why need six strengths for puja, bala?

We have seen how Purandara Dasa said about the six   
strengths for puja and why should one waste time on   
all these? Saint Manikkavachagar, says in TirupaLLi   
Ezhuchhi, the song that is sung along with Tirvuembavai   
in the month of Margasirsha. He says only your body, and   
a good musical instrument is needed, at best.   
He sings: [In the temple]   
People with veena or yazh are singing on the one side.   
People say prayers in Rig Veda and Tamil Stotras.   
People keep their folded flowerlike hands and pray to you on one side.   
People are prostrating, weeping and melting on the one side.   
You have also taken charge of me and ruled me,   
[who does not do any of these]   
O Siva of Tiruperundurai!   
O my Master, please wake up and bless us!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes. I watched it. He is giving commentary based on   
yoga marga. But Bhagavan Ramana intended it for all   
four margas. Incidentally, anyone interested in scriptures   
and particularly Ramana's philosophy, can watch these   
programmes in Sri Sankara TV.   
1\. One Nocchur Venkatraman's [ a young man in his   
lates 20s] giving discourses on Bhagavadpada Vaibhavam.   
It is between 8 am and 8. 30 on all days including weekends.   
He is quoting profusely from Sankara's works and Bhagavan   
Ramana's life and teachings.   
2\. One Smt Parimalam, is giving one story of each saint   
of 63 in Periya Puranam, between 6 pm and 6.30 pm.   
everday including week ends in the same channel.   
3\. One Sri Venkata Krishna Bhagavatar is discoursing   
on Srimad Bhagavatam every evening between 7.30   
pm and 8 pm on all days including week ends. He quotes   
Bhagavan Ramana often. It is also in Sri Sankara TV.   
Arunachala Siva.
