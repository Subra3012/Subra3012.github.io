Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes. I watched it. He is giving commentary based on   
yoga marga. But Bhagavan Ramana intended it for all   
four margas. Incidentally, anyone interested in scriptures   
and particularly Ramana's philosophy, can watch these   
programmes in Sri Sankara TV.   
1\. One Nocchur Venkatraman's [ a young man in his   
lates 20s] giving discourses on Bhagavadpada Vaibhavam.   
It is between 8 am and 8. 30 on all days including weekends.   
He is quoting profusely from Sankara's works and Bhagavan   
Ramana's life and teachings.   
2\. One Smt Parimalam, is giving one story of each saint   
of 63 in Periya Puranam, between 6 pm and 6.30 pm.   
everday including week ends in the same channel.   
3\. One Sri Venkata Krishna Bhagavatar is discoursing   
on Srimad Bhagavatam every evening between 7.30   
pm and 8 pm on all days including week ends. He quotes   
Bhagavan Ramana often. It is also in Sri Sankara TV.   
Arunachala Siva.
