the supreme measure. This, which is visible, is nothing at all.   
7. I am myself bliss alone. I am consciousness and un-diminishing. Bliss is the supreme measure.   
This, which is visible is nothing at all.   
8. I alone am the secret Self. I alone am the gap-less. Bliss is the supreme measure. This, which   
is visible, is nothing at all.
