_" It is all a question of the mind. Bondage and liberation are of the mind  
alone._   
 **The mind will take the colour you dye it with. It is like white clothes  
just returned from the laundry. If you dip them in red dye, they will be red.  
If you dip them in blue or green, they will be blue or green. They will take  
only the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be.   
If you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your companions.  
On the other hand, when you are in the company of devotees, you will think and  
talk only of God.**   
"The mind is everything. A man has his wife on one side and his daughter on  
the other. He shows his affection to them in different ways. But his mind is  
one and the same.   
"Bondage is of the mind, and freedom is also of the mind. A man is free if he  
constantly thinks: 'I am a free soul. How can I he bound, whether I live in  
the world or in the forest? I am a child of God, the King of Kings. Who can  
bind me?'

Yes, what SRK has said about bondage and liberation, Bhagavan   
Ramana has also said in a few verses: Upadesa Undiyar, Verse 29: Bandha Veedu atra para-sukam uttravaur   
Indha nilai nitral Undhipara,   
Irai PaNi nitralam Undhipara.   
Abiding in this state of bliss   
Beyond bondage and release,   
Is steadfastness   
In service of the Lord.   
Irai Pani Nittral is a beautiful phrase. Murugnar has written   
some verses on this. It is the service of the Lord or Guru.   
Muruganar, who is a versatile Tamil poet, decided not to   
sing on anyone excepting Bhagavan Ramana. This is Irai   
Pani Nittral.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says: En kai unakkallathu eppanium   
seyyarka... Let me hands do not do any work excepting for   
yourself.   
Again in Verse 39 of ULLadu Narpadu: Patthanai ennu matte bandha mukti chintainaigal....   
Thoughts of bondage and freedom last only as long as one feels: "I am bound". When one enquires of oneself, "Who am I, the   
bound one?", the Self, Eternal, ever free, remains. The thought   
of bondage goes; and with it goes the thought of freedom (mukti   
-liberation) too.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kala Bhairava  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 26, 2010, 03:51:57 AM

Kala Bhairava is one of the 8 forms of Siva, some of the others   
being, Nataraja, Kalyana Sundara, Bhikshtana, and Somaskanda.   
Kaila Bhairava is the ferocious form who came out of the plucked   
hair of Siva, when Siva wanted to punish Daksha, when the latter   
disrespected Dakshayani (Uma) during the famous sacrifice for   
which Siva himself was not invited.   
This Kala Bhairava went to Daksha's sacrifice hall and left and right,   
destroyed and injured the participants. Brahma's one of theheads   
was snapped, Saraswati lost her nose, Daksha himself was beheaded.   
Only Narayana was spared, since he had earlier dug out one of his   
eyes to do puja for Siva, when one lotus was short in the puja   
with 1000 lotuses.   
The prayers and meditation on Kala Bhairava are said to be good   
solutions for solving various disputes in life, including marital   
discord. He is prayed with lime fruits garlands and red flowers.   
In the month of Chaitra, (Apr-May), such worships are performed   
more since the boons will be quicker.   
Kala Bhairava image can be seen in any large Siva Temple. This   
time when I went to Tiruvannamalai, I climbed the steps of the   
shrine inside the Eastern Towers of Big Temple and paryed to   
Kala Bhairava. I did not do any special puja but only simple   
prayers.   
He is seen with a mace on his hand and in a standing posture.   
Saint Manikkavachagar makes reference to this, in his Tiru Undiyar   
in Tiruvachakam.   
Arunachala Siva.
