## Topic: Books and Materials on Sri Bhagavan  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: September 24, 2014, 11:29:57 AM

Dear Devotees,   
As a humble devotee like everyone of you, i felt an urge to convey that the  
devotees may please be informed that it is best to refer to the materials and  
books presented and sold by the official website of Sri Ramanasramam alone  
(http://bookstore.sriramanamaharshi.org/) As the works available in here alone  
can be considered the most authentic for your study and reflections on the  
teachings of Sri Bhagavan.   
In todays world, in times of information overload, in platforms such as  
Internet, there are plenty of information and in-depth information, analyses  
and deep study in to the teachings of Sri Bhagavan. Devotees are best advised  
to not take these materials as granted. Do not even depend on the information  
available here in this forum for granted. Always make sure about the  
authenticity of the words, statements, observations by Self Effort by checking  
if they genuinely stated by Sri Bhagavan.   
There are random information and studies available everywhere, it could prove  
be a great stepping stone in ones sadhana that might end up creating needless  
confusions. This is not to discourage reading the various information  
available instantly. There is a reason by we need to pay some money and buy  
books, for our study, than that of simply downloading pdf files from internet  
for free!   
Keep simple things fist. Go by the Rules. It will never fail.   
Thank you.

## please educate on latest tips for precautions

Dear Graham and all others,   
Please educate about latest set of precautions to be taken both by male and  
female devotees while going up the hills or going in inner path.   
Even for males, is there any danger from the so called beggars in the hill  
path? they seem to be in young age with pants and ask for alms, if they look  
around and no body else to be found, will they start threatening?   
What are the precautions to be taken to tackle stray dogs that suddenly bark  
and monkeys that scare?   
I have seen at one instance, a young guy saw a group of foreigners climbing  
virupaksha cave. I was behind them some feets away climbing. This guy  
thought I did not know tamil and told something not very parliamentary in  
tamil language. I looked at him casually and then resumed my steps. This  
happened on Dec 25th 2012 being a christmas day thank God foreigners and  
Indians were found in large numbers. Otherwise I dont think it is safer to  
roam around the hills alone even for males

Sri Graham and Friends,

 **Parable of the "elephant God"**   
"Let me tell you a story. In a forest there lived a holy man who had many  
disciples. One day he taught them to see God in all beings and, knowing this,  
to bow low before them all. A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for  
the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he heard an outcry: 'Get out of the way! A mad  
elephant is coming!' All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels.  
He reasoned that the elephant was also God in another form. Then why should he  
run away from it? He stood still, bowed before the animal, and began to sing  
its praises. The mahut of the elephant was shouting: 'Run away! Run away!' But  
the disciple didn't move. The animal seized him with its trunk, cast him to  
one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay unconscious  
on the ground. Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother  
disciples came to him and carried him to the hermitage. With the help of some  
medicine he soon regained consciousness. Someone asked him, 'You knew the  
elephant was coming - why didn't you leave the place?' 'But', he said, 'our  
teacher has told us that God Himself has taken all these forms, of animals as  
well as men. Therefore, thinking it was only the elephant God that was coming,  
I didn't run away.' At this the teacher said: 'Yes, my child, it is true that  
the elephant God was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to stay there.  
Since all are manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the mahut's words?  
You should have heeded the words of the mahut God.' (Laughter)   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

Dear Sanjayji,   
I will pray for your son and your family. Please remember to surrender your  
problems to Bhagavan, He will give you strength and take care of your  
problems.   
I can relate to your problems because my 10 year old adopted son is diagnosed  
with ADHD and has behavior issues. He looks normal, is very intelligent but  
his behavior is very unpredictable. He is on homeopathic medicine and  
responding well. But taking care of him is very challenging and heart-  
breaking, our social life is zero because people think he is undisciplined and  
want nothing to do with him. But he is my Lord Sri Krishna and it is my  
sadhana to take care of him. He is the reason I became spiritual and I trust  
Bhagavan will take care of him.   
I like to listen to sharanagati song when feeling overwhelmed. Chanting  
Hanuman chalisa has helped too.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Thank you, Ravi Ji for such sincere time spent for someone else. Will be  
definitely following your advice today with family.   
Latha Ji - Thanks. I can fully understand the depth and meaning of what you  
are saying - as I do have a close friend who is a Special Educator - and is  
also teaching my kid. But let us just abide by what I heard in a Satsang  
attributed to Swami Vivekananda said once in a speech - "Take even a grain of  
sand and I can prove to you that it is nothing but the Supreme Reality in  
action".   
Namaskar!   
Sanjay.

Dear Sanjay   
I can see through your tough situation. And with such a child of under-growth  
our mind will naturally thread it to distance future of who will take care him  
and all that.   
It is very emotional to deal with such a child because your Heart will outpour  
more kindness and love only to the weakest child while not all your relatives  
and friends may emphathize with you.   
I am not going to suggest any mantra or sloga but all I can request is, pray  
to Bhagavan only for the child's normal behaviour and peace and wellbeing,   
nothing more than that.   
I was thinking about you and offered my few seconds prayer to our beloved  
Bhagavan Ramana Maharishee to intervene and restore peace and wellbeing in  
your family.   
Here I wish to point out this again: People confuse Bhagavan Ramana's famous  
statement to his Mother Azhagammal and assume lot of things on destiny. But  
Bhagavan Ramana did not mean that message to be so universal and he definitely  
interferes in our day to day calamities to protect and turn us to the path of  
Self Enquiry.   
Don't strain yourself with this and that remedy suggested by various  
astrologers -- relax into Bhagavan's form with a silent prayer put at the  
start and end of your meditation.   
Arunachaleshwara and Apeethakuchamba will definitely bless your child for long  
healthy life.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya.

Thank you, dear all.   
Atmavichar - That is an amazing budhist prayer. Thanks for sharing.   
BTW, you will be surprised to know what is the most favorite song of my son -  
It is the group chanting Aksharamana Malai CD tha I have. For around 30  
minutes it plays, he is almost in a trans state without even listening to his  
name call sometimes.

Sanjay   
It is really a blessing that your son loves listening to AAMM group chanting  
. I have a friend of mine whose son aged 5-6 also loves listening to the same  
and he has started memorizing the verses slowly. In the Sankaracharya thread I  
have given Kanchi Mahaswamigal's quote on power of words /sound vibrations  
and how it differs from one good word to bad word and it is really a blessing  
that kids get to hear these divine words / divine sounds at a very young age.

Thanks all.   
Deepa - He is child of Arunachala. I am just doing the responsible custodian  
role play as Arunachala wants me to. All said and done, I know Arunachala has  
all the plans for him, but that does not mean I will sit idle simply because  
Arunachala has also plans for me. As long as both of us decided to play this  
game, we will ensure we play it so well that our father is impressed.   
Sanjay.

It is so nice of you, Jewel. The medicines are all imported ones and they just  
arrives last week on time due to Bhagawan's grace (apparently they got caught  
in customs for almost all times - but Bhagawan willing this was cleared in a

Thank you for the very warm and such a sincere prayer,
