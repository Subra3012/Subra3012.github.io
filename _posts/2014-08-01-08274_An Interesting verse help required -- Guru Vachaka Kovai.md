## An Interesting verse help required -- Guru Vachaka Kovai

I have read this verse sometime before and again re-read it (only English  
version) in Sadhu Om website. The below meaning clearly says that we should  
not too much worry about mundane body needs and run after them. If we are  
sincere in sadhana, that alone will do.   
Can somebody paste here for me the tamil original verese? Verse number 150   
 _ **Those who have realized that Prarabdha (Fate) will take care of the body,  
will not feel anxious and wander about seeking food and so on. All the  
enjoyments ordained by Prarabdha will surely come. Hence it is clear that  
craving and rejecting (likes and dislikes) are the deluding acts of mind.**_   
-Verse 150

Dear Krishnan,   
The Verse says that Prarabdha will take care of even the food that is  
required. One need not seek it with efforts. Because   
any efforts cannot overcome Prarabdha. There are several examples in Sri  
Bhagavan's life itself. When He was very   
hungry at Arainai Nallur, the priest refused to give the cakes of rice to Him.  
But in Keelur temple, the drummer gave his   
quota of food to Him! Again when He was hungry, not knowing the further route  
to T'mlaai, Muthukrishna Bhagavatar's   
sister gave Him all sweets and savouries prepared for the next day, Kirshna's  
birthday to Him in a packet! She also gave   
Him food. Again when He needed some money for further train journey,  
Bhagavatar was ready to take his ear studs as pawn\   
and gave Him money! In the early days of Virupaksha Cave, He used to starve  
on many days but many days He had the   
food brought by His fellow sadhus who went for Bhiksha. In T'malai,  
Annamaliayar brought the good man Friday -   
Pazhaniswami who did all service to Him. He brought food from alms seeking,  
and shared with Sri Bhagavan. There   
are many many such instances.   
Arunachala Siva.

That is very good info sir.   
Can you elaborate on the tamil verse? And what translation Sri Swaminathan has  
written for this?   
This comes a surprise, whatever job we are thinking which is earing money is  
nothing but our prarabdha. It is very important verse. No more blame on work  
and world. only sadhana.   
Please elaborate your point of view also sir.

Dear Krishnan,   
Prof. K. Swaminathan has translated this verse in a slightly different way,  
though the meaning is the same. He says: What we experience now is only   
The fruit of former actions. Knowing   
This, one should not worry what   
Happens to one. Whether or not one likes it   
One may not escape, one needs must eat,   
The food one has prepared.   
In Sri Bhagavan's life He always said that Destiny (Prarabdha) will only have  
its role and there is no Free Will for any   
one. The only Free Will is to make your mind still and take it to the Heart.  
Once Devaraja Mudaliar asked Sri Bhagavan: Bhagavan! Is Destiny operative for only important things or for even small  
things, like I am taking this hand fan at   
some point of time and then putting it back on the floor at some other point.   
Sri Bhagavan replied: Yes, every thing is predestined.   
Mudaliar then asked perhaps at a later time: What is the meaning of avan anRi  
Or aNuvum asaiyaathu. Sri   
Bhagavan said: No. The correct proverb is avan anRi asaiyaathu. Even an  
atom is not apart from Brahman.   
He only moves and He only unmoves.   
Then He said: Seththaaraip Pola thiRi... Move about like a dead man. That  
is, without even an atom of free will of yours.   
Sri Bhagavan on reaching T'malai and after embracing Arunachaleswara Linga,  
came out and threw away the sweet   
packets given by Bhagavatar's sister because He knew that the food for the  
next occasion will be given by Arunachaleswara.   
He waited for some time. One barber asked: Swami, should I tonsure your head?  
Who decided that? It was Arunachaleswara.   
He agreed and had the tonsure. Then He thought: Should I take a bath?  
Normally, after hair cut one takes bath.   
Then He thought: Why should this body have a bath? Then suddenly it drizzled  
heavily and His whole body including   
the tonsured head had a bath! So this formality was also fulfilled by the  
Lord.   
Arunachala Siva.

sir   
in that scenario can you kindly post the tamil original verse?   
I remember Sri Swaminathan's version is the same as Sri Sadhu Om translation?   
And Devaraj Mudhalair anectode is really nice, I have read it many times and  
enjoyed it.

Dear Krishnan,   
The following is the original Tamizh verse: ஊழே கூழாக உணர்ந்தோர் உளம் கலங்கிக்   
கூழுக்கா என்றும் குலைவு உறார் \- கூழதனை   
வேண்டினும் வேண்டா வீடினும் எவர்க்கும் அவ்   
ஊண்தான் ஒழியாது உணர்.   
oozh means prarabdha. koozh means that 'we eat'. We eat our prarabdha  
effects. One must necessarily eat.   
Sri Bhagavan says that the only way to overcome oozh, prarabdha is attaining  
Self Knowledge.   
Arunachala Siva.

In reply to a sadhu who asked if bhakti consisted in forgetting the body, etc.  
Sri Bhagavan said:  _" What do you care for the body? Practise bhakti and don't worry about what  
happens to the body."_   
(Talk 149)

dear friends,   
The same thing was also informed by Bhagavan to Sivaprakasam Pillai.You may  
refer to the Power of the Presence part 1.   
Of course before that Bhagavan had informed this in the first note that he  
even wrote. "The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their  
past deeds. Whatever is destined not to happen will not happen, try how hard  
you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to stop  
it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is to remain silent.".   
Hence there is no need to feel angush about what will happen,no need to worry  
whether we have said or done the right thing.   
Everything is divinely ordained.Hence we should try to focus on practicing  
whatever sadhana works consistently for us and just "drop" the rest.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

very nice and thank shri RS sir. but does it mean we need not even work for  
getting anything let it be even mundane since prarabhdha will handle our life.  
I think we should do work and a make attempt to earn our livlihood, food and  
shelter. taking coverage under prarabhdha factor/ effects one can not simply  
keep quite or be complacent ? can you kindly detail on this......? swami  
chinmayananda says, "one must act having born"........... om namo bhagavathe  
sri ramanaya

Friends,   
One will encounter two ends in this subject. Whether to keep silent, simply be  
or carry on the actions as the Lord says.   
If one is to question the validity of keeping silent, simply remaining quiet  
without actions, Bhagavan would perhaps say, just try and see. if one is to  
question the validity of actions, Bhagavan would perhaps say, actions are  
inert, seek within. These are individual specific. Bhagavan never gave mass  
advice or path (refer Paramahamsa Yogananada)   
One should also understand that even simply being without doing anything is  
not just idle indolence. But it is as Bhagavan says below:  _Is the state of 'being still' a state involving effort or effortless?   
It is not an effortless state of indolence. All mundane activities which are  
ordinarily called effort are performed with the aid of a portion of the mind  
and with frequent breaks. But the act of communion with the Self (atma  
vyavahara) or **remaining still inwardly is intense activity which is  
performed with the entire mind and without break**_   
To take the discernment beyond its limitations, there have been Yogis who have  
been able to give up even food and breath too and remain in exalted states,  
but they were not like stones.   
On one hand we can see Ramana bahgavan who remained fixed in one place, where  
as Shankara Bhagavat pada was extensively on the move. There is no difference  
between them. If we look at Vyasa Valmiki, then it appeares they have not even  
slept and engaged always in activities for the kind of works that they have  
provided for posterity.   
I feel we should cast off such analyses and focus the attention on the goal.  
Realise God or Self, that is the main objective. Whether one is to remain  
fixed in one place or whether one has to wait for food to come on its own or  
strive for little food for sustenance or whether one is to be on move, let us  
see it later.   
So presently, the objective being to realise God or Self, strive towards it.  
as Bhagvan himself has come down with two paths in the ultimate sense. Which  
ever path one is inclined to, one has to inculcate moderation, facilitate  
oneself with "Spiritual luxuries" such as eating satvic food, enough sleep,  
moderation in other activities, limit the vyavaharam as little as necessary  
alone.   
Either Surrender and keep quiet or sit and enquire things out, sort out all  
issues sprouting from within.   
For instance, when such questions arise as to whether one has to put effort or  
not, one has to either enquire discern the truth completely or surrender  
completely not even wanting to know the answer.   
 _There are two ways. One is looking into the source of ?I? and merging into  
that source. The other is feeling ?I am helpless by myself, God alone is all-  
powerful and except by throwing myself completely on him, there is no other  
means of safety for me.? By this method one gradually develops the conviction  
that God alone exists and that the ego does not count. Both methods lead to  
the same goal. Complete surrender is another name for jnana or liberation._   
All these questions, if we see subtly, they arise out of body identification,  
what is to act and what is to be still? The self is beyond stillness and  
action. Most questions, if we see, we ask from the level of body  
identification.   
Either way, if one has surrendered, one gives no room for any questions, and  
cut such questions by the spirit of Surrender to God and if one is to enquire,  
one would ignore the weight of a question and would proceed inquiring the  
source of the question, as to whom is this question springing to.   
so we now know, questions are springing from body identification, there is not  
sompletion, Purna as yet, then what is the ideal response, what should we do?  
discern this truth as above and ignore the question and move on which ever  
path one is inclined to. Really if one has got this message, one need not know  
anything more, learn anything more or even try and understand anything new as  
well, as we know, there is nothing to understand, i need to surrender, it is  
God's will His will prevails, He is the doer, Not I But Thou. or Who am I, Who  
am I? Who am I?
