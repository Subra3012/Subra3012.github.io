Dear Krishnan,   
I am happy hat you are there in Mumbai well settled. For Ramana devotees or  
Sri Ramana satsangh, you may have to   
make inquiries in Matunga area or check with Shanmukhananda Hall nearby, where  
South Indians come for listening to   
music performance, discourses etc., I do not think that there is any other  
place where Sri Ramana satsangh may be there.   
You can make inquries in Sion area also.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you for the warning message Graham.   
At certain times of the day and night, the mosquitos literally appear in  
little "clouds" \- you might think they try to carry you away However, I  
found a local mosiquito repellent product (after arriving in Tiruvannamalai  
without one), excellent to keep the little pests away from the skin. It's  
called "Odomos", comes in cream form, and works like a charm. It's available  
at most shops and pharmacies in India. Prevention is the best medicine they  
say

## Re:[4]Open tuberculosis in Arunachala?  
Author: musgrave            Date: August 27, 2007, 03:03:43 PM

I have just received an email from someone in Thiru, saying that open TBC is  
spreading wild and fast, and that there have been several cases in the Ashram  
lately. I was planning to visit in a month's time, but now I'm really  
concerned about this, especially as I am pregnant. Does anyone have more  
information?   
Thank you so much

Dear Graham Sir,   
Excellent photo. But the verses appear too small for reading. The Hill is  
absolutely majestic. Thank you for the same.   
Arunachala Siva.
