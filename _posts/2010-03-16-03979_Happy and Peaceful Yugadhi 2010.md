## Shiva geetha

There is shiva geetha which was taught to Rama by Agasthya. If anybody knows I  
request to write on this Geetha.   
I came to know that Chandra sekara kurukkal has published this book. It says  
how to worship shiva and get His grace.Rama did this puja and vrath and got  
Pasupada asthra. In the same way Agasthya taught Athiya Hridhayam also. Being  
a avathar Rama followed all the rules and rites but where the people do nt  
follow anything. Rama shows sadhana and faith is very important.

Ramanaduli garu,   
Correct pronunciation is Subha kamkshalu and not Shubha kanchalu   
May guru ramana blessings be with everyone of us.
