When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.

and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really

say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali   
Darvesh levitating stone of shivapur near puna. People can lift this heavy  
stone with a index finger.   
There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It  
seems people before 2 to 4 centuries had faith on them as well as God. They  
left behind some records on stones which is still alive and teaches to coming  
generations. I request this forum members to share their experiences where  
they visted such temples.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.

Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali

There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It

When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.

They kept one of the stones which were used to form a bridge in a Hanuman  
temple in Rameshwaram. The stone is kept in a water tank where u can touch and  
see.These stones are floating in water. And there we could see a photograh of  
the bridge which is under water is taken from statelite. The pandits said this  
is the same bridge which Hanuman build it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is a raging battle of words, between Tamil Nadu government   
and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really   
man made or made by the monkey-armies of Sri Rama. But to   
say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Everyone should put forth their best capacities whether in   
the matters of self improvement or self enquiry or for good of   
others. Only our goal should be noble.

They kept one of the stones which were used to form a bridge in a Hanuman  
temple in Rameshwaram. The stone is kept in a water tank where u can touch and  
see.These stones are floating in water. And there we could see a photograh of  
the bridge which is under water is taken from statelite. The pandits said this  
is the same bridge which Hanuman build it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is a raging battle of words, between Tamil Nadu government   
and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really   
man made or made by the monkey-armies of Sri Rama. But to   
say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali   
Darvesh levitating stone of shivapur near puna. People can lift this heavy  
stone with a index finger.   
There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It  
seems people before 2 to 4 centuries had faith on them as well as God. They  
left behind some records on stones which is still alive and teaches to coming  
generations. I request this forum members to share their experiences where  
they visted such temples.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda on Vedanta and giving up hope  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 31, 2010, 05:09:38 PM

**PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART II (Delivered in London, 12th November 1896)   
Give up the small for the Infinite, give up small enjoyments for infinite  
bliss.** It is all yours, for the Impersonal includes the Personal. So God is  
Personal and Impersonal at the same time.   
And Man, the Infinite, Impersonal Man, is manifesting Himself as person. We  
the infinite have limited ourselves, as it were, into small parts. The Vedanta  
says that Infinity is our true nature; it will never vanish, it will abide for  
ever. But we are limiting ourselves by our Karma, which like a chain round our  
necks has dragged us into this limitation. Break that chain and be free.  
Trample law under your feet. There is no law in human nature, there is no  
destiny, no fate. How can there be law in infinity? Freedom is its watchword.  
**Freedom is its nature, its birthright.** Be free, and then have any number  
of personalities you like. Then we will play like the actor who comes upon the  
stage and plays the part of a beggar. Contrast him with the actual beggar  
walking in the streets. The scene is, perhaps, the same in both cases, the  
words are, perhaps, the same, but yet what difference! The one enjoys his  
beggary while the other is suffering misery from it. And what makes this  
difference? The one is free and the other is bound.   
The actor knows his beggary is not true, but that he has assumed it for play,  
while the real beggar thinks that it is his too familiar state and that he has  
to bear it whether he wills it or not. This is the law. **So long as we have  
no knowledge of our real nature, we are beggars, jostled about by every force  
in nature; and made slaves of by everything in nature; we cry all over the  
world for help, but help never comes to us; we cry to imaginary beings, and  
yet it never comes.** But still we hope help will come, and thus in weeping,  
wailing, and hoping, one life is passed, and the same play goes on and on.   
So are our lives spent in hoping, hoping, hoping, which never comes to an end.  
**Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? You have everything,  
nay, you are everything. What are you hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs  
about trying to find the king of his country, he will never find him, because  
he is the king himself. He may go through every village and city in his own  
country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but he will never find  
him, because he is the king himself. It is better that we know we are God and  
give up this fool 's search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become  
happy and contented. Give up all these mad pursuits, and then play your part  
in the universe, as an actor on the stage.**

Among Maharishi Dayananda's contributions are his promoting of the equal  
rights of women - such as the right to education and reading of Indian  
scriptures - and his translation of the Vedas from Sanskrit to Hindi so that  
the common person may be able to read the Vedas.   
Dayananda was born on on February 12 in 1824, in the village of Tankara near  
Morvi (Morbi) in the Kathiawar region (present Rajkot district), of the  
princely state of Gujarat, into a affluent and devout Brahmin family of  
Krishna Lal Tiwari and Yashodabai.   
**Swami Dayananda 's creation, the Arya Samaj, is a unique contribution in  
Hinduism.** The Arya Samaj unequivocally condemns idol-worship, animal  
sacrifices, ancestor worship, pilgrimages, priestcraft, offerings made in  
temples, the caste system, untouchability, child marriages and discrimination  
against women on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. The Arya  
Samaj discourages dogma and symbolism and encourages skepticism in beliefs  
that run contrary to common sense and logic. To many people, the Arya Samaj  
aims to be a "universal society" based on the authority of the Vedas.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Victory of the Little Squirrel

When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.   
 **Everyone has different gifts and capacities. We should try to perform to  
the best of our ability however difficult the task may be.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Everyone should put forth their best capacities whether in   
the matters of self improvement or self enquiry or for good of   
others. Only our goal should be noble.   
Arunachala Siva.

They kept one of the stones which were used to form a bridge in a Hanuman  
temple in Rameshwaram. The stone is kept in a water tank where u can touch and  
see.These stones are floating in water. And there we could see a photograh of  
the bridge which is under water is taken from statelite. The pandits said this  
is the same bridge which Hanuman build it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is a raging battle of words, between Tamil Nadu government   
and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really   
man made or made by the monkey-armies of Sri Rama. But to   
say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali   
Darvesh levitating stone of shivapur near puna. People can lift this heavy  
stone with a index finger.   
There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It  
seems people before 2 to 4 centuries had faith on them as well as God. They  
left behind some records on stones which is still alive and teaches to coming  
generations. I request this forum members to share their experiences where  
they visted such temples.
