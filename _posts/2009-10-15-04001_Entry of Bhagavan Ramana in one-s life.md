## Maha Vibhuti Sahitam

Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Verse 10, is a Palasruti, the Benediction Verse.   
The all-pervasiveness of the Atma is clearly expounded in this   
hymn. By its recital, hearing, and meditation on its implied   
meaning, the devoted disciple attains to that all-pervasiveness   
of the Atman. He further fully realizes his oneness with It,   
including the unhindered lordship over the whole universe, becoming the very  
essence of the eight fold manifestations referred   
to in Verse 9. He reaches the plenitude of realization and spiritual   
joy.   
This Verse speaks about all-pervasiveness of the Atman, which is   
attained by the devotee or a sadhak. Sarvatmavtam says Sri   
Sankara. What does it mean? Does it mean, that you will   
become God or Brahman. Yes. You will become Brahman or   
God but you will not become the ruler. Here the rulership is   
not indicated because, after realizing Brahman, where is separate   
"you" to become a ruler and have many people to be ruled?   
The ruler and the ruled implies dualism and it is not definitely   
indicated here. We become one with Brahman and whatever   
Brahman is, we are. That is all.   
Then, Sri Sankara says Isvaratvam and mahavibhuti sahitam.   
WE become Isvara with all powers and riches. Here again   
it is indicated here, that the mahavibhuti sahitam isvaratvam,   
is the power of siddhis and supernatural powers. But a Brahma   
Jnani will not care for them. Bhagavan Ramana says that siddhis   
are again dreams. Why do you want dreams, when you are   
constantly awake in Brahmanhood? So these powers and riches   
would come if one wants, but one will not want.   
Why great Jnanis do not exhibit supernatural powers?   
We shall see.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Maha Vibhuti Sahitam and Isvaratvam - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 14, 2009, 08:41:37 AM  
---  
The Brahma Jnanis always dwell steeped in the bliss of Brahman   
and they do not want to exhibit siddhic powers. The Siddhic   
powers will go against the nature of destiny, which Hindu philosphy agrees  
that these should be borne with perseverence   
to wipe out our sins and misdeeds of the past. Secondly, Brahmanhood does not  
mean interfering with Brahman's work.   
Very rarely, Jnanis have exhibited some siddhic powers, in most   
deserving cases. This is more an exception than a general rule.   
Jesus Christ cured only a couple of leprosy affected persons,   
and again one or two demon-afflicted persons and lame and   
paralytic. He raised only one Lazrus from death. Bhagavan   
Ramana thus raised from death only one young boy, when he   
was bitten by a snake and was dying black and blue. He   
never interfered with destiny of two young babies of Mahalakhsmi Amma, because  
they were to be liberated. Why save them   
and make them toil in this world? In one case, he fed the child   
with a spoon of milk, and that too Mahalakshmi Amma wanted   
Him to do. He was hesitant. But He did it. In the second case, He applied  
Vibhuti on the forehead of the baby, reluctantly,   
due to adamance of Mahalakhshmi Amma. This second baby   
also got liberated and left the world.   
Bhagavan Ramana has once told: "If I start reviving the dead   
to life, then tomorrow this Asramam will be full of corpses,   
for my assistance!" Bhagavan Ramana never wanted to cross   
swords with destiny. Even in His own case, He did not do!   
Aiswaryamavyahatam - Such a devotee will get all riches   
and powers. But he would not care a penny for it.   
Sarvatmatvamithi sputkrutamidam yasmadha mushmim stave,   
Tenasya sravanath tadhartamananath dhyanacha sangirtanath,   
Sarvatamatva maha vibhuti sahitam syadhichvaratvam svatha,   
Siddhyeth tatpunarashtadha parniathanch aisvaryamm avyahatam.   
 \- Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram - Verse 10   
There are a few verses added much later (not Sri Sankara's) on   
this poem. We shall quickly find the meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram - the last few verses  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 14, 2009, 10:20:44 AM  
---  
The last few verses of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram were added   
later by some other saints and poets and these were not Sankara's.   
However, for day to day chanting, these are also included. Here   
is where, Sri Dakshinamurty is picutrised as sitting at the banyan   
tree, and all munis and rishis are sitting before him. The original   
verses do not give any such details. Sri Sankara says the guru   
is dakshina-amurty, the formelss Self. He is the Isvara of three   
worlds, he is Dakshinamurty Deva, he vanquishes births and deaths, and all the  
miseries associated with life and death.   
He is the seat of Jnanam. Jnanadhatharam. (Verse 11)   
The Verse 12 describes the wonder, Chitram: At the northern end (spiritual north pole), at a banyan tree,   
there is a wondrous thing happening. The disciples (Sanaka   
and others) are old but the Guru is young. This Guru is in   
Silence and explains the Truth and the disciples get their   
doubts solved. (Verse 12)   
He is Om. He is the meaning and purport of Om. He is the   
Pure Jnana form. He is tainteless, he is ever peaceful (and   
spreads peace), He is Sri Dakshinamurty. (Verse 13)   
The Guru is Brahma. The Guru is Vishnu. The Guru is Maheswara.   
This Guru is really Para Brahman. He is Sri Dakshinamurty.   
(Verse 14). This is actually from Guru Gita.   
He is the physician for the whole world. He cures the bhavaroga,   
the disease of worldly life. He is eternal and he is all knowledge of the  
universe. He is Sri Dakshinamurty. (Verse 15)   
He is placing his index finger at the bottom of the thumb, and   
is showing a handpose (Chinmudra). This is only to show the   
union of jiva and Brahman, leaving the three malams, impurities,   
represented by the remaining three fingers kept away. (Verse 16)   
Arunachala Siva.

## Entry of Bhagavan Ramana in one's life  
Author: arcsekar            Date: October 15, 2009, 05:24:04 PM  
---  
A general survey of Bhagavan Ramana devotees reveals a common thing. To many  
devotees who did not know much about Ramana, He gained entry into their  
heart, when they were in deep trouble or undergoing bad patch of life. In  
fact, in my case also, when I had a long period of unemploymeme despite my  
qualifiactions and experience, in 1991-that was the time when HE seized me in  
his tiger's claw and Iam for ever under his grip.His saying that if you are  
not destined to work, you will not get work,however hard you may try; if you  
are destined to work, you can not escape from it -created a deep impression on  
me.

Dear arcsekar,   
I fully agree with you. In good days, one does not think of God   
or Bhagavan Ramana. One comes to God or Guru, only when   
miseries and pains confound him. There are a few exceptions   
like Muruganar and Kavyakanta Ganapti Muni and David Godman,   
who seeks a Guru despite a comfortable living on hand. In my   
case, He became known to me in 1990s when I visited Tiruvannamalai first. It  
was a casual visit and then the local   
Ramana Maharshi Centre, in charge Sri Natarajan gave me some   
books during one of my visits to his house cum Ramana books   
sale centre in Bangalore. He really 'entered' my life in the year   
2000, when miseries and pains bogged over me. This time, it   
was intense. I came out of drug habit easily by putting faith in   
me. I started going to Tiruvannamalai again at least once in a   
year. The year 2007 marked the beginning of more than one visit   
to Asramam, every year. In the year 2008 I visited His Asramam   
three times and during the current year, three times so far.   
Many people come to know Him.   
A few people are called.   
Still fewer are chosen.   
I bow to Him, the Complete Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

My mother had placed an image of Bhagavan on her shrine. I found that any  
chance I had I would gaze at this photograph, I could not take my gaze from  
his as I just wanted - then I realised that I had found and recognised  
"living proof" beyond any of my doubts, of a self-realised person. Ten years  
of earnest practice and enquiry had led me to Bhagavan, or rather, when I was  
ready, Bhagavan let me know he was here (and everywhere ).   
Love to all
