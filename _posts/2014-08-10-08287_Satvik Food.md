## Satvik Food

Dear friends,   
I wanted inputs from our learned friends on what can be construed as a satvik  
diet in the life of a sadhak.   
This I am writing seeking response with respect to an Indian diet, though i  
presume any response depending on the generality, could help other sadhaks as  
well..   
Secondly with respective to the following simple meals, I request some  
response on what care could be taken to ensure that components of below meals  
and hence the overall meal, remains satvik.   
1.South Indian meal -Rice with sambar (a south indian liquid gravy eaten wit  
rice ),Rice with RAsam (a spicy liquid) and rice with curd along with a curry  
made of any vegetable like brinjal,lady's finger etc fried in oil.   
2.A North Indian diet of chapathi (or Roti-Both Indian Breads) along with a  
curry (In curry there are various dishes possible).Here possibly an  
additional response that would help is which dishes to avoid and which to be  
preferred.   
Since the mind is made up among other things -of the subtle element that we  
eat - this response will help sadhaks to be somewhat choosy whenever an option  
is available to them.   
Regards,   
Anand.

Dear Anand,   
According to Sri Bhagavan, sattvic food is all vegetarian food. Eggs, meat  
etc., are prohibited. Bread etc., are also   
vegetarian food.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anand,   
Always resorting to home food at any cost is best practice, especially cooked  
by oneself or ones closest relative. It is a tapas to not eat from outside.  
Outside food is to be rejected at all costs, no matter how satvic they may  
seem. outside food is outside. Avoiding onions and garlic is a practice  
followed since the time immemorial, by the practice of aspirants.   
Eating very hot and very cold food (refrigerated) is not satvic, microwave  
food is not recommended. The food should not be very spicy, should be of very  
lesser salt and lesser of tamarind as well.   
It is said in the shastras, food must be eaten like this - "Half stomach food,  
one fourth is water and one fourth is for air - left free"   
We have to cultivate nurture our selves to become masters of our tongue. All  
Sages have said that all good things begin to happen when the tongue is tamed  
- by way of what we eat and by way of what we talk (speak less) Hence,  
observing vratas like Ekadasi is highly recommended. Ekadasi vrata is just not  
about not eating, all the senses are to observe vratas, the stomach observes  
fast, the mouth observes fast by not speaking much, the mind observes fast by  
not thinking worldly, the ears observe fast by not listening to the sundri,  
the eyes observe fast by not looking at sundry, and so on. this alone is true  
ekadasi vrata.   
When the tongue is mastered, all vasanas are over come without much struggle  
by the grace of God.   
Not eating at all is bad, eating too much is also bad. one has to discern ones  
own moderation suitable to ones body, biologically.   
Auvvayar says eat only when you are hungry, and you need not eat just because  
it is eating time.   
At the same time, one should not resort to extremes, one has to be wise and  
discriminative as the situation demands, but such demanding situations are to  
be carefully discerned.   
What is very easily digestable is basically satvic!   
If body permits, it is best advised to sit on the floor and eat, eating from  
table is only secondary. There is science in this.   
Also while eating food, one should avoid seeing TV, and such other  
disturbances. Eating food is worship of Lord, it is a sacred and ought to be  
carried in a slow and quietly.   
Finally, inorder to follow these virtues, if it is thrusted on family members  
against their wishes, there is no bigger mistake or sin. One has to take it  
step by step and it is Tapas, nothing happens over night. Win every ones trust  
by way of love and tapas.

The best solution for having the right food that is tasty, at the same time  
sattvic and also quite nutritious is to learn cooking and start preparing your  
own food at home and it does not matter whether you are a man / women. In  
today's complex Urban world it is mandatory for both men and women to know  
cooking and prepare their own food at home instead of depending upon cooks /  
caterers /hotels/ready made food stuffs /processed foods etc etc. They can be  
used for special occasions or during some very tight situations.   
It is never too late to learn cooking and though initially it may look quite  
complex but if you approach cooking as a "Spiritual Practice" in itself then  
you will not feel tired / bored but will approach each day's cooking with love  
and affection. If fact cooking was considered as a sacred act in Hindu Dharma  
. Along with cooking learn basics of Nutrition so that you get to know whether  
your food had adequate carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and fats. You do  
not have to buy any specific books for the same as most of the material is  
freely available on net.   
Today apart from food being sattvic we have to also focus whether we get the  
right type of nutrition as most of the fruits and vegetable as well as the  
other pulses and grains that we get from market are mass produced and lot of  
pesticides are used to increase the agricultural output and hence we just cant  
blindly take for granted that the sattvic food that we take also provides us  
with the right nutrition.   
The Saying "An apple a day keeps the Doctor away " is well known and also  
quite valid even today but we have to also remember that the Apple that we  
eat today is not the same one that was consumed by our Parents / Grandparents  
50 years back.   
Will share more on this topic later

dear shri anna sundaram   
though veg eating is pre requesite may i add that that pizza, noodles, any  
thing fried in oil like poori can not be satwic food. also food main or side  
prepared, stored and eaten later is not satwic except may be like gruel.
