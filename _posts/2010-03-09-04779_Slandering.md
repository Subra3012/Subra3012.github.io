## Slandering

(Shirdi) Baba required no special place, nor any special time for giving  
instructions. Whenever any occasion demanded, He gave them freely. Once it so  
happened that a Bhakta of Baba, reviled another behind his back, before other  
people. On leaving aside merits, he dwelt on the faults of his brother, and  
spoke so sarcastically, that the hearers were disgusted. Generally, we see  
that people have a tendency to scandalize others, un-necessarily; and this  
brings on hatred and ill-will. Saints see scandal, in another light. They say  
that there are various ways of cleansing or removing dirt, viz. by means of  
earth, water and soap etc., but a scandal-monger has got a way of his own. He  
removes the dirt (faults) of others by his tongue; so in a way of obliges the  
person, whom he reviles and for this he is to be thanked. Sai Baba had his own  
method of correcting the scandal-monger. He knew by his omniscience what the  
slanderer had done and when He met him at noon near the Lendi, Baba pointed  
out to him a pig that was eating filth near the fence and said to him -  
"Behold how, with what relish it is gorging dung. Your conduct is similar. You  
go on reviling your own brethren to your heart's content. After performing  
many deeds of merit, you are born a man, and if you act like this, will Shirdi  
help you in any way?" Needless to say, that the Bhakta took the lesson to his  
heart, and went away.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. Shirdi Baba told this story. He also said that slandering others, is   
like licking the dirt from another's body for cleaning.   
Arunachala Siva.

There should be a purpose. its never the act but the purpose that defines the  
true act. if it is to help, its not slander, its help. if it is just ot enjoy  
gossip. .. its slander.   
A Lot actually depends on what it means to slander.   
suppose someone is going to a wrong person, and we help him out, is it  
slander?   
or suppose we sit home and talk ill of another person for no reason, is that  
slander?
