## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Reason Why Angaraparna Addresses Arjuna As 'tapatya'

**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 173 - 177**   
Pandavas, along with their mother start walking towards Panchala, to obtain  
Draupadi as their wife. At nightfall they reach the banks of river Ganga. A  
gandharva king by name Angaraparna (Blazing chariot), was bathing in that  
river along with his wives and retinue.   
Arjuna approaches water to quench thirst, and the gandharva challenges Arjuna  
for a fight, saying that during nightfall, men are not supposed to enter  
Ganga.   
Arjuna asks Gandharva, why he fought with them, chastised them for entering  
Ganga, as they are not at fault. Angaraparna replies "Even though you are not  
at fault, and I know that you are from Kuru race, I also know the knowledge  
and power of your preceptor Drona, I also know that you five brothers are  
noble and well learned, and good fighters, yet I censured you.   
The reason is, you have completed your studies, yet you have not taken a wife  
and you have not taken up any mode of life and wandering in forest. Lastly,  
being of nobility, you dont have a priest who can guide you on the path of  
virtue, you have not appointed one."   
Gandharava addresses Arjuna as 'Tapatya'. Arjuna was curious to know why he is  
called as Tapatya, as he is son of Kunti and should be called as Kaunteya.   
Gandharva king Angaraparna then tells him the story of Tapati, daughter of  
Surya the sun god.   
There was a king named Samvarana, was a just ruler of earth. Once when he was  
on a hunting expedition, he saw the daughter of Sun god, Tapati, in a dazzling  
golden light. He immediately falls in love with that damsel and requests her  
hand. She says, only her father, Surya can determine who has to be her  
husband. Samvarna then, prays to his chief priest Sage Vashishta, who ascends  
to the world of light, illuminated by Surya and requests his daughter's hand  
for Samvarna. Sun god agrees to that and marries off his daughter tapati to  
Samvarana. They have a illustrious son by name Kuru, on whose name the entire  
race is known as Kauravas.   
 **On Hearing this story Arjuna wanted to know about Sage Vashishta.**   
Gandharva then tells about Sage Vashishta, "Vashishta is the foremost among  
sages. he is the manasa putra (mind-born son) of the creator Brahmaji. His  
wife is Arundhati. He has fully conquered all the 6 enemies of any person, viz  
kama (unreasonable desires), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment  
and delusion), madha (pride) and matsarya (jealousy).   
He is conversant in all Vedas. King Vishwamitra, to spite Vashishta has killed  
all his sons. Even then Vashishta did not retaliate, and exterminate the race  
of Kusikas, to which Vishwamitra belongs. Instead he forgave him. He could  
have brought back his children from the world of death, through his ascetic  
power. Even that he did not do, as he does not want to interfere in natural  
order of things. He has helped many Kings, by being their priest, in putting  
them on the path of virtue. So, O Tapatya, you should also appoint a good  
priest for you."

Is there any duality while attending to the self i.e during self-enquiry?

No no duality whether attending to self inquiry or doing waht ever ;  
duality is a mistaken notion: no matter what one is doing !There is no duality  
right now.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Attending to the self-enquiry, that is,   
asking, "Who am I?" is also a thought. This one thought, will ward off   
all other thoughts, and eventually, even this will burn itself, like   
the stick that is used to stir the funeral pyre. (Who am I? - 1902)   
Dear srkudai, Nice, but you are telling the 'ultimate'.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Do not rush to where even the angels fear to go! Even during  
enquiry there is duality. Duality vanishes only when you are   
self realized. Then, there is no Subramanian, no non duel, no Sankar,   
no DRPVSSN Raju, no srkudai. One is One without a Second!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, There is duality till the self enquiry or self   
surrender merges into the goal, the Self. Then, there is   
selflessness, that is there is no individual self or soul. But,   
it is full of SELF-ishness!   
Arunachala Siva.

Ramana Maharshi says Duality (dvaita) even during sadhana is not present   
 **Even the argument which says, Duality (dvaita) during practice (sadhana)   
which one undertakes (due to) not knowing (the truth that one is always  
Brahman)  and nonduality (advaita) after attainment (that is, duality is true  
during the time of practice and non-duality becomes true only after the  
attainment of Self-realization), is not true. Who else is one except the  
tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) and when  
one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).**   
Sri Bhagavan says that even this is not true, because nonduality (advaita) is  
always the truth and duality (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one non-  
dual **Self alone exists and is real** even when in the ignorant outlook of  
the individual it seems to appear as this unreal world of duality and  
diversity.   
In order to emphasis that duality is unreal even during the time of its  
seeming existence, Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the lost tenth man.  
_Ten foolish men forded a river, and on reaching the other side they wished to  
make sure that all had crossed safely. So all of them began to count the  
number of persons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count himself,  
they all counted only nine. Believing that one of their companions must have  
drowned, they all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who understood the  
situation asked each one to count himself, whereupon they realized that they  
were always ten men, both during the time of their seeming loss and after  
their finding the missing man. Similarly, when we attain Self-knowledge we  
will realize that non-duality (advaita) is always the sole truth,both during  
the time of our seeming ignorance (when nonduality appears to be lost and  
duality appears to prevail) and after our attaining Self, the non-dual  
reality._   
 **It is to be noted here that, though non-duality is the truth even during  
the time of seeming ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual practice  
(sadhana) is necessary,as some theoreticians/theorists have wrongly  
concluded.So long as the tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for  
each one of the ten to enquire and find out Who is lost?, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the so called lost tenth man is only  
oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as the experience  
of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to enquire and find  
out Who am I, who have lost the experience of non-duality?**, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the seeming individual I who does not  
experience non-duality is merely an unreal appearance, and that the real I  
has in fact never lost the experience of non-duality.
