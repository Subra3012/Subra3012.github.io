Can anyone tell me the preferred dress code for ladies at the Ashram  
facilities? I already red that the Ashram grounds are to be walked barefoot.   
Grateful,   
kaleido

Dear kaleido,   
There is no dress code as such. But ladies usually wear saris   
or chudidhar. Even Western ladies wear saris and come!   
Western men wear loose trousers or dhotis. Indians wear trousers   
or dhotis.   
Arunachala Siva.
