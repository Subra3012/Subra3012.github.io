Can anyone tell me the preferred dress code for ladies at the Ashram  
facilities? I already red that the Ashram grounds are to be walked barefoot.   
Grateful,

Dear kaleido,   
There is no dress code as such. But ladies usually wear saris   
or chudidhar. Even Western ladies wear saris and come!   
Western men wear loose trousers or dhotis. Indians wear trousers   
or dhotis.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Arunachala Visiri Samiyar

Extracts from http://www.arunachalasamudra.org/yogiram.html   
Visiri Saamiyar Sri Sri Yogi Ram Surat Kumar a true saint and our Father's  
devotee.   
Over to Visir Samiyar on Arunachala in his own words/of his life: He always acknowledged with reverence his huge debt to sacred Arunachala and  
Arunachaleswarar Temple, saying: 'This hill and this temple, they have saved  
this beggar,' and with the utmost gratitude for the sanctity of Mount  
Arunachala, he would later say: 'This beggar wandering here and there, tired of wandering but having no home -  
Arunachalesvara, in the form of this hill, had mercy on this miserable sinner.  
So he gives thanks, a thousand thanks, to this holy hill, this holy temple.  
Oh, the magnanimity of the Lord! He has given me shelter for twenty long  
years. Whereas others who come are enabled to stay only days or weeks. . .   
For thousands of years the hill has given shelter to so many dirty sinners  
like me - and Arunachala will give us shelter for thousand of years to come.'   
 When Yogi Ramsuratkumar used to walk around the Hill, out of humility, he would always walk in the opposite direction of all the other pilgrims.   
 Many times Yogi Ramsuratkumar would say: 'The mountain helps us.' He himself spent many years wandering on the mountain, taking shelter in its caves. Based on his own comments, his transformation seems to have been connected in part to his subtle relationship to the divine force within Arunachala.   
Where is the Fire?   
The Fire is there on the hill there.   
But I don't see it there.   
You can see it if you are really bent upon seeing it.   
Are you afraid of being engulfed by it?   
Then you can't see it   
Have courage, no fear   
You are sure to see it   
 Yogi Ramsuratkumar   
 The 'Fire' referred to by Yogi Ramsuratkumar (as poet) is the mystical Fire of Creation, the light that is perceived burning within Mount Arunachala as the embodiment of Shiva: 'This holy Fire burned at the core of the beggar's absolute certainty: his  
faith in a Power that governs everything, controls everything.'   
Yogi Ramsuratkumar
