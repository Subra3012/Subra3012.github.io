One day, having heard of Vengamaiyar, a reputed saint in the nearby village of  
Poththarai, in Polur   
district, Achutha Dasar went to see her. The distinguished Ammaiyar welcomed  
Dasar with a motherly   
affection and delighted in their discussions about spiritual matters. Dasar  
stayed with Ammaiyar for   
little over a year, and was thoroughly instructed in great yoga practices  
before he returned to the house   
of his in-laws. He stayed in a separate room and continued his yoga  
practices. It was said that after   
continuing these yogic practices without interruption he gained several  
siddhis (powers) notably the   
power of levitation.   
During this period of intense practice Achutha Dasar's young wife reached  
puberty. Her parents performed   
all the obligatory social and religious ceremonies every day, and on the ninth  
day, the Manjal Neerattu,   
a special purificatory bathing ceremony was performed and that evening further  
ceremonies were   
performed preparatory to the nuptial night. Meanwhile Dasar went into his  
room bolting it from the   
inside and did his usual yogic practices. When all the ceremonies were  
completed, in order to leave his   
young bride with Achuyta Dasar, they went to his room to leave his young bride  
with Achyutha Dasar,   
they went his room and asked him to open the door.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
