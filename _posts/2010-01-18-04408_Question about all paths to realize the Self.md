## Does a jnani have "moods"?

Hey guys. I listened to Shinzen Young's interview  
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE) about 103-year-old zen master  
Joshu Sasaki Roshi. He is now the oldest buddhist teacher in the world. I have  
read a lot of people having amazing experiences in his presence.   
One person said: " _Of the handful of reputed spiritual teachers that I have been able to sit  
with or speak to, this man had the most remarkable stillness. His energy field  
was completely still, yet radiant - not even a shutter of movement in his  
energy. To this day, I have never seen another person who was so still within.  
-- Yet my direct experience of this roshi - his stillness, depth, and radiance  
- confirmed that he had experienced this state deeper than anyone I had met  
before (or to this day)_."   
In my opinion Sasaki Roshi is closer to advaita teacher than most zen teachers  
because he says that koan zen is the real way. Koans are spiritual questions  
like "Who am I" or "What is this?". So to my question, from Nisargadatta  
Maharaj and other advaita masters I have understood that they are all the time  
in the the highest state and they don't have any sense of self (with small s)  
left.   
Shinzen Young says in the video that he had supressed thoughts, mental images,  
feelings (= the sense of self). But Joshu Sasaki told him not to supress the  
sense of self. He said that there is always the movement between zero self and  
**doing** of the self. It's like ocean giving rise to a wave and it continues  
even after realisation. (But he also mentions that these both are no **s** elf  
experiences when they are allowed to happen.   
So do you think here is any contradiction? I've just got the idea that a  
jnani's state is eternal and doesn't have any changes.

Moods being of the mind. .. they keep changing.   
The body states also keep changing.   
whether a Jnani or otherwise... what is changing will remain changing.   
No escape.   
Jnani. .. knows himself as Consciousness and Consciousness is changeless !  
Ever the Same!   
What is changeless remains changeless   
what is changing keeps changing!   
Love!

If "yawning" is to be taken to indicate boredom or sleep, I am told   
that Bhagavan Ramana was never seen "yawning". He was ever   
happy, ever satisfied, ever in limitless bliss. Even anger, another   
"mood", He showed very rarely in His entire life of 54 years in   
Arunachala.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
The one who has moods will bother to see about moods of others, and a one who  
is above moods, well what is 'mood' for him?   
Mood exists for him who has various meanings for 'mood'.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Yes. Bhagavan Ramana used to sleep, intermittently for a few   
minutes even during nights. Daytime, I think, He had never slept.   
The "snoring" incident happened when Major Chadwick was present.   
He asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Bhagavan! Do you also snore?"   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Yes. I knew I snored. I continued it,   
since it was fine!"   
Now, tell me, can anyone know his own snoring? We see others   
pointing out the sleeping man's snore. The sleeping man never   
knows that he is snoring!   
All is Ramana Maya.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 To know one's snoring is not all that difficult. I remain aware of my snoring some times.   
Sleep, awake. .. these also would qualify as moods. ..   
Moods are of mind. .. Ramana is Ever Awake, as he is the Self and not mind.  
And infact, out of ignorance, i see the moods of that body/mind as his moods  
and the moods of this body and mind as my moods. In Reality. .. there is only  
Ramana in and through all these bodys and minds! So Ramana has infinite moods,  
if I may be allowed to say so.   
And at the same time, being Consciousness which is beyond all moods. .. he has  
absolutely no moods!   
Love!

Thanks, I liked reading your answers. Anthony de Mello once told a story  
about a monk asking a zen master what did he got when he attained  
enlightenment. The zen master replied: "Well, before enlightenment I used to  
be depressed, but after enlightenment I continued to be depressed."   
de Mello said that The difference is that after his enlightenment, the zen  
master saw that he was not the depression, and the feeling was just like a  
cloud passing in the blue sky. Anthony de Mello also says that if one  
practices self awareness it may be very well possible that all negative  
feelings dissapear for good, but after awakening it doesn't matter at all is  
there negative feelings or not.

Yes. It is also true. After enlightenment, everything looks the   
same, as T.S. Eliot said in his poem: "There will be time, there will   
be time, when every thing looks alike." "At the end of all explorartion, we  
shall be there where we started, "to know the   
place for the first time." But the difference, is enlightenement, i.e.   
"knowing the place for the first time!"   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say: If one gets head ache occasionally,   
he needs medicine. But if he gets head ache every day, such a   
person does not need any medicine. Headache becomes "natural"   
to him as the Self becomes natural for a Jnani. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Nava Mani Maalai, Verse   
7: "You are the deficiency, You are the completion. I shall no   
more think of them. But give me, O Eye of my eye, abundant love   
for your anklet-wearing feet!"   
Arunachala Siva.

That is why in Bhagavad Gita while defining a Stitaprajna   
Sri Krishna says "Sitoshna sukadukeshu", Cold, heat, sukham (comfort), dukkham  
(discomfort). .. remain Equanimous. he does not say "Do not experience them"   
He says "Be equanimous".   
How to remain equanimous... Practice Titiksha. Bear them. There is no  
alternative to it!   
That is the important !   
If one were supposed to not experience cold, heat etc. .. then what is the  
point in saying a person who is equanimous when experiencing all these?   
No one can escape experience of these. Only a Jnani knows them as unreal and  
is able to treat them completely as unreal.   
Love!

Dear I,   
Him the sword cannot pierce; him the fire cannot burn; him the water cannot  
melt; him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle  
whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is located in the body, and  
that death means the change of this center from body to body.   
\- Swami Vivekananda   
and Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi said that the Spiritual experience or heart is  
situated 2 digits towards the right side.   
And when we do certain parayana, when we do the Nyaasa, when we use the Bija  
Mantras: ... iti Bijam (on the right side of the chest) exactly to the position what  
Bhagawan has said   
... iti Shaktihi (on the left side of the chest) which is Maya Tatvam or  
Shakti Tatvam located on the Vama Bhaaga or the left side   
... Iti keelakam (on the centre of the body just below the chest)   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Perhaps, they (Plenum, Self, Existence, Transcendental Reality, Pure  
Consciousness, Awareness, Absolute ) also want to know whether you and i are  
the same with them?   
You yourself have just created several objects. Why don't one to provide them
