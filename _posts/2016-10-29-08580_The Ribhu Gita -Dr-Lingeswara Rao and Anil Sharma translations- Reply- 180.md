20. I am myself the peacefulness of the individual. I myself am the form of Isvara.   
I am myself Brahman, the supreme Brahman. I alone am, the inexhaustible.   
21. I am myself the ruination and the theory. I am myself the Self, the illuminator.   
I am myself the radiant form. I am myself the extremely blemish-less.   
22. I am myself the eternal Self, indeed. I am myself the pure, the desirable. I am   
myself the metrical form. I am myself devoid of the body and such.   
23. I am myself the flawless Self. I am myself seated as the space. There are   
no 'this' or 'this one'. There are no differences such as 'this'.   
24\. Brahman alone shines as the mind. Brahman alone is always like Siva.  
Brahman   
alone shines as the intellect. Brahman alone is always like Siva.   
25. Brahman alone shines like the moon. Verily Brahman itself is the gross;   
Brahman alone ever, not another. Brahman alone is its Guru.   
26\. I am the light of the Self. I am naught. I am myself ever. I am myself  
the   
supreme Brahman. I am myself the inexhaustible consciousness.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
