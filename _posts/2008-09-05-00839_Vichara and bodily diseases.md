## Vichara and bodily diseases

Dear nondsait, I did not see your message in the Personal Message   
of yours through that column in the Forum till today. Please   
forgive me.   
Vichara, confers Cosmic Consciousness, which is the Self. It does   
not cure the diseases, in the ordinary parlance. It gives the   
realized person, enormous strength to withstand the pain and   
agony of such ailments, as if it is an ant bite. It can be termed 'karmic',  
but again it may not be true in the case of a self realized person,   
since he is beyond the three karmas, Agami, Sanchita and Prarabdha.   
There are various theories on Bhagavan's terminal cancer. But   
no one has proved anything. But the truth remains, that He   
withstood it as an ant bite.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subrahmanyan Ji   
As I see bhagavan like siva, who has kept posion in His throat to save the  
world while during Samudhra Manthan, our   
bhagavan also bought from His devotees all the ailment.At least in one of His  
Thruvilaiyadal i,e. pittuku man sumandadhu,   
he gave the pain of the blow to all 3 world to teach all He is none other than  
God Siva. But Bhagavan after becoming God He lived like a human being among  
human being. What there is to say.Bhagavanuke Velicham..

Dear Ramanaduli, Bhagavan did cure diseases of His devotees   
in a few cases and in a few other cases, He got them cured through   
some other devotess. He cured the pain in the finger and the elbow   
of His devotee, as you might have read in one of the Golden eyes   
post. He cured the blindness of another through a surgery by another   
doctor devotee. But He said that He had not done anything, so   
that many ill devotees would not throng Him, with problems. He   
did not bring the dead child back to life, in one case, because that   
was that child's prarabdha. As regards His own terminal cancer,   
he bore it lightly without pain and misery because He had no mind!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subrahmaniyan ji   
When the mind is killed we do not feel the pain and pleasure. Is not it?  
Therefore those who got realised soul they must have lost their mind. When  
they do not have the mind then how they can feel other's pain. Because I  
cannot kill my mind so I am geting lot sort of stupid questions. At the same  
time I pray to Bhagavan for my stupidity. Can you explain please?

Dear Ramanaduli, Your question is very relevant. The killing of   
the mind is itself a difficult task, because we are so much used   
to mind and ego and we always get a feeling that a killed mind   
is a broken mind that is insane. It is not. The killing of mind is   
not contaminating the mind, causing mental break-down that   
we become schizophrenic or madcaps. The killing of mind is the   
state where one eternally lives in the Self, happy and blissful.   
This problem was raised earlier in the Forum and I have given   
similar answers.   
The question therefore remains as to how the Self realized Jnanis,   
live and express emotions like human beings. The answer is,   
they live in a state of Supermind (Aurobindo) or Overmind (Zen Master   
Bosho) or Pure Mind. (Bhagavan Ramana). This mind will do all   
the activities, more skillfully and display emotions, in times of need.   
Bhagavan was a beautiful cook. He can cut vegetables and stitch   
leaf plates (the old type), with great dexterity. He cried with   
joy in times of joy and shed tears towards other people's sorrow.   
He never shed tears for his pain and misery, that is during his   
terminal cancer. He cried when Echammal came with her grandson,   
crying for the demise of her daughter. He expressed happiness,   
when ganji and aviayal were served in the Asram!   
This Pure Mind displays all emotions. It does not harm others,   
it is like a burnt rope.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 When we posit our consciousness in the source of the mind,there is an experience of absence of the mind(Naiva manasam).Then   
the mind is free of contamination of tendenies and purified(Suddha)manas act  
spontaneouly as in the case of Jnanis.This purification and experience   
of absence of mind amounts to killing of the mind.You cannot kill the mind  
because it is never there.Can you kill the illusory snake in a rope.   
Recognising the rope as a rope amounts to killing of the snake.But in the  
first instance snake never existed,it is only our imagination born out of   
false perception of the rope.So also we imagine mind to be there because we  
have not recognised self "as it is".For this keeping our attention   
in the source(Adhistana) of the mind through self-enquiry is the best way.

Dear Raju ji   
Now I understand that there is no such "mind" we have like snake in the rope.  
Self is every where and in every time.   
As we erase the mind then the body will also go away. Means our body is the  
imaginery one the mind.Something which acts like self is CALLED MIND, where  
there is no truth if I go to the source. your comments please.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Yes,that is exactly what i mean.Bhagawan used to say that he is aware of the body only when someone pointed it out.   
Otherwise he used to be aware of awareness all the time.From his point of view  
body-mind omplex is just imageary.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
As Dr. Raju said the mind-body comlplex will not be felt after   
self realization. It will be away from him, as a skin which has   
been shed by the snake. He will be, all the time, in Brahman   
and the body is appearing only from the point of view of onlookers.   
He will say, "No mind, I am the Self." He will be like a mirror,   
reflecting emotions for others, as per their emotions.   
Arunachala Siva.
