Bhagavan would never eat during an eclipse of the sun or moon, a custom that  
still continues in the Ashram, where food may only be cooked after the eclipse  
is finished. He told me that the stomach did not digest while the eclipse was  
proceeding and so it was bad for the health to eat at that time.   
However, he did not take the ritual bath at the beginning and end of an  
eclipse as is usual with orthodox Brahmins.

Dear prasanth,   
You may be correct. But there is one incident where Bhagavan   
Ramana did eat during a lunar eclipse during the evening.   
Generally, He used to say that all these dharmas are applicable only to those  
who have not realized the Jnana. Bhagavan Ramana is also   
an Ati varnasrami, beyond all castes and stages of life. So it is   
okay for Him to observe or not to observe these customs.   
Arunachala Siva.
