For the purpose of bringing out the full philosophy of the Ramayana, one has  
to closely follow the part played by the (1) King Dasaratha (2) Manthara  
the maid servant of Kaikeyi (3). Kaikeyi-- the youngest of the king  
Dasaratha's consorts (4) Ravana the demon king of Lanka (5) Hanuman--Minister  
of the Vanara chief Sugriva (6), Sita the beloved wife of Sri Rama, the prince  
of Ayodhya (7) Lakshmana --brother of Sri Rama and ( Sri Rama --the hero of  
the great epic.   
On the eve of the coronation of Sri Rama as the Crown Prince of Ayodhya, the  
whole scheme was shelved because of the pressure brought on Dasaratha by his  
wife Kaikeyi under the instigation of her maid servant Manthara and the King's  
submission to the dictates of his wife whereby Prince Rama was exiled to the  
forest for fourteen years.   
In this context, King Dasaratha is to be compared to the ordinary man of the  
world placed in an atmosphere of pleasure and plenty falling a victim to the  
promptings of his vicious mind ( Manthara) infatuated by sense objects  
(Kaikeyi).   
The ten headed Rakshasa, Ravana, in the absense of sri Rama and Lakshmana  
steals away Sita from their forest- dwelling. Here Ravana with his ten heads  
is to be compared with the ten sense organs--five organs of knowledge, and  
five organs of action. Stealing away of Sita is to be compared to the loss of  
reasoning power of the worldly minded, deluded by Maya. The golden deer  
Maricha is Maya which deluded both Lakshmana and Rama and they lost their  
power of discrimination (Sita).   
Hanuman, the intellectual giant and strong celibate, is an invincible power  
**which indicates that if one has to achieve success in all his undertakings  
one has to cultivate truth, simplicity, purity, selfless service, devotion to  
duty,and establish oneself in absolute Bramhacharya.**   
 **Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya!!!!**

Like sita we ordinary jivas have always temptations going after illusion. When  
Sita wanted the golden deer   
Ram told her it is not a real. But to satisfy His wife's desire He went after  
the deer. In day to day life also   
it happens in so many houses. Wives demand and compel their husband to get  
luxury life then both will be in   
trouble.   
There are lots of lession we should learn from Ramayana.   
Ramanaduli

Sita herself is the Maha Maya. But she played a pageant. She   
asked for a maya (illusory) deer and thus lost contact with Brahman   
(Rama) got separated by kama (Ravana) etc., and then with the   
help of the Guru (Hanuman), she regained union with Brahman!   
Arunachala Siva.
