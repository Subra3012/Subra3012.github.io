## Who is afraid of death?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 16, 2010, 03:05:26 PM

There was a concentration camp and there were prisoners during   
World War II. The prisoners were quite happy, playing cards,   
carrom and chess and laughing and giggling. One journalist came   
to interview them. He became aghast seeing the happy nature   
of the prisoners. He asked them: How come you are all extremely   
joyful. You are going to be executed in a month's time. Are you   
not afraid of the impending death?   
One prisoner looked at the journalist and said: At least our dates   
of execution are known to us in advance. But what about your case?   
You may even be shot dead tomorrow. Why should we worry about   
death at all? It may happen or it may not happen. Either way,   
we don't care. We are happy today. That is all.   
One Sanskrit pandit quoted a sloka from a scripture and said   
that we are not afraid of death because of our ajnana, ignorance.   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye! It is not due to that. It is due   
to the truth that in our intuitive knowledge, we are deathless.   
That is our real state. If this intuitive knowledge becomes, the   
experiential truth, then we shall fully understand that our intuitive   
knowledge is the truth.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna : counterfeiting sometimes leads to unexpected results

A THIEF entered the palace of a king in the dead of night and overheard the  
king saying to the queen, "I shall give my daughter in marriage to one of  
those sadhus {holy men) who are dwelling on the bank of the river," The thief  
thought within   
himself: "Well, here is good luck for me. I will go and sit among the sadhus  
tomorrow in the disguise of a sadhu, and perchance I may succeed in getting  
the king's daughter."   
The next day he did so. When the king's officers came soliciting the sadhus to  
marry the king's daughter, none of them consented to it. At last they came to  
the thief in the guise of a sadhu, and made the same proposal to him. The  
thief kept quiet. The officers went back and told the king that there was a  
young sadhu who might be influenced to marry the princess and that there was  
no other who would consent. The king then came to the sadhu in person and  
earnestly entreated him to honour him by accepting the hand of his daughter.   
But the heart of the thief was changed at the king's visit. **He thought  
within himself: "I have only assumed the garb of a sadhu, and behold! the king  
comes to me and is all entreaties. Who can say what better things may not be  
in store for me if I become a real sadhu!" These thoughts so strongly affected  
him that, instead of marrying under false pretences, he began to mend his ways  
from that very day and exerted himself to become a true sadhu. He did not  
marry at all, and ultimately became one of the most pious ascetics of his  
day.**   
 **The counterfeiting of a good thing sometimes leads to unexpected good  
results.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna Says Inscrutable Are The Ways Of God

**How can we understand the ways of God through our small intellects?**   
As Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava brothers and Krishna  
stood around him.They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the great hero.   
Arjuna said to Krishna: "Friend, how surprising it is! Even such a man as our  
grandsire Bhishma - truthful, self-restrained, supremely wise and one of the  
eight Vasus - weeps through Maya,at the hour of death." Sri Krishna asked  
Bhishma about it.   
Bhishma replied: "O Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause of  
my grief. **I am thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas ' sufferings,  
though God Himself is their charioteer,A thought like this makes me feel that  
i have understood nothing of the ways of God, and so I weep."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 17, 2010, 07:56:57 AM

ONCE a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came back and  
told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour on a  
certain tree.The second man replied: "When i went into the wood, I also saw  
that animal.But why do you call it red? It is green."   
Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was  
yellow. Presently others arrived and contended that it was grey,violet, blue,  
and so forth and so on. At last they started quarrelling among themselves. To  
settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw a man sitting under it.   
On being asked, he replied:'Yes, I live under this tree and I know the animal  
very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red, sometimes  
yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey and so forth- It is a chameleon.   
And sometimes it has no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has  
none."   
 **In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature;  
he alone knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and  
aspects. God has attributes; then again He has none. Only the man who lives  
under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in various colours, and he  
knows further that the animal at times has no colour at all. It is the others  
who suffer from the agony of futile argument.

SANKARACHARYA was a Brahmajnani, to be sure! But at the beginning he too had  
the feeling of differentiation. He didn't have the absolute faith that  
everything in the world is Brahman.   
One day as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath,he saw an  
untouchable, a butcher, carrying a load of meat. Inadvertently the butcher  
touched his body.   
**Sankara shouted angrily, "Hey there! How dare you touch me?" "Revered sir",  
said the butcher, "I have not touched you, nor have you touched me.   
The pure Self cannot be the body or the five elements or the twenty four  
cosmic principles." Then Sankara came to his senses.**

This episode (which appears in all Sankara Vijayam biographies)   
gave birth to the famous Maneesha Panchakam. "Five Verses   
on my determination."   
I have covered this work, in some posts, based on Brahmasri   
Nochur Venkataraman's Sat Sangh.   
Arunachala Siva.
