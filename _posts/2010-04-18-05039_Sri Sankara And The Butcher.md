SANKARACHARYA was a Brahmajnani, to be sure! But at the beginning he too had  
the feeling of differentiation. He didn't have the absolute faith that  
everything in the world is Brahman.   
One day as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath,he saw an  
untouchable, a butcher, carrying a load of meat. Inadvertently the butcher  
touched his body.   
**Sankara shouted angrily, "Hey there! How dare you touch me?" "Revered sir",  
said the butcher, "I have not touched you, nor have you touched me.   
The pure Self cannot be the body or the five elements or the twenty four  
cosmic principles." Then Sankara came to his senses.**

This episode (which appears in all Sankara Vijayam biographies)   
gave birth to the famous Maneesha Panchakam. "Five Verses   
on my determination."   
I have covered this work, in some posts, based on Brahmasri   
Nochur Venkataraman's Sat Sangh.   
Arunachala Siva.
