## Siva Manasa Puja of a different kind - 6  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 07, 2009, 10:56:54 AM  
---  
Starting from Sri Sankara, we have been seeing how different   
saints and sages had performed Siva Puja. They did not do   
anything formally, but in various different ways and Siva   
was pleased.   
Karaikal Amma was a devout wife of a rich merchant, who   
was purchasing and selling precious gems and stones. His   
wife Punitavati was a lady devoted equally to Siva and her   
husband. One day, before lunch, her husband Danavaniga   
had sent two mangoes through a servant to leave them at   
home, which he would eat during lunch. Punitavati was   
preparing the lunch and it was not yet ready. Meantime   
Siva appeared as an old brahmin and asked for bhiksha.   
She had no food ready, and so she gave the brahmin one   
of the two mangoes. The brahmin thanked her and left.   
During lunch Danavaniga asked for mango. She served one.   
It was delicious and so her husband asked for the second.   
Where can she go for the mango? She could have told the   
truth but destiny played its role. She went into the kitchen   
and prayed intently to Siva and a mango appeared on her   
palm! She became happy and served it. Tasting the mango,   
her husband said: How come this mango is many times more   
delicious than the first one? It is heavenly. Punitavati could   
not hide the matter beyond that. She told him the truth. Dananiga could not  
believe her words. He also became curious   
and wanted to 'test' Siva. He asked for a second one to be given by Siva.  
This lady was in great dilemma? What can she do now?   
Her immense faith came to her rescue. She got another one   
on her palm when she prayed again! Danavaniga took that   
third mango and was about to bite. The mango disappeared   
from his hand! Siva answered Punitavati's prayers but did not   
want the fruits of her faith to be tested and tasted by her doubting husband.  
The husband became horripilated and left   
the house in great awe. Punitavati waited for his return for   
long only to hear the news that that chap had married another   
woman and settled down in Nagapattinam, near Karaikal.   
The lady felt that it is her job to pray to Siva and visit places   
instead of wasting any more time at home. She wanted Siva   
to give her an invisible form of a devil so that no outsider could   
see her and spread scandals. The prayer was answered. She   
visited various temples to her heart's content. She went to   
Kailas and asked Siva to show his cosmic dance. Siva told   
her to go to Tiru Alangadu [near Chennai]. She went their   
and witnessed His Cosmic Dance and at the end she merged   
with Him in His Effulgence.   
Out of the 63 Saints of Siva, in temples, she is the only   
who is sitting majestically! All the other saints including   
Mangayarkarasi and Sundaramoorthy's mother are standing   
in the row but the Karaikal Amma, Mother of Karaikal is   
sitting majestically. She is Karaikal Amma, because Siva   
Himself addressed her as Mother.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
It is very nice to read about Karikal ammaiyar. I want to add some more lines  
here. She asked siva to have darshan of His dance and He danced   
and she sang for His dance. This event took in the place of THRUVALAGADU. I  
think this is the rathna sabha. She asked the boon that she should   
always hear His CHALLAGAI OLI. So she sits very close to His feet which was  
raised. Sometimes people add so many things when they give upannasam.   
I have not have the original periya puranam. I want to know whether this story  
goes like above said. Your comment is highly appreciated.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
You are correct in a way. Periya Puranam does not give   
more details about the dance she witnessed at Tiru Alangadu,   
which is of course, the Ratna Sabha, the Court Hall of Ruby.   
But Karaikal Amma has sung a few songs which find place   
in Book XI of 12 Books of Saiva Canon. There she says   
in one decad titled Tiru Alangadu Mootha Tirupathigam,   
the Elder Decad of Tiru Alangadu, that she is hearing the   
sound of Siva's anklets, she is seeing His third eye, she   
is seeing the serpants on his body, the Ganga roaring on   
his matted locks, the crescent moon, which is afraid of the   
serpents, the laughing skulls of many a crore of Brahmas   
on his shoulder and on his palm. These are all mystic visions.   
People with faith believe them, that is all. Saiva Siddhantam   
says that after every 100 Brahmas die, one Vishnu dies. Like   
that several crores of Brahmas and several lakhs of Vishnus   
have met with death. But Siva is beginningless and endless.   
Manikkavachagar also says this in Tiruvachakam. Sri Sankara   
says in Sri Soundarya Lahari: "When Brahma, Indra and Vishnu and all devas  
close their eyes one by one and die, You {Lalita}   
are playing with Siva in the garden of Kailas!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you very much for the clarification. We say Thennadudaiya sivane potri.  
Ennatavarkkum erraiva potri. Why Siva likes the south very much. He did   
64 leelas. In North people know about Ram leela and krishna leela and devi  
also to some extent. But here in south, Lord has done lots of leelas, gave  
darshan   
Tamil literature says Siva and Murgan liked tamil songs to be sung by their  
devotees. To listen tamil songs, He plays some drama in this world. Siva wrote  
wrong tamil song for Dharumi to get golden coins from Pandian king. I want to  
know why Siva played so many plays in south only. As because Madurai Meenakshi  
wanted Him to come down to Madurai from kailas. He became the Mappilai of  
Tamil Nadu. So He got authority to play,   
Anyway Periya puranam is wonderful epic. which moved Bhagavan. People here  
say, they love Tamil but they do not believe God. But Tamil is based on God  
only. Tamil and God cannot be separated. It is my view.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Siva's Abode is Kailas. Arunachala is Siva-swarupa.   
Siva did a lot of holy sports in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Kings   
were all Saivites, excepting for some trespassing into   
Jainism by Pandyas. Tamil = Sivam = Love. Meenakshi   
was Madurai princess and she married Siva. Kamakshi   
is Lalita Tripura Sundari and she came to Kanchipuram to   
do penance and then married Siva, once again after her   
sin of going to Daksha's yajna for which Siva was not   
called. Not satisfied with marriage, she wanted half   
the body of Siva which was conferred in Arunachala.   
That is why Siva is ArdhaNari. There are five temples for   
Siva representing five elements of nature. Since Rama   
and Krishna were born in Ayodhya and Gokula, they   
are more popular there. Siva belongs to the entire universe.   
Muruga is of course, an original Tamil God. Muruga worship   
is very rare in North India.   
Arunachala Siva.

A very popular example which everyone would have come across.   
Take different brands in Chocolates - Cadburys, Nestle, Amul, Ravalgon,  
Parrys, etc... (Various Gods)   
The Sweetness remains the same in all the brands. Seek for the sweetness and  
not the Brands (Various Gods).   
All Brands Give same sweetness. For Some like Cadburys, some Amul, etc... but  
they derive same ecstasy as what other would get from a different brand.   
Seek the sweetness in and not the God.   
So when we see Rama, we should just not see the figure. see that which you  
will find even in Krishna and Shiva, Murugan, Devi, Aiyappa, Ramana,  
Ramakrishna, etc...   
When you begin to see what it is, you will discover that it is LOVE.   
 **The Truth is God is a very poor man, He can only Give us LOVE alone, he  
cannot give anything else for he does not have anything to give. If you ask  
for LOVE he will give you in Abundance and then by this our life will begin to  
brim with happiness.

I was contemplating on this Spider and the Bumble Bee... Suppose our near and  
dear one is trapped in a Lion's Den and is stuck, unable to pull out the  
stone, would we simply let it be as it is? will we let even our near and dear  
one also be food for the lion! This will be the real test for us!

Nagaraj.. The thing with all these ethical choices is that you can speculate  
all you like   
but when confronted with the real situation you will do something or you won't  
.   
and some would say your choice is actually an illusion because it was  
inevetable according   
to your natural tendencies.

True. That's why it is said you cannot remember God at the time of your death  
unless you have remembered him constantly and established a relationship with  
him throughout your life. But most of us tend to postpone this till our ripe  
old age when we can do nothing and spend all our good times playing with the  
world.

Dear skyperson & mmohan,   
Yes. What mmohan says is correct. Our choices vary   
according to our circumstances. But Prarabdha is god's   
scheme of things. This can never be changed. At best,   
according to Saiva Siddhantis, Praradha can be thinned   
by God. When you have to lose your head, you lose only   
your headgear. Bhagavan Ramana also said Destiny decides   
everything. You can at best pray. Or be a Jnani and take   
it without any pain on your body-mind complex. I was   
wondering about this incident some years back. Once   
a group of devotees, who went to Sabarimala for darshan,   
after 48 days of penance, had a darshan and when they   
were returning to their hometown, their van met with an   
accident and everyone died. How did it happen? Why   
did it happen? These questions have no answers. At   
best it could be "our various theories".   
Arunachala Siva.

Probably destiny might have decided to hasten their (the Sabarimala pilgrimage  
victims) Prarabdha and finish off their backlog once for all and given them  
moksha or release from this cycle of birth and death. Or probably a better  
next birth more conducive for sadhana. Who knows?   
This brings another question I wanted to ask. I have heard some jnanis and  
speakers say that once you are on the spiritual path, at some stage, destiny  
takes over and to speeden up things might cause havoc with our lives in order  
to deepen our Vairagya to the world and release our backlog of karma (this is  
generally said of Siva devotees as Siva is considered the destroyer). I wonder  
how far this is true. Sure, most of us need shocks every now and then to come  
back to the path and progress, but is it a must? Sounds scary as our perceived  
world and luxuries might crumble any minute. Might be the reason why many  
perfer to stay at a safe distance from the path and progress as slow as  
possible (like treading unchartered waters) !!!

Yes. Destiny takes its own course. Bhagavan Ramana had   
the death experience, around mid-July 1896, and He   
could not stay in that state for long. Six weeks went with   
immense pains. Everyday, He went to Meenakshi Temple and cried before 63  
Saints, how long, how long? Destiny fixed it   
as end August 1896. The money came to Him, and He had   
to utter a lie. He left Madurai and reached Tiruvannamalai   
on 1st September 1896. He went inside the Arunachaleswarar   
Temple; It was around 10.45 AM. There were none [!] inside   
the Temple. He went to Arunachala [linga], and embraced   
him. He found an all-engulfing Light. He said: "O Father! I have reported  
as per Your command!" Arunachala took care of Him for 54 years!   
Then, think of His departure! How can He depart? The body   
had to go through a little of prarabdha. He took upon Himself,   
a terrific disease, for which no medicine was available. Devotees tried four  
surgeries on Him. He had to find an excuse for departure! He left as a  
glorious light. One sentence,   
we should all remember. He had said: "Where can I go?   
I am here!" Only His body disappeared. He is very much   
with us, once you repose faith in Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

My reaction to the original post was that I would help to save the bee.   
While out walking with the dog this morning there was young thrush walking  
near by. It didnÂt fly away, I wandered whether it was injured. So I waited  
and watched, it hopped over to the longer grass and started pecking, the next  
second it had something in its beak. There was a worm struggling to get free,  
trying to get back into the ground. In this instance I didnÂt do anything. A  
thought went through my mind that I couldnÂt help every living creature. I  
carried on with the walk not knowing whether the thrush needed help or whether  
the worm wriggled free.

Dear Paul,   
Well thats all is in our hands, just watch. What else can we do? The one that  
had the thought of whether to save it or leave it or the thought of no being  
able to help all creatures is the Ego's. The Consciousness is least affected  
by all these.   
That which gets affected is only the Ego because its agenda of saving it, not  
saving it, not being able to do anything is affected.

Dear Nagaraj, it is very difficult to watch without all sorts of thoughts and  
emotions getting in the way. Even if one sets out to practise Self-enquiry the  
ego rears its head and starts an internal conversation about Self-enquiry,  
which is no good at all. When this happens sometimes I pray to God that he  
will help me to surrender. ThatÂs all I can do and trust it will happen in its  
own time.

Dear Paul,   
Yes surender is the way. In the world every being is created   
and one becomes the food of others. Even human beings   
who are vegetarians have to kill the plants to eat food. A   
fly is eaten by a lizard, a cow by tiger, a tiger by a man etc.,   
This chain continues ever and for ever. We can at best help   
the suffering beings to the extent possible. Suppose we   
save a deer from tiger, the tiger would look at us and ask: Who are you to prevent my food? We have no answer.   
Surrender to God or Guru is the best way. All things   
are done by one Parameswara Sakti. Our job is to stay   
away from thinking that I shall do this or do that.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was contemplating on this Spider and the Bumble Bee... Suppose our near and  
dear one is trapped in a Lion's Den and is stuck, unable to pull out the  
stone, would we simply let it be as it is? will we let even our near and dear  
one also be food for the lion! This will be the real test for us!

Nagaraj.. The thing with all these ethical choices is that you can speculate  
all you like   
but when confronted with the real situation you will do something or you won't  
.   
and some would say your choice is actually an illusion because it was  
inevetable according   
to your natural tendencies.

True. That's why it is said you cannot remember God at the time of your death  
unless you have remembered him constantly and established a relationship with  
him throughout your life. But most of us tend to postpone this till our ripe  
old age when we can do nothing and spend all our good times playing with the  
world.

Dear skyperson & mmohan,   
Yes. What mmohan says is correct. Our choices vary   
according to our circumstances. But Prarabdha is god's   
scheme of things. This can never be changed. At best,   
according to Saiva Siddhantis, Praradha can be thinned   
by God. When you have to lose your head, you lose only   
your headgear. Bhagavan Ramana also said Destiny decides   
everything. You can at best pray. Or be a Jnani and take   
it without any pain on your body-mind complex. I was   
wondering about this incident some years back. Once   
a group of devotees, who went to Sabarimala for darshan,   
after 48 days of penance, had a darshan and when they   
were returning to their hometown, their van met with an   
accident and everyone died. How did it happen? Why   
did it happen? These questions have no answers. At   
best it could be "our various theories".   
Arunachala Siva.

Probably destiny might have decided to hasten their (the Sabarimala pilgrimage  
victims) Prarabdha and finish off their backlog once for all and given them  
moksha or release from this cycle of birth and death. Or probably a better  
next birth more conducive for sadhana. Who knows?   
This brings another question I wanted to ask. I have heard some jnanis and  
speakers say that once you are on the spiritual path, at some stage, destiny  
takes over and to speeden up things might cause havoc with our lives in order  
to deepen our Vairagya to the world and release our backlog of karma (this is  
generally said of Siva devotees as Siva is considered the destroyer). I wonder  
how far this is true. Sure, most of us need shocks every now and then to come  
back to the path and progress, but is it a must? Sounds scary as our perceived  
world and luxuries might crumble any minute. Might be the reason why many  
perfer to stay at a safe distance from the path and progress as slow as  
possible (like treading unchartered waters) !!!

Yes. Destiny takes its own course. Bhagavan Ramana had   
the death experience, around mid-July 1896, and He   
could not stay in that state for long. Six weeks went with   
immense pains. Everyday, He went to Meenakshi Temple and cried before 63  
Saints, how long, how long? Destiny fixed it   
as end August 1896. The money came to Him, and He had   
to utter a lie. He left Madurai and reached Tiruvannamalai   
on 1st September 1896. He went inside the Arunachaleswarar   
Temple; It was around 10.45 AM. There were none [!] inside   
the Temple. He went to Arunachala [linga], and embraced   
him. He found an all-engulfing Light. He said: "O Father! I have reported  
as per Your command!" Arunachala took care of Him for 54 years!   
Then, think of His departure! How can He depart? The body   
had to go through a little of prarabdha. He took upon Himself,   
a terrific disease, for which no medicine was available. Devotees tried four  
surgeries on Him. He had to find an excuse for departure! He left as a  
glorious light. One sentence,   
we should all remember. He had said: "Where can I go?   
I am here!" Only His body disappeared. He is very much   
with us, once you repose faith in Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

My reaction to the original post was that I would help to save the bee.   
While out walking with the dog this morning there was young thrush walking  
near by. It didnÂt fly away, I wandered whether it was injured. So I waited  
and watched, it hopped over to the longer grass and started pecking, the next  
second it had something in its beak. There was a worm struggling to get free,  
trying to get back into the ground. In this instance I didnÂt do anything. A  
thought went through my mind that I couldnÂt help every living creature. I  
carried on with the walk not knowing whether the thrush needed help or whether  
the worm wriggled free.

Dear Paul,   
Well thats all is in our hands, just watch. What else can we do? The one that  
had the thought of whether to save it or leave it or the thought of no being  
able to help all creatures is the Ego's. The Consciousness is least affected  
by all these.   
That which gets affected is only the Ego because its agenda of saving it, not  
saving it, not being able to do anything is affected.   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj, it is very difficult to watch without all sorts of thoughts and  
emotions getting in the way. Even if one sets out to practise Self-enquiry the  
ego rears its head and starts an internal conversation about Self-enquiry,  
which is no good at all. When this happens sometimes I pray to God that he  
will help me to surrender. ThatÂs all I can do and trust it will happen in its  
own time.   
Paul.

Dear Paul,   
Yes surender is the way. In the world every being is created   
and one becomes the food of others. Even human beings   
who are vegetarians have to kill the plants to eat food. A   
fly is eaten by a lizard, a cow by tiger, a tiger by a man etc.,   
This chain continues ever and for ever. We can at best help   
the suffering beings to the extent possible. Suppose we   
save a deer from tiger, the tiger would look at us and ask: Who are you to prevent my food? We have no answer.   
Surrender to God or Guru is the best way. All things   
are done by one Parameswara Sakti. Our job is to stay   
away from thinking that I shall do this or do that.   
Arunachala Siva.
