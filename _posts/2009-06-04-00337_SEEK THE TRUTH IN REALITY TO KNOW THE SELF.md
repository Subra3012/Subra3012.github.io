## After realisation....

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
There are lots and lots of poems written by saints, who have realised souls.  
Sometimes they say, every thing is brahma and there is only one soul.   
And they say, there is no difference in between atma and paramathma. But same  
saints sing about paramathma as if He is separated from them.   
Here it looks like they are singing about themselves. Is not it? For me I  
always feel He is separated from me and I have to feel within me (even though  
it is not correct according to the scriptures and Bhagavan.) But they were  
realised souls.   
Your comments please

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Why should saints like Manikkavachagar, Jnaneswar and   
Bhagavan Ramana were all already self-realized. They were   
ever in Bliss of the Self. All the poems they sang and all   
the verses they composed, at dual level, were for the   
sake of others. Why should Manikkavachagar sing: "I   
am not telling your names, I am not plucking flowers and   
making garlands, I am not offering you Prasadam..."   
Why should he do? He was Siva Himself. But it is for the   
sake of people like us. Jnanadeswar sang thousands of   
abhangams. It is all for us. Bhagavan Ramana sings in   
Akshara Mana Malai: "Let me not wither like creeper,   
without your support! Please be my support!" All these are for us. They have  
no need to pray at all. They have sung for the welfare of others who trust  
God, and want to pray to him. Sankara has also composed many such wonderful  
poems.   
One Azhwar says: "I do not want even Vaikuntam. Let   
me a stone slab in your sanctoum sanctorum and be looking   
your coral like lips" This is towards Venkatesa of Tirupathi.   
All their crying, shedding tears, melting are only for us.   
Arunachala Siva.

It only appears in our eyes, that they are singing about themselves for we are  
still unrealised. But for a Jnani, it will be nothing at all. He is always in  
blissful inaction. Only for us, who are still unrealised itseems like this. It  
is said in scriptures, that once realised, a jnani will remain like an  
ordinary person but he will be in supreme bliss but we are in the world of  
thoughts and they are thoughtless.   
Sri Ramana

I just modified my front page. Took out a few things. Ive notice this in the  
past as well. I have my default photo and the top menu as well as the main  
menu on the left side. However my main article info doesnt start until below  
the main page and log in info. For some reason my page is being pushed down  
below that. Is the main menu and the log in section causing the problem some  
how? How do I tell?   
Thank you,

Dear Sankar, I agree with you. As aids to self-realization, I   
am looking deeply into the words of Who am I? and see how   
many steps that Bhagavan has prescribed, we are able to follow.   
For example, He says, that both likes and dislikes should be   
eschewed. This is extremely difficult. If the autorickshaw driver   
demands five rupees more than the actual fare, we yell at him.   
This five rupees may give him happiness and he likes it, but since   
it is dislike for us, we do not like it. There are various such prescriptions   
from Bhagavan in Who am I?. I shall write separately about each   
step, at a later date.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Seeking the Truth itself is seeking the Reality.   
It is Aboslute-Knowledge-Bliss. But as steps towards this, we   
have to do many things as mentioned in Who am I?   
1\. Eschew hate and love, both.   
2\. Everything is governed by a Parameswara Sakti. Abide   
in it, without thinking always, that, I will do this or I will do that.   
3\. Trust in Guru. Once you trust in Guru, he will take care of   
everything and once one surrenders to Guru, you will be consumed   
by him, like a fawn in tiger's jaw and saved!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, yes either total surrender or self enquiry is necessary.   
But this is quite difficult. It is like an ant walking on the rock   
continuously to see that the rock disappears.

Dear Sankar, surrender and "the surrendered" are there only during   
the practise or " sadhana". At the end of the road, there is neither   
surrender or'surrendered. There is only One without a second.
