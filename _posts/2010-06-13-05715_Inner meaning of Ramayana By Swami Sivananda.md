Him.   
Q: Why did the All-merciful God create pain in this world?   
A: Pain is the only blessing in this world. It is an eye-opener. Man would  
never attempt to attain salvation if there had not been any pain in this  
world.   
Q: How can I know whether I have purity of mind or not?   
A: If you have Vairagya (dispassion or indifference to sensual enjoyments),  
that is a sign of Chitta Suddhi or purity of mind. No sensual desires or  
Vasanas will arise in the mind.   
Q: What is the purpose of God creating the world?   
A: This is a transcendental question or Atiprasna. You will know the purpose  
when you attain Self-realisation or Brahma Jnana. The finite mind that is  
conditioned in time, space and causation cannot get an answer to a question  
that relates to transcendental matters.   
Q: What is the use of repeating the Mantra again and again?   
A: It gives force. It intensifies the spiritual Samskaras.   
Q: When I concentrate, so many thoughts arise in my mind. How can I avoid  
them? Can I suppress them?   
A: Do not try to suppress them with force. The thoughts will manifest with  
redoubled force. They will rise up frequently also. You will tax your will and  
waste your energy. Be a silent witness of these thoughts. Say unto yourself: "I have no concern with these thoughts." Be indifferent. All useless worldly  
thoughts will die by themselves.   
Q: How to prevent bad dreams?   
A: Study any religious book. Meditate for half an hour just before retiring to  
bed. You will have no bad dreams.   
Q: What are the signs of a person who has no Ahamkara or egoism?   
A: He will not identify himself with his body. He will be free from pride,  
likes, dislikes, jealousy, anger and hypocrisy.   
Q: Why does evil exist in the world?   
A: Change the angle of vision or Drishti. All evils will disappear. Evil is  
negative good. Evil exists to glorify good. It has a raison d'etre, reason for  
its existence. Evil and good are relative terms. What is good at one time is  
evil at another time. What is good for one is evil for another. Understand  
this and become wise. Behold the one Atman in all forms and beings. Evil and  
good are mental creations. Transmute evil into good by Atma-Drishti. There is  
good in evil also.   
Q: How to lead the life of unity?   
A: This is attained by service, charity, sharing what you have with others,  
cultivating cosmic love and realising the one Atman seated in the hearts of  
all, through constant Brahmachintana or meditation on Atman.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says a true disciple should follow these four conditions  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 12, 2010, 08:35:57 AM  
---  
**Discipleship (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900)   
Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses  
The first condition is that the student who wants to know the truth must  
**give up all desires for gain in this world or in the life to come**.   
The **second condition is that the disciple must be able to control the  
internal and the external senses** and must be established in several other  
spiritual virtues.   
 **The next qualification is that the disciple must have faith in the Guru  
(teacher).** In the West the teacher simply gives intellectual knowledge; that  
is all. The relationship with the teacher is the greatest in life. My dearest  
and nearest relative in life is my Guru; next, my mother; then my father. My  
first reverence is to the Guru. If my father says, "Do this", and my Guru  
says, "Do not do this", I do not do it. The Guru frees my soul. The father and  
mother give me this body; but the Guru gives me rebirth in the soul.   
Some years ago one of your Christian teachers, a friend of mine, said, "You  
believe in Christ?" "Yes," I answered, "but perhaps with a little more  
reverence." "Then why don't you be baptised?" How could I be baptised? By  
whom? Where is the man who can give true baptism? What is baptism? Is it  
sprinkling some water over you, or dipping you in water, while muttering  
formulas?   
Baptism is the direct introduction into the life of the spirit. If you receive  
the real baptism, you know you are not the body but the spirit. Give me that  
baptism if you can. If not, you are not Christians. Even after the so - called  
baptism which you received, you have remained the same. What is the sense of  
merely saying you have been baptised in the name of the Christ? Mere talk,  
talk -- ever disturbing the world with your foolishness! "Ever steeped in the  
darkness of ignorance, yet considering themselves wise and learned, the fools  
go round and round, staggering to and fro like the blind led by the blind."  
Therefore do not say you are Christians, do not brag about baptism and things  
of that sort.   
We are like moths plunging into the flaming fire, knowing that it will burn  
us, knowing that the senses only burn us, that they only enhance desire.  
"Desire is never satiated by enjoyment; enjoyment only increases desire as  
butter fed into fire increases the fire." **Desire is increased by desire.  
Knowing all this, people still plunge into it all the time. Life after life  
they have been going after the objects of desire, suffering extremely in  
consequence, yet they cannot give up desire.** Even religion, which should  
rescue them from this terrible bondage of desire, they have made a means of  
satisfying desire. **Rarely do they ask God to free them from bondage to the  
body and senses, from slavery to desires. Instead, they pray to Him for health  
and prosperity, for long life: "O God, cure my headache, give me some money or  
something!"**   
 **The fourth and last condition of discipleship is the discrimination of the  
real from the unreal.** There is only one thing that is real -- god. **All the  
time the mind must be drawn to Him, dedicated to Him. God exists, nothing else  
exists, everything else comes and goes.** Any desire for the world is  
illusion, because the world is unreal. More and more the mind must become  
conscious of God alone, until everything else appears as it really is --  
unreal.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about are Christ and Buddha Identical?

**Notes Of Class Talks   
Volume 8, Notes Of Class Talks And Lectures**   
It is my particular fancy that the same Buddha became Christ. Buddha  
prophesied, "I will come again in five hundred years", and Christ came here in  
five hundred years. These are the two Lights of the whole human nature. Two  
men have been produced, Buddha and Christ; these are the two giants, huge  
gigantic personalities, two Gods. Between them they divide the whole world.  
Wherever there is the least knowledge in the world, people bow down either to  
Buddha or Christ.   
It would be very hard to produce more like them, but I hope there will be.  
Mohammed came five hundred years after, five hundred years after came Luther  
with his Protestant wave, and this is five hundred years after that again. It  
is a great thing in a few thousand years to produce two such men as Jesus and  
Buddha. Are not two such enough? Christ and Buddha were Gods, the others were  
prophets. Study the life of these two and see the manifestation of power in  
them -- calm and non - resisting, poor beggars owning nothing, without a cent  
in their pockets, despised all their lives, called heretic and fool -- and  
think of the immense spiritual power they have wielded over humanity.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says we need to possess 3 things if we wish to be a reformer  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:27:51 AM  
---  
If you wish to be a true reformer, you must possess three things.   
**The first is to feel. Do you really feel for your brothers? Do you really  
feel that there is so much misery in the world, so much ignorance and  
superstition?** Do you really feel that all men are your brothers? Does this  
idea permeate your whole being? Does it run in your blood? Does it tingle in  
your veins? Does it course through every nerve and filament of your body? Are  
you full of that idea of sympathy? If you are, that is only the first step.   
**Next you must ask yourself if you have found any remedy.** The old ideas may  
be all superstition, but in and around these masses of superstition are  
nuggets of truth. Have you discovered means by which to keep that truth alone,  
without any of the dross? If you have done that, that is only the second step;   
**one more thing is necessary. What is your motive? Are you sure that you are  
not actuated by greed for gold, by thirst for fame or power? Are you really  
sure that you can stand for your ideals and work on, even if the whole world  
wants to crush you down?** Are you sure that you know what you want and will  
perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are you sure  
that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is one  
pulsation left in the heart?   
Then you are a real reformer, you are a teacher, a master, a blessing to  
mankind.   
But man is so impatient, so shortsighted! He has not the patience to wait, he  
has not the power to see. He wants to rule, he wants results immediately. Why?  
He wants to reap the fruits himself and does not really care for others.  
**Duty for dutys sake is not what he wants. To work you have the right, but  
not to the fruits thereof, says Krishna. Why cling to results? Ours is to do  
our duties. Let the fruits take care of themselves.** But man has no patience;  
he takes up any scheme that will produce quick results; and the majority of  
reformers all over the world can be classed under this heading.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about Laws Of Life And Death  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 12, 2010, 08:40:53 AM  
---  
**The Laws Of Life And Death (Report of a lecture delivered in Oakland on  
March 7, 1900, with editorial comments of the Oakland Tribune)   
Volume 8, Notes Of Class Talks And Lectures  
Life can only spring from life, thought from thought, matter from matter. A  
universe cannot be created out of matter. It has existed for ever. **If human  
beings came into the world fresh from the hands of nature, they would come  
without impressions; but we do not come in that way, which shows that we are  
not created afresh.** If human souls are created out of nothing, what is to  
prevent them from going back into nothing? If we are to live all the time in  
the future, we must have lived all the time in the past.   
It is the belief of the Hindu that the soul is neither mind nor body. **What  
is it which remains stable -- which can say, "I am I"? Not the body, for it is  
always changing; and not the mind, which changes more rapidly than the body,  
which never has the same thoughts for even a few minutes.** There must be an  
identity which does not change -- something which is to man what the banks are  
to the river -- the banks which do not change and without whose immobility we  
would not be conscious of the constantly moving stream. Behind the body,  
behind the mind, there must be something, viz the soul, which unifies the man.  
Mind is merely the fine instrument through which the soul -- the master --  
acts on the body. In India we say a man has given up his body, while you say,  
a man gives up his ghost. The Hindus believe that a man is a soul and has a  
body, while Western people believe he is a body and possesses a soul.   
Death overtakes everything which is complex. The soul is a single element, not  
composed of anything else, and therefore it cannot die. By its very nature the  
soul must be immortal. **Body, mind, and soul turn upon the wheel of law --  
none can escape.** No more can we transcend the law than can the stars, than  
can the sun -- it is all a universe of law. The law of Karma is that every  
action must be followed sooner or later by an effect. Action can never die  
without producing action. **Now, if our acts can only produce their  
appropriate effects on this plane of existence, it follows that we must all  
come back to round out the circle of causes and effects. This is the doctrine  
of reincarnation.** We are the slaves of law, the slaves of conduct, the  
slaves of thirst, the slaves of desire, the slaves of a thousand things. Only  
by escaping from life can we escape from slavery to freedom. **God is the only  
one who is free. God and freedom are one and the same.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Significance of Aarati - The Ritual Lamp  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:06:31 AM  
---  
It has a deep philosophical and ritualistic significance.   
**The flame in the Aarti represents the soul of the devotee, which is offered  
to the deity.** To forget the self in the sacred invocation of heavenly  
power,to be one with it, is the quintessence of Aarati as of bhakti. ..Waving  
of the light before the deity is a ritual known as Aarati,which is done  
towards the close of the worship sequences. Either camphor (karpura) or a set  
of three, five or seven wicks dipped in ghee or oil is used.   
The light containers may be in the form of a serpent (Naga deepa), chariot  
(Ragha deepa), elephant (Gaja deepa),Nandi (Bull deepa), and so on. The first  
round of waving must be from the head of the deity to th feet, the second from  
the face to the knees, and the third from the neck to the loins.   
**(Condensed from Tattavaloka, Dec. 2008) - - (Taken from Sri Ramana Jyoti,  
February 2009)**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Secret of Eternal Youth By Param Pujya Sant Shri Asaramji Bapu  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 05:09:22 AM  
---  
First of all, let us understand the meaning of Brahmacharya.   
'Yajnavalkya Samhita' states: "Brahmacharya is abstaining from all kinds of Maithuna or sexual enjoyment  
forever, in all places and in all conditions- physically, mentally and  
verbally."   
The great sage Vyasa said: 'To abandon the pleasure gained through the sexual organs by restraint is  
defined as celibacy."   
Lord Siva said to Goddess Parvati,   
"O Parvati! What is there on this earth which cannot be accomplished if one  
has control over his sexual fluid?" That is, all powers reside at the divine  
feet of the Enlightened Urdhvareta (one who is able to sublimate his sexual  
energy through the practice of yoga). In fact, Siddhis (divine powers) become  
his facile servants. Such a Sadhaka can attain Self-Realisation within a short  
span of time. Even the gods (deities) have attained immortality through  
Brahmacharya".   
"The gods have conquered death by Brahmacharya and penance. Indra, the King of  
gods, has attained a still higher status, through the self-discipline of  
Brahmacharya." (Atharva veda: 1. 5. 19)   
 **Preservation of semen gives life**   
Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as the  
buttermilk is thinned after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned  
by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen, the more the body deteriorates  
and weakens. **The preservation of semen is the secret of good health and  
longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and  
spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of Brahmacharya will tide over  
a crisis of any disease very easily.** One who follows Brahmacharya strictly  
is usually not afflicted by any disease. That is why, in scriptures, it is  
said: "Death is hastened by letting out semen from the body. Life is saved and  
prolonged by preserving it. Semen is the real vitality in men. It is the  
hidden treasure in man."   
"There is no doubt that people die prematurely by letting the semen out of the  
body; knowing this, the Yogi should always preserve semen and lead a life of  
strict celibacy." \- Siva Samhita   
 **How is semen formed?   
According to Ayurveda, from the digested food chyle is formed. Out of chyle  
comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat  
comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. Conversion of  
Dhatu at every step takes a period of five days. Thus semen is the last Dhatu  
that is formed out of food. It takes approximately 30 days and 4 hours to  
complete this cycle. Scientists believe that an intake of 32 kgs. Of food  
produces 800 Gms. of blood, which in turn forms only 20 Gms. of semen. Now,  
you can see how precious the semen is!**   
If a man leads a life of celibacy even in householder's life and has  
copulation for the sake of progeny only, he can bring forth healthy,  
intelligent, strong, beautiful and self-sacrificing children. Higher forms of  
animals do have the sex impulse, but it becomes active only during the mating  
season; and thus they maintain health. Man, with his boasted intellect, has to  
learn lessons from birds and animals. Even animals have more self-control than  
men. It is only the so-called man who has degraded himself much by indulgence.  
At the heat of sexual excitement, he repeats the same ignoble act again and  
again. Man only violates the laws of nature and consequently suffers from  
innumerable diseases. He has degenerated to a level far lower than that of  
animals in this respect.   
Lack of self-control gives rise to diseases. **The western world has suffered  
moral and ethical degradation by following the Freudian psychology. It is  
clearly observed in statistical data. Population of India is three times that  
of U.S.A. Yet, consumption of drugs in U.S.A. is 10 times that in India. In  
New York City, a ten-year study, Mental Health in metropolis, claimed that  
approximately 80 per cent of adults showed some symptoms of Mental illness,  
with one in four actually impaired.**   
(Srole, Leo, Langer, Thomas, et al, Mental health in Metropolis, The midtown  
Manhatton Study.)   
Freudian psychoanalysts failed to give any solution to the problem of  
suppressing desires. So the people alarmed of getting mental disorders,  
continued to satisfy their desires even by illegal means. This in turn  
increased the incidence of crimes.   
On an average one case of rape is recorded per six seconds and about 2 million  
cases of pre-marietal pregnancy are recorded every year in U.S.A. Teenage  
pregnancy is a burning problem of U.S.A. Pre-marital sex is common in U.S.  
because they advocate free sex. As a result of that they compare the sexual  
gratification after marriage with the previous pre-marital experiences and  
when they find it less, they ask for divorce.   
About 65% of marriages result in divorce. As they have violated the nature's  
law of self-control, they suffer from sexually transmitted diseases. The most  
horrible is AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), which is spreading  
like an epidemic. The family life is disturbed by internal conflicts,  
dissatisfaction and rage. The social life is full of chaos, terror, insecurity  
and arrogance. This is not caused by poverty or lack of materials.   
**The U.S. has 4 % of the world 's population. They have made provisions for  
40 % of the global material productions (like cars, TVs etc.). Yet the  
criminal tendency is so high that one case of burglary is recorded per ten  
seconds. There are 425 prisoners per one lakh population whereas there are  
only 23 prisoners per one lakh population in Indian jails. In U.S.A. 14  
million cases of crime were recorded by the police department during the year  
1992. This is because the people under the influence of Freudian psychology  
try to satisfy all desires (not only sexual). The social life is degraded.  
Unchecked criminal tendencies lead to chaos, terror and insecurity.**   
 _In the present-day world, unfortunately, many people read pornographic  
literature, view sexy films on television and in theatres, view blue films in  
privacy, as a result we see all around us, the number of physical, mental and  
moral wrecks increasing every day._ Many a times such people indulge in  
unnatural sex. Masturbation or homosexual tendency lead them to wastage of  
seminal energy many times a weak. They may discharge seminal energy in bad  
dreams or wet dreams. Due to excessive loss of semen, enlargement of testes  
and sometimes pain in the testes develops. The evil after-effects that follow  
the loss of seminal energy are dangerous. Persons are physically, mentally and  
morally debilitated.   
The body and the mind refuse to work energetically, because the semen is not  
used up in the body to form Ojas that give vibrant health, strong will power  
and sound mind. Later on, such people develop impotency for the testices  
cannot produce semen with normal sperm count. Life for him loses all zest,  
zeal and charm. He becomes a victim of a number of diseases like anaemia, loss  
of memory, gloominess, palpitation of heart, pain in the back, loins, head and  
joints, weak kidneys, fickle mindedness, enlargement of testes, pain in the  
testes, debility, nervous breakdown, restlessness of mind, lack of thinking  
power, etc. He goes through hellish suffering. The scripture declares  
emphatically,   
'Atharva Veda' declares: "I have abandoned the lust that wastes my seminal energy. I throw away those  
sexual desires forever as they destroy my strength, intelligence and health. I  
will never become a victim of sexual desires' "   
But what happens to one who does not lead the life of celibacy. 'Atharva Veda'  
says,   
"The lust is the cause of diseases, dire diseases. It is the cause of death,  
fatal death. It makes one walk with tottering steps. It causes mental debility  
and retardation. It destroys health, vitality and physical well being. It  
burns all the Dhaatus (viz.chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen).  
It pollutes the purity of mind."   
Alcoholic drinks (liquor), tobacco (chewing), cigarettes stimulate passion.   
In Quran Sherifs Allaah Pak Trikol Roshal's Sipard, it is written:"O  
believers, this wine and gambling, and these arrows you use for divination,  
are all acts of Satan, so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.   
 **Ramakrishna Param Hamsa said, "Whenever you see a beautiful woman, and if  
evil thoughts crop up in your mind, visualise the 'World Mother' (Jagadamba)  
in her. She is a manifestation of 'World Mother'. That is why she is so  
beautiful. She is Divine mother blessing me with her Darshana. Entertain this  
Bhava (attitude), evil thoughts will die.**   
When Governor of Kalyana, Bahlol Khan was defeated by Major General of  
Shivaji's army, the latter presented a beautiful Begum to Shivaji. Strict  
celibate Shivaji looked at her with reverence, and said, "If I have to become  
beautiful, I will take birth through your womb, mother." Saying this he  
scolded his Major and ordered him to send her with full honour to her husband.  
**Shivaji was a strict celibate because he was a disciple of a mighty saint  
Samartha Ramadasa.**   
For protecting the semen, it is essential to wear always a strip of cloth  
(Langoti or Kaupin or loin cloth) over the private part, for there will be no  
night emission and growth of inflammation or any other disease of the  
testicles. This will help you in keeping up Brahmacharya.   
Immoral songs produce a bad, deep impression in the mind. **Aspirants should  
run away from places where vicious songs, poems, vulgar film songs, pop music  
or disco songs are sung or played on radio, transistor or cassette player.**   
Our great martyrs Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Vir Savarkar were  
inspired by patriotic literature to dedicate and sacrifice their lives for the  
liberation of India. Therefore, the glory of good literature is beyond words.  
There are so many great inspiring spiritual books reflecting the glory of  
Indian civilization viz, 'Yoga-Vagistha Maha Ramayan', 'Shrimad Bhdgavadgita',  
'Upanishads', 'Daas Bodh', 'Vivek Chudamani', 'Sukhmani', publications of Shri  
Ramakrishna mission, books by Swami Ramatirtha, etc etc.   
Make study of such literatures an indispensable part of your daily routine.  
Books that deal with love stories exciting passion and pornographic  
literatures should be either thrown into dustbin or reduced to ashes. You  
should strictly avoid these and give them not to others for reading. Reading  
of spiritual literature is of immense value in observing Brahmacharya.   
**Always read a spiritual book in the morning after taking bath (and before  
going to job) and at night just before retiring to bed. The pure, sublime-  
elevating thoughts of the book will displace the evil (passionate) thoughts of  
your mind and you will not become a victim of sexual thoughts and fantasies.**   
"Semen is brightness, strength and (Self) Atma." -(Satapath brahman).   
 **Grandsire Bhishma and the great Abhimanyu**   
There were two great battles, which took place during the war of Mahabharat.  
One is of grandsire Bhisma and the other of Abhimanyu.   
**Bhisma was a Naisthika Brahmachari, i.e. life long celibate. Therefore he  
was a man of boundless power.** Lord Krishna had taken a vow that during the  
war he would not wield any weapon. However, he was compelled to break his vow  
in the face of the allconquering and irresistible attack that Bhisma mounted  
on the army of Pandavas. Even Arjuna armed with celestial weapons could not  
combat Bhisma's onslaught and Lord Krishna was forced to take up a wheel of a  
chariot to protect Arjuna from the arrows showered by Bhisma. It was through  
the power of Brahmacharya (alone), that Bhisma could conquer death. When he  
was pierced by sharp arrows all over the body, his survival was impossible.  
Yet (god of) death could not snatch his life. **Lying on the bed of arrows, he  
gave wonderful discourses on political, philosophical, religious, social and  
moral subjects to Yudhisthira. Bhisma waited for the beginning of auspicious  
Uttarayana. Then he willingly left his body.   
The second battle was that of a charming and brilliant hero Abhimanyu.  
Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu fought single handed against the terrific strategy of  
Kauravas called Chakravyuha.** Bhima, the chief of Pandava army, was left  
behind. Abhimanyu fought with commendable valour wielding a wheel of a chariot  
all alone amidst great warriors of Kauravas. But in the end he was killed  
because Abhimanyu sowed the seed of Pandava dynasty before proceeding to his  
last battle. He had passed the night before the great battle in the amorous  
company of his wife Uttara. **Due to this act of infringement of Brahmacharya,  
he could not conquer death, unlike grandsire Bhisma.**   
 **An experiment done in U.S.A.**   
A scientific experiment was carried out in an American school of science. 30  
students were given no food for a fixed period of time. It was observed that  
their libido subsided. But when they were given food, libido increased. This  
shows that fasting gives only a temporary benefit in observation of celibacy.   
 **Techniques for Conservation of Seminal Energy**   
Tulsi (Basil) cures many diseases. Moreover, it helps in conservation of  
seminal energy. It improves power of memory. Leaf of Tulsi is an excellent  
herbal medicine. It restores imbalance of wind, bile and phelgm and thereby  
helps in cure of many ailments caused due to their imbalance. It is very  
useful in cases of blood disorders, cough, worm- infestation etc. It is good  
for cardiac disorders also."   
Herbal aid to celibacy: One can make this Ayurvedic Churna, without much cost  
at home. Take dried **Amalas** (goose berries) the fruits of a tree Emblica  
Officinalis and grind them into powder. Ready-made Amala powder is available  
in the market also. Mix two parts of the Amala powder with one part of  
powdered rock-sugar. You may get this ready-made mixture from ashram also.   
Mere thinking of a woman with sexual feelings causes a Sadhaka's downfall.  
Therefore, beware! Try to know the heart of the scriptures and saints and take  
its benefits by following it.   
"These sexual propensities, though they are at first like ripple, acquire the  
proportions of a sea on account of a bad company. **Whenever the mental image  
of a woman crops up in your mind with evil thoughts, repeat mentally "Om  
Durgaa Devyai Namah " and do mental prostrations." \- Swami Vivananda**   
"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live  
coals. From the contact comes sensation, from sensation thirst, from thirst  
clinging, by ceasing from that, the soul is delivered from all sinful  
existence." \- **Lord Buddha**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Significance of Aarati - The Ritual Lamp

It has a deep philosophical and ritualistic significance.   
**The flame in the Aarti represents the soul of the devotee, which is offered  
to the deity.** To forget the self in the sacred invocation of heavenly  
power,to be one with it, is the quintessence of Aarati as of bhakti. ..Waving  
of the light before the deity is a ritual known as Aarati,which is done  
towards the close of the worship sequences. Either camphor (karpura) or a set  
of three, five or seven wicks dipped in ghee or oil is used.   
The light containers may be in the form of a serpent (Naga deepa), chariot  
(Ragha deepa), elephant (Gaja deepa),Nandi (Bull deepa), and so on. The first  
round of waving must be from the head of the deity to th feet, the second from  
the face to the knees, and the third from the neck to the loins.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says we need to possess 3 things if we wish to be a reformer  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:27:51 AM

If you wish to be a true reformer, you must possess three things.   
**The first is to feel. Do you really feel for your brothers? Do you really  
feel that there is so much misery in the world, so much ignorance and  
superstition?** Do you really feel that all men are your brothers? Does this  
idea permeate your whole being? Does it run in your blood? Does it tingle in  
your veins? Does it course through every nerve and filament of your body? Are  
you full of that idea of sympathy? If you are, that is only the first step.   
**Next you must ask yourself if you have found any remedy.** The old ideas may  
be all superstition, but in and around these masses of superstition are  
nuggets of truth. Have you discovered means by which to keep that truth alone,  
without any of the dross? If you have done that, that is only the second step;   
**one more thing is necessary. What is your motive? Are you sure that you are  
not actuated by greed for gold, by thirst for fame or power? Are you really  
sure that you can stand for your ideals and work on, even if the whole world  
wants to crush you down?** Are you sure that you know what you want and will  
perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are you sure  
that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is one  
pulsation left in the heart?   
Then you are a real reformer, you are a teacher, a master, a blessing to  
mankind.   
But man is so impatient, so shortsighted! He has not the patience to wait, he  
has not the power to see. He wants to rule, he wants results immediately. Why?  
He wants to reap the fruits himself and does not really care for others.  
**Duty for dutys sake is not what he wants. To work you have the right, but  
not to the fruits thereof, says Krishna. Why cling to results? Ours is to do  
our duties. Let the fruits take care of themselves.** But man has no patience;  
he takes up any scheme that will produce quick results; and the majority of  
reformers all over the world can be classed under this heading.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ True and Fake Brahmanas as per Hindu Dharmashastras  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:34:51 AM  
---  
The Brahmana was the ideal, perfect individual in the ancient Hindu society  
who served as a role model for others, who was respected and worshipped by all  
other varnas of the society, and who was a repository of all spiritual and  
temporal learning and wisdom.T **he Brahmana was supposed to be devoted only  
to virtues, to spirituality and to teaching and guiding others in his  
community.The true Brahmana was considered the best of all human beings, the  
leader of the society,and a representative of Devas on this earth.** What were  
the attributes of a true Brahmana that made him so respectable and exalted?   
Hindu scriptures list the following characteristics of such a true Brahmana -   
He who befriends all creatures is considered a true Brahmana. -- Manu Smriti  
2.87b   
Devatas consider him alone a Brahmin, who is fearful of quarrels as he would  
be of a snake; **who is afraid of honor as if it were death; and who is afraid  
of (sexual relations with) women (other than his wife),** i.e., is celibate,  
as he would shun a corpse. -- Vaadhûla Smriti, verse 199   
 **I consider such a person alone as a Brahmin, who is of a peaceful  
nature,gentle,who has conquered anger, who has conquered his soul and who has  
conquered his sense organs. All others are but Shûdras.-- Vaadhûla Smriti,  
verse 200**   
 **The body of a Brahmin is not meant for enjoyment of pleasures. It is meant  
to forbear great austerities in this life**, so that infinite bliss (of moksa  
or salvation) may result upon death. -- Vaadhuula Smriti, verse 201   
Purity (external and internal), performance of virtuous deeds, abstaining from  
actions that hurt one's body excessively, absence of ill-will towards  
everyone,absence of hatred, control of senses, charity and compassion  these  
are the characteristics of a Brahmana. -- Atri Samhita 1.33   
 **A Brahmana who studies the Vedanta everyday**, who has abandoned all  
worldly ties and who is knowledgeable in Samkhya and Yoga is called a Twice  
Born.-- Atri Samhita 1.374   
 **Dishonor increase austerity or spiritual splendor (tapa), whereas honor  
destroys austerity.** A Brahmana who gets much honor and worship sinks, just  
like a cow that is milked everyday withers away. -- Apastamba Smriti 10.9   
But just as that same cow becomes strong and healthy by eating grass grown  
with ample water, likewise a Brahmana who performs japa, homa and other  
virtuous deeds progresses greatly (in Dharma and Moksha). -- Apastamba Smriti  
10.10   
The Pseudo-Brahmana   
Needless to say however, every society has phony people who do not live up to  
the standards expected of them, but want to enjoy all the privileges that the  
society grants to them. Hindu scriptures too warn us against such fake  
Brahmanas in very harsh terms as the following quotations will show -   
A Brahmana who sells salt, lacquer, kusumbha, Ghee, sweets, milk and meat is  
called Shudra. -- Atri Samhita 1.377   
A Brahmana who is a thief, a smuggler, giver of harmful advice, harsh tongued  
and is always hankering after fish and meat is called a Nishaada.-- Atri  
Samhita 1.378   
 **A Brahmana who is ignorant of the Vedas and has no knowledge of God but  
goes about arrogantly as a Brahmana sporting his sacred thread is a sinner and  
is called an Animal. -- Atri Samhita 1.379**

Apologizing doesn't mean that   
ur wrong and the other is right..   
It only means that u value the   
relationship more than ur ego...   
If everything is going according   
to ur wish then ur lucky..   
If its not then ur too lucky, coz   
its going according to God's wish...   
Ever noticed ur parents spend the   
first 18 months trying to make u stand   
up and talk...and The next 18 years   
trying to make u sit down n listen..   
Either walk as if u rule the world..   
or Walk as if u don't mind who   
the hell rules the world..   
That's the attitude...   
Rock ur life..   
Silly thing about affection..   
when u get little u want more...   
when u get more u desire   
even more..but when u lose it u   
realize "little" was enough..   
Never design ur character like   
a garden where anyone can walk..   
Design it like a sky where   
everyone aspires to reach..   
One of the best messages for mankind...   
"There is no market for ur sorrows..   
So never advertise ur feelings,..."   
One true fact..   
The world's thinnest book has   
only one word written in it..: "EVERYTHING" and   
The book is titled: "what a human wants??"   
True fact of life: When u need ADVICE everyone   
is ready to HELP u..but   
when u need HELP everyone   
is ready to ADVICE u..   
Never accept others definition   
of life..Its Ur life define it urself...   
We are not human beings having   
spiritual experiences..We are spiritual   
beings having human experiences..   
Two nice thoughts..   
Pray as if everything depends on god..and   
Work as if everything depends on   
u...   
To handle urself use ur head...   
To handle others use ur heart..   
To have good relations with all,   
we should keep our nature like   
a theater screen..It accepts all   
characters but remains   
peacefully white...   
Its just meaningless to expect ur   
partner to be like urself coz   
u cant hold their right hand in ur   
right hand to walk together..think over..   
Confidence never comes if v have   
all the answers, but it comes when v   
r ready for all the questions..   
Be bold to face the world..   
When ur depressed..When ur confused   
When u have been hurt the most..   
Don't ever get carried away...   
rather just get in front of the mirror,   
n there u will find d right person who   
could actually help u get out of this..   
There is always a little truth behind   
every "just kidding"   
A little knowledge behind every "I don't know"   
A little emotion behind "I don't care"   
Two aspects of life: If v become 2 sentimental, its   
2 hard to lead life and   
If v become 2 practical, its 2   
tough to respect relations..   
No one in this world is afraid 2 speak   
the truth..   
They are afraid only about the consequences   
that are to be faced after speaking the truth..   
Truth of life: what is status??   
"Spending money which we don't have to   
buy things which we don't need..   
To impress people whom we don't know..."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ True and Fake Brahmanas as per Hindu Dharmashastras  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:34:51 AM

The Brahmana was the ideal, perfect individual in the ancient Hindu society  
who served as a role model for others, who was respected and worshipped by all  
other varnas of the society, and who was a repository of all spiritual and  
temporal learning and wisdom.T **he Brahmana was supposed to be devoted only  
to virtues, to spirituality and to teaching and guiding others in his  
community.The true Brahmana was considered the best of all human beings, the  
leader of the society,and a representative of Devas on this earth.** What were  
the attributes of a true Brahmana that made him so respectable and exalted?   
Hindu scriptures list the following characteristics of such a true Brahmana -   
He who befriends all creatures is considered a true Brahmana. -- Manu Smriti  
2.87b   
Devatas consider him alone a Brahmin, who is fearful of quarrels as he would  
be of a snake; **who is afraid of honor as if it were death; and who is afraid  
of (sexual relations with) women (other than his wife),** i.e., is celibate,  
as he would shun a corpse. -- Vaadhûla Smriti, verse 199   
 **I consider such a person alone as a Brahmin, who is of a peaceful  
nature,gentle,who has conquered anger, who has conquered his soul and who has  
conquered his sense organs. All others are but Shûdras.-- Vaadhûla Smriti,  
verse 200**   
 **The body of a Brahmin is not meant for enjoyment of pleasures. It is meant  
to forbear great austerities in this life**, so that infinite bliss (of moksa  
or salvation) may result upon death. -- Vaadhuula Smriti, verse 201   
Purity (external and internal), performance of virtuous deeds, abstaining from  
actions that hurt one's body excessively, absence of ill-will towards  
everyone,absence of hatred, control of senses, charity and compassion  these  
are the characteristics of a Brahmana. -- Atri Samhita 1.33   
 **A Brahmana who studies the Vedanta everyday**, who has abandoned all  
worldly ties and who is knowledgeable in Samkhya and Yoga is called a Twice  
Born.-- Atri Samhita 1.374   
 **Dishonor increase austerity or spiritual splendor (tapa), whereas honor  
destroys austerity.** A Brahmana who gets much honor and worship sinks, just  
like a cow that is milked everyday withers away. -- Apastamba Smriti 10.9   
But just as that same cow becomes strong and healthy by eating grass grown  
with ample water, likewise a Brahmana who performs japa, homa and other  
virtuous deeds progresses greatly (in Dharma and Moksha). -- Apastamba Smriti  
10.10   
The Pseudo-Brahmana   
Needless to say however, every society has phony people who do not live up to  
the standards expected of them, but want to enjoy all the privileges that the  
society grants to them. Hindu scriptures too warn us against such fake  
Brahmanas in very harsh terms as the following quotations will show -   
A Brahmana who sells salt, lacquer, kusumbha, Ghee, sweets, milk and meat is  
called Shudra. -- Atri Samhita 1.377   
A Brahmana who is a thief, a smuggler, giver of harmful advice, harsh tongued  
and is always hankering after fish and meat is called a Nishaada.-- Atri  
Samhita 1.378   
 **A Brahmana who is ignorant of the Vedas and has no knowledge of God but  
goes about arrogantly as a Brahmana sporting his sacred thread is a sinner and  
is called an Animal. -- Atri Samhita 1.379**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Inner meaning of Ramayana By Swami Sivananda  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:57:41 AM

For the purpose of bringing out the full philosophy of the Ramayana, one has  
to closely follow the part played by the (1) King Dasaratha (2) Manthara  
the maid servant of Kaikeyi (3). Kaikeyi-- the youngest of the king  
Dasaratha's consorts (4) Ravana the demon king of Lanka (5) Hanuman--Minister  
of the Vanara chief Sugriva (6), Sita the beloved wife of Sri Rama, the prince  
of Ayodhya (7) Lakshmana --brother of Sri Rama and ( Sri Rama --the hero of  
the great epic.   
On the eve of the coronation of Sri Rama as the Crown Prince of Ayodhya, the  
whole scheme was shelved because of the pressure brought on Dasaratha by his  
wife Kaikeyi under the instigation of her maid servant Manthara and the King's  
submission to the dictates of his wife whereby Prince Rama was exiled to the  
forest for fourteen years.   
In this context, King Dasaratha is to be compared to the ordinary man of the  
world placed in an atmosphere of pleasure and plenty falling a victim to the  
promptings of his vicious mind ( Manthara) infatuated by sense objects  
(Kaikeyi).   
The ten headed Rakshasa, Ravana, in the absense of sri Rama and Lakshmana  
steals away Sita from their forest- dwelling. Here Ravana with his ten heads  
is to be compared with the ten sense organs--five organs of knowledge, and  
five organs of action. Stealing away of Sita is to be compared to the loss of  
reasoning power of the worldly minded, deluded by Maya. The golden deer  
Maricha is Maya which deluded both Lakshmana and Rama and they lost their  
power of discrimination (Sita).   
Hanuman, the intellectual giant and strong celibate, is an invincible power  
**which indicates that if one has to achieve success in all his undertakings  
one has to cultivate truth, simplicity, purity, selfless service, devotion to  
duty,and establish oneself in absolute Bramhacharya.**   
 **Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya!!!!**

Like sita we ordinary jivas have always temptations going after illusion. When  
Sita wanted the golden deer   
Ram told her it is not a real. But to satisfy His wife's desire He went after  
the deer. In day to day life also   
it happens in so many houses. Wives demand and compel their husband to get  
luxury life then both will be in   
trouble.   
There are lots of lession we should learn from Ramayana.

Sita herself is the Maha Maya. But she played a pageant. She   
asked for a maya (illusory) deer and thus lost contact with Brahman   
(Rama) got separated by kama (Ravana) etc., and then with the   
help of the Guru (Hanuman), she regained union with Brahman!
