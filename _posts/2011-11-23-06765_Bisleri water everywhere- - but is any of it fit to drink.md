## Please help me with your insights

Thankyou for this lovely discussion. Ive just discovered this forum today.   
And as I was so engrossed in the content I immediately registered as a user to  
join in the discussions .   
Anyhow. . I dont think its by chance (nothing ever is, is it? ) that I  
have come across this forum. So, now I am posting a question that I would  
love your insights on: When we realise the self, we connect with the divine universal energy (the  
same essence/ energy we see in nature, miracle healings, the birth of a child,  
etc.). We dont see ourselves as our thoughts (ie. I am an Olympic athlete I  
am the best. Or I am such a failure, nothing ever goes right for me Or am a  
student, mother, daughter etc). But we see ourselves as an extension of the  
divine.   
This is not a mind space. But a being, awareness, bliss space.   
What guides us is our intuition (which sounds like clear instructions of what  
to do next).   
What shows us we are on the right track are the miracles we see unfold, ie.  
People we meet, obstacles clearing, doors opening up Basically a life of love  
and grace.   
I have had fleeting moments of this in the last 6 years. This has been  
wonderful.   
HOWEVER I have also had moments when I feel like I am banging my head against  
a brick wall. This feeling only happens though, when I work towards creating  
a business.   
I have experienced the grace/ the flow where everything unfolds miraculously  
and effortlessly. And I have also experienced obstacle after obstacle when it  
comes to creating my business. To be honest This is driving me crazy.   
When I hear the word parabdh I feel powerless rather than comforted. It is  
obvious to me, that these business ventures are not meant to take off and  
hence they have not.   
HOWEVER I live in the western world, I have over $500,000USD in debt so I NEED  
to create an income stream to support my family. THEREFORE I have an urgent  
need to create this income stream.   
I have encountered obstacle after obstacle in creating a business since 2004  
and I have used every opportunity to learn from each experience and rise above  
it. But to be honest now I am just getting FED up. . Yes I want to be of  
service to the world while shining in my light. HOWEVER I dont know what to  
do, or how to be to create this income. . And I truly feel I have an amazing  
gift to share with the world, but as it stands at the moment while looking at  
my current debt level, I feel hopeless. Yes, I know I must surrender. But  
that would also mean doing nothing while my debt levels and bills rise So in  
my practical reality sense, I feel I have to do something.   
Ahhhh. This is causing me such grief!   
Anyhow, I would love any insights, support, references to Bhagwhan Ramanas  
texts that may help me. I feel stuck and would really love anything you have  
to share with me.   
With love,   
Geeta

Dear Geeta,   
Welcome to Satsang   
You have raised some deep questions. Bhagavan's way is quite different from  
the usual. When an old woman, lamented and cried to Bhagavan about her  
difficulties, how she is having to suffer, how much burden she is having,  
etc... for some time, Bhagavan very patiently listened to her and paused for  
some time and he said to her, all these difficulties, did you have them even  
in your sleep too? and that lady replied spontaneously, no Bhagavan, during my  
sleep, nothing was there, I sleep very peacefully. Bhagavan then said to her,  
While you are sleeping, there are no problems, but all these problems have  
raised along with your waking, therefore, enquire who this 'I' which has  
awaken from sleep. Nobody knew, if that lady even understood anything, she sat  
for some more time silently and prostrated to Bhagavan and left.   
Now, Kavyakantha Ganapathy Muni, who was a witness to this, was quite  
surprised, he was taken aback by Bhagavan's response to that old lady and  
prayed, asked Bhagavan, "Why, Bhagavan, have you chosen to reply thus (very  
high level of Atma Jnanam) to a very ordinary old lady, what will she know  
about Atma, Atma Vicharam, etc? Will she have even understood anything?  
Wouldn't it have been better, if Thou had asked her to do some Panchakshari  
Japam (Om Namah Shivaya) or something? which would have made some sense to  
her.   
Bhagavan, kept silent for some time and said very casually, "I can only tell  
what I know, and let others tell what they know"   
Bhagavan gave atma Upadesam not only to humans, but he spoke of Atma Vichara  
to Monkeys and other animals as well. When one attendant asked Bhagavan, when  
he saw Bhagavan telling a monkey about Atma Vichara, "Bhagavan, how can a  
monkey understand, Atma Vichara?" Bhagavan said, Language is not a medium, The  
Heart understands through the language of heart. He went on to say, I have  
been been telling you people, many of you also still don't understand, but  
don't some of you also understand? in the same way, even some animals among  
them also will understand"   
Once somebody, thew a stone on a monkey and it fell down and died. All the  
other monkeys flocked Bhagavan as if in protest about the happenings.  
Bhagavan, who knew everything, came close to the monkeys and said with so much  
tenderness, "Whosoever is born has to die some time or the other, so don't  
grieve over the dead 'body' instead realise the that the atma within is  
deathless and birthless" Surprisingly, the monkeys quietened and they came to  
terms and understanding and left the place peacefully! Such was the power or  
Bhagavan. Even to Monkeys, when they came and complained to Bhagavan about  
their difficulties and problems, he only asked them to enquire within and  
realise the Atma.   
When Karuppan (Dog) was seen barking at another dog, (its nature) Bhagavan  
used to tell him "Summa Iru" "Keep Quiet (Just Be), why cant you simply remain  
without exhibiting your nature (barking). Surprisingly, Karuppan immediately,  
spontaneously stopped barking and kept quiet and remained seated at peace. His  
Samamdhi can be found in the Ashram.   
Like this, Bhagavan had responded to several devotees who turned up with  
different kinds of problems, some came worried and lamented to Bhagavan about  
their Children's marriage, some for diseases, some for birth of children, and  
so on... For everybody, Bhagavan gave more or less the same answer. He some  
how, made the questioners forget their questions and diverted their attention  
to their True Nature. Bhagavan, never gave a direct solution to devotees for  
their problems. He rather swallowed their problems and the devotees found  
themselves robbed from their problems.   
Paul Brunton, quoted in his book, Bhagavan's words - "Problems need not be  
solved, problems have to be dropped. Because, in reality, there are no  
problems" Only mind conceives problem. The children of the mind is problems.  
Like the children of the childless mother, problems exist!   
Bhagavan's one stop (solution) for every kind of problems was to really  
realise our True Self. He even said that, we are already realised and only we  
need to Claim it.   
The only Sadhana, he seemed to have kept telling repeatedly throughout his  
physical presence was only one - "Enquire, who am I" hold onto the 'I' That is  
all. This one thing alone is sufficient for every problems to fall off on  
their own accord. The more we sincerely do this, our worldly problems solve by  
themselves. This has been experienced by most of the sincere Bhagavan  
devotees. Specific to your personal case, Sri Bhanu Sarma, son of Sri TKS  
Sundaresa Iyer, had plenty of debt, and during the 1940's he once came to  
Bhagavan and said to him about his huge debt and Bhagavan "oh, you have fallen  
into debt, is it? go around the hill, it will burn away your debt, this is  
fire mountain" and Sri Bhanu Sarma did it accordingly, and within short span  
of time, he was fully free of all debt and enjoyed a good life thereafter very  
peacefully.   
Geeta, if you do get a chance to come to India in the near future, please  
reserve time to do Giri Pradakshinam around the hill once.   
Another very important Quote of Bhagavan, which all his devotees are strung  
within is this -   
"The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their  
prarabdhakarma (destiny to be worked out in this life, resulting from the  
balance-sheet of actions in past lives). Whatever is destined not to happen  
will not happen, try as you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen,  
do what you may to prevent it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is  
to remain silent."   
Whevever you feel stuck somewhere, or find yourself agitated, unable to act  
with prudence, in such tough time, just remember the above quote and you will  
find yourself automatically pacified, calmed down for _Whatever is destined  
not to happen will not happen, try as you may. Whatever is destined to happen  
will happen, do what you may to prevent it. This is certain. The best course,  
therefore, is to remain silent_ because, this quote from Bhagavan is no Brahma  
Vidya. It is the highest teaching anybody can receive.   
_And finally, Geeta, there is no coming to consciousness without pain.  
Thanks to all the sufferings, it is only because of the grace of our  
sufferings, that we get closer and closer to God! If we only have happiness,  
we will never know what God is, what Grace is, Who we really are, What is  
Atma, etc... because we would be only immersed in the momentary happiness.   
Suffering is truly grace. It is a Blessing in disguise_** and be sure, this  
suffering can cause no harm. Because, this suffering is the play of the Lord  
Almighty, how can he cause us any harm. He created the suffering, it is his  
lookout, his problem   
Just trust the blessings of your Guru and Be! Sufferings are like the passing  
clouds, they pass very quickly before even we realise and take note, realise  
the temporariness of suffering and pains and focus on the teachings of your  
Guru.   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Nagaraj Ji,   
Thankyou, thankyou for taking the time and energy to respond to my post.   
Your answer is one I will save and look upon regularly.   
It is funny. While the last 6 years (regarding my business) have been a  
struggle, it is only through this experience where I have had the deepest  
learning, releasing unnecessary thoughts/energy/ vibration and experienced  
moments of sheer bliss. I believe this whole struggle has unfolded as my life  
purpose is to live life from my lightness And hence through this struggle, I  
have been looking inward rather than looking for someone or something to come  
and save me.   
I have a knowing that this struggle is only temporary. And I also have a  
knowing that what is waiting on the other side of this, is pure bliss (the  
same feelings I felt while sitting outside the cave at Arunachala). My  
challenge has been, while looking inward that I have blamed and shamed myself  
for my financial situation.   
I realise beating myself for my shortcomings is not the way. It has now come a  
time to shed my load; and while I cannot come to India and do Giri  
Pradakshinam around the hill at the moment. I will not let this stop me. I  
will have to do a walk here, while immersing myself in the vibration of  
Arunachala and simply let go of this baggage I have been carrying. This  
constant internal mind chatter has not served me, it has now come a time to be  
silent, trust and be.   
I feel I am on the cusp of a breakthrough in learning what I need to learn...  
However rather than chasing and trying to catch the butterfly, I need to  
settle myself down and 'be' and let the butterfly come and sit on my shoulder.   
I read a quote yesterday from Abraham Hicks, which I thought was quite nice   
You cannot have a happy ending to an unhappy journey. I will remember this  
and enjoy this journey.   
Thankyou again, I am so grateful for your reply,   
With love,   
Geeta

Dear Geeta,   
Sufferings in life are there for all people, whether Asians or Americans or  
Africans.   
We cannot apply immediately what Sri Bhagavan said, I am not the body etc.,   
It needs quite a preparation. But you can surrender to Him. Initially  
surrender will   
also be half hearted. In course of time, as you start 'feeling' His grace, it  
will become   
total. As you totally surrender, submitting your mind and ego to Him you will  
see the   
dusappearance of problems and difficulties.   
Arlunachala Siva.

Dear Geeta,   
Chose a suitable Guru for yourself (dead Gurus are also fine). And once you  
have chosen, please open your heart, share your problems clearly, list  
down all your desires, fears, hidden thoughts, all you have. Surrender to  
your Guru all these feelings wholeheartedly morning and evening and proceed  
with your day as you do now. Problems that has come to a focus of a jnani  
will never trouble us the same way they used to do earlier. There will be a  
change. Even if there is no change you could see, dont give up. Guru will  
never foresake a devotee.   
In my experience, every fear of me had a corresponding desire hidden within  
me. So once you submit your fear to your Guru, he will chase away the root  
cause desire element within you and he will drive both away.   
The only thing expected from you is this: dont forget your Guru no matter  
what the situation is. Never never forget him even if your faith is very  
weak. Perseverence is the only quality that is needed. Even if you doubt him  
100% at some instance, dont worry about it, just stick to his image and do  
japa of his name. Just blindly. It will do wonders sooner or later mostly at  
the moment when you forget your self and become lost completely, the helping  
hand will come.   
Dont worry all your problems will come to an end very soon.

Dear Krishnan,   
Just a small observation. I felt, it is in appropriate to refer Guru as "dead  
Gurus"   
There is no Death for the Guru, as the Guru is not the gross body. The Guru  
never dies, the Guru ever is.

Oh I already pondered over this and wondered David Godman why he himself used  
this term.   
As a very serious follower of David Godman -- I accept and follow whatever he  
says and writes. I inherited this way of addressing from him.   
Dead Gurus means in the physical plane with physical body -- otherwise, I  
have to mention like who is not in body now in a lengthy way.

Dear Krishnan and Nagaraj,   
I do not know where and in which book of his, David used the phrase "dead  
gurus."   
But I prefer to use the phrase, " the Guru who has shed his mortal coil."

Thankyou all for your words of encouragement. :)I am in great appreciation.   
I have some other questions that have emerged: \- Do I need a Guru (in physical or non physical form)?   
When I pray to the Divine, I pray to the Divine Universal energy, it has no  
form. I use the words Bhagwan, Ramana Maharishi, Shirdi Baba, Satya Sai Baba,  
Jesus, Allah, God. It doesn't matter. I am calling to that Divine Universal  
Energy and when I need it, it appears. I generally connect to this energy with  
silent meditation, prayer, sitting outside in nature.   
In the same breathe, if I apply everything you said **ksksat27** towards this  
Universal energy, is that one in the same thing or is there a difference?   
From experience I believe in the physical and non physical beings. At the  
birth of my third child I had complications during my delivery. I have never  
felt such as fear as I did in that moment when my childs life was at risk. I  
called every guiding spirit I knew and almost immediately the room filled with  
these beings. One by one as I called they kept emerging. A calm came over me.  
Anyhow, my little baby and I were both fine.   
\- I'm really sorry if this sounds like a silly question, but I must ask.   
What is the objective to self inquiry? My understanding is that it is to see  
the 'I' that exists is not Geeta my physical body/ mind, but rather that 'I'  
is the same Divine energy that I call (Universe/ God/ Baba etc...)?   
So in essence, I Geeta in physical form (am the Universal energy) and there is  
no difference between my essence/ core/ God self and that same Universal  
energy that makes the sun rise every morning?   
[Note: I'm not minimising the self enquiry process, however I just want to  
confirm my understanding]   
\- Another question that keeps on emerging is..... OK, so once I do come into  
Consciousness, then what? Don't I have a greater obligation to this planet, my  
children, all children, beings to share the unique talents I have been born  
with while shining in my light? So is my purpose to keep working/ creating  
things while infusing them with my God/Light energy?   
I understand that in essence we're never fully 'Done', yes, we 'wake up'  
become conscious and from that place we keep sharing our light with the world.  
I may be way off here, so any feedback would be appreciated.   
[Again, please note... I am not saying I'm fully Conscious by any means (I  
think I've had glimpses) but this is a question that keeps emerging].   
\- And finally................. What does consciousness feel like?   
This example pops into my mind....(Again, feel free to jump in and clarify if  
I'm way off on this one too). When someone is trying to lose weight they will  
be 'aware' of everything they eat, and exercise. This awareness will help them  
attain their weight loss goal. However, the minute they lose their 'awareness/  
consciousness' they start eating junk, stop exercising... And then the next  
week when the jump on the scales to their horror they've put on weight. They  
beat them selves up about it, etc. But on the other hand, if the person  
remained conscious and reached their weight loss goal (by awareness of their  
eating/ exercise) they would less likely cry about their shortcomings/ less  
likely to ever put their weight on again etc...   
[Is that the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness?]   
And then when the light of awareness comes on... Obviously, is this something  
we need to practice (like the weight loss example)... Therefore, the light may  
start off at one level and then with practice only becomes brighter and  
brighter..... Is this correct?   
OK...... I seem to have posed allot of questions. I was not too sure who to  
ask. I will perhaps go for a walk in the mean time and contemplate these  
questions myself.... However if you have any insights that would be of benefit  
to me or the larger community, I would love to hear your thoughts.   
With love,   
Geeta

Hi Geeta   
I have been observing your expereience related statements in few of your  
postings. Please note that all these experiences you have may be just a  
tricky working of your ego. For example, the room filled with beings, it  
may be God's will or your tricky mind may have made you believe an illusion it  
created by itself. Same case applies when anybody cliams a glimpse of the  
Self. . So the best course is not to focus our attention on all these  
experiences etc.   
Secondly, please dont worry about your return of contribution to the world  
etc. Again these are all illusions within your own ego mind.   
In short, for now for a moment forget universe problems your ego mind  
experiences. We can easily fall into traps by directing our attention on  
them.   
Now coming to the method I prescribed -- this is what I would like to advise  
you. Sorry, but I dont know about other valid methods, but atleast I can  
guarantee, this definitely will have its effects.   
Choose one main Guru and one personal God for yourself. Once you choose,  
dont worry about universal energies or any other concepts you have in your  
mind.   
Now that you have chosen your Guru, start surrendering yourself, all your  
concepts, all your desires, all you fears, all your lust etc. Start  
surrendering deeply without any reservation. Surrender mentally, surrender  
your words, deeds and everything else.   
Stay with that Guru and personal God without switching immediately to another  
Guru. Follow your chosen Guru's teachings and more importantly, please hold  
on to his/her name and form with a vigouros grip. This will reveal the GRACE  
AND Grace will make you perform more and more of surrender. Dont worry about  
anything else that come on the way.   
To start with you will do only partial surrender -- but do it earnestly. You  
place all your problems at his lotus feet.   
Minimimum one month to 48 days, if you do this, there will be a subtle  
change. But at any stage, even if peace or any extraordinary experience  
comes, just ignore it completely, just surrender it to your Guru's lotus  
feet. This way even if that experience is your ego -mind's creation, it will  
not have negative impact on you. If it is a genuine expereience also,  
surrendering to your Guru, will only make it very good.   
For example, one way of surrendering is to write a factual letter to your  
Guru stating that experience. As if a third person writes.   
Geeta,   
I tell you this \-- many people fall into this trance, illusionary  
experiences and other types of ego mind's trap. I am sure you understand this  
and be careful not to fall prey into this.   
List of Gurus I know of 19/20th century who are very very great Mahatmas and  
who had lot of tapas and high degree of detachment.   
Please note I am not doing any marketing for any Gurus listed below and you  
are free to choose or ignore this list.

Dear ksksat27,   
Thankyou so very much for your post   
You are right. My ego has been at work. I must retract however a previous  
comment I mentioned in an earlier post 'that I have had glimpses of the self'.  
I do not yet know what the 'self' is, but what I meant was that I have had  
glimpses of 'moments of time where it seems that time actually stands still  
and I lose myself in the moment in whatever I am doing'. It feels like bliss/  
presense/ stillness/ peace/love all in one, that is what I had experienced.  
This may be my ego, yes, but from a normal person living life, those moments  
were wonderful. But yes, not the real thing... So see it was my ego.   
It's funny. I have had a picture of Ramana Maharishi on my desk for the last 6  
years. The same 6 years where I have been pulling my hair out trying to run my  
business and fell in a downward spiral. Still his calm face kept looking back  
at me. I visited Tiruvanamalai in 2006 and feel drawn to both him and Shirdi  
Sai Baba.   
I genuinely appreciate your guidance   
The practices I have followed have led me this far. I feel ready to move to  
the next level. I will immerse myself in the teachings of Ramana Maharishi (I  
have several of his books, but I'm sorry to say that I don't actually know  
what his teachings are, with the exception of self inquiry). I will immerse  
myself in this study. I will surrender. Surrending feels like relinquishing  
'control' which serves me in the physical world, but does not serve me on my  
spiritual journey. This requires letting go, being vunerable, open, guided. I  
really feel now is the time. So I will surrender.   
Do you have any recommendations for texts to read? Or should I just follow  
where I am guided?   
This may be a unrelated, or workings on my ego yet again, but since I joined  
this forum (only 2 days ago), I have experienced extreeeeeeeeeeeme dizzyness,  
lightheadedness, nasuea. This may be my ego distracting me, or something  
totally unrelated?   
Anyhow, sincrest gratitude for sharing your wisdom. I greatly appreciate it.   
With love,   
Geeta

Ramana/Nagaraj/Friends,   
An excerpt from The Gospel of sri Ramakrishna:  **God-vision through pure love**   
MR. CHOUDHURY: "How can one see God?"   
MASTER: "Not with these eyes. God gives one divine eyes; and only then can one  
behold   
Him. God gave Arjuna divine eyes so that he might see His Universal Form.   
"Your philosophy is mere speculation. It only reasons. God cannot be realized  
that way.   
"God cannot remain unmoved if you have raga-bhakti, that is, love of God with  
passionate   
attachment to Him. Do you know how fond God is of His devotees' love? It is  
like the   
cow's fondness for fodder mixed with oil-cake. The cow gobbles it down  
greedily.   
"Raga-bhakti is pure love of God, a love that seeks God alone and not any  
worldly end.   
Prahlada had it. Suppose you go to a wealthy man every day, but you seek no  
favour of   
him; you simply love to see him. If he wants to show you favour, you say: 'No,  
sir. I don't   
need anything. I came just to see you.' Such is love of God for its own sake.  
You simply   
love God and don't want anything from Him, in return."   
Saying this, the Master sang: Though I am never loath to grant salvation,   
I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.   
Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;   
He is adored by men;   
He triumphs over the three worlds.. . .   
He continued, "The gist of the whole thing is that one must develop passionate  
yearning for   
God and practise discrimination and renunciation."   
Namaskar.

Graham,   
Sorry but i have doubt here also.   
By 12 liters, do you mean the cans supplied to houses? And what about 1  
litre water bottles that are sold opp. to Ramansramam?   
I heard antoher notion that the shopkeepers or intermediate vendors just fill  
river water and supply those plastic cans to houses, not just bisleri band to  
be blamed. Even in Bangalore AquaGuard plastic cans have issues atleast as I  
know.   
Best way is to finish this adulterated janma and attain permanent liberation.
