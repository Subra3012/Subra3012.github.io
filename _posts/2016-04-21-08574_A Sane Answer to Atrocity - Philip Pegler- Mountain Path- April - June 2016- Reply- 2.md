Quietly insistent, these dedicated contemplatives \-- often martyrs for their  
faith -- have urgently spoken   
out for everyone of good will whenever they have touched the true light within  
themselves in profound   
reflection and in all simplicity. They have ever upheld the perennial  
philosophy, expressing the essential   
goodness and wisdom at the heart of all the great world religions. In so  
doing they have provided a reassuringly sane and balanced response to the  
barbaric atrocities seen throughout history and now witnessed to our  
consternation in our own day.   
Faith is hardly amenable to reason, but even so what you notice around you  
depends on how you look.   
When we view things deeply with the eyes of love and in the light of faith,  
you will find signs of great goodness   
breaking through on all sides - clear evidence of a merciful background, which  
is the invisible foundation of all   
all activity, whether wholesome or pernicious.   
Silent and ignored, because it can only be intuitively known and defies  
scientific scrutiny, still this ground of   
being endures in the midst of both cynical disbelief and unquenchable hope.  
This deepest truth insists even in the midst of both cynical disbelief and  
unquenchable hope. This deepest truth insists even in the midst of   
the heedless destruction of war -- pain too terrible to contemplate -- but it  
can only be realized then in the   
obscure darkness of a faith unadorned by the niceties of creed or ritual and  
lit up simply by love.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
