"Glory to Sri Ramana the Sage,   
Who firmly established in devotion   
to the Lotus-feet of Arunachaleswara,   
can undo the evil of the world and   
the misery of those who take refuge   
in Him. Glory to Ramana,   
glowing with merciful love for all."   
"Bhagavan Sri Ramana's Realization is unique   
and unparalleled in the annals of history.   
He realised in his boyhood the Eternal Truth,   
the Self Supreme, without the aid of initiation   
by any external Guru, without the need for   
theoretical knowledge and without any study   
of the Scriptures, and without having resorted   
to any ritualistic form of worship.....other than   
his spontaneous realization of the eternal nature   
of the "I", the Self Supreme."   
 **The sense of body is a thought;   
the thought is of the mind,   
The mind rises after the "I"-thought,   
the "I"-thought is the root-thought.   
If that is held,   
the other thoughts will disappear.   
There will be no body,   
no mind, not even the ego;   
only the Self in all its purity.**   
To remain as the Self   
is not difficult.   
 **Why should one think of birth and death?   
Are you really born?   
....all these are only of the mind.   
So long as the body is considered,   
birth is real. But the body is not "I".   
The Self is not born, nor does it die.   
There is nothing new.   
The Sages see everything as being   
in and of the Self;   
there is no diversity in it,   
Therefore, there is neither birth nor death.**   
The soul remains always uncontaminated.   
It is the substratum funning through these three states:  **Wakefulness passes off, I Am   
the dream state passes off, I Am;   
the sleep states passes off, I Am;   
They repeat themselves,   
and yet "I Am" remains.   
They are like pictures   
moving on a screen at the cinema show.   
They do not affect the screen.   
"I Am" remains unaffected...**   
Any new appearances are bound to disappear.   
Anything created will certainly be destroyed.   
The eternal is not born nor does it die.   
We are now confounding appearances with reality.   
Appearance carries its end in itself.   
What is it that appears newly?   
If you cannot find it, surrender unreservedly   
to the substratum of appearances;   
then, the reality remains as residue.   
Engage yourself in the living present.   
The future will take care of itself.   
Do not worry about the future.   
Doubts cease when the confusion is surpassed.   
Engage in self-investigation,   
then the non-self will disappear.   
The Self will be left over.   
This is self-investigation of the Self.   
The one word "Self"   
is equivalent to the mind,   
body, man, individual,   
the Supreme and all else.   
The Real is That what is;   
the others are only appearances.   
Diversity is not its nature.   
 **We are reading the printed characters   
on paper, but ignore the paper   
which is the background.   
Similarly, you are taken up by the manifestations   
of the mind, and let go the background.   
Whose fault is it?**   
Is there a difference between the   
individual soul and the Self?   
That is what IS.   
The mind obstructs the innate peace.   
Our investigation is only in the mind.   
Investigate the mind;   
then it will disappear.   
There is no entity by the name "mind."   
Because of the emergence of thoughts,   
we surmise something from which they start;   
that we term "mind."   
When we probe to see what it is,   
there is nothing of the sort.   
After it has vanished,   
Peace will be found to remain eternal.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Final Part - Few Teachings Of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:31:57 AM

**To say that one is apart   
from the Primal Source   
is itself a pretension;   
to add that one divested of the ego   
becomes pure and yet retains individuality   
only to enjoy or serve the Supreme,   
is a deceitful stratagem.**   
What duplicity is this --   
first to appropriate what is really His,   
and then pretend to experience or serve Him!   
Is not all this already known to Him?   
It is enough that one surrenders oneself.   
Surrender is to give oneself up   
to the original cause of one's being.   
Do not delude yourself   
by imagining such a source   
to be some God outside you.   
One's source is within oneself.   
Give yourself up to it.   
That means that you should   
seek the source and merge in it.   
The Swami continued, In actual practice,sadhakas, even sincere ones,  
sometimes become dejected and lose faith in God. How to restore their faith?  
What should we do for them?   
Bhagavan: If one cannot believe in God, it does not matter. I suppose he believes in  
himself, in his own existence. Let him find out the source from which he came.   
Swami: Such a man will only say the source from which he comes are his parents.   
Bhagavan: He cannot be such an ignoramus, as you started by saying he was a sadhaka in  
this line already"   
 **Deep sleep is only the state of nonduality.   
Can the difference between individuals   
and Universal souls persist there?   
Sleep implies forgetfulness   
of all differences.  
This alone constitutes happiness.   
 **All efforts are meant only to end ignorance.   
They have no use after realization.**   
It is enough that one surrender oneself.   
Surrender is to give yourself up   
to the original cause of one's being.   
The gods and sages   
experience the Infinite   
continuously and eternally,   
without their vision being obscured   
at any moment.   
Their minds are surmised by the spectators   
to function, but in fact they do not.   
Such surmising is due to the sense of individuality   
in those who draw inferences.   
There is no mental function   
in the absence of individuality.   
Individuality and mind functions   
are co-existent.   
The one cannot remain without the other.   
The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss   
Some kind of knowledge has to be admitted,   
even in the realization of Supreme Bliss.   
it may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The pure mind is itself Brahman;   
therefore it follows that Brahman   
is not other than   
the mind of the sage.   
 **We are happy in deep sleep.   
We remain then as the pure Self.   
We are the same even now.   
In such sleep there was neither the wife   
nor others nor even "I."   
Now they become apparent   
and give rise to pleasure or pain.   
Why should not the Self,   
which was blissful in deep sleep,   
continue its blissful nature even now?   
The sole obstruction to such continuity   
is the wrong identification   
of the Self with the body.**   
 **" I am Brahman," is only a thought.   
Who says it?   
Brahman itself does not say so.   
What need is there for it to say it?   
Nor can the real "I" say so.   
For "I" always abides as Brahman.   
To be saying it is only a thought.   
Whose thought is it?   
All thoughts are from the unreal "I,"   
i.e., the "I"-thought.   
Remain without thinking.   
So long as there is thought   
there will be fear.**   
There is no use discussing transcendental experiences   
by those whose limitations are not removed.   
Learn what surrender is.   
It is to merge in the source of the ego.   
The ego is surrendered to the Self.   
Everything is dear to us   
because of love of the Self.   
 **The Self is that   
to which we surrender our ego   
and let the Supreme Power,   
I. e., the Self, do what it pleases.   
The ego is already of the Self.   
We have no rights over the ego, even as it is.**   
However, supposing we had,   
we must surrender them.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 2 - Few Teachings Of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:29:33 AM  
---  
We misapprehend the ego   
and call it intellect or mind.   
Being of the nature of Bliss,   
why does one continue to crave for happiness?   
To be rid of that craving is itself salvation.   
The Scriptures say, "You Are That."   
The imparting of that knowledge is their purpose.   
The Realization must be   
by your finding out who you are   
and abiding as That, i. e., your Self   
To be repeating "I am that"   
or "not this" is a waste of time.   
For the worthy disciple   
the work lies within   
and not without.   
 **There was no "I" thought in your sleep   
whereas it is present now.   
The true "I" is not manifest   
and the false "I" is parading itself.   
This false "I" is the obstacle   
to your right knowledge.   
Find out wherefrom this false "I" arises.   
Then it will disappear.   
You will be only what you are --   
i. e., absolute Being.**   
Search for the source of the "I" thought.   
That is all one has to do.   
The universe exists on account of the "I" thought.   
If that ends, there is an end of misery, also.   
The false "I" will end only when its source is sought.   
The universe is like a painting on a screen.   
That which rises and sinks is made up of what it rises from.   
The finality of the universe is God --   
meditating on Him or on the seer, the Self;   
there is a mental vibration "I" to which all are reduced.   
Tracing the source of "I",   
the primal "I"-"I" alone remains,   
and it is inexpressible.   
The seat of Realization is within   
and the seeker cannot find it as an object outside him.   
That seat is bliss, and is the core of all beings;   
hence it is called the Heart.   
The only useful purpose of the present birth   
is to turn within and realize it.   
There is nothing else to do.   
 **Is there a mind in the first place?   
What you call mind is an illusion.   
It starts from the "I"-thought.   
Without the gross or subtle senses,   
you cannot be aware of the body or the mind.   
Still, it is possible for you to be without these senses.   
In such a state, you are either asleep   
or aware of the Self only.   
Awareness of Self is ever there.   
Remain what you truly are   
and this question will not arise.**   
The Self is more intimate than the objects.   
Find the subject [your Self]   
and the objects will take care of themselves.   
the objects are seen by different persons   
according to their outlook --   
and these theories evolved.   
But who is the seer,   
the cognizer of these theories?   
It is you.   
Find your Self.   
Then there is an end to   
these vagaries of the mind.   
Yoga implies prior division and it means   
later union of one with another.   
Who is to be united with whom?   
You are the seeker,   
seeking union with something.   
That something is apart from you.   
Your Self is intimate to you.   
You are aware of the Self.   
Seek it and be it.   
That will expand as the infinite.   
Man owes his movements to another Power,   
whereas he thinks he does everything himself --   
just like a lame man bluffing that,   
were he helped to stand up,   
he would fight and chase away the enemy.   
Action is impelled by desire;   
desire arises only after the rise of the ego;   
and this ego owes its origin to a Higher Power   
on which its existence depends.   
It can not remain apart.   
Why then prattle, "I do, or I act, or I function"?   
A Self-realized being cannot help but benefit the world.   
His very existence is the highest good.   
 **I exist now. I am the enjoyer.   
I enjoy fruits of action.   
I was in the past --   
and shall be in the future.   
Who is this "I"?   
Finding this "I" to be pure Consciousness   
beyond action and enjoyment;   
freedom and happiness are gained.   
There is then no effort,   
for the Self is perfect   
and there remains nothing more to gain.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi says Self alone is real direct knowledge  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:39:42 AM  
---  
**Self alone is the real eye. Therefore Self, which is known by itself, alone  
is the real direct knowledge.But insentient people, who do not have Selfs  
sight,claim the knowledge of alien sense-objects to be direct knowledge.**   
 **Sadhu Om:** Sri Bhagavan here describes those who do not see through the  
eye of Self as insentient people, since they see only through the insentient  
physical eyes. Such people say that the knowledge of the objects of this world  
is direct knowledge [pratyaksha aparoksha jnana]. However, **the world seen in  
front of the eyes is not perceived directly, since it is known only through  
the medium of the mind and the five senses.** Self, the knowledge of ones own  
existence, is a more real and more direct knowledge than the knowledge of any  
alien object. **It is only after there is the first knowledge I am that the  
knowledge the world and all else exists can come into being, and hence no  
knowledge except I am can be direct knowledge;** Self alone is the ever-  
direct knowledge.   
 **Will an ornament become gold only when its form is destroyed by melting? Is  
it not [in reality] gold even while it is in the form of an ornament?  
Therefore,know that all the three [unreal] entities [the world,soul and God]  
formed by the mind, are likewise [in reality] nothing but existence-  
consciousness [Self].**   
 **Sadhu Om:** Even while they appear to be many different things,the world,  
the soul and God are in reality nothing but the one Self alone. It is wrong to  
think that they will become Self only after their diverse forms have  
disappeared. In truth, only Self, the substance or reality of those diverse  
forms, is real, while the forms themselves are ever unreal.   
 **If one does not take to the deluded life of modern civilization,if one  
rejects the liking towards the useless worldly knowledges [such as sciences,  
arts and languages],and if one removes the sense of differentiation [bheda-  
buddhi] between Siva [or Paramatma] and the soul [or jivatma], then only will  
the true import of Siva Jnana Bodham shine forth.**   
 **Source** : GURU VACHAKA KOVAI The Light of Supreme Truth or THE COLLECTION  
OF GURUS SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By Sadhu Om and Michael James   
Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collection of Bhagavans spoken teachings  
that was thoroughly checked and revised by him during his lifetime. As such it  
has a unique place in the Ramana literature.

## Re:[1] Ramana Maharshi says Self alone is real direct knowledge  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 27, 2010, 09:41:55 AM

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar covers in his Padamalai verses also about the the Self   
Knowledge which is the true knowledge. About "I am" -which is   
the true learning.   
Verse 425: To remain naturally merged in the Heart, without rising   
as "I", is the proper dharma.   
Verse 276: Padam declares: "To enquire and know oneself properly,   
nothing except the consciousness 'I am' is necessary.   
Verse 518: Taking the underlying consciousness ["I am"] as the one unique  
refuge for your attention, live your life.   
Verse 1055: The awareness of being, 'I am [sat bodham], which shines as the  
source of the intellect, is the divine grace that enables the attainment of  
true Jnana.   
Verse 2575: When the mind, one pointed and fully focused, knows the supreme  
silence in the Heart, this is [true] learning.   
Verse 1492: As a result of the knowledge obtained from this true   
learning, all false misery will fall away, and a profound peace will   
flourish.   
Verse 616: Bear in mind that the benefit of scholarship is prompting the mind  
to turn about, enabling it to be captivated   
by the light of the Self.   
Verse 1974: The benefit of learning is simply to become established   
within the Heart, in the concept-free state of reality, which is your   
own nature.   
Verse 1821: As long as the holy feet do not touch and come to rest squarely  
upon the head [of the jiva] what benefit can scholarship give?   
Verse 722: Only the learning of akhanda-vritti [unbroken   
experience], one's truth, the substratum, is true learning.   
Verse 342: The benefit of learning should be nothing less than to dwell upon  
the gracious feet of the one whose form is the wealth of pure consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.
