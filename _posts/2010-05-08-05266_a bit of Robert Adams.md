1) personal cleanliness   
2) tidiness of dress   
3) habitual wearing of vibhuti and kumkum on the forehead;   
4) equal sharing of all enjoyments with those around him;   
5) strict adherence to a time schedule;   
6) performing useful work however low it be;   
7) never leaving a work unfinished;   
the pursuit of perfection in every action;   
9) incessant activity except while sleeping or resting after a spell of hard  
work;   
10) never considering oneself superior to others;   
11) speaking the truth always, or strict silence if the expression of a truth  
would hurt or lower the reputation of others;   
12) perfect self-help;   
13) never asking another to do a piece of work which can be done by oneself;   
14) taking full responsibility for failure, if any, without shifting the blame  
on others;   
15) accepting success and failure with equanimity;   
16) never disturbing the peace of others;   
17) leaving the leaf or plate clean after eating;   
18) complete noninterference in the affairs of others;   
19) never worrying about the future.   
These are the lessons Sri Ramana taught by example to his devotees. We should  
try to follow the example of the Maharshi with all the strength of the body,  
mind and spirit.   
Of what the Maharshi taught in the realm of spirit, words fail and I dare not  
write. Moments Remembered, page 72

Sri N.R. Krishanmurty Iyer was from Madurai. He came to see   
Bhagavan Ramana often when he was young. Later he went to   
college and slowly forgot the greatness of Bhagavan and even   
spoke ill of Him, since He was not quite active in any social work,   
particularly when that was the time of freedom movement. Once   
he had some work in Tiruvannamalai. He went to T.K. Sundaresa   
Iyer's house. Since it was a festival time, he found the house full   
of people and did not want to stay there. He told Sundaresa Iyer   
about it. Iyer suggested that he could stay in the Asramam. NRK   
was reluctant. Iyer pursued. NRK said: I shall go there. But I   
shall not do any namaskaram for your Bhagavan. Iyer said that   
He did not want any thing from him. Both went. Bhagavan   
Ramana was sitting on a wooden chair near the Iluppai Tree.   
(which one can see even today. The tree is more than 100 years   
old.)   
As soon as NRK and Iyer went in, NRK fell like a stick and did   
namaskaram to Bhagavan Ramana, even earlier than Iyer!   
Many miracles happened subsequently in the Asrmam for NRK.   
Please go through Fragrant Petals for details.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Thank you for this **_WONDERFUL_** post. This post is **" Pokkisham"** (Tamil)  
**" Treasure"**. I am going to make myself a wonderful copy this post and  
laminate it with Ramana picture beside the points and hang it in my room and  
"I" am going to make it a habbit to read it everyday and try and put it into  
practice.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. We find the same person different and everyone sees the   
person in his own different way. This is because we have still   
not understood and realized that "I am". This "I am ness" if it   
could jettison out the "I" or the "I-thought", then everyone will   
see only the One. This I thought only gives rise to first person,   
second person and third person. Then it gives room for here and   
there, the space and yesterday, today and tomorrow, the time.   
This idea is taught by Bhagavan Ramana in Verses 14,15 and 16   
of Sad Darsnam.   
There is wooden doll of an elephant. One child sees it as elephant. Another  
child sees it as wood. Only a matured child sees it as   
elephant made in wood. (Tirumoolar)   
Arunachala Siva.
