Once, on being asked by sage Bhardwaj and few others about the grandeur of  
Ayodhya, Sutji replied--' Ayodhya,   
a sacrosanct city is based on the bank of river Saryu. It is the very city  
where the famous king Ikshavaku ruled   
once upon a time. The term Ayodhya means unconquerable and consists of three  
root letters: a- symbolizing   
Brahma, y-symbolizing Vishnu and dh-symbolizing Rudra. It is a place where  
lord Vishnu has his abode for   
eternity and does not leave it even for a moment. According to the scriptures  
Ayodhya is based on Sudarshan   
chakra. It is well expanded in the radius of one yojan. Its eastern boundary  
stretches up to one yojan from a place   
called 'Sahastradhan'. Similarly, the western front stretches up to one yojan  
from a place called 'Sama', the   
southern up to one yojan from the bank of Saryu and its northern boundary up  
to one yojan starting from the bank   
of river Tamsa. In ancient times, a brahmin named Vishnu Sharma had performed  
an austere penance at   
Ayodhya. Lord Vishnu had appeared after becoming pleased by him and had  
created a holy place by digging up   
the earth with his Sudarshan chakra. Anybody, who takes a holy dip in  
Chakrateerth becomes absolved of all his   
sins.

## Pitiable Conditions of Gopi's in God's absence

After the disappearance of God, Gopis were perplexed. Their hearts burned with  
desire. They had   
dedicated their entire selves in the feet of Lord. They were entirely merged  
in the love of Krishna. Thus   
driven by passion, Gopis began to search Lord Krishna. They asked trees,  
creepers and vegetation for   
the whereabouts of their beloved. They then spotted His footprints at one  
place. Footprints of Radha   
were also there. 'Indeed He would have carried her, that great fortunate one,  
on His shoulders.' They   
thought. Lord had indeed, after disappearing from amidst Gopis, taken Radha to  
an isolated place. She   
had then began to think herself superior to other Gopis. So at one place, she  
said: "O Lord, I can't walk   
now. My tender feet are tired. Kindly carry me on your shoulders to wherever  
you wish." At her request,   
Lord Krishna agreed to carry her on his shoulder. But as soon as she proceeded  
to ride, Lord   
disappeared from there also. Now, Radha began to cry and wail and fainted. At  
the same time, other   
Gopis also reached there and found Radha lying unconscious on the ground. All  
of them including   
Radha then returned to the bank of Yamuna and began to wait for Krishna's  
appearance.

Dear Nagaraj,   
One Sri Vaishnava gentleman said: Radha was seven years old   
and Krishna was four years old, in the beginning of Srimad   
Bhagavtam. I think these stories have inner layers of meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.
