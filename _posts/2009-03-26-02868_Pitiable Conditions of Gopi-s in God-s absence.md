After the disappearance of God, Gopis were perplexed. Their hearts burned with  
desire. They had   
dedicated their entire selves in the feet of Lord. They were entirely merged  
in the love of Krishna. Thus   
driven by passion, Gopis began to search Lord Krishna. They asked trees,  
creepers and vegetation for   
the whereabouts of their beloved. They then spotted His footprints at one  
place. Footprints of Radha   
were also there. 'Indeed He would have carried her, that great fortunate one,  
on His shoulders.' They   
thought. Lord had indeed, after disappearing from amidst Gopis, taken Radha to  
an isolated place. She   
had then began to think herself superior to other Gopis. So at one place, she  
said: "O Lord, I can't walk   
now. My tender feet are tired. Kindly carry me on your shoulders to wherever  
you wish." At her request,   
Lord Krishna agreed to carry her on his shoulder. But as soon as she proceeded  
to ride, Lord   
disappeared from there also. Now, Radha began to cry and wail and fainted. At  
the same time, other   
Gopis also reached there and found Radha lying unconscious on the ground. All  
of them including   
Radha then returned to the bank of Yamuna and began to wait for Krishna's  
appearance.

Dear Nagaraj,   
One Sri Vaishnava gentleman said: Radha was seven years old   
and Krishna was four years old, in the beginning of Srimad   
Bhagavtam. I think these stories have inner layers of meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.
