I want to get clarified How Many days make one Mandalam. When do some stotra  
chanting ( like Vshnu Sahasranama etc ) for 1 Mandalam then does it mean we  
chant it for 40 days or 42 or 45 or 48 days ?   
Some say it is 40 but others give different nos. I know it does not matter  
much if we chant for few more days the names of God but just for technical  
purpose I want to know whether it is 40 days or more than 40 days so that  
when I finish exactly 1 Mandalam of Parayanam of any stotra then I can make  
some special dish as Prasadam and do a special Pooja for almighty after I  
complete 1 Mandalam and restart the next Parayana.   
So hoping for inputs from members here.   
Om Peace.

One Mandalam is 48 Days, it is said when somebody doing some particular  
Sadhana, one has to do it without fail for 48 days, one mandalam, only then  
will the Sadhana get the fruits of what tapas he performs.   
There are several scientific reasons for these calculations, i will get back  
to you once i gather more information.

Thanks Sri Nagaraj for this info. There was some confusion whether it is 40  
or 48 as some people said that Iyyappa devotees maintain 40 days vratham. As  
I said for me it does not matter chanting for a few more days but I want to  
know exactly when I complete 1 Mandalam so that on the day of conclusion I can  
do a better Puja and offer better Naivedyam and conclude it in a more  
enriching manner.
