The Big Bang was the result of the inevitable laws of physics and did not need  
God to spark the creation of the Universe, Stephen Hawking has concluded.   
The scientist has claimed that no divine force was needed to explain why the  
Universe was formed.   
In his latest book, The Grand Design, an extract of which is published in  
Eureka magazine in The Times, Hawking said: Because there is a law such as  
gravity, the Universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous  
creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the  
Universe exists, why we exist.   
He added: It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and  
set the Universe going.   
In A Brief History of Time, Prof Hawking's most famous work, he did not  
dismiss the possibility that God had a hand in the creation of the world.   
He wrote in the 1988 book: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the  
ultimate triumph of human reason  for then we should know the mind of God.   
In his new book he rejects Sir Isaac Newton's theory that the Universe did not  
spontaneously begin to form but was set in motion by God.   
In June this year Prof Hawking told a Channel 4 series that he didn't believe  
that a "personal" God existed. He told Genius of Britain: "The question is: is  
the way the universe began chosen by God for reasons we can't understand, or  
was it determined by a law of science? I believe the second. If you like, you  
can call the laws of science 'God', but it wouldn't be a personal God that you  
could meet, and ask questions."   
Until his retirement last year Prof Hawking was Lucasian Professor of  
Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a post previously held by Newton.   
The book, co-written by American physicist Leonard Mlodinow, is published on  
September 9.

I donot know why this guy Stephen Hawking changes his views quite often

Stephen Hawking is making the papers a fair bit lately. He has been talking  
about aliens and how we should be careful about trying to make contact.   
But does he explane how the laws of physics came into being, or did he miss  
that.

Stephen Hawking is not needed to create the universe - God.

Maybe God was not needed, but surely, some principle does enable Stephen  
Hawking to talk. Some principle is there to not need God for creation too. And  
what is that? Physics?

Dear amiatall,   
Scientists has said that there are four basic theories: 1\. Gravitational Theory.   
2\. Electro magnetic Theory.   
3\. Weak reaction [electron] theory.   
4\. Strong reaction [electron] theory.   
These four principles no doubt, explain everything in the earth and   
heavens and the inter stellar attraction, their creations, their life,   
their dissolution into black hole [the coal sack of the galaxy].   
Now these four theories independenly explain things. There is   
no unified theory to accommodate all the other four theories. Stephen Hawking  
himself has said that this unified field theory   
would explain much more facts about this universe. It is yet   
to be discovered.   
Now these are all discoveries. They are not inventions. No body   
invented these theories like James Watt invented steam engine.   
In other words, these theories are there and will be there, even before  
Einstein and Hawking and also after them. Now who invented these theories.  
That is God! When the universe was formed,   
god invented electromagnetic and gravitational theories to make it work. So  
the principle of God must come at the outer rim of physics   
and astrophysics. He is the Master watching the show sitting at the outer  
rim of Space. The Space is of course expanding. Still he is   
sitting at the outer rim of the enlarging space, about which no   
scientist can bring conclusive evidence. If he finds it out, then he   
will not be able to communicate. Because it would be a blissful   
experience and not a simple discovery where some one comes out of the bath  
tub shouting Eureka, Eureka.....   
P.S. Our brain consists of more than 2.5 billion cells, something   
more than the stars of the milky way galaxy. There are at least   
50 billion galazies like milky way. Some of them are larger than milky way.  
For example, double ant galaxy 20 times larger than   
milky way.   
We are standing here in this little planet and speak about Afghan   
and Iraq war and the Ayodhya Masjid dispute! Little ants!   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
thank god finally judge has given the decision in favour of us and indeed it  
is proven that temple did exist before masjid was built.   
No scientist still could not explain how all these plants,animals have come.   
As Sri sundara chaitanya swami says there is order in the universe like plants  
will grow only if you pour water but not kerosene.So if order is there there  
must and should be creator i.e god.   
I am still amazed to obersve ants as really it is amazing creature such a tiny  
creature and it has its own family and kids being born is funny and amazing.  
How really they are identifying sugar is again excellent.

Dear prasanth,   
In fact, our day to day life itself is full of miracles. Nature gives out   
miracles about which we do not know anything. There is a small plant, in front  
of my house, and I go for 3 year study to a city and come back and the plant  
has grown into a full fledged tree! When the roses bloom in my garden, what  
is that exact time it blooms, I do not know. How girls grow into tall ladies,  
even mother does not understand. How I grow old? No one knows. Suddenly I  
find a gray hair on the left or right corner of my ears. When exactly the  
black hair become gray hair? Not only in growth, but also in decay and death,  
there are miracles. Suddenly stars are formed and suddenly stars become black  
holes without any light.   
Amidst all these changes, vikaram they call it, what is changeless?   
What is permanent. It is I-I. Satyam Param dheemahi starts Srimad   
Bhagavatam. It ends with Satyam Param dheemahi. All in between   
are unreal. Even Krishna as a Kala rupa is unreal. Krishna only as   
Atma rupa is real.   
Only the I-I transcends the space and time. Bhagavan Ramana says   
in ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 16: What are time and space? Where are they? If we are the body,   
we will be, as embodied beings, bound by time and space. Are   
we this body? No. We, who are not bodies, today and then at   
all times are the same and always the form of the changeless One.   
Everywhere we are one form. We the Self, the form of Jnana alone   
is. Neither time nor space is, we alone are!   
Arunachala Siva.

If I have understood the jnanis correctly, the Universe constantly arises from  
the Source and goes back into the Source (or God).

Dear snow,   
Yes. The Universe is Sakti and the Source is Siva or Godhead.   
Bhagavan Ramana describes the return and quelling of Sakti   
in Sivam in His Sri Arunachala Nava Mani Maalai, Verse 1.   
Source is Achalam, non moving. Sakti is full of movement, changes,   
constantly appearing in kaleidoscopic formations.   
Arunchala Siva.**
