When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.   
 **Everyone has different gifts and capacities. We should try to perform to  
the best of our ability however difficult the task may be.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Everyone should put forth their best capacities whether in   
the matters of self improvement or self enquiry or for good of   
others. Only our goal should be noble.   
Arunachala Siva.

They kept one of the stones which were used to form a bridge in a Hanuman  
temple in Rameshwaram. The stone is kept in a water tank where u can touch and  
see.These stones are floating in water. And there we could see a photograh of  
the bridge which is under water is taken from statelite. The pandits said this  
is the same bridge which Hanuman build it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is a raging battle of words, between Tamil Nadu government   
and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really   
man made or made by the monkey-armies of Sri Rama. But to   
say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali   
Darvesh levitating stone of shivapur near puna. People can lift this heavy  
stone with a index finger.   
There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It  
seems people before 2 to 4 centuries had faith on them as well as God. They  
left behind some records on stones which is still alive and teaches to coming  
generations. I request this forum members to share their experiences where  
they visted such temples.
