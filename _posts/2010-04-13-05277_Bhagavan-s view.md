## Bhagavan's view

We know Bhagavan witness us but with our physical eyes we cannot see or talk  
to Him. Suppose if He is in human frame and Annamalai swamy also   
and if someone shows this forum, what would be His views and answers. I think  
He would say, the sugar doll is asking how does the sugar taste.

Bhagavan Ramana and Annamalai Swami are the Self, Atma, within   
us. He cannot be seen with our physical eyes. He can be seen only   
within in our Heart, by constant meditation. The Self is the eye of   
the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says these aspects beautifully in Sri Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Verse 15: Kannukku kannai kanninri kan unaik   
 Kanuvadhu evar par Arunachala!   
Who can ever find Thee? The Eye of the eye art Thou, and   
without eyes Thou seest, Oh Arunachala!   
Then how to see the Self? The Self Itself should show It, to you.   
There is no other way!   
Verse 43: Thaane thaane tattuvam idhanait   
 Thaane kattuvai Arunachala!   
Reveal Thyself! Thou only art Reality, Oh Arunachla!   
Okay, for this, what should we do?   
Verse 44: Thirumbi ahanthanai thinam ahak kan kaan   
 Therium enranai en Arunachala!   
"Look within, ever seeking the Self with the inner eye, then will   
it be found", Thus didst Thou direct me, beloved Arunachala!   
Bhagavan Ramana and Annamalai Swami have not gone anywhere.   
Their Presence is ever within us. Let us not insist on physical form.   
The Self which they are, have no form and name. They can be   
seen within us through our looking within, with inner eye.   
It is the Self which is directing us about the teachings of   
Bhagavan Ramana, in this Forum, if we have faith and conviction.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Verse 43:

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the reply. In day to day life every moment when the things happen  
as people wish we get happiness. On the other hand when it turns upside down,  
people   
get unhappy. The people who does atma vicharam, in the beginning ego does not  
want to accept the unhappy situation so people start argue and fight. Bhagavan   
who is inside of us He also witness the people's struggle, How much it is  
difficult to witness the fight in between the ego and the pure mind. That time  
our patience also get disappeared. How long this drama will take place and  
starts asking ENGE UNNADHU KARUNAI KANGAL.

the wish to " get something " is based on the belief that you dont have it.   
wanting to get something ( happiness ) or to get rid of something (  
unhappiness/sadness ) are 2 sides of the same coin. the ego (mind ) uses both  
sides of the coin to avoid truth. the drama is ALL in the mind. all the  
fighting is in the mind. look to see what is DRAMALESS. just stop for one  
moment and be unhappy all the way with no chance of ever being happy. .. what  
a relief it will be to not have that burden, and in that peace see if there  
is a difference between the peace and yourself. there is no difference. ...  
what a joy !
