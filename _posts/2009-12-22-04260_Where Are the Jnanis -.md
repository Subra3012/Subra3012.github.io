## Where Are the Jnanis ?

Hi   
I am having a lot of insights at the moment. And I would like to be among  
jnanis (or whoever) to discuss them. It's quite unbelievable some of the  
things I am thinking. .. like how do I know there is anyone else on the planet  
?   
Anyway. .. is there an Ashram for Jnanis or a meditation centre or a church  
somewhere on the planet where people talk about these things. Sort of like a  
working group. .. do some practice, then discuss etc...   
?

Dear I,   
On your query whether there is anyone else on the plannet. My "I' answer is  
No. There is no one else apart from your (I) Self.   
Yes there is an Ashram for Jananis or meditation centre or a church where  
people talk about all these things. exactly like a sort of working group...  
doing some practice, disscuss etc... It is in YOU (I) itself. Its the  
Discussion and doubting analysing etc... everything - between 'I' and 'I'   
There is only I everywhere. All that is seen heard everything is the I.  
nothing apart from it   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

to meet the people, and discuss with others is itself a desire. It is clear  
that, if we realise same "I" is everywhere, then what is there to discuss.   
When we feel everywhere we are present, then I think meeting the other person  
is looking ourselves in the mirror.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
If you could see everywhere, every person, every being as I, then   
you have reached state as described by Bhagavan Ramana in   
Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam, Verse 5, "Unnitathil oppuvitta uLLathal  
epozhuthum UnnaikaNdu ellamum Unnuruvai...."   
Arunachala Siva.
