One day Bhagawan is walking on Arunachala hill.Three learned people came near  
him and asked Bhagawan "what is meant by Akarma even when one is engaged   
in work".Bhagawan did not reply but took a stem of a moderate sized plant and  
started making it into a staff with the help of leaves there.It took one and  
half hours   
to prepare and give finishing touches to that staff and to the surprise of  
questioners the staff is extremely beautiful.By the time it is finished one  
shepard boy   
came there and saluted Bhagawan and asked about his welfare.Bhagawan gave that  
beauiful staff to that boy saying that it will be useful to hiim but he did  
not   
answer to the question of the learned people and went upwards.The learned  
people understood the existential message of action wihout doership without   
an eye on the fruit of action and went happily.

Dear Raju, Yes. Bhagavan demonstrated what is Nishkamya   
Karma or Naishkarmya Karma or Akarma, to the questioner.   
Bhagavan used to prepare nice curries, sambhar and rice by   
toiling for a couple of hours with kitchen workers. But at   
the lunch, He used to mix everything and took them as one   
lump, without bothering about taste!   
Arunachala Siva.

As Sri Bhagavan says: Ishvar-arpitam na ichaya kritam chitta shodakam mukti  
marganam   
[Having surrendered to God, not desiring anything, just reveling in the Self  
is the way to Liberation.]   
Actually people pick this up as a practise. That is not the way to do.   
One needs to understand a few things: a) We have a right to work, over result we do not have any control.   
So once someone understands this, one cannot strongly hold to the results.   
b) There is no Doer. .. only IShvara. So, Reveling in Self, Reveling in  
Ishvara is also not a "Task". .. it is an understanding. .. when properly  
understood, it automatically shows off in the actions as in the case of Sri  
Ramana in this story.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, I shall give you a puzzle. All of you can give their   
views. Is Desiring the Self, a desire or not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Desire for self is also a desire because like other desires it is an outcome of self-ignorance.But desire for self finally leads   
to self-enquiry and is consumed in the fire of self-knowledge that is  
conferred during enquiry,so i welcome that desire.Desire for self happens  
because of God's grace.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 That is the only desire.   
There is fundamental ignorance: I am incomplete.   
And Therefore a desire: I should become Complete.   
all desires are desires for completeness. So every one who seeks, what ever he  
seeks, is seeking completeness.   
When the object he seeks itself does not have that completeness. .. he is  
seeking at the wrong place. Hence he is called a materialist!   
When the object he seeks is a spiritual experience which can lead him out of  
incompleteness we call him a spiritual seeker.   
When he understands that the very seeking is born out of wrong knowledge. The  
seeking stops and so does the seeker and The Self Shines in full.   
Love!

dear   
subrahmaniyan ji   
In tamil sages say AASAI ARUMIN ARUMIN EESANANALUM AASAI ARUMIN   
Esan i.e. Eswar and Self both are same is not it. But i think after realising  
Eshwar the knower and known will be same so there would not be desire. Who  
will have the desire? Is not it?

Dear Ramanaduli, Yes. Tirumoolar said: You cut the desires   
all the desires, even your desire with the Self or God. He has   
advocated desisrelessness towards the Self also. But let us hear   
the others. And then work out the final answer. Once Visvanathaswami's  
brother who was a Gandhian and a freedom   
fighter came to the Asram. He had no faith in castes etc., Despite   
being a Brahmin, he deliberately sat in a non brahmin's row for   
meals. Bhagavan said that even the desirelessness to sit in   
a brahmin's row for meals is also a desire! The Self is beyond   
the desires and non desires! What do you say for this?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subrahmaniyanji   
After realaising the Self, all works, speech comes normal way. in natural way.  
So Bhagavan got realaisation and   
the SELF was moving, talking even though it had a human frame. There is no  
desire or any intention to show off.   
But without self realisation whatever people do there must be some ego touch.  
People may become slaves to their behaviour, symbols and robes. Bhagavan must  
have realised the gentleman who sat in non brahmin's row. He wanted to show  
himself that he does not believe in cast system. I think politics and  
spiritualism cannot go along. We are all ordinary atma. Karam Chand Gandhi was  
mahatma due to his selveless desire towards to one country i.e. India. Whereas  
Bhagavan is paramatma for the 14 lokhas. My mother used to advise me, even if  
you know something you must have the bowyam specially in front of mahans. All  
are Bhagavans Leelas. That much I can say.   
Ramanaduli

Dear srkudhay   
First we can touch only the objects. We cannot touch the air. but we can feel  
it. In the same way Bhagavan is now not in physical form so we cannot touch  
His feet. But having Bhakti and surrender we can feel the grace in any form  
like air because now He is in everywhere like air and space.   
Am I right?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The profound point to understand is... For none of the activities do we need  
to do anything [Perhaps if we are not standing on ground, may be we will have  
to touch it... else. .. no activity requires us to do anything].   
Same with Self. To touch the Self... nothing need be done.

Dear Ramanaduli and srkudai, When we touch the items mentioned   
by you, we are not doing anything. Only the feeling of the touch   
is there. In case of Bhagavan too, we have to only feel Him in   
our Heart, after stopping touching of other things which are worldly   
and empirical.   
Arunachala Siva.

On the subject of non-doership, I shall give a quote from Annamalai   
Swami -Final Talks: Once a questioner asked: The desire to become absorbed in the Self, seems to be some kind   
of vasana. It is still a desire, and to indulge in it implies that I must   
look for something I do not already have. With this attitude, I then   
feel that I am setting up enlghtenment as some kind of a future goal,   
and not something that is here and now. There is something very   
dualistic in this attitude, and I sometimes get the feeling that I am   
not accepting Bhagavan's will for the present moment if I am looking   
for something that is not here and now.   
Annamalai Swami: This desire is not counter productive. The desire for enlightenment   
is necessary because without it, you live never the necessary steps   
to realize the Self. A desire to walk to a particular place is necessary   
before, you take any steps. If that desire is not present, you will   
never take up the first step. When you realize the Self, that desire   
will go.   
Here again, it is only "the desire for enlightenment" that is, the process,   
and not the Self, which is the goal. I still feel that Bhagavan had   
mentioned anything directly like the desire for the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai ji   
In one way you are correct. we need not to do anything. But when? When I  
remove my ignorance of my necklace is on my neck. Until then I have to search  
till I meet some sat guru. Like Sri Ramakrishna says, till our stomach get  
filled up we will be eating and there must be noise. Once it is filled up  
there would not be any sound. KUCH NA KAHO.......   
In tamil sages say SUMMA IRUPPADHE SUKAM. until we find out our "SELF"

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The ignorance is alone is the villain of the peace. Ignorance or   
ajnana is one which makes us to have desires for worldly things,   
do things with ego and get feelings like pain and pleasure, happiness   
and misery, good and bad. Ignorance is like darkness and the   
mere presence of Knowledge removes the darkness. The   
sun or lamp should be "merely" present and it does not eradicate   
the darkenss; the darkness merely disappears.   
Arunachala Siva.
