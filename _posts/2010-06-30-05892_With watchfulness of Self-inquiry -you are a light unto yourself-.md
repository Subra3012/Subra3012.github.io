## With watchfulness of Self-inquiry "you are a light unto yourself".

Most people think of watching and deceived by themselves and start feeling  
that greater   
things are happening.Be aware of the mind,it keeps you tethered to the body  
and does not   
allow you to open your eyes to your consciousness.It keeps you engaged,  
otherwise you   
may become aware of your inner splendor of your being and enormous truth and  
glory of it.   
But once you have seen that splendor,you are not going to be deceived anymore.   
So instead of thinking of watching,start watching the thinking.This is what  
all about Self-inquiry.   
Watching will reveal secrets and mystery of your being.And as they are  
revealed the mind disappears.   
Mind is there only when you are utterly unconscious.When more light is brought  
about by   
witnessing,watching, mind disappears like darkness and darkness has no  
intrinsic strength   
in it.   
Watching in Self-inquiry is the process of going beyond the mind.Watching  
knows no judgement,   
no condemnation,no justification,no appreciation.Watching is like a mirror,it  
won't smile if your face   
is beautiful and won't feel disgusted if your face is ugly and it is  
unconcerned even if you are   
faceless.   
Watching is the beginning and 'no mind' is the fulfillment.It is a long  
pilgrimage requiring a lot of   
patience.We are offered only one moment at any given time by the existence.If  
we can transform   
that one moment into thoughtless state,why we can't change the second moment  
which also come alone   
with the same potential.We are not given two moments together.Then there is a  
possibility   
that the thoughtless gap becomes our intrinsic reality.Thought free glimpses  
show that we are on the   
right path with the right method.we cannot gain Self knowledge through others  
or through   
books or discourses,we have to earn it for ourselves by being watchful of the  
activity of the mind.   
When one is capable of sleeping without the aid of effort we have the  
intrinsic capacity to wake   
up without any effort.Watchfulness is the way without making any effort to  
wake up in the Self.   
But one has to wake up on his own from this prolonged metaphysical sleep.   
The ultimate mysteries are open only to those who do Self-inquiry with immense  
patience and   
trust in the existence.   
Thoughts do not have their own life,they are parasites,they live on our  
identifying with them.   
When you watch anger,we are not giving energy to the anger and it becomes  
impotent and   
does not affect us.It will pass on.Slowly slowly we start getting out of our  
thoughts.   
That is the whole process of Self-inquiry with its watchfulness.When we have  
broken   
connection with the thoughts then only we can watch them.Watching needs  
certain   
distance and if we are identified with the thoughts,there is no distance.   
If we put the mirror too close to the eyes,you cannot see the whole face.   
Watching destroys this oneness with the thoughts and creates a separation.   
The more you watch the bigger is the distance,the bigger the distance,the less  
energy   
your thoughts are getting from you.Soon they start dying,disappearing and in  
those   
moments we have the glimpse of light of inner Self.As watchfulness  
deepens,blissfulness   
deepens because bliss is the intrinsic quality of awareness.Many people are  
not aware of a   
single gap because their thoughts are always in a rush hour.So let us do Self-  
inquiry and be a   
light unto ourselves in the gap of thoughts and be in our natural state of  
blissfulness.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Thinking of watching is again the mind's play. Vritti is the function  
of the mind, whereas continuous consciousness transcends the mind. This is  
the natural, primal state of the Jnani or a liberated being. That is unbroken  
experience. It asserts itself when the relative consciousness subsides. Aham  
Vritti ['I' thought] is broken, Aham sphurana [the light of the 'I-I'] is  
unbroken, continuous. After the thoughts subside, the light shines forth.   
Vritti is of short duration. It is qualified, directed consciousness; or   
absolute consciousness broken up by cognition of thoughts, senses, etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Watching mind is very good. However, please tell me. .. have you tried this?   
And did you feel: 1\. We get tired if we try to watch the mind continuously   
2\. Watching mind is difficult.   
Did you feel these ?   
And if you have been practising it for long enough. .. anger and other such  
emotions are so fast that they invariably slip your watching process.   
atleast many times.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,if we watch we don't get tired.It is like mirror will not be tired  
by the number of images reflected in it.   
What happens commonly is one part of the mind assumes the role of watcher and  
it tries to watch the rest of   
the mind,In this mind is split and definitely so called watcher gets tired.In  
this type there is no qualitative   
difference between the watcher and the watched.Both are conditioned  
entities.But watchfulness born out of   
awareness is a qualitatively different phenomena.In this type of watching  
there is no judgement,condemnation,   
evaluation,categorization.This watchfulness simply reflects the contents of  
the mind "as it is"without any   
distortion.Unlike mental observation there is no attempt to manipulate the  
contents of the mind and translate   
them according to any conditioning because watchfulness of witnessing  
consciousness cannot be conditioned.   
If anger arises then it indicates that we have already slipped from witnessing  
consciousness to mind.   
Watchfulness happens by itself and it is a not action of the will.Many times  
watchfulness happens when the   
mind is free and it naturally happens during transition of mind from one mode  
to another without any effort   
on our part.Effort indicates duality and there is always conflict associated  
with it.Watchfulness is spontaneous   
and there is never a conflict involved in it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
You have used the word 'watching'. Michael James has used the   
word 'scrutiny' to express the same idea. The word scrutiny should   
not give us ideas like auditing, examining etc., etc.,   
*   
Other than our mind or power of imagination, which is just a distorted and  
illusory function of our simple non dual consciousness of being, there is no  
such thing as maya or self delusion. Our power of maya arises in the form of  
our own mind, and it and its   
effects appear to exist only so long as we imagine our mind to be this mind --  
that is, only so long as we ignore our true non dual   
self conscious being, and therefore fail to investigate or scrutinize   
the real, fundamental and essential nature of our mind. If we keenly  
scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.   
*   
Therefore, since we cannot rely upon the power of our mind to enable us to  
experience ourself as we really are, upon what power must we instead depend?  
Only upon the power of Grace, which is source from which our mind derives its  
limited power. We can attain absolute true knowledge only by the infinite  
power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

Most people think of watching and deceived by themselves and start feeling  
that greater   
things are happening.Be aware of the mind,it keeps you tethered to the body  
and does not   
allow you to open your eyes to your consciousness.It keeps you engaged,  
otherwise you   
may become aware of your inner splendor of your being and enormous truth and  
glory of it.   
But once you have seen that splendor,you are not going to be deceived anymore.   
So instead of thinking of watching,start watching the thinking.This is what  
all about Self-inquiry.   
Watching will reveal secrets and mystery of your being.And as they are  
revealed the mind disappears.   
Mind is there only when you are utterly unconscious.When more light is brought  
about by   
witnessing,watching, mind disappears like darkness and darkness has no  
intrinsic strength   
in it.   
Watching in Self-inquiry is the process of going beyond the mind.Watching  
knows no judgement,   
no condemnation,no justification,no appreciation.Watching is like a mirror,it  
won't smile if your face   
is beautiful and won't feel disgusted if your face is ugly and it is  
unconcerned even if you are   
faceless.   
Watching is the beginning and 'no mind' is the fulfillment.It is a long  
pilgrimage requiring a lot of   
patience.We are offered only one moment at any given time by the existence.If  
we can transform   
that one moment into thoughtless state,why we can't change the second moment  
which also come alone   
with the same potential.We are not given two moments together.Then there is a  
possibility   
that the thoughtless gap becomes our intrinsic reality.Thought free glimpses  
show that we are on the   
right path with the right method.we cannot gain Self knowledge through others  
or through   
books or discourses,we have to earn it for ourselves by being watchful of the  
activity of the mind.   
When one is capable of sleeping without the aid of effort we have the  
intrinsic capacity to wake   
up without any effort.Watchfulness is the way without making any effort to  
wake up in the Self.   
But one has to wake up on his own from this prolonged metaphysical sleep.   
The ultimate mysteries are open only to those who do Self-inquiry with immense  
patience and   
trust in the existence.   
Thoughts do not have their own life,they are parasites,they live on our  
identifying with them.   
When you watch anger,we are not giving energy to the anger and it becomes  
impotent and   
does not affect us.It will pass on.Slowly slowly we start getting out of our  
thoughts.   
That is the whole process of Self-inquiry with its watchfulness.When we have  
broken   
connection with the thoughts then only we can watch them.Watching needs  
certain   
distance and if we are identified with the thoughts,there is no distance.   
If we put the mirror too close to the eyes,you cannot see the whole face.   
Watching destroys this oneness with the thoughts and creates a separation.   
The more you watch the bigger is the distance,the bigger the distance,the less  
energy   
your thoughts are getting from you.Soon they start dying,disappearing and in  
those   
moments we have the glimpse of light of inner Self.As watchfulness  
deepens,blissfulness   
deepens because bliss is the intrinsic quality of awareness.Many people are  
not aware of a   
single gap because their thoughts are always in a rush hour.So let us do Self-  
inquiry and be a   
light unto ourselves in the gap of thoughts and be in our natural state of  
blissfulness.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Thinking of watching is again the mind's play. Vritti is the function  
of the mind, whereas continuous consciousness transcends the mind. This is  
the natural, primal state of the Jnani or a liberated being. That is unbroken  
experience. It asserts itself when the relative consciousness subsides. Aham  
Vritti ['I' thought] is broken, Aham sphurana [the light of the 'I-I'] is  
unbroken, continuous. After the thoughts subside, the light shines forth.   
Vritti is of short duration. It is qualified, directed consciousness; or   
absolute consciousness broken up by cognition of thoughts, senses, etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Watching mind is very good. However, please tell me. .. have you tried this?   
And did you feel: 1\. We get tired if we try to watch the mind continuously   
2\. Watching mind is difficult.   
Did you feel these ?   
And if you have been practising it for long enough. .. anger and other such  
emotions are so fast that they invariably slip your watching process.   
atleast many times.   
Love!

Dear Udai,if we watch we don't get tired.It is like mirror will not be tired  
by the number of images reflected in it.   
What happens commonly is one part of the mind assumes the role of watcher and  
it tries to watch the rest of   
the mind,In this mind is split and definitely so called watcher gets tired.In  
this type there is no qualitative   
difference between the watcher and the watched.Both are conditioned

awareness is a qualitatively different phenomena.In this type of watching  
there is no judgement,condemnation,

the mind "as it is"without any   
distortion.Unlike mental observation there is no attempt to manipulate the  
contents of the mind and translate   
them according to any conditioning because watchfulness of witnessing  
consciousness cannot be conditioned.   
If anger arises then it indicates that we have already slipped from witnessing  
consciousness to mind.   
Watchfulness happens by itself and it is a not action of the will.Many times  
watchfulness happens when the   
mind is free and it naturally happens during transition of mind from one mode  
to another without any effort   
on our part.Effort indicates duality and there is always conflict associated  
with it.Watchfulness is spontaneous   
and there is never a conflict involved in it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
You have used the word 'watching'. Michael James has used the   
word 'scrutiny' to express the same idea. The word scrutiny should   
not give us ideas like auditing, examining etc., etc.,   
*   
Other than our mind or power of imagination, which is just a distorted and  
illusory function of our simple non dual consciousness of being, there is no  
such thing as maya or self delusion. Our power of maya arises in the form of  
our own mind, and it and its   
effects appear to exist only so long as we imagine our mind to be this mind --  
that is, only so long as we ignore our true non dual   
self conscious being, and therefore fail to investigate or scrutinize   
the real, fundamental and essential nature of our mind. If we keenly  
scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.   
*   
Therefore, since we cannot rely upon the power of our mind to enable us to  
experience ourself as we really are, upon what power must we instead depend?  
Only upon the power of Grace, which is source from which our mind derives its  
limited power. We can attain absolute true knowledge only by the infinite  
power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

Most people think of watching and deceived by themselves and start feeling  
that greater   
things are happening.Be aware of the mind,it keeps you tethered to the body  
and does not   
allow you to open your eyes to your consciousness.It keeps you engaged,  
otherwise you   
may become aware of your inner splendor of your being and enormous truth and  
glory of it.   
But once you have seen that splendor,you are not going to be deceived anymore.   
So instead of thinking of watching,start watching the thinking.This is what  
all about Self-inquiry.   
Watching will reveal secrets and mystery of your being.And as they are  
revealed the mind disappears.   
Mind is there only when you are utterly unconscious.When more light is brought  
about by   
witnessing,watching, mind disappears like darkness and darkness has no  
intrinsic strength   
in it.   
Watching in Self-inquiry is the process of going beyond the mind.Watching  
knows no judgement,   
no condemnation,no justification,no appreciation.Watching is like a mirror,it  
won't smile if your face   
is beautiful and won't feel disgusted if your face is ugly and it is  
unconcerned even if you are   
faceless.   
Watching is the beginning and 'no mind' is the fulfillment.It is a long  
pilgrimage requiring a lot of   
patience.We are offered only one moment at any given time by the existence.If  
we can transform   
that one moment into thoughtless state,why we can't change the second moment  
which also come alone   
with the same potential.We are not given two moments together.Then there is a  
possibility   
that the thoughtless gap becomes our intrinsic reality.Thought free glimpses  
show that we are on the   
right path with the right method.we cannot gain Self knowledge through others  
or through   
books or discourses,we have to earn it for ourselves by being watchful of the  
activity of the mind.   
When one is capable of sleeping without the aid of effort we have the  
intrinsic capacity to wake   
up without any effort.Watchfulness is the way without making any effort to  
wake up in the Self.   
But one has to wake up on his own from this prolonged metaphysical sleep.   
The ultimate mysteries are open only to those who do Self-inquiry with immense  
patience and   
trust in the existence.   
Thoughts do not have their own life,they are parasites,they live on our  
identifying with them.   
When you watch anger,we are not giving energy to the anger and it becomes  
impotent and   
does not affect us.It will pass on.Slowly slowly we start getting out of our  
thoughts.   
That is the whole process of Self-inquiry with its watchfulness.When we have  
broken   
connection with the thoughts then only we can watch them.Watching needs  
certain   
distance and if we are identified with the thoughts,there is no distance.   
If we put the mirror too close to the eyes,you cannot see the whole face.   
Watching destroys this oneness with the thoughts and creates a separation.   
The more you watch the bigger is the distance,the bigger the distance,the less  
energy   
your thoughts are getting from you.Soon they start dying,disappearing and in  
those   
moments we have the glimpse of light of inner Self.As watchfulness  
deepens,blissfulness   
deepens because bliss is the intrinsic quality of awareness.Many people are  
not aware of a   
single gap because their thoughts are always in a rush hour.So let us do Self-  
inquiry and be a   
light unto ourselves in the gap of thoughts and be in our natural state of  
blissfulness.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Thinking of watching is again the mind's play. Vritti is the function  
of the mind, whereas continuous consciousness transcends the mind. This is  
the natural, primal state of the Jnani or a liberated being. That is unbroken  
experience. It asserts itself when the relative consciousness subsides. Aham  
Vritti ['I' thought] is broken, Aham sphurana [the light of the 'I-I'] is  
unbroken, continuous. After the thoughts subside, the light shines forth.   
Vritti is of short duration. It is qualified, directed consciousness; or   
absolute consciousness broken up by cognition of thoughts, senses, etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Watching mind is very good. However, please tell me. .. have you tried this?   
And did you feel: 1\. We get tired if we try to watch the mind continuously   
2\. Watching mind is difficult.   
Did you feel these ?   
And if you have been practising it for long enough. .. anger and other such  
emotions are so fast that they invariably slip your watching process.   
atleast many times.

Dear Udai,if we watch we don't get tired.It is like mirror will not be tired  
by the number of images reflected in it.   
What happens commonly is one part of the mind assumes the role of watcher and  
it tries to watch the rest of   
the mind,In this mind is split and definitely so called watcher gets tired.In  
this type there is no qualitative   
difference between the watcher and the watched.Both are conditioned  
entities.But watchfulness born out of   
awareness is a qualitatively different phenomena.In this type of watching  
there is no judgement,condemnation,

the mind "as it is"without any   
distortion.Unlike mental observation there is no attempt to manipulate the  
contents of the mind and translate   
them according to any conditioning because watchfulness of witnessing  
consciousness cannot be conditioned.   
If anger arises then it indicates that we have already slipped from witnessing  
consciousness to mind.   
Watchfulness happens by itself and it is a not action of the will.Many times  
watchfulness happens when the   
mind is free and it naturally happens during transition of mind from one mode  
to another without any effort   
on our part.Effort indicates duality and there is always conflict associated  
with it.Watchfulness is spontaneous   
and there is never a conflict involved in it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
You have used the word 'watching'. Michael James has used the   
word 'scrutiny' to express the same idea. The word scrutiny should   
not give us ideas like auditing, examining etc., etc.,   
*   
Other than our mind or power of imagination, which is just a distorted and  
illusory function of our simple non dual consciousness of being, there is no  
such thing as maya or self delusion. Our power of maya arises in the form of  
our own mind, and it and its   
effects appear to exist only so long as we imagine our mind to be this mind --  
that is, only so long as we ignore our true non dual   
self conscious being, and therefore fail to investigate or scrutinize   
the real, fundamental and essential nature of our mind. If we keenly  
scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.   
*   
Therefore, since we cannot rely upon the power of our mind to enable us to  
experience ourself as we really are, upon what power must we instead depend?  
Only upon the power of Grace, which is source from which our mind derives its  
limited power. We can attain absolute true knowledge only by the infinite  
power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.   
*   
Therefore, since we cannot rely upon the power of our mind to enable us to  
experience ourself as we really are, upon what power must we instead depend?  
Only upon the power of Grace, which is source from which our mind derives its  
limited power. We can attain absolute true knowledge only by the infinite  
power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

Most people think of watching and deceived by themselves and start feeling  
that greater   
things are happening.Be aware of the mind,it keeps you tethered to the body  
and does not   
allow you to open your eyes to your consciousness.It keeps you engaged,  
otherwise you   
may become aware of your inner splendor of your being and enormous truth and  
glory of it.   
But once you have seen that splendor,you are not going to be deceived anymore.   
So instead of thinking of watching,start watching the thinking.This is what  
all about Self-inquiry.   
Watching will reveal secrets and mystery of your being.And as they are  
revealed the mind disappears.   
Mind is there only when you are utterly unconscious.When more light is brought  
about by   
witnessing,watching, mind disappears like darkness and darkness has no  
intrinsic strength   
in it.   
Watching in Self-inquiry is the process of going beyond the mind.Watching  
knows no judgement,   
no condemnation,no justification,no appreciation.Watching is like a mirror,it  
won't smile if your face   
is beautiful and won't feel disgusted if your face is ugly and it is  
unconcerned even if you are   
faceless.   
Watching is the beginning and 'no mind' is the fulfillment.It is a long  
pilgrimage requiring a lot of   
patience.We are offered only one moment at any given time by the existence.If  
we can transform   
that one moment into thoughtless state,why we can't change the second moment  
which also come alone   
with the same potential.We are not given two moments together.Then there is a  
possibility   
that the thoughtless gap becomes our intrinsic reality.Thought free glimpses  
show that we are on the   
right path with the right method.we cannot gain Self knowledge through others  
or through   
books or discourses,we have to earn it for ourselves by being watchful of the  
activity of the mind.   
When one is capable of sleeping without the aid of effort we have the  
intrinsic capacity to wake   
up without any effort.Watchfulness is the way without making any effort to  
wake up in the Self.   
But one has to wake up on his own from this prolonged metaphysical sleep.   
The ultimate mysteries are open only to those who do Self-inquiry with immense  
patience and   
trust in the existence.   
Thoughts do not have their own life,they are parasites,they live on our  
identifying with them.   
When you watch anger,we are not giving energy to the anger and it becomes  
impotent and   
does not affect us.It will pass on.Slowly slowly we start getting out of our  
thoughts.   
That is the whole process of Self-inquiry with its watchfulness.When we have  
broken   
connection with the thoughts then only we can watch them.Watching needs  
certain   
distance and if we are identified with the thoughts,there is no distance.   
If we put the mirror too close to the eyes,you cannot see the whole face.   
Watching destroys this oneness with the thoughts and creates a separation.   
The more you watch the bigger is the distance,the bigger the distance,the less  
energy   
your thoughts are getting from you.Soon they start dying,disappearing and in  
those   
moments we have the glimpse of light of inner Self.As watchfulness  
deepens,blissfulness   
deepens because bliss is the intrinsic quality of awareness.Many people are  
not aware of a   
single gap because their thoughts are always in a rush hour.So let us do Self-  
inquiry and be a   
light unto ourselves in the gap of thoughts and be in our natural state of  
blissfulness.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Thinking of watching is again the mind's play. Vritti is the function  
of the mind, whereas continuous consciousness transcends the mind. This is  
the natural, primal state of the Jnani or a liberated being. That is unbroken  
experience. It asserts itself when the relative consciousness subsides. Aham  
Vritti ['I' thought] is broken, Aham sphurana [the light of the 'I-I'] is  
unbroken, continuous. After the thoughts subside, the light shines forth.   
Vritti is of short duration. It is qualified, directed consciousness; or   
absolute consciousness broken up by cognition of thoughts, senses, etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Watching mind is very good. However, please tell me. .. have you tried this?   
And did you feel: 1\. We get tired if we try to watch the mind continuously   
2\. Watching mind is difficult.   
Did you feel these ?   
And if you have been practising it for long enough. .. anger and other such  
emotions are so fast that they invariably slip your watching process.   
atleast many times.

Dear Udai,if we watch we don't get tired.It is like mirror will not be tired  
by the number of images reflected in it.   
What happens commonly is one part of the mind assumes the role of watcher and  
it tries to watch the rest of   
the mind,In this mind is split and definitely so called watcher gets tired.In  
this type there is no qualitative   
difference between the watcher and the watched.Both are conditioned  
entities.But watchfulness born out of   
awareness is a qualitatively different phenomena.In this type of watching  
there is no judgement,condemnation,   
evaluation,categorization.This watchfulness simply reflects the contents of  
the mind "as it is"without any   
distortion.Unlike mental observation there is no attempt to manipulate the  
contents of the mind and translate   
them according to any conditioning because watchfulness of witnessing  
consciousness cannot be conditioned.   
If anger arises then it indicates that we have already slipped from witnessing  
consciousness to mind.   
Watchfulness happens by itself and it is a not action of the will.Many times  
watchfulness happens when the   
mind is free and it naturally happens during transition of mind from one mode  
to another without any effort   
on our part.Effort indicates duality and there is always conflict associated  
with it.Watchfulness is spontaneous   
and there is never a conflict involved in it.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
You have used the word 'watching'. Michael James has used the   
word 'scrutiny' to express the same idea. The word scrutiny should   
not give us ideas like auditing, examining etc., etc.,   
*   
Other than our mind or power of imagination, which is just a distorted and  
illusory function of our simple non dual consciousness of being, there is no  
such thing as maya or self delusion. Our power of maya arises in the form of  
our own mind, and it and its   
effects appear to exist only so long as we imagine our mind to be this mind --  
that is, only so long as we ignore our true non dual   
self conscious being, and therefore fail to investigate or scrutinize   
the real, fundamental and essential nature of our mind. If we keenly  
scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
You have used the word 'watching'. Michael James has used the   
word 'scrutiny' to express the same idea. The word scrutiny should   
not give us ideas like auditing, examining etc., etc.,   
*   
Other than our mind or power of imagination, which is just a distorted and  
illusory function of our simple non dual consciousness of being, there is no  
such thing as maya or self delusion. Our power of maya arises in the form of  
our own mind, and it and its   
effects appear to exist only so long as we imagine our mind to be this mind --  
that is, only so long as we ignore our true non dual   
self conscious being, and therefore fail to investigate or scrutinize   
the real, fundamental and essential nature of our mind. If we keenly  
scrutinize our mind, which we experience as our seemingly   
finite individual consciousness "I", in order to discover what it really is,  
it will dissolve and merge in our true non dual self conscious being, because  
it has no reality other than that.   
*   
However, in order for us to investigate or scrutinize our mind effectively,  
Bhagavan Ramana says that Grace is necessary. Why   
is this so? When we undertake the practice of self investigation   
or self attentive being, we feel ourself to be this mind, which is the   
power of maya or self delusion. If we believe that we can attain our natural  
state of true self knowledge, by our own efforts, that is, by the power of our  
own mind, we will surely fail, because our mind is the power of self delusion,  
and hence it will delude us o an infinite variety of ways in order to ensure  
its own survival. In order for us to attain true self knowledge, therefore,  
we must surrender our mind, that is, we must entirely dissociate ourself from  
it. So long as we continue to cling to the illusion that is mind is ourself,  
it will continue to delude us.   
*   
Therefore, since we cannot rely upon the power of our mind to enable us to  
experience ourself as we really are, upon what power must we instead depend?  
Only upon the power of Grace, which is source from which our mind derives its  
limited power. We can attain absolute true knowledge only by the infinite  
power of grace, and not by the finite power of our mind, because no finite  
power can produce an infinite or absolute result.   
*   
Therefore, so long as we continue to experience ourself as this finite  
consciousness, that we call our 'mind', which we will continue to do until it  
is dissolved entirely in the clarity of true self knowledge, we must depend  
entirely upon the power of grace   
to motivate us and impel us in our efforts to practice the thought-free and  
therefore mind-free art of self attentive being.   
Arunachala Siva.

## With watchfulness of Self-inquiry "you are a light unto yourself".  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 30, 2010, 06:52:55 PM

Most people think of watching and deceived by themselves and start feeling  
that greater   
things are happening.Be aware of the mind,it keeps you tethered to the body  
and does not   
allow you to open your eyes to your consciousness.It keeps you engaged,  
otherwise you   
may become aware of your inner splendor of your being and enormous truth and  
glory of it.   
But once you have seen that splendor,you are not going to be deceived anymore.   
So instead of thinking of watching,start watching the thinking.This is what  
all about Self-inquiry.   
Watching will reveal secrets and mystery of your being.And as they are  
revealed the mind disappears.   
Mind is there only when you are utterly unconscious.When more light is brought  
about by   
witnessing,watching, mind disappears like darkness and darkness has no  
intrinsic strength   
in it.   
Watching in Self-inquiry is the process of going beyond the mind.Watching  
knows no judgement,   
no condemnation,no justification,no appreciation.Watching is like a mirror,it  
won't smile if your face   
is beautiful and won't feel disgusted if your face is ugly and it is  
unconcerned even if you are   
faceless.   
Watching is the beginning and 'no mind' is the fulfillment.It is a long  
pilgrimage requiring a lot of   
patience.We are offered only one moment at any given time by the existence.If  
we can transform   
that one moment into thoughtless state,why we can't change the second moment  
which also come alone   
with the same potential.We are not given two moments together.Then there is a  
possibility   
that the thoughtless gap becomes our intrinsic reality.Thought free glimpses  
show that we are on the   
right path with the right method.we cannot gain Self knowledge through others  
or through   
books or discourses,we have to earn it for ourselves by being watchful of the  
activity of the mind.   
When one is capable of sleeping without the aid of effort we have the  
intrinsic capacity to wake   
up without any effort.Watchfulness is the way without making any effort to  
wake up in the Self.   
But one has to wake up on his own from this prolonged metaphysical sleep.   
The ultimate mysteries are open only to those who do Self-inquiry with immense  
patience and   
trust in the existence.   
Thoughts do not have their own life,they are parasites,they live on our  
identifying with them.   
When you watch anger,we are not giving energy to the anger and it becomes  
impotent and   
does not affect us.It will pass on.Slowly slowly we start getting out of our  
thoughts.   
That is the whole process of Self-inquiry with its watchfulness.When we have  
broken   
connection with the thoughts then only we can watch them.Watching needs  
certain   
distance and if we are identified with the thoughts,there is no distance.   
If we put the mirror too close to the eyes,you cannot see the whole face.   
Watching destroys this oneness with the thoughts and creates a separation.   
The more you watch the bigger is the distance,the bigger the distance,the less  
energy   
your thoughts are getting from you.Soon they start dying,disappearing and in  
those   
moments we have the glimpse of light of inner Self.As watchfulness  
deepens,blissfulness   
deepens because bliss is the intrinsic quality of awareness.Many people are  
not aware of a   
single gap because their thoughts are always in a rush hour.So let us do Self-  
inquiry and be a   
light unto ourselves in the gap of thoughts and be in our natural state of  
blissfulness.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Thinking of watching is again the mind's play. Vritti is the function  
of the mind, whereas continuous consciousness transcends the mind. This is  
the natural, primal state of the Jnani or a liberated being. That is unbroken  
experience. It asserts itself when the relative consciousness subsides. Aham  
Vritti ['I' thought] is broken, Aham sphurana [the light of the 'I-I'] is  
unbroken, continuous. After the thoughts subside, the light shines forth.   
Vritti is of short duration. It is qualified, directed consciousness; or   
absolute consciousness broken up by cognition of thoughts, senses, etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Watching mind is very good. However, please tell me. .. have you tried this?   
And did you feel: 1\. We get tired if we try to watch the mind continuously   
2\. Watching mind is difficult.   
Did you feel these ?   
And if you have been practising it for long enough. .. anger and other such  
emotions are so fast that they invariably slip your watching process.   
atleast many times.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,if we watch we don't get tired.It is like mirror will not be tired  
by the number of images reflected in it.   
What happens commonly is one part of the mind assumes the role of watcher and  
it tries to watch the rest of   
the mind,In this mind is split and definitely so called watcher gets tired.In  
this type there is no qualitative   
difference between the watcher and the watched.Both are conditioned  
entities.But watchfulness born out of   
awareness is a qualitatively different phenomena.In this type of watching  
there is no judgement,condemnation,   
evaluation,categorization.This watchfulness simply reflects the contents of  
the mind "as it is"without any   
distortion.Unlike mental observation there is no attempt to manipulate the  
contents of the mind and translate   
them according to any conditioning because watchfulness of witnessing  
consciousness cannot be conditioned.   
If anger arises then it indicates that we have already slipped from witnessing  
consciousness to mind.   
Watchfulness happens by itself and it is a not action of the will.Many times  
watchfulness happens when the   
mind is free and it naturally happens during transition of mind from one mode  
to another without any effort   
on our part.Effort indicates duality and there is always conflict associated  
with it.Watchfulness is spontaneous   
and there is never a conflict involved in it.

The consciousness is witness to everything.   
This is so in everyone.   
Therefore redundant to tell also.   
The fact that we are saying "Observe without any conditioning", it means just  
be vigilant lest you shall fall into the flow of thoughts.   
like getting involved into the flow of thoughts.   
isnt this so ?
