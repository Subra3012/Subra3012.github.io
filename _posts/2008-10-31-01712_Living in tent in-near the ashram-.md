## Living in tent in/near the ashram?

Hello!   
I'm thinking about staying a year or so at the ashram, to find my inner guru  
(this might sound odd, but I believe I have to find a external first, and then  
awaken/become-conscious-of this 'external' guru inside myself afterwards). I'd  
like to see if I feel Bhagavan's presence at the ashram, as others have said,  
too. And last, I would also like to meet other devotees of Bhagavan, and see  
how they practise/understand his teachings.   
I believe that might be very educational.   
My question: Is it possiple to sleep in tent at or near the ashram, as I don't need much  
comfort, and I guess it would be cheaper?   
Thank you in advance   
And may you all have 'luck' on your paths towards liberation!

Dear friend,   
You can stay in the Asram guest houses for a maximum period of   
three days. Perhaps for visitors, who are coming from far off places,   
the Asram authorities may permit more time. Sleeping in a tent   
is impossible in front of the Asram or nearby because the town is   
quite crowded and the Asram is right in a national highway. The   
best thing is to find a cheap accommodation, one room with bathing   
and toiler facilities, as a paying guest in someone's house.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear friend,   
The local sadhus and beggars sleep on the road and sidewalks,   
constantly being disturbed by policmen and street dogs. This   
is the scene in many towns in India.   
Arunachala Siva.

A visit to Tiruvannamalai and Ramanasramam has tremendous impact on the mind.  
Even thinking of Tiruvannamalai and Arunachalam quietens the mind. No one can  
come to the path of self-enquiry (Who am I?) without the grace of Guru or God.  
To a question on the influence of a _jnani_ after the physical dissolution of  
the body, Bhagavan replied: "Guru, not being physical form, his contact will  
continue after his form vanishes. If one _jnani_ exists in the world, his  
influence will be felt by or benefit all people in the world and not simply  
his immediate disciples" (Day by Day with Bhagavan, Ramanasramam publication -  
Day 9-3-46). The work is, therefore, within and no search for an external  
Guru is necessary. Sometimes, the mind imagines a future situation in which  
it can fully engage in spiritual practice. This is a trick of the mind denying  
the present and imagining a 'favourable' future. Maharshi has repeatedly  
stressed that one need not change his circumstances but should pursue the  
enquiry even while engaged in activities.

Dear S. Subramanian,   
You are correct. The Self is within and Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever present. But for many people, a visit to the Asram and looking   
intently at the Hills helps, because the Power of the Presence is more.   
However, this is not obligatory. It depends upon one's convenience,   
health, money etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear rideover,   
Yes. The Hill is God's own broad acre. One can sleep there in   
a tent. You should only see that you do not trespass the   
Asramam area and also the areas of some of the other Maths,   
in the Hill.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear rideover,   
Squirrel does not have a fat ego like you. It does not have   
many thoughts excepting hunger and procreation. But you   
are a mighty monster. You will trespass into the jungles   
on the Hill and take away some sandal wood. You will peep   
into the Maths and start scandals about the non existent activities   
there. You will steal the mangoes, owned by the lesses of the   
mango trees. You can do many such things, and the squirrel   
does not do any of these "human acts".   
Arunachala Siva.
