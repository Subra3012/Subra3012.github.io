Is it possible to communicate with the death soul of a person, I have come  
across numbers accounts of people communicating to death soul for queries that  
were left unanswered when the person was alive.   
Recently in one of my girivalams i cam across such thing one at Adiannamalai  
temple.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
These things are not always true. There are many bogus claimers.   
Once when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Asramam, a group of   
people came to Him and said that Seshadri Swamigal is speaking   
to them through their special communications, [like 'planchets'   
a board with letters and a person moves his finger fast on the   
lettes which form a sentence.] and that they would ask Him to   
make some queries! Bhagavan Ramana smiled and said: "Oh,   
He is speaking to you all! Let Him come to me and tell me first   
that He is speaking to you people and then I shall make my   
queries." Bhagavan Ramana usually pooh-poohed the idea since   
it only meant diverting one from his sadhana. But He did not say   
whether such things are true or false. I also feel that we should   
not be curious about such things. They are no better than astrology,   
palmistry, Nadi sastra etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Death and Birth are only Myth. They don't exist. Its only thoughts. Nobody  
dies or nobody is ever born. There exists nobody apart from you - "I".  
Everything else is only ignorance. What dies is only thoughts.   
When your near and dear ones die, (They actually don't exist, its only a  
thought again) what happens is that you - "I" which has been experiencing Life  
from the shoes of your near one who died actually goes away. One cries because  
He thinks he can never again live the life of his near and dear one who died.   
Therefore communicating with Death Soul is all only ignorance. Is there 2  
separate souls so that one soul communicates with another soul? Does the soul  
die?   
If the arguement is that soul never dies, only body dies then why do you want  
to communicate with the soul? one must be trying to communicate with the dead  
body, why the soul?   
There is nobody to communicate to other than only OneSelf. Here too there is  
no communication. Communication exists so long ignorence about ones real  
nature comes in.   
These are all only Myths and they only deviate one from knowing himself.   
Nagaraj

Dear MagicOPromotion,   
You are correct.   
In sleep, god as a matter of grace, allows the prana, breath   
to continue, whereas the mind is temporarily under suspended   
animation. [ The prana goes in and comes out, so that others   
would not think that you are dead, this is god's grace].   
\-- Who am I?   
In dream, mind shows some mischief.   
In wakeful state, it is the mind which calls all the shots.   
In all three states, Soul or the Self or Brahman is everpresent.   
Arunachala Siva.
