Madalasa upadesha or Madalasa putropadesha is Mandalasa's cradle song to her  
crying child. Through these simple verses the mother introduces her child to  
the Truth that he already IS. To every crying child [anyone who is crying for  
what ever object], The Mother's teachings are real eye openers. If someone is  
crying. .. what ever the reason, be it for spirituality or materialistic  
object, such a person needs this teaching.   
In our tradition Mother, Father and Guru are said to be equal to God. Coz they  
introduce the child systematically to their Self. We shall see how Mandalasa  
explains the Truth to her child...   
Quote  
Verse 1: Suddhosi bubbhosi niranjanosi   
samsara maya parivarjitosi   
samsara svapnam tyaja moha nidra   
mandalasollapamuvacha putram   
Mandalasa says to her crying son: "You are pure, Enlightened, and spotless.   
Leave the illusion of the world   
and wake up from this deep slumber of delusion."   
The world which seems to bother you is actually an illusion... maya, it  
appears to be present, but not a reality. So, wake up from this delusion that  
it is real... she seems to be saying. And she also tells him that he is really  
spotless and pure... he cannot even be touched by anything!   
Usually such teaching is presented with detailed explanation. To drive the  
point to the student, it is illustrated with short stories and lot of  
practical illustrations as we can see in Yoga Vasishtam or Tripura  
Rahasyam. At other places, the teaching is presented in question/answer format  
where all the "likely" doubts of the student are discussed.   
It is natural to ask: "how do u call it a dream?" On one such occasion, a  
relative asked me, "If you are not given food, then would you call it a dream  
still?". .. to an uninitiated student who has not understood the teaching  
calling the whole world as dream would look like philosophizing unnecessarily.  
We shall study these verses more meditatively and see how our day to day life  
situations are not very different from dream experiences.   
[To continue. ..]

Its very evident that the entire Scriptures are aimed at reminding one what he  
really is. Looking at the big picture one cannot but has to accept that one is  
to be reminded about his true nature. This has been the case with all the  
realised souls who kept their foot on the Earth.   
Even Bhagawan was first reminded about his true Self by one of his Uncle, who  
when he came to his home, and Venkaraman asked where from he came? He replied  
"Arunachala"   
This reminder was enough for Venkataraman!   
Whereas for us, we have been reminding ourselves millions of times... but I  
just cant help type this word - "STILL"   
Mandalasa begins to remind the baby right from its birth its true nature. Very  
beautiful verses. Looking forward to know more!

In Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, verse 1, Bhagavan Ramana graphically   
describes this incident of his uncle mentioning about Arunachala. He   
thought it was a big thing. Then He came. He found it Achalam,   
non-moving. In verse 2, He continues: I came, I could not say 'I saw'  
because, there is no seer. Then how can I say 'I did not see'?   
I became one with Arunachala. Beautiful verses. Sri Arunachala   
Stuti Panchakam, is a pilgrimage from duality to non duality. First,   
is Aksharamanamalai, where He pines for Arunachala the Lord to marry Him.  
Then comes Navamani malai, where the same thought   
continues. In Padigam, it is a mixture. In Ashtakam, the merger   
is complete. In Arunachala Pancharatanam, He describes the various paths for  
such a merger, jnana, yoga, bhakti and karma.   
Arunachala Siva.

If i am pure, spotless and absolutely beyond everything. .. that means nothing  
can even touch me. But in reality i am troubled by the whole samsara. Whether  
or not the samsara is there to trouble me. .. it seems to torture me. How can  
i call myself pure when i am suffering?   
The problem of suffering is identified as the basic problem of human life by  
Buddha. And the cause for suffering is actually lack of Self knowledge.   
So here is a person who is suffering... since he / she is suffering, Self  
knowledge is required for them. if they are not suffering, no self knowledge  
is required. Now if i am pure how can i be affected?   
The point is; for me to get hit by a physical object; there should be a  
physical presence. if i am physical, ie, if i am something made up of the 5  
physical elements. .. then i can be hit by physical objects.   
Similarly, even if something hits this body, unless i get a thought of it,  
nothing is a problem. For any object to touch me or torture me... it has to  
become a thought in my mind. Now, if i am getting affected by thoughts and  
mental objects that means i must be a mental entity. just as for me to be  
affected by physical objects, i should be a physical entity... so too, for me  
to be affected by thoughts i should be a thought. But wait. if i am a thought,  
when thought dies i should die... which is not really happening. That cannot  
be true. So the mental identification alone is a problem here. so we shall see  
how Mandalasa teaches her child that she is not a mental thought but the  
consciousness that is an eternal witness to all thoughts. And just as a stone  
thrown can hit a building but not the space. .. so too, any thought can hit a  
mental form, but cannot hit the Consciousness which like space is formless in  
the mental world.

Quote  
suddhosi re taat na te asti naama   
krtam hi tatkalpanayadhunaiva   
panchatmakam deham idam na teasti   
naivasya tvam rodisi kasya hetoh   
My child, you are nameless and ever pure. The (name and form ) are falsely  
imposed on you.   
This body consisting of 5 elements is not you. So what makes you cry ?   
Its like puppet show. My friend and i have two puppets say. So my friend says,  
see these two are wife and husband. She even describes their likes and  
dislikes. .. eventually we start playing a whole drama with those two puppets.  
We start superimposing our likes and dislikes upon the lifeless puppets. ..  
later if we forget that they are mere puppets and really do not have any likes  
or dislikes, nor any life of their own; then there is a lot of trouble. More  
so if we identify with those puppets and start crying their losses and start  
imitating their feelings.   
The body is made up of the physical elements. This body, does not have any  
worries or sorrows. The mind, as if, takes the responsibility to cry on behalf  
of the body.   
its like this: suppose i have a diamond with me, and someone steals it away.  
The diamond does not have any sorrow... it does not have any sense of  
possessiveness. it does not even know who its owner is, nor has any  
preferences. So when the diamond is stolen, the diamond does not cry or make  
merry. But i cry and worry.   
The body too, does not have any worries. On behalf of it. .. there is someone  
who is actually [rather unnecessarily] taking up the duty of crying on behalf  
of the body.   
If there is pain, the body just conveys it. It does not suffer. Between one  
sensation and another the body has no difference... even the little difference  
found at the body level is due to preprogramming it that way. For example, the  
body does not see any difference between a picture of a beautiful girl and an  
ugly ghost. To the eyes, there is no difference. But if the pupils dialate  
upon seeing a beautiful girl, that is also due to mental programming. The mind  
is imposing its preferences upon the body.   
This game of creating likes and dislikes on dead entities is fun. .. but one  
needs to be careful not to consider it as real and get lost. One needs to  
clearly see how the likes are dislikes of the body are created by us... we  
have conditioned ourselves to believe thus. So we need to look within and see  
that we need not cry for the body or dance on its behalf.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Excellent post. Some Siddhar uses more or less the same simile.   
Two young girls play with puppets, treating them as Appa and Amma.   
One girl attains puberty. She does not like the puppet game anymore.   
On marriage, she knows what is sexual life. Then she forgets the   
puppets once and for all. On self realization, all the puppet games   
become unreal and dream-like, because one is awakened!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,   
Very beautiful verses and nice illustrations, especially the Diamond one is  
very good!   
You mentioned that _if there is pain, the body just conveys it._   
But, I feel the body is absolutely lifeless, its the same 'I' that conveys the  
pain as well. The body does not convey anything. The pain is also in the mind  
level only. what does the body know of pain or pleasure? Pain or Pleasure is  
only for the 'I' only. This also is a delusion only!   
This 'I' feels that it is inside the body and the body is its residence and  
when some other entity comes to take the body, this 'I' gets disgusted and  
fights for it does not want to share it with anybody. Like when we keep our  
finger in the fire, the 'I' immediately orders to remove the finger from the  
fire for the fear that the finger may be burnt and eaten by fire.   
Body is made up of 5 elements: Fire   
Water   
Air   
Earth   
Space   
Fire dies in water   
Water disappears in fire   
Air Dries water   
Space sucks Air   
Earth dissolves in water   
Each of the 5 elements are enemies to each other. therefore when we come into  
contact with any of the 5 elements the 'I' fears. It does not want to share  
its residence with anybody.

I came across a similar topic discussed by Bhagawan: The trouble is that it is extremely difficult to regard the body   
or the objective world as unreal. Bhagavan admitted that in   
the following dialogue: Devotee: I have a toothache; is that only a thought?   
Bhagawan: Yes.   
Devotee: Then why cant I think that there is no toothache, and   
so cure myself?   
Bhagawan: One does not feel the toothache when one is absorbed   
in other thoughts or when asleep.   
Devotee: But still it remains.   
Bhagawan: So strong is mans conviction of the reality of the world   
that it is not easily shaken off. But the world is no more real   
than the individual who sees it.   
The Seeker himself is Unreal.   
There is only one 'I' when the seeking began, the seeker was created. when the  
seeking ends the seeker dies and the 'I' remains...   
Devotee: Why did the Self manifest as this miserable world?   
Bhagawan: In order that you might seek it. Your eyes cannot see   
themselves but if you hold a mirror in front of them they see   
themselves. Creation is the mirror. See yourself first and then   
see the whole world as the Self.

Quote  
Verse 3: na vai Bhavan rodati vivshva janma,   
sabdhoya mayadya mahisha sunuma   
vikalpyamano vividhairgunaiste   
gunaasca bhutah sakalendriyesu   
The essence of the universe does not cry in reality. Due to association with  
word 'prince' you appear to have all these qualities. The qualities present in  
these sense objects do not belong to you. The qualities belong to the objects  
of perception.   
The Self is nirguna, without any attributes/qualities. So "I" have no  
qualities. .. As Awareness... I just AM.   
Now, if there are any qualities that is due to association with a name and a  
form. A nice example is given here. The moment the name "prince" is given, a  
set of qualities get attributed to what is without qualities. That is like  
playing a role. So the actor of the role is without any attributes. The moment  
we say he is going to play the role of a "prince", he will get some ornaments,  
some kind of dress, he will be termed "rich" and so on. .. the words and the  
qualities are all for operational purposes. They are fine, but the True Actor,  
has nothing to do with any of them.   
If the one who is playing the role of Ravana says "I have a huge kingdom". ..  
in the relative sense he is correct and in absolute sense it has no meaning.  
Coz the kingdom is not the actor's. The relative need not be dismissed to see  
the Absolute. When one knows one is the actor playing the role of Ravana, one  
need not stop playing the role of Ravana. The relative and the absolute are  
ever in complete harmony... ever embracing each other...   
The only differentiation one needs to make is. .. the attributes of the roles  
should not be confused with the attributes of the Self. when with my mother, i  
am the "son". That is the "son" role is predominant. The "son" role may have  
its concerns and attributes. .. like "he is a nice son" or "he is a  
philosopher son" and so on. .. the role has attributes and qualities... the  
Self has none.   
The words and forms. .. belong to the roles... the external coverings. So  
Awareness or Self is not at conflict with them or not in association with them  
... Awareness is at a totally different plane. It has no crying. .. the crying  
is of a role. .. roles cry, i need not cry. Then, whole life becomes a role  
playing game. I play the role of a son or a husband. .. and show concerns of  
the son or husband. .. but never for a moment do i forget that i am the one  
playing the role and not the role itself. And i never forget that nothing  
really affects me. .. though the roles keep getting affected.   
So there is really no conflict between the relative world of roles and the  
absolute world of Self. The Self never cries. The substratum of the whole  
universe is ever in absolute meditation. Like the skies, the sees, the oceans,  
the sands, the mountains, the Trees. .. everything is eternally rocking in  
absolute Stillness. .. Ever in complete meditationg. The Substratum of  
everything is that Pure Awareness that is never affected.   
When this is seen, one may involve in all kinds of activities but never is he  
burdened by the roles he plays. Coz he knows that he is the one who is playing  
the role and not the role itself. So he can play the role of Ravana without  
getting angry ! That is true meditation. .. not to forget one Self during  
one's day to day activities.   
Meditation is therefore not an activity in exclusion to other activities   
Meditation is actually being the Substratum of all activities.   
Love!

Its the role that plays and not the Self. But if the roles is fixed like a  
cinema then no one will contest your role. But in the roles that we play all  
the other characters in the movie are demanding a different role of the same  
character at the same time. I am playing the role but since each of the other  
roles are demanding a different role of the character the role does not really  
know which role to play in the end. in the end it is becomes a bad  
performance.   
If the role of the son is 'philosopher son' or a 'good son' if this is what  
the mother role wants then there is no problem but the if the mother role  
wants you to play some other role, and others want you to play a different son  
role?   
I feel we have to cease playing even the roles. it is short lived. for even to  
play a role is also a desire. the desire to keep the mother character happy!

Dear Naagraj,   
Let us observe closely: 1) What if the role is pulled in different directions? The mother role does  
not communicate with you. .. it communicates with the son role. It is the role  
that is getting pulled in different direction... that is you are playing the  
role of a person who is getting pulled in different directions. playing the  
role of a person who is getting pulled in different directions. .. one does  
not get frustrated. just as playing the role of a Ravana one does not get  
angry.   
2) Playing role is not a desire. You are already doing it. Here and now.   
Ceasing to play role is to remain without acting in the external world. That  
is not needed.

Dear Udai,   
Its true what you said. Just that here in me, the Vairagya to hold on to the  
knowledge that I am only the actor is not concrete enough. Each moment I shoud  
just practice remembering my real nature like for Eg. this moment as I type

I understand you. All of us have got these difficulties, occasional

Dear Nagraj,   
 The vairagya is not strong means you need to understand clearly. When one understands clearly vairagya is automatic. When one sees that the objects of the world cannot make me better. .. obviously i detach myself. now i feel the objects improve me. so i cling to them. so before trying vairagya, i should see why and how the objects cannot improve me... not just theoretically but by studying ourselves with the help of a good Guru.
