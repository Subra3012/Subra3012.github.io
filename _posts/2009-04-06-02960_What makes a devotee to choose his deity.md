What makes a devotee to choose his deity that is Vishnu or Shiva.   
My personal life at the beginning was for Vishnu slowly I worshiped shiva. Now  
I worship both the gods.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
In olden days people from all castes, not only Brahmins, had a Kula   
Devata, a family god. Thereafter, a person, develops interest in another  
form of God, through his reading or personal experience. This is called Ishta  
Devata, the liked-God. This practice is common to   
all persons in Hinduism. A king like Raja Raja Chozhan developed great  
interest in Siva and he built the Big Temple in Thanjavur. Saint   
Arunagiri Natha chose Muruga. This happened after a miracle in his   
life, when extreme passion towards women, was chastised by his sister and  
Muruga appeared before him. This sort of thing can happen to anyone,  
regardless of his Kula Devata. There is one A.S. Raghavan,   
a Sri Vaishnavite by birth, now in Chennai, formerly in New Delhi.   
He had acute non-stop stomach pain and doctors had lost hope to save him.  
Someone suggested to pray to Tiruchendur Muruga. He   
prayed and got relieved. He started a Tiruppugazh Devotees Group in New Delhi  
and started having bhajans of Muruga songs. He also rendered these songs  
under various ragas and today there are bhajan groups all over India following  
his musical rendering and having weekly meetings. This Group is now 50 years  
old. Mr.A.S. Raghavan has rendered 501 songs so far to music and a book  
containing only these songs (out of 1350 of Saint Arunagiri Natha) has come  
out 8 editions and is sold (Hardbound books) for Rs 60! Audios cassettes and  
CDs have come out. Another Sri Vaishnavite scholar by name Mr. Gopala Ratnam,  
has translated all the 1350 songs in English and has published it through his  
blog: www.kaumaram.com. I know one   
Madhva brahmin by name Vyasa Rao. He sings all five hundred Tiruppugazh songs  
melodiously. His mother tongue is Tulu and his family deity is Krishna.  
There are many many such stories on Ishta Devatas. Things can happen the  
other way also. Siva scholars have become staunch Sri Vaishanavites, like  
Tiru Mazhisai Azhwar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
You are correct. Bhagavan Ramana had said that Major Chadwick   
was in India as a Hindu in his previous birth. He also said that   
Annamalai Swami could not have come to Him, but for his love for   
Siva in his previous birth.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramakrishna says thus: When a person is born of the spirit of Siva, he becomes a Jnani.   
His constant tendency is towards the consciousness that Brahman alone is true  
and this world is false.   
But when a person is born of the spirit of Vishnu,   
in him faith and devotion never fail.   
Even if, for a time, these virtues shrink by the strong influx of reason or  
dialectic knowledge,   
in the fullness of time they increase copiously like the Mushala (a pestle)  
that brought ruin to the Yadava   
dynasty.

Dear silengtreen,   
It is said that Vishnu is the greatest Siva-Jnani and Siva is the   
greatest Mukunda-priya! They represent devotion and wisdom.   
Arunachala Siva.
