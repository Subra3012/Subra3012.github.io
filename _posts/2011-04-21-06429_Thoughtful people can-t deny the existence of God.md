Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, industrialists and  
scientists have fantasized about a symbiotic factory setup. Consider two  
hypothetical factories A & B. Suppose the two factories could be arranged such  
that the waste product of factory A would serve as a raw material for factory  
B and the waste product of factory B would serve as a raw material for factory  
A. Then the factory setup would able to run perpetually with zero expenditure  
and unlimited profit! However this has always been nothing more than a  
fantasy. The raw materials in every factory are quite expensive to obtain and  
the waste products are quite useless and expensive to even dispose off.   
Amazingly enough, such a symbiotic factory setup already exists in nature: human respiration & plant photosynthesis. At every moment we human beings  
breathe in O2 & give out CO2.   
O2 is life-sustaining & CO2 is life-destroying, if present in excessive  
quantity. Therefore the human respiration by itself would diminish the supply  
of O2 & increase CO2 in the atmosphere soon making the atmosphere & the planet  
inhabitable for human beings and indeed all O2-breathing creatures.   
But there is a magnificent balance system in nature which exactly takes in the  
waste product of the human respiration CO2 & gives out the raw material for  
respiration O2 - plant photosynthesis.   
Isnt it remarkable that what the best scientists on the planet could nothing  
more dream about has already realized by nature? Albert Einstein has remarked,  
"There are two ways to live life. One is to see nothing as a miracle & other  
is to see everything as a miracle."   
Some people say that nature certainly works remarkably, but its working is  
automatic & more or less governed by chance. They argue that seeing any  
divinity or God controlling nature is just a sentimental longing coming from  
an unscientific mentality.   
However the word automatically used in this context is somewhat misleading  
because it doesnt indicate the absence of a controller, but rather the  
absence of the knowledge of the controller.   
When we say that a machine works automatically, what it means is that the  
machine doesnt require continuous interaction with the operator. But still  
there is an operator who activates the machine and monitors its working. Is  
that the case with nature?   
E.g. If you want to have fun with a child, then you might get an automatic toy  
i.e. either a mechanically or in some other way programmed toy. By staying out  
of view of the child, you release the toy & it comes moving into the view of  
the child.   
Seeing the toy moving automatically, the child becomes astounded and thinks  
that the toy is working by itself. But you a wise person will never be misled  
into the conclusion of an inexperienced child. You know that even if the toy  
is moving automatically, it is programmed by you.   
Similarly the magnificent phenomena in nature are not just occurring  
automatically; they are working under the expert but remote and therefore  
invisible programming of God.   
Uninformed people, like the naive child, may think that nature is working  
automatically, but wise people throughout history  religious and scientific   
have always understood that there is a super-intelligent designer behind  
nature. Thus it is that the famous physicist Lord Kelvin has remarked, "If you  
think deeply enough you will be forced by science to believe in God."   
_______________________________________________

producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is  
created and annihilated again and again ~ Lord Krsna [Bg 9.10]

Dear prasanth,   
Wonderful explanation. Thank you. God's ways are inscrutable.   
How does the tough coconut consist inside the delicious coconut   
water? Who kept a hundred seeds inside the pomegranade? Who   
taught the new born baby to look for its mother's breast for food?   
If you think of these things, you will realize that there is a great   
designer for all these. But no one can find the source code for these   
designs.   
Sri Bhagavan says in Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai, Verse 80: Mudi adi kaaNa mudi viduthu anai ner   
Mudi vida kadanilai arunachala!   
[anai = Annai, Mother.]   
Our ego is a knot for which there is no beginning and no end.   
You have undone the knot which shows no beginning and no end.   
And now should yo not like a mother complete the task, O Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.**

Seems to me, we have amazing intelligence in the universe. I don't really  
understand how people can't see it, or call it all a chance happening. I was  
at one time an atheist. I just wasn't thinking big enough. The quote by Kelvin  
is spot on. Scientific advancement is going to destroy atheism.And hopefully a  
new wider understanding will begin.

Dear kde,   
I remember to have read a long time back. Einstein after his discovery of  
general theory of relativity, where he found that time and space are inter-  
related and after Hisenberg found out the particle - wave theory, where by he  
found out that a particle can also be sometimes a wave and the exact status of  
a particle or a wave cannot be determined, in his famous uncertainty  
principle. both of them became theists. Einstein had a huge board left on his  
room in Syracuse University: I now believe in God but he is very subtle.

Dear Subramanian, I have heard Richard Dawkins admit more or less the same as  
Einstein wrote.   
I went thru his book THE GOD DELUSION, but found nothing to make me change my  
mind. I think biology is his subject, it certainly not philosophy. I think  
deep down we all know better.   
When I was an atheist I used to hate God. Where is the sense in that!

Dear kde,   
About a year or so back, scientists in a laboratory in French-Swiss   
border, called CERN, started with a device called Large Hadron Collider and  
allowed two particles to collide with each other at a near light speed, to  
find out what is called Boson's Particle or God's Particle, the primary basic  
material which had formed immediately after big bang. Many physicists  
including Stephen Hawking said in advance, that they can never find out God's  
particle. Because God is not some where outside, but within the Heart of  
everyone. The Large Hadron Collider stopped working many times in between.   
A couple of days back I read in newspapers that they have found out   
a particle and it is not yet officially announced because it is not   
God's particle but some other primary particle like Neutron, Positron   
etc.,!   
This is where science and Atma Vichara differs. Atma Vichara says   
God is within us and scientists say that God is somewhere in a laboratory in  
French-Swiss border. It is like sitting on a crocodile   
[thinking it is a log of wood] and someone trying to cross a river.   
Arunachala Siva.**

Dear Subramanian, I remember watching a tv program about the Large Hadron  
Collider. I think the God particle is the one that gives "matter" weight or  
mass, something like that. I don't really understand physics.   
As far as I can see matter is nothing more that thought whatever the particles  
maybe.   
I didn't know Stephen Hawking had said that they will never find the God  
particle.   
Outside CERN they have a statue shiva, or is it siva?

Dear kde,   
It should be written as Siva in English. But S must be pronounced   
as between Si and Shi. The Sanskrit letter has no equivalent in   
English or Tamizh. It is sometimes written as S'.   
Stephen Hawking has said as soon as the experiment started in   
CERN, that the scientists can never discover God's particle. He betted one  
million dollars for the same. It came in newspapers   
in India.

time will come when science will prove God. The evidence will be undenyable.   
The very same fact, that any scientist gets idea (not constructs it or creates  
it) but gets idea from 'somewhere' at the exact moment and exact place, shows  
that they are dependent upon 'something' or 'no-thing' which gives these ideas  
and guides the world. The problem is "I created it", "I proved it", "I did  
this, I did that", this stops from investigation which shows clearly that  
truly not I but He made an idea to descend upon my mind.

Dear amiatall,   
Science can never prove God. It can at best come to a close surmise   
about the existence of God. Because God is an experience. Experience is  
something within one seeker. How can a general proof   
of this experience be discovered? Even one's thoughts, another cannot prove.  
The lie detecting machines are not even able to detect the lie uttered by an  
accused. Because the accused can keep the lie deep within, with the result,  
the questions and answers asked with the help of these machines are not able  
to detect the lie many times. The Experience of God is deeper within, beyond  
the mind and ego. This can at best be surmised.   
I invite other views in this matter.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
It may appear so now, but who knows, Gods ways cannot be left fixed like in  
"it is impossible" point of view.   
Speaking of science, the very new science is being born which is called  
Subjective Science. Finally, after avoiding "subjective" for so many years, or  
should I say forever, some scientists just opens a possibility for discoveries  
in this field. They admit that this science will be more clear only after 30  
years or so. Since 3 scientists do experiments with subjective world and all  
three comes to the same experience and conclusion following certain steps, it  
shows that the subjective world has some commonalities in each one of us. The  
only problem is that you cannot show it to others, it is like spirituality you  
say "practice practice and you will see". It means that the only way to show  
people is to make them do or go same way you went. Then one can say "ah, I see  
it myself, no need for proof" whereas in objective science all say "ah we see  
it now, because scientists say so and shows us so", but the fact is I do not  
have a microscope or telescope so I cannot truly have evidence of what is  
being told to me through media, in both cases I need to see for myself. So,  
where is the difference? None in reality, plenty in mind.   
So, speaking in this context, you may call many ancient scriptures as evidence  
of God or the power or "something" which is beyond our understanding, the same  
scriptures scientifically says "do these steps and you will see", yet no one  
looks at this in this context.   
I know for sure that God and science will merge, you can nail me on cross, and  
I am pretty sure even in this life time you will be able to witness it. Till  
then... well, i am just a babbling idiot

Big scienctists are always working on a unknown matter. If they find  
something, they will be awarded. But after sometime, other scienctist will  
make effort to prove better than previous theory. So there is no end for  
researching on the material things.   
In the same way, saints also researched inwardly and doing "nethi nethi' they  
will come to the result but thier result cannot be written or spoken. Because  
it is called inner experience. These saints also scientists in metaphysics  
subject. Their experiences are the results what they have found it. In tamil  
saints say, KANDAVARGAL VINDATHILLAI. So we people should decide which science  
we should study.
