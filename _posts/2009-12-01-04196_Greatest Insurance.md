## Sri Arunachaleswarar Kartikai Festival  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 29, 2009, 09:59:00 AM

Sri Arunachaleswara Temple's Kartikai festival started during last   
week. On the 5th day, that is on 26th instant, there was procession in  
Rishabha Vahana. Mother Unnamulai and Father Arunachaleswara   
mounted on a big silver bull, comes out of the temple for procession.   
There is a video clipping for about 4 mintues in the official website   
of the Asramam. The picture is fantastic. The bull is really big   
and the cute little Mother and cute little Father are seated majestically.  
The vahanam should be really heavy and I see from   
the video, scores of people lifting it and bring it outside the temple,   
by climbing a few steps with hard work and extreme care.   
Nandanar in Periya Puranam says "Ayya, malai pol paduthirukku   
our madu." "O Lord, there is a mountain like bull sitting before   
your form." It is really a big bull. In Bangalore, Mysore and   
Thanjavur there are huge bills. And Thanjavur Bull, I am told   
is carved out of a single stone.   
On the 6th Day, that is on 27th instant, there was a procession   
of Arunachaleswara, Apeetkuchambal and sixty three saints,   
on silver car, smaller ones. This 63rd Saints Festival is quite   
famous in Mylapore, Chennai. There is no video on this from   
the offical website of Sri Ramanasramam.   
On the 7th Day, that is on 28th instant, there were Panchamurti Mara Rathams.  
That is Arunachleswara, Apeetakuchambal, Vinayaka, Skanda, and Chandikeswara,  
were coming huge   
wooden cars, the Father's car being the largest. It was moving   
slowly with hundreds of people pulling it with a pair of ropes,   
crying Annamalaikku Arohara, Annamalaikku Arohara.... Victory   
to Annamalai, Victory to Annamalai. Vinayaka first came, then Siva and then  
the Mother, followed by Skanda, and Chandikeswra, the   
guardian angel of Siva's temples. There is a four minute Asramam video  
clipping on this.   
Once on the Wedding day of Arunachala and Unnamulai, devotees of Bhagavan from  
the Asramam, went out to see the functions and returned telling the  
descriptions to Bhagavan. They also brought with them vibhuti and kumkum.  
Bhagavan Ramana applied them on His forehead and said with great joy: Today  
is the wedding of My Mother with My Father! This is in month of Phalgun,  
Uttara star day.   
(March-April).   
Today is Arunachaleswra's royal visit to the streets, called Veedhi   
Ula, in Tamil.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Mahan Viitoba  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 01, 2009, 10:46:26 AM

Mahan Vittoba was living in PoLur near Tiruvannamalai. He was   
a Saurashtra family and knew only Hindi. He was a great Jnani   
but given to various quixotic ways of behaviour. For long months,   
he used to remain silent and even laughing within himself like   
a madman. Once in a village called Tiruchur (not Kerala Thrissur),   
some miscreants took an cutting player and pierced his cheek.   
He cried: Oh, Vittoba. Thus he came to be called as Mahan   
Vittoba.   
Akhilandamma (Desuramma) used to feed him occasionally.   
Many times, he had refused the food and even spit it out. He   
used to live near a foul smelling drainage. Once a village   
accountant was driving to drive him away with a stick and as   
the accountant rose his hand, he became paralyzed. He prostrated before him  
and sought forgiveness.   
Vittoba once spat every bit mango fruit that was offered to him   
but when Akhilandamma went to him, a little later, with hot   
rice and rasam, he took it fully and even asked for more.   
When Mahan Vittoba left the world, Seshadri Swamigal exclaimed   
in Tiruvannamalai: "O Vittoba is going, O Vittoba is going."   
People knew his nirvana only after Seshadri Swami said so.

Arunachala Siva.

## Greatest Insurance  
Author: silentgreen         Date: December 01, 2009, 12:32:18 PM

It is said that the greatest insurance is to do good to others.   
The investment is deposited with God.   
It may come back in any form even without our knowledge, at the appropriate  
time.   
There is no corruption in that office.   
There is also no chances of bankruptcy.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I? "What one gives to   
others, he is giving it to himself. If one knows this, who will not   
but give?" There is a tremendous amount of meaning in this   
sentence.   
Arunachala Siva.
