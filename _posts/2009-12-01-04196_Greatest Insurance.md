It is said that the greatest insurance is to do good to others.   
The investment is deposited with God.   
It may come back in any form even without our knowledge, at the appropriate  
time.   
There is no corruption in that office.   
There is also no chances of bankruptcy.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I? "What one gives to   
others, he is giving it to himself. If one knows this, who will not   
but give?" There is a tremendous amount of meaning in this   
sentence.   
Arunachala Siva.
