## Appearence of the world

Is it true that world is known or appears only when you attend to it?

Dear PSVNN Raju, The world appears and is known only when   
a man operates the mind. You can ask, if you do no operate the   
mind, will not the world appear for others? The relationship is   
only with a person and not with all the persons in the world.   
Imagine, some Martians come down to earth and kill every person!   
Then the world will not appear, because there is no one to operate   
the mind! The world appears only with the mind. This is what   
Bhagavan says in Who am I? So also is the case with individual   
soul and the personal gods. These appear only with the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Usually, Sheshadri Ashramam, which is just next to Ramanashramam is the next  
best option. Their contact No is +91 4175 236999 and usually, accommodation is  
easily available!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. As Nagaraj said Sri Seshadri Asramam is the second best. Or if   
you know Telugu, you can stay in Kavyakanta Sastri's Asramam (or   
Choultry?) by speaking to them over phone. My wife and a few of   
her bhajan friends went all by themselves and they stayed in that   
Asramam (or choulry).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Yes, there is ample car parking space available at Sri Ramanashramam. it is a  
good idea to make the journey by car, there are a lot of places of interest in  
and around Arunachala.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear SLakshmi,   
It is safe for a single woman PROVIDED YOU TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS. You are safe  
strictly within the ashram premises only. You are much better off in a group  
when you go to the town or when you climb the hill.   
Dear Subrap,   
You can park your car in the ashram. However the ashram gates close by 8.45PM.  
Your car cannot enter or leave the ashram after that time until around 6AM.  
Check with the office.

Dear Sadhak,   
Thanks for your advise. I think 8.45pm closure is fine with me, however, I  
will confirm it when I check in.   
Cheers

There are normally package tours to Arunachala from nearby cities like  
Chennai, Bangalore etc. These tours may not be wholly dedicated to  
Thiruvannamalai but cover other important places nearby like Pondichery etc.  
So any single person who would like to visit Arunachala but cannot make it by  
themselves may avail such tours. Oftentimes it more enjoyable to travel by  
package tours traveling worry free without having to take care of lot of  
arrangements.

In Tiruvannamalai, the best place to stay is either Sri Ramanasramam guest   
houses, or Sri Seshadri Swami Ashram rooms or Kavyakanta's choultry.   
For circumambulation, it is better to go with a group, even if they are   
unknown to you, but in circumambulation) than alone. The best time   
is Poornima time, like 28th Feb. Start at around 5 am and finish it before   
say, 9.30 am. Go by the outermost route, which is a tar-road. One should   
go without footwear, if one could bear with T'malai heat. You can take some  
water or cool drinks with you. Do not keep talking. Keep chanting some   
prayers and go. Kali is there at your sides, in front and in the back. This   
conviction is the most important.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Lakshmi,   
Can we stay in Sheshadri swamigal's ashram? Do we have to write to them and  
how many days we can stay there.   
Please furnish the details.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli/S.Lakshmi,   
What S.Lakshmi is referring should be at Seshadri Swamigal   
Ashram and other ashrams. Regarding Sri Ramanasramam, there   
is no fee but there is restriction to stay only for 3 days or at best   
4 days. Of course, all these Ashrams need prior approval and   
their confirmation.   
Arunachala Siva.
