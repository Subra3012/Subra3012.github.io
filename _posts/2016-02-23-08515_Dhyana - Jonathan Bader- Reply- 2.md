The fixity of his gaze suggests that the meditator has also put an end to the  
activity of the senses.   
This is accomplished by a withdrawal (pratyahara) of the sensory organs so  
that there is no longer   
any interaction with sensory stimuli. These three practices, asana, pranayama,  
and pratyahara (Yoga   
Sutra) go together with the requisite moral conduct. The YS provides details  
of necessary moral   
principles, which comprise the first two steps of the eight-fold yoga practice  
(ashtanga yoga). The first   
step, Yama, designates a series of 'restraints': not causing injury to living  
beings, non covetousness,   
non stealing, truthfulness and continence. (YS. 2.30) The second step, Niyama,  
involves a series of   
'observances': purity, contentment, austerity, study and devotion to the Lord  
(YS. 2.32.). They constitute   
the foundation upon which meditation is based.   
When the aspirant is thus prepared, he may then strive to achieve mastery of  
the mind. The mind is first   
fixed in concentration (dharana), focused exclusively on a single object. It  
is only then that the 'uniform   
train of thought', characteristic of dhyana, can be developed. Sankara likens  
this current of unbroken   
thought to the way oil pours. A fine and continuous stream. (BG. bhasya  
13.24). Dhyana culminates   
in Samadhi, absorption. Samadhi occurs when all sense of separateness  
disappears. The one who   
meditates, the act of meditation and the object of meditation merge into one.  
This identity manfests   
itself by shining forth in the light of the object.
