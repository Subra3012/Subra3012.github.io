**_Gajendra 's Prayers of Surrender_**  
_Gajendra said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, Vasudeva [om namo  
bhagavate vasudevaya].   
 Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He  
is therefore the root cause of everyone.   
He is worshipable for such exalted Gods as Brahma and Shiva, and He has  
entered the heart of every living being.   
Let me meditate upon Him.   
The Supreme Godhead is the supreme platform on which everything rests,   
the ingredient by which everything has been produced,   
and the person who has created and is the only cause of this cosmic  
manifestation.   
 Nonetheless, He is different from the cause and the result.   
I surrender unto Him, the Supreme Lord, who is self-sufficient in everything.   
The Supreme Lord, by expanding His own energy,   
keeps this cosmic manifestation visible and again sometimes renders it  
invisible.   
He is both the supreme cause and the supreme result, the observer and the  
witness, in all circumstances.   
Thus He is transcendental to everything. May that Supreme Lord give me  
protection.   
In due course of time, when all the causative and effective manifestations of  
the universe,   
 including the planets and their directors and maintainers, are annihilated,  
there is a situation of dense darkness.   
Above this darkness, however, is the Supreme Lord, I take shelter of His lotus  
feet.   
An artist onstage, being covered by attractive dresses and dancing with  
different movements, is not understood by his audience;   
 similarly, the activities and features of the Supreme Artist cannot be  
understood even by the demigods or great sages,   
and certainly not by those who are unintelligent like animals.   
Neither the demigods and sages nor the unintelligent can understand the  
features of the Lord,   
 nor can they express in words His actual position. May that Supreme Lord give  
me protection.   
Renunciants and great sages who see all living beings equally,   
 who are friendly to everyone and who flawlessly practice in the forest the  
vows of brahmacarya [celibate student],   
vanaprastha [retired] and sannyasa [renunciation] desire to see the all-  
auspicious lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.   
May that same Supreme Lord be my destination.   
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material birth, activities, name,  
form, qualities or faults.   
To fulfill the purpose for which this material world is created and destroyed,   
He comes in the form of a human being like Lord Rama or Lord Krishna by His  
original internal potency.   
 He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material  
contamination, He acts wonderfully.   
He is therefore the Supreme Brahman. I offer my respects to Him.   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, the self-effulgent  
Supersoul,   
who is the witness in everyone's heart, who enlightens the individual soul   
and who cannot be reached by exercises of the mind, words or consciousness.   
The Supreme Lord is realized by pure devotees who act in the transcendental  
devotion.   
 He is the bestower of uncontaminated happiness and is the master of the  
transcendental world.   
Therefore I offer my respects unto Him.   
I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Vasudeva, who is all-pervading, to  
the Lord's fierce form as Lord Nrisimhadeva,   
to the Lord's form as an animal [Lord Varahadeva],to Lord Dattatreya, who  
preached impersonalism, to Lord Buddha,   
and to all the other incarnations.I offer my respectful obeisances unto the  
Lord,   
who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities of goodness,  
passion and ignorance within this material world.   
 I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.  
_**   
**_I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto You,   
who are the Supersoul, the superintendent of everything, and the witness of  
all that occurs.   
 You are the Supreme Person, the origin of material nature and of the total  
material energy.   
You are also the owner of the material body. Therefore, You are the supreme  
complete.   
 I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.   
My Lord, You are the observer of all the objectives of the senses.   
Without Your mercy, there is no possibility of solving the problem of doubts.   
The material world is just like a shadow resembling You.   
Indeed, one accepts this material world as real because it gives a glimpse of  
Your existence.   
My Lord, You are the cause of all causes, but You Yourself have no causes.  
Therefore You are the wonderful cause of everything.   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic  
knowledge contained in the shastras   
 like the Pancharatras and Vedanta-sutra, which are Your representations, and  
who are the source of the parampara system.   
Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all  
transcendentalists.   
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.   
My Lord, as the fire in arani wood is covered, You and Your unlimited  
knowledge are covered by the material modes of nature.   
Your mind, however, is not attentive to the activities of the modes of nature.  
T   
hose who are advanced in spiritual knowledge are not subject to the regulative  
principles directed in the Vedic literature.   
Because such advanced souls are transcendental, You personally appear in their  
pure minds.   
Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.   
Since an animal such as I has surrendered unto You,   
who are supremely liberated, certainly You will release me from this dangerous  
position.   
Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver me.   
Like Paramatma, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings.   
 You are celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited.   
 I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Personality of  
Godhead.   
My Lord, those who are completely freed from material contamination   
always meditate upon You within the depths of their hearts.   
 You are extremely difficult to attain for those like me who are too attached  
to mental concoction,   
home, relatives, friends, money, servants and assistants.   
You are the Supreme Lord, uncontaminated by the modes of nature.   
You are the reservoir of all enlightenment, the supreme controller.   
I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.   
After worshiping the Supreme Lord, those who are interested in the four  
principles of religion,   
economic development, sense gratification and liberation obtain from Him what  
they desire.   
What then is to be said of other benedictions?   
 Indeed, sometimes the Lord gives a spiritual body to such ambitious  
worshipers.   
May that Supreme God, who is unlimitedly merciful,   
bestow upon me the benediction of liberation from this present danger and from  
the materialistic way of life.   
True devotees, who have no desire other than Him,   
worship Him in full surrender and always hear and speak about His activities,  
which are most wonderful and auspicious.   
Thus they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees  
never ask the Lord for any benediction.   
I, however, am in danger. Thus I pray to the Supreme Lord, who is eternally  
existing,   
who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahma,  
and who is available only by transcendental devotion.   
 Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and  
transcendental to all external realization.   
He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely full in  
everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.   
The Supreme Lord creates His minor parts and parcels, the jiva-tattva,  
beginning with Lord Brahma,   
 the demigods and the expansions of Vedic knowledge [Sama, Rig, Yajur and  
Atharva Vedas]   
and including all other living entities, moving and nonmoving, with their  
different names and characteristics.   
As the sparks of a fire or the shining rays of the sun emanate from their  
source and merge into it again and again,   
the mind, the intelligence, the senses, the gross and subtle material bodies,   
and the continuous transformations of the different modes of nature all  
emanate from the Lord and again merge into Him.   
He is neither demigod nor demon, neither human nor bird nor beast.   
He is not woman, man or neuter, nor is He an animal.   
 He is not a material quality, a fruitive activity, a manifestation or  
nonmanifestation.   
He is the last word in the discrimination of "not this, or not that," and He  
is unlimited.   
 All glories to the Supreme Lord.   
I do not wish to live anymore this life of an elephant..   
What is the use of an elephant's body covered externally and internally by  
ignorance?   
I simply desire eternal liberation from the covering of ignorance.   
 That covering is not destroyed by the influence of time.   
Now, fully desiring release from material life,   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person who is the creator  
of the universe,   
who is Himself the form of the universe and who is nonetheless transcendental  
to this cosmic manifestation.   
He is the supreme knower of everything in this world, the Soul of the  
universe.   
He is the unborn, supremely situated Lord. I offer my respectful obeisances  
unto Him.   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, the Supersoul, the master  
of all mystic yoga,   
who is seen in the core of the heart by perfect mystics when they are  
completely purified   
and freed from the reactions of fruitive activity by practicing devotion.   
My Lord, You are the controller of formidable strength in three kinds of  
energy.   
You appear as the reservoir of all sense pleasure and the protector of the  
surrendered souls.   
You possess unlimited energy, but You are unapproachable by those who are  
unable to control their senses.   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again.   
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, by whose illusory  
energy the jiva [individual soul],   
forgets his real identity because of the bodily concept of life.   
I take shelter of the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, whose glories are difficult to  
understand.

I am Narayaṇa among the sages and Sanat-kumara among brahmacaris.

mong those who have divided the Vedas I am Kṛṣṇa Dvaipayana Vedavyasa, a   
nd among learned scholars I am Sukracarya, the knower of spiritual science.   
Among those entitled to the name Bhagavan I am Vasudeva,   
and indeed, you, Uddhava, represent Me among the devotees.   
I am Hanuman among the Kimpuruṣas, and among the Vidyadharas I am Sudarsana.   
Among jewels I am the ruby, and among beautiful things I am the lotus cup.   
Among all types of grass I am the sacred kusa,   
and of oblations I am ghee and other ingredients obtained from the cow.   
 Among the enterprising I am fortune, and among the cheaters I am gambling.   
 I am the forgiveness of the tolerant and the good qualities of those in the  
mode of goodness.   
Of the powerful I bodily and mental strength, and I am the devotional  
activities of My devotees.   
My devotees worship Me in nine different forms, among which I am the original  
and primary Vasudeva.   
Among the Gandharvas I am Visvavasu, and I am uūrvacitti among the heavenly  
Apsaras.   
 I am the steadiness of mountains and the fragrant aroma of the earth.   
I am the sweet taste of water, and among brilliant things I am the sun.   
I am the effulgence of the sun, moon and stars, and I am the transcendental  
sound that vibrates in the sky.   
Among those dedicated to brahminical culture I am Bali Maharaja, the son of  
Virocana,   
 and I am Arjuna among heroes. Indeed, I am the creation, maintenance and  
annihilation of all living entities.   
 I am the functions of the five working senses ? the legs, speech, anus, hands  
and sex organs   
 ? as well as those of the five knowledge-acquiring senses ? touch, sight,  
taste, hearing and smell.   
 I am also the potency by which each of the senses experiences its particular  
sense object.   
I am form, taste, aroma, touch and sound; false ego; the mahat-tattva;   
earth, water, fire, air and sky; the living entity; material nature; the modes  
of goodness, passion and ignorance;   
 and the transcendental Lord.   
All these items, along with knowledge of their individual symptoms   
 and the steady conviction that results from this knowledge, represent Me.   
As the Supreme Lord I am the basis of the living entity, of the modes of  
nature and of the mahat-tattva.   
Thus I am everything, and nothing whatsoever can exist without Me.   
Even though over a period of time I might count all the atoms of the universe,   
I could not count all of My oppulences which I manifest within innumerable  
universes.   
Whatever power, beauty, fame, opulence, humility, renunciation, mental  
pleasure, fortune, strength,   
 tolerance or spiritual knowledge there may be is simply an expansion of My  
opulence.   
 I have briefly described to you all My spiritual opulences and also the  
extraordinary material features of My creation,   
which are perceived by the mind and defined in different ways according to  
circumstances.   
Therefore, control your speaking, subdue the mind, conquer the life air,   
 regulate the senses and through purified intelligence bring your rational  
faculties under control.   
 In this way you will never again fall onto the path of material existence.   
A transcendentalist who does not completely control his words   
and mind by superior intelligence will find that his spiritual vows,   
austerities and charity flow away just as water flows out of an unbaked clay  
pot.   
Being surrendered to Me, one should control the speech, mind and life air,   
 and then through loving devotional intelligence one will completely fulfill  
the mission of life.

**_What Prahlada Learned in the Womb_**  
_All the six conditions of the body which can be observed, beginning with  
birth,   
just like they are seen with the fruits of a tree   
[that come about, exist materially, grow, transform, dwindle and perish],   
these conditions and changes do not apply to the Soul.   
The Soul is eternal, does not dwindle,pure and individual,   
It is the knower and different from the material body,   
without the material contamination,the original foundation,   
the unchanging, self-illumined,the cause of all causes,   
All pervading,independent and immutable.   
By [contemplating] these twelve transcendental characteristics of the Soul   
a conscious person is impelled to give up the false conception of 'I' and  
'mine'   
originating from the illusion of having material body,   
and false identification with it.   
Gold which can be found in stones is by the expert gold-diggers   
easily found and and extracted in the gold mines.   
 The experts(mystics,yogis...),understanding the difference between spirit and  
matter,   
can in the same way make distinction between body and Soul,   
 with the help of spiritual processes,and attain the goal,Realization.   
The teachers of example speak of eight types of material energy,   
 three modes of nature and sixteen modifications   
 [the senses of action and perception, the elements and the mind].   
The individual living entity, is the one element connecting all the others.   
The body that moves about or stands still, combines all these [24] elements,   
and is thus characterized by this duality [of spirit and matter].   
By analisis and introspection in a way of 'not this, not that' [neti neti],   
 everything which is not the Spirit should be given up like unessential.   
...   
Be of service to a Guru with faith and devotion, offer all that you  
acquired,and all the fruits,   
be of association with the saintly and devoted ones and worship the Lord.   
Have faith in the stories about the Lord,   
 glorify His qualities and activities, meditate on His Lotus feet   
and exercise respect in worship of His forms.   
 Understanding that Hari, the Supreme Lord is situated in all living beings,   
one should be of the highest regard for all creatures.   
In this way,with devotion to the Supreme Lord Vasudeva,   
one manages to subdue the six symptoms of the senses   
[ lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and jealousy],   
and obtains attraction and love for the Lord.

**Answering by Citing the Lord 's Version**  
 **Sri Suka said: "Between the soul of pure consciousness in the beyond and  
the material body there can never be any meaningful relationship,without the  
Supreme and His energy,oh King, the same way a dreamer cannot make any use of  
what he saw in his dream.   
By the influence of the exterior energy many forms manifested. While enjoying  
in the modes of different qualities,the Pure Soul misconceives, thinking in  
terms of ?I? and ?mine.?   
The very moment he (the witness,the Self) enjoys his glory of transcending the  
time of the material energy, in that fulness,he will forsake the two [of that  
'I' and 'mine'].   
When the Supreme Lord showed His form to the Creator who was veracious in his  
vows and diligence, He pointed out that the goal of all purification is to  
find the love of the knowledge of self-realization [atma-tattva, the soul  
principle].   
[And so] he, the first godly person in the universe, the supreme spiritual  
teacher, began from his own divine position [on the lotus of creation] to  
reflect on the source of that lotus. But considering therewith how he would  
start his creation, he could not figure out what the directions and the ways  
were, and how it all materially should be put together.   
When he once was immersed in thinking this way, he heard two syllables being  
spoken which were the sixteenth [ta] and the twenty-first [pa] of the spars'a  
alphabet. Joined together [as tapas, penance], these syllables became known as  
the potency of the renounced order, oh King. When he heard that being spoken,  
he looked in all directions to detect the speaker, but there was non other to  
be found. Than,he thought it is wise to sit down on his lotus seat firmly and  
give his attention of pursuance of penance,the way it was instructed.   
He endowed with a spotless vision controlled his life breath, mind and senses  
of perception and action for a thousand godly years,enlightening all the  
worlds by this extremely hard penance. Thus he is known as the greatest of all  
ascetics.**   
 **For him, the Supreme Lord being pleased by his penance, manifested His own  
abode, beyond which no other world is found and which is worshiped as the  
place where the five miseries of material life [ignorance, selfhood,  
attachment, hatred and death-fear] have completely ceased. It is the place  
that is praised by persons,who free from illusion and fear for a material  
existence,are of perfect self-realization. There where the Lord is worshiped  
by both the enlightened and the unenlightened devotees, the mode of goodness  
prevails over the other two of passion and ignorance,without ever being mixed  
with them. Nor is there the influence of time or the external energy, not to  
mention the influence of all the other matters like attachment, greed etc.. As  
blue as the sky and glowing with lotuslike eyes, very attractive and youthful  
with yellow garments, all inhabitants there are endowed with the four arms and  
the luster and effulgence of pearls and fine ornaments. Some radiate like  
coral or diamonds, with heads with earrings and garlands blooming like a  
celestial lotus. That place which radiates with rows of brilliant high  
rising, excellent buildings,specially designed for the great devotees,and is  
populated by celestial, flashing beauties with heavenly complexions, is as  
attractive as a sky decorated with clouds and lightning. The Goddess  
,Sri,performs there, enraptured together with her personal, singing  
associates,in innumerable ways, devotional service at the lotus feet of the  
Lord, surrounded by black bees who busily humm along in the attraction of the  
everlasting spring season.There he [Brahm?] saw the Lord of the entire  
community of devotees, the Lord of the Goddess, of the Universe and the  
sacrifice, the Almighty One who is being served in transcendental love by  
foremost associates like Sunanda, Nanda, Prabala and Arhana. The servants  
affectionately facing Him are intoxicated by the very pleasing sight of His  
smile, His reddish eyes, His face with His helmet and earrings, His four  
hands, His yellow dress, His marked chest and the Goddess of Fortune at His  
side. Seated on His highly valuable throne He as the Supreme Lord fully  
enjoys His abode, where He is surrounded by the opulence of His four energies  
[the principles of matter, original person, intellect and ego], His sixteen  
energies [the five elements, perceptive and working senses, and mind] His  
fivefold energies [the sense objects of form, taste, sound, smell and touch],  
His six energies [of the opulences of knowledge, intelligence, beauty,  
penance, fame and riches] and the other personal powers He sometimes  
demonstrates [the eight siddhis or mystic perfections].

**Cont...   
The Creator of the Universe, who was overwhelmed by the sight of that  
audience, with his heart full of ecstasy and his body full of divine  
love,bowed down with tears in his eyes before the lotus feet of the Lord. It  
was an example that is followed by the great liberated souls.   
 Seeing him present before Him, the Lord deemed the worthy, great scholar  
suitable for creating - in line with His own control - the lives of all living  
beings. Mildly smiling He very pleased shook hands with His partner in divine  
love and addressed the beloved one with enlightening words.   
 The Supreme Lord said:  'As opposed to the penance of the pseudo,false yogis, I am most pleased with  
prolonged penance, the penance by which the Vedic knowledge has accumulated in  
you, who desired to create. All my blessings for you, just ask Me, the giver  
of all benediction, whatever favor you wish oh Brahma. For to reach the  
ultimate of realizing Me is the final success of everyone's penances. This  
enviable perception of My abode was granted to you because you submissively  
listened when you in seclusion were of the highest penance. It was Me who told  
you [to do penance] in that situation because you were perplexed in your duty.  
That penance is My very heart Soul,and not in any way different from Me,Oh  
sinless one.   
 I create by that penance, I maintain the cosmos by that penance and I  
withdraw again by that penance. My power is found in severe penance.'**   
 **The knowledge acquired about Me is very confidential and is realized in  
combination with devotional service and the necessary equipments. Take it up  
the way I explain it to you.   
 May from My mercy with you there be this factual realization of My eternal  
form and transcendental existence, My colors, qualities and activities.   
 It was I who existed before the creation when there was nothing else, nothing  
of the cause and effect of all of this( that is also Me), and it is Me as well  
who of all that was created remains in the end; that is what I am.   
 That which appears to be of value, is not what it seems when it does not  
relate to Me,Know it as My illusory energy, that reflection which appears to  
be in darkness.   
 The elements of the universe appear, before they are engaged and also  
thereafter, minutely as well gigantically. The same way I am present in  
them,as well not present in them(beyond).   
 He who has made the soul his object of study may count on it that he, until  
he arrives at this notion, has to investigate the reality and principle of the  
Self directly as well as indirectly,in the context of whatever time, place or  
circumstance.   
When your focus of mind remains fixed on the Supreme, you do not have to fear  
a fall in bewilderment, not when you have temporally lost your way, nor when  
you have reached the end of your life. '   
Canto 2,Chapter 9

**_Mother Yashoda binds Lord Krishna   
Sri Suka said: 'One day, when the maidservants were otherwise engaged, mother Yashoda,  
Nanda's queen, was churning and making her curd.   
During the time she was churning the butter she sang songs about everything  
she could remember her son had done.   
The Lord desirous to drink approached her as she was churning and getting  
affectionate with His mother,   
 stopped the churning rod by taking hold of it.   
Having gotten angry He, biting His full red lips and with false tears, with a  
stone broke the pot in which the butter was churned and,   
hidden from sight in an adjacent room, He began to eat from everything that  
was churned.   
 The gopi rescued the boiling hot milk from the stove   
and returned to her workplace where she discovered that the churning pot was  
broken.   
 Not seeing her child she with a smile concluded that it had been His work.   
 Standing on top of a mortar He had turned over, He, anxiously looking around,   
 from a hanging [storage] pot to His pleasure handed a share of the milk  
goodies out to a monkey.   
From behind watching these activities, she very slowly approached her son. _**  
**_Seeing her approaching with a stick in her hand He quickly climbed down and  
fled away, like He was afraid, with the gopi after Him   
\- He who could not even be reached by the greatest yogis of penance who try  
to get access in their meditation.   
Seeing the little scoundrel remorsefully crying and rubbing the collyrium of  
His eyes all over His face with His hands,   
she caught Him with His fearful eyes by the hand with a threatening pose.   
With a good heart for her son understanding His fear she threw away the stick  
though and decided to bind Him with a rope.   
But she did not know what kind of power she was dealing with. _**  
**_He to whom there is neither an inside nor an outside, neither a beginning  
nor an end,   
is both the beginning and the end, both the inside and the outside of the  
universe.   
 He constitutes the complete universe. And He, the One Unmanifest, the One  
Unseen present in the form of a mortal being,   
was by the gop? taken for her son and bound to a mortar like one does with a  
normal child.   
 When the rope she used to bind her naughty child fell short with a length of  
an inch,Yashoda tied another rope to it.   
 When even that one fell short she tried another one that, joining and  
joining, would not suffice either to bind Him,staying short again with an  
inch.   
Yashoda proceeded with all the ropes in the household and thus failing she,  
being struck with wonder,   
had to laugh together with all the gopis taking part in the fun.   
Seeing His mother sweating and getting tired and all the flowers falling down  
from her loosened hair,   
 Krishna was so gracious to allow her to bind Him.   
My best one, the Lord factually thus showed how He, Krishna, despite being the  
controller of the entire universe with all its demigods,   
 is controlled by His Devotees.   
Neither Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, nor the Goddess of Fortune residing at His  
side,   
 received from the Giver of Final Liberation, the mercy the gopi obtained.   
Canto 10,Chapter 9_**

**Sankhya philosophy**  
 **The Lord said: ?Now I shall tell you about the Sankhya system propounded by  
the ancient seers (Kapila and others); having known this, man can at once cast  
aside the delusion caused by diversity.   
In the beginning before the origin of the Yugas (in Pralaya) and in the Satya  
Yuga at the beginning of the cycle, when people were strong in determination,  
there was but one thing without difference, the perfect consciousness (seer)  
or Brahman. There was no division of seer and seen or knower and knowable,  
subject and object. It was all one homogeneous consciousness, pure Chit alone  
(Chinmatra). All the objective existence was one and the same. It was absorbed  
in Brahman. The seer and the whole universe were one and the same.   
That great thing Brahman, the absolute Truth, the homogeneous essence, the  
only living Reality which is beyond the reach of mind and speech became  
twofold by means of Maya, the visible, objective universe, and the thinking  
subject. Of the two, one is Prakriti possessed of two aspects viz., cause and  
effect, and the other is Jnana or knowledge absolute which is called Purusha.   
To give fruits to the Karmas of Jivas I disturbed the equilibrium of the  
Prakriti. When I agitated her under the eye of Purusha, Sattva, Rajas and  
Tamas became manifest. The Gunas gave rise to Sutra (thread), also called  
Mahat which is always joined to Sutra. From the transformation of Mahat was  
produced egoism which causes delusion in the Jiva.   
Egoism is threefold?Sattvic or Vaikaric, Rajasic or Taijasa and Tamasic. Mind  
and the eleven gods or presiding deities of organs came from Sattvic Ahamkara,  
the organs came from Rajasic Ahamkara, the Tanmatras or the fine particles of  
matter (the root elements or Sukshma Bhuta) came from Tamasic Ahamkara.  
Ahamkara is both sentient and insentient.   
Impelled by Me all these principles united together to form the Egg which was  
an excellent abode for Me. I dwelt in that Egg which was floating in water.  
From My navel grew the lotus called the universe. The self-born Brahma,  
manifested in that lotus.   
Strengthened by Tapas (knowledge) with the help of Rajas, and through My grace  
he, the Master of the universe, the universal soul created the three worlds  
Bhur, Bhuvah and Suvah with their protectors (Lokapalas).   
The Suvah (heaven) became the abode of the gods; the Bhuvar (Antariksha) of  
the Bhutas; Bhur (earth) of men and the spheres beyond the Suvar of the  
Siddhas; the spheres below the earth of the Asuras and Nagas. Actions  
characterised by the three Gunas lead to the three worlds viz., Bhur, Bhuvar  
and Suvah. Mahar, Jana, Tapas are attained by Yoga, Tapas and renunciation. My  
abode, Vaikuntha which is beyond the seven Lokas is attained by Bhakti Yoga.   
By Me who am Time and the dispenser of all Karmas, this world with its diverse  
Karmas rises and sinks in this stream of the Gunas, i.e., one is led to higher  
life in regions up to Brahmaloka or to lower life down to plants or clod of  
earth.   
The smallest or the highest, thinnest or the stoutest thing that is seen to  
exist is all made up of the two principles, Prakriti and Purusha.   
That from which a thing takes its origin and into which it dissolves exists  
also in the middle. That alone is real. That which is the beginning and at the  
end of a thing is also in the middle. Whatever is the beginning of anything or  
its end, is also its middle and thus it is the real existence, but the  
modifications have a mere relative or empirical existence like the ornaments  
of gold and earthen ware.   
That is only real which gives rise to the original transformation which is at  
the beginning and at the end. Brahman is the only Absolute Reality which is  
never subject to modifications. The effect has a beginning and an end. All  
effects depend upon Brahman for their subsistence as effects.   
Prakriti which is the material cause of this universe, Purusha which pervades  
the Prakriti, which is its substratum or support and Time which causes  
disturbance in the Gunas and brings its manifestation?all these three am I,  
the Brahman.   
The creative process flows on in due order of father and son without a break  
for the experience of the Jiva. It lasts so long as the period of preservation  
continues according to the will of the Lord.   
Then, the universe which pervaded by Me, the place of the births and deaths of  
various creatures, becomes fit for dissolution into the five Bhutas. The order  
is reversed in Pralaya. The modifications are dissolved in the Tattvas or  
principles from which they proceeded.   
Thus the body merges into the food, food into seeds, seeds into earth and  
earth into smell; smell into water, water into taste, taste into fire, fire  
into form or colour; colour into air, air into touch, touch into ether; ether  
into sound.   
The organs merge into their causes, the gods (Adhidaivas); the gods into the  
mind which rules over all and the mind into Sattvika Ahamkara. Sound is  
withdrawn into Tamasic Ahamkara, and that powerful Ahamkara into Mahat; Mahat  
into the Gunas; the Gunas into the unmanifested Prakriti and Prakriti into  
Time (Kaala).   
Time merges into Jiva, Jiva into Me, the birthless Atman. Atman is absolute  
and remains by Himself who is indicated by the creation and destruction of the  
universe and who is their substratum.   
When these processes are meditated on, how can delusion implying difference  
rise in that mind or even if it arises, how could it stay in that mind which  
reflects in this way, just as darkness cannot stay on rise of the sun in the  
sky?**

**_Story of Avanti Brahmin and Song of an ascetic_**  
 **The Lord said: 'O disciple of Brihaspati there is not in the world a sage  
who can control his mind when he is pierced by harsh words of the wicked.   
Even arrows aimed and directed with force at the most vital parts of a man  
will not give so much pain as the cruel harsh words of the wicked which rankle  
in the heart for ever.   
O Uddhava, I shall narrate to you a very sacred story of ancient times. Listen  
to it with rapt attention. It was recited by an ascetic who was ill-treated by  
the wicked, but who bore it with great patience and fortitude, and who thought  
it was all due to his own past actions. This was sung by him.   
There lived in Avanti a very wealthy Brahmin. But he led a very miserable  
life. He earned money by the evil ways of the world. He was miserly, covetous  
and very irritable. He did not spend anything in charity. He did not greet his  
relations or guest with kind words even. He never even attended to the  
comforts of himself, his wife, children or servants. He was a human iron-safe  
hoarding and guarding money. He dwelt in a house unknown to all religious  
activities.   
As he led such a miserly and impure life, his sons and relatives did not like  
him. His wife, daughters and servants got so much disgusted that they would  
not do what he liked. He took pleasure only in hoarding money. He was  
destitute of righteousness. He never enjoyed his life. So he lost both this  
life and the next. The gods presiding over the five Yajnas or daily sacrifices  
grew very angry.   
O liberal Uddhava, his stock of merits was exhausted through his neglect of  
the five claimants. Even the wealth which he had hoarded with great pains and  
exertion was lost.   
O Uddhava, some of his wealth was taken by his relatives. Thieves laid their  
hands on some. He lost another portion by the anger of the gods or calamities  
or accidents and by the lapse of time. Some of it was taken by men and kings.  
When his wealth was thus lost he was neglected and cast away by his own  
people. He was very much afflicted at heart when he reflected that his wealth  
had never been used for the satisfaction of his own desires or for  
righteousness.   
He shed tears when he reflected on his pitiable condition and his voice was  
choked. He developed intense disgust for the world. He attained Vairagya or  
distaste for worldly possessions and enjoyments like an ascetic.   
He said to himself,   
 'My experience has indeed been bitter. Alas! Woe unto me! I deserve it. I  
have tormented my body in hoarding wealth. I have not utilised the wealth for  
the attainment of my desires or righteousness. I have gained neither  
righteousness nor my own pleasures.   
Generally the wealth of the miserly does not contribute to their comfort or  
happiness. It only leads to their affliction in this world and leads them to  
hell and loss of their soul after their death.   
The spotless fame of a renowned man and the excellent qualities of a virtuous  
man are spoiled by greed, however little it may be, just as a small patch of  
white skin or leucoderma spoils even the most beautiful forms.   
In acquiring wealth, in improving it when got, in protecting it, in spending  
it, in its loss and use, men experience only exertion, fear, anxiety and  
delusion.   
Theft, injury to others, falsehood, hypocrisy, lust, anger, pride,  
haughtiness, discord, enmity, distrust, envy, over-indulgence in sex, wine and  
gamblings?these fifteen evils pertaining to men have indeed, their source in  
wealth. Therefore one who is desirous of obtaining the highest good should  
abandon the evil known as wealth from a distance.   
Also brothers, wives, fathers and friends fall out and soon become enemies for  
the sake of a small sum of money.   
For the sake of a little money they quarrel and become enraged. They abandon  
all prior remembrance and affection, and out of jealousy stand in the way of  
one another, attack and kill one another.   
The miser who hoards and guards his wealth like a Yaksha, who does not share  
it with the gods, the Rishis, the Pitris, relatives, friends, lower animals  
who all deserve a share, and does not use it for his own self, falls down.   
Certainly that glorious Lord Hari, who is the Lord of the universe, who is the  
embodiment of all the gods, is immensely pleased with me, for He has brought  
me to this state in which I am endowed with Vairagya or dispassion which is a  
raft or a boat for me to cross the ocean of Samsara or ocean of births and  
deaths.   
I shall lead the rest of my life, if at all there is any left, in penance, I  
shall find delight in Atman only. I shall do all that tends to the attainment  
of highest good. I shall lead a virtuous life and strive for my salvation. May  
the gods, the rulers of the three worlds bless me to attain this state. Raja  
Katwanga, attained the abode of Brahma within an hour.'   
The Lord said: 'Having thus resolved in his mind, the great Brahmin of Avanti  
cut off all desires and also the knot of egoism in his heart and became a  
Sannyasin. He also became tranquil in mind.   
He wandered alone over the earth with perfect control over his mind, senses  
and Pranas and he just entered towns and villages for the sake of alms. No one  
knew who he was. Wicked people surrounded, mocked and ill-treated the old and  
ugly monk in various ways.   
Some mocked him often, while others tied him with ropes to a pillar or a tree,  
making sport of him as if he were a toy or a bird.   
Whatever affliction or trouble thus befell him caused by the elements or the  
gods or his own body, he thought they were predestined and therefore must be  
patiently borne.   
Even though he was insulted and treated with contempt by wicked men, even  
though they tried to make him abandon his saintly course he stuck to his path  
of righteousness, quite steadily and sang the following song.   
The Brahmin said,   
 ?Neither this body nor these people nor the gods, nor the Atman, nor planets,  
nor Karma nor time is the cause of my pleasure or pain. The wise say or the  
Srutis declare that it is the mind that is the true cause of pleasure and  
pain, as it sets in motion the wheel of Samsara.   
The mind creates desire and the like. It makes the various Gunas function and  
through them brings about various Karmas, good, bad or indifferent for the  
attainment of such desires. By such actions man gets into bondage or Samsara  
(chain of births and deaths) and attains different kinds of birth according to  
the nature of his actions.   
Atman is the self-effulgent, inactive, silent witness of the activities of the  
mind. He is the friend of the Jiva. The Jiva identifies himself with the mind  
on account of ignorance, and thinks he is the actor. In reality it is the mind  
that does everything, who enjoys sense-objects through desires and mind?s  
active qualities and thus becomes bound.   
When one?s mind is controlled and tranquil, of what use are charity and the  
rest for him? If his mind is uncontrolled and restless, of what use, again,  
are this charity and the rest?   
Without curbing or conquering this strong invincible enemy of irresistible  
force within, that cuts the very vital parts, some foolish people try to  
achieve victories outside creating friends, enemies, or neutrals. Those who do  
not conquer the mind make friends and enemies.   
If the Atman is the cause of pleasure and pain, such experience must be  
considered unreal as the Vedas declare that the essence of Atman is bliss and  
that all things but Atman are unreal and transitory.   
If the Atman or one?s own Self is the cause of pleasure and pain, evidently  
nothing in that case happens from another. In that case the cause is one?s own  
nature, pleasure and pain are of the essence of itself, because there is  
nothing besides the Atman. If there be, it must be unreal. Therefore how could  
there be then any occasion for anger? With whom should one become angry? There  
is neither pleasure nor pain. Atman only really exists.   
If the planets be the cause of pleasure and pain, what have they then to do  
with Atman who is unborn, because the planets affect the body only? Further,  
one planet exercise an adverse influence on another planet. The Atman is  
entirely different from either the planet or the body. With whom then should  
one become angry?   
He who has attained illumination has fear from no one else. The Atman which is  
beyond Prakriti is not affected by the pairs of opposites. Ahamkara only is  
the cause of Samsara. Ahamkara only is affected by the pairs of opposites.   
So I shall practise this devotion to the Supreme Self which the most ancient  
Rishis had, and I shall cross the unlimited ocean of ignorance.   
The Lord said: 'This was the song sung by that sage who lost his wealth and attained  
dispassion, who roamed over the earth as a Sannyasin free from anxiety and who  
remained unshaken from his righteous course, though he was thus ill-treated  
and insulted by the wicked.   
The cause of happiness or misery is no other than one?s self. It is a delusion  
of the mind. This world consisting of friends, neutrals and enemies which  
affects a man with pleasure and pain is a delusion of the mind caused by  
ignorance.   
Therefore, O child! Control the mind perfectly by fixing it on Me. This is  
the very gist of Yoga. This is in brief all Yoga. This is the highest aim and  
end of Yoga.   
Whoever with a serene mind studies, recites before others or hears this song  
of the tranquil, self-restrained Sannyasi immersed in Brahman,will not be  
overpowered by the pairs of opposites.'**

**_Jnana and Vijnana_**  
 **The Lord Krishna said,   
 'He who is endowed with theoretical knowledge of the Sastras and who has  
attained Self-realisation also, should finally resign to Me that knowledge  
also, knowing the universe of differences to be an illusion or the result of  
mere Maya.   
To a man of wisdom I alone am beloved. I alone am his purpose or the desired  
goal and the means thereto. I am his Svarga as well as Moksha. There is  
nothing else but Me which is dear to him.   
Those who have attained Jnana ( wisdom,knowledge) and Vijnana (Self-  
realisation) attain to My supreme abode or the highest goal. The sage is the  
most beloved of Me because he holds Me up with his knowledge.   
Tapas, pilgrimage to holy places and holy waters, repetition of the Mantra,  
charitable gifts, and many other purifying acts are not so helpful to attain  
that perfection which comes through a ray of direct Self-realisation.   
Therefore, O Uddhava! Know thyself in order to have Self-realisation, and  
possessed of Jnana and Vijnana, worship Me with a devout heart.   
By means of the sacrifice of knowledge and Self-realisation, sages have  
worshipped Me, the Atman and Lord of all sacrifices in their own Self (heart),  
and have attained perfection.   
O Uddhava! The threefold modification viz., birth, death, decay or the gross,  
subtle and causal bodies that appears to be in thee is merely Maya or  
illusion, for it occurs in the middle but it does not exist in the beginning  
or at the end. When birth and such other states affect this modification  
(body) what is that to you? Because in the case of an illusory object what  
really exists in the beginning and end alone exists in the middle also.'   
Uddhava said: 'O Lord of the universe, O Lord who art in the form of the  
universe, please tell me how the ancient and pure knowledge together with  
dispassion, renunciation and realisation may be fully attained. Please also  
tell me about the method of devotion to Thee which is sought after by the  
great sages and even Brahma.   
O Lord! In the fearful path of Samsara, harassed by the threefold fires viz.,  
Adhyatmic (diseases etc.), Adhidaivic (thunder, lightning etc.) and  
Adhibhautic (scorpion-bite, snake-bite etc.) and subjected to severe trial, O  
Lord, I do not see any shelter other than the umbrella of Thy feet that  
showers nectar viz., the blissful Moksha. O most glorious Lord, because of my  
greed for the fleeting worldly pleasures I have got into the jaws of the  
python (time) which has dragged me into the abyss of the never-ending series  
of births and deaths. Lift me up, from this pit and graciously sprinkle me  
with Thy soothing words of wisdom that conduce to Moksha or the final  
emancipation.'   
The Lord said: 'Formerly king Yudhishthira asked Bhisma, the foremost one of  
those versed in the love of Dharmas, in exactly this way to which we all  
listened.   
After the Mahabharata war was over, filled with sorrow for the slaughter of  
his kinsmen and friends, Dharmaputra sought the advice of Bhishma, and after  
asking him questions on various subjects finally asked this question about  
emancipation or Moksha.   
I shall tell you of these which I heard from the lips of Bhishma and which are  
pregnant with high precepts on renunciation, Vijnana (realisation), faith,  
sincerity and devotion.   
That is true Vijnana, I consider, by which one sees in all beings the nine  
[viz., Prakriti, Purusha, Mahat (intellect), Ahamkara (egoism) and the five  
Tanmatras (five root-matter or fine matter or Sukshma Bhutas)], the eleven  
viz., the five organs of actions, the five organs of knowledge and mind, the  
five elements viz., earth, water etc., and the three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and  
Tamas and also sees the one in all these beings.   
Now Vijnana is only this. The sage does not now see the many principles to be  
real or how the many is pervaded by the one. He no more beholds things  
pervaded by the one as before. He remains conscious of the one supreme cause,  
Brahman and of nothing else. He realises that the states of origin,  
subsistence, and destruction relate only to the things that are constituted of  
the three Gunas.   
That which, when one object is transformed into another, exists at its  
beginning, middle and end, and remains behind, when those objects return to  
their cause, is indeed the real or the existing Sat.   
The Vedas, direct perception, the sayings of great men and inference are the  
four Pramanas or proofs of knowledge. The world of transformation does not  
stand the test of any of them so the wise man becomes dispassionate to all  
things and renounces the world.   
All works are subject to change. They bear the seed of sorrow and have a limit  
of time. They can never create everlasting happiness. Therefore the wise man  
sees all the regions that may be attained by actions, from that of Brahma  
downwards, as miserable and transitory even like the world that is seen.   
O sinless one! I have already told you of Bhakti Yoga. I shall again tell you  
the chief means for the attainment of devotion to Me. Hear again what I say.   
Faith in the nectar-like tales of My deeds, expounding them to others after  
hearing, constantly singing of Me, steadiness in worshipping Me, singing hymns  
in praise of Me, delight in doing service to Me, bowing to Me with all the  
eight parts of the body, worship of My devotees which is even greater than the  
worship of Me, realisation of My presence or existence in all beings, looking  
upon all beings as Myself.   
Moving the limbs in doing acts dedicated to Me, singing My qualities,  
directing daily talks towards Me by talking about My attributes, resigning or  
offering the mind to Me, the giving up of all desires, giving up wealth,  
enjoyment, comforts and happiness for My sake, performing sacrifices, gifts  
and oblations, repeating Mantras, practising vows and austerities all for My  
sake, these are the chief means for the attainment of devotion to Me.   
O Uddhava! Those men who have surrendered themselves to Me develop devotion to  
Me by such pious acts. When once they attain My devotion, nothing else remains  
to be realised in this universe.   
When the mind full of Sattva and perfectly serene is resigned unto Me,the  
Atman, and devotee attains righteousness, knowledge, dispassion or  
renunciation and divine powers of the state of Isvara.   
But when the mind runs after the pleasures of the senses, when it is set on  
anything different from Myself i.e., on the phenomenal objects, when it runs  
astray with the senses, it becomes very impure with Rajas and gets attached to  
unreal objects and thus it becomes perverse and the man develops the very  
reverse of the above qualities viz., unrighteousness, ignorance, attachment  
and weakness.   
'Whatever promotes devotion to Me is Dharma; realisation of the oneness of  
Atman is Jnana or wisdom; non-attachment to sense objects or the three Gunas  
and their products is dispassion; and the state of Isvara is to possess Anima  
and other powers.'**

## Re:[9]The Story of King Ambarisha  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: February 24, 2015, 06:44:13 AM

**The Story of King Ambarisha**   
AMBARISHA became the monarch of the whole earth. All wealth and all enjoyments  
were at his command ; but these meant very little to him, for he loved the  
Lord, and he knew the vanity of earthly delights. Wealth and pleasure attract  
only the ignorant. He who has come to love God, the only eternal, blissful  
existence, knows that all else is but a vanishing dream. Ambarisha's mind was  
always fixed on Sri Krishna ; his tongue uttered only his praises ; his hands  
were engaged only in his service ; his ears heard only his Word ; his eyes saw  
everywhere the expressions of his divinity ; his sense of touch felt only his  
divine presence ; his sense of smell perceived only the fragrance of his  
holiness ; his sense of taste savoured only the food accepted by him : his  
feet walked only towards his Pre-sense ; and his head touched his Lotus Feet.  
He, the Lord, the Atman, existeth everywhere and in all beings : knowing this,  
Ambarisha offered all his labours to him as worship. Those who find the Lord  
of bliss manifest within their hearts are never attracted by vain earthly  
desires Ambarisha, thus unattached, reigned in his kingdom, his mind enjoying  
continuously the divine bliss. Once he made a vow to the supreme Lord of the  
universe, in observing which he practised special disciplines for one year and  
at the end of this time fasted for three days. On the fourth day he made gifts  
of his possessions to the poor and the needy, and then was about to break his  
fast when the sage DurvasA approached him. The king made obeisance to him and  
invited him to partake of the feast. After accepting the invitation Durvasa  
went to perform his ablutions in the sacred river Kalindi. There, his bathing  
finished, he became absorbed in meditation. Time passed. The king was  
anxiously waiting, for the auspicious period when he must break his fast was  
slipping away. He knew that if he did not break his fast within that period  
the performance of his vow would be of no avail. Yet to break his fast before  
the arrival of the invited guest was not becoming to a king. He therefore  
compromised by drinking water, which was in 'a sense breaking fast, but which  
at the same time did not involve an insult to his honoured guest. When Durvasa  
arrived at last and learned that the king had accepted drink during his  
absence, he wasmuch disconcerted, for he felt that the king in his pride as  
monarch had wittingly slighted him. In the first heat of his anger he cursed  
the king. The curse took the form of a demon who approached King Ambarisha to  
devour him ; the king, however, remained calm and unafraid, and this behaviour  
baffled the demon, rendering him impotent. Finding himself thus powerless with  
respect to the king, the monster turned around and advanced toward Durvasa in  
order to devour the being from whom he had issued. DurvAsa sprang away in a  
desperate effort to save himself from his own curse, but found no way of  
escape. At last he went to BrahmA, and then to Siva, but neither of them could  
help him, for in that curse he had wished to injure a devotee of Vipu, the  
all-pervading Lord of the universe. In a final effort he approached Vi$rpu,  
who said : " I also am powerless, for thou hast offended my devotee. I love my  
devotees, and I am a willing slave to my love. How can it be otherwise, since  
these devotees of mine willingly sacrifice everything for my sake ? They have  
surrendered themselves completely unto me. When anybody curses such a devotee,  
his curse with increased force, returns upon himself. One only can deliver  
him. Go to him whom thou hast offended by thy curse, and ask his forgiveness.  
This only can save thee. Go thou immediately, and I wish thee well." Finding  
no other way to escape from his own curse, Durvasa humbly approached Ambarisha  
and begged his forgiveness. The king showed him due respect and readily  
forgave him.   
Then to counteract the curse and also to free Durvasa from its effect upon  
himself, King Ambarlsha offered this prayer : " O Lord, Thy infinite power existeth in all. Thou art in the fire,   
Thou art in the sun, Thou art in the moon, Thou art in the stars,   
Thou art in the water, Thou art in the earth, Thou art in the ether,   
Thou art in the wind, Thou art in the subtle elements of the universe : Thou  
art all in all.   
Save and protect Durvasa with Thy all-loving power. May we all find Thy peace  
! "   
Now Durvasa found peace in his heart and was cleansed of all evil.

**_Bhakti Yoga_**  
_ Uddhava said: "O Krishna, those versed in the Vedas speak of  
various means or courses of attaining Moksha. Are all of them equally  
important or only one is the foremost of them?   
"Thou too hast taught the path of devotion to the Lord by which the mind  
getting rid of attachment to everything merges in Thee."   
The Lord said, "These words of mine known as the Vedas were destroyed by Time  
at the dissolution of the universe. It was first taught by Me to Brahma and  
therein is taught the Dharma or the righteous course of devoting the mind to  
Me. He declared it to his eldest son Manu, from whom Bhrigu and other great  
Brahma Rishis, seven in number, learnt it.   
From those fathers, their sons, the Gods, Danavas, Guhyakas, men, Siddhas,  
Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Charanas, Kimmdevas (half gods), Kinnaras, Nagas,  
Rakshasas, Kimpurushas and others also learnt it. But the natural tendencies  
of those are different being the outcome of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.   
The tendencies of men are different according to the differences in their  
nature. So, different paths have been spoken of. It is on account of these  
natural tendencies that beings and their thoughts differ. According to their  
nature, different expressions flow from them all. Beings and minds are  
differentiated according to their temperament, nature and tendencies.  
According to their natures, the interpretation of the Vedas is various.   
Thus according to difference in nature, the thoughts and ideas of men differ  
from generation to generation; while some differ on account of instructions  
handed down to them through a succession of teachers, and there are also  
others who go against the Vedas. Because of this difference of nature or  
intellect, different schools of thought based on the same authority of Vedas  
arose. Some men became atheists who hold heretic views and have no faith in  
the Vedas.   
O best of men, people deluded by My Maya describe various things as means to  
the highest good according to their Karma or occupation and taste.   
As means to the goal some mention duty; others fame, pleasure, truthfulness,  
control of the senses and control of the mind; yet others mention their own  
wealth, or the lordly power or gift or food; and some mention sacrifice,  
austerity, charity, vows, moral rules (Yamas and Niyamas) universal and  
particular.   
The results attained by these means, being the outcome of work, have a  
beginning and an end, cause misery and end in Tamas. They give small and  
transient pleasures and are attended with sorrow.   
Where is that bliss to be found in objects that is to be found in Me? How can  
one who is attached to sense-objects, enjoy that bliss which a man with his  
mind given up to Me and free from attachment to all other things, gets from  
Me?   
To one who craves for nothing, who has nothing to own of the world, who has  
controlled his senses and mind, who regards all equally, who finds perfect  
delight in Me alone, all the directions are full of bliss. Fixed in Me, and  
finding bliss in Me, all is blissful to My devotee.   
He who has surrendered his mind to Me does not seek for the position of  
Brahma, or that of Indra or an Emperor's throne or Lordship over the nether  
regions, or the attainment of Yoga powers or even Moksha from which there is  
no returning; for he desires nothing else but Myself.   
Neither Brahma, nor Siva, nor Balarama, nor Lakshmi, nor My own form is so  
very dear to Me as thou art to Me.   
I always follow the sage, who desires nothing, is perfectly tranquil, hates  
none, regards everything equally, in order to purify Myself by the dust of his  
feet.   
Those great souls whose mind is not touched by desires, who are absolutely  
free from sin, who are penniless, serene, and compassionate to all creatures,  
who are devoted to Me do attain to that limitless blissful state which belongs  
to Me but not to others.   
My ordinary devotee who has yet no control over his senses is generally not  
overpowered by sense-objects though only troubled by them, on account of his  
strong devotion. Just as fire growing into a flame burns all fuel into ashes,  
so the devotion unto Me, O Uddhava, totally burns all sins. O Uddhava, neither  
Yoga, nor knowledge, nor Dharma, nor study of the Vedas, nor austerity nor  
renunciation propitiates Me or wins Me, so much as the well developed and  
unswerving devotion to Me does. I, the beloved Atman of the righteous, am  
attained only by undivided devotion and faith. Devotion to Me purifies even  
outcastes and removes their congenital impurity and saves them from births.   
Virtue united with truthfulness and compassion or learning with austerity does  
not entirely purify one who is destitute of devotion to Me.   
How can the mind be purified without devotion to Me which is characterised by  
melting of the heart, the hair standing on end and tears of joy trickling down  
the cheeks?   
A devotee of Mine whose speech is broken by sobs, whose heart melts, who  
without shyness sometimes weeps profusely, or laughs or sings loudly and  
dances, not only purifies himself but purifies the whole world.   
Just as gold blown in the fire loses its impurities and regains its own real  
form, so also the mind shakes off its impurities and its tendencies of Karma  
and desire for work by means of devotion to Me, regains its own true form and  
attains to Me.   
The more the mind is purified by listening to my sacred stories and the  
repetition of My names, the more it sees the subtle essence of things and the  
subtle Reality, just as the eye touched with collyrium or unguent does through  
its enhanced power of sight.   
Think of objects and your mind will be attached to objects. Think of Me and  
your mind will be merged in Me alone. Therefore fix your mind on Me, purified  
by devotion, abandoning all other thoughts of unreal objects which are like  
the dreams or fancies.   
Shun off the company of women and those who associate with them. Be self-  
controlled. Go to a solitary place which is congenial and then sleeplessly  
meditate on Me without break. Be on the alert. Be vigilant. Shake off lethargy  
and laziness. There is not so much misery, so much bondage from other quarters  
as from the company of women and of those who associate with them.

**Narada 's Instructions on Sharing, Irreligion, Yoga and Advaita**  
 **S 'ri Narada said:  'Some of the twice-born souls are devoted to fruitive labor, some are engaged  
in austerities oh ruler of man, some excel in Vedic study while others  
exercise rhetoric, some also unify [their consciousness] in spiritual  
knowledge [in bhakti- and jnana-yoga]. A person desiring liberation should  
donate the result of his sacrifices to someone devoted to spiritual knowledge  
[usually a brahmin or a jnani]. If it happens that such a person cannot be  
found, one should donate to others according to their merit. Offering to the  
demigods one should feed two of them and offering to the forefathers three of  
them should be fed, or else in any case at least one should be nourished. One  
must not involve a great number of them, despite having the means for it. In  
case one entrusts the sacrificing in faith to a greater number of them and  
their [accompanying] relatives, things will not work out perfectly as for the  
most suitable time and place, the person to receive the honor and the method  
applied. When the sacred food, that was obtained by offering it at the proper  
time and place with love and devotion to the deity of the Lord, is given to  
the person who deserves the honor, such a practice will be a source of  
everlasting welfare. In offering [sanctified] food to the godly ones, the  
saints, the forefathers, the living beings in general, oneself and one's  
family members, one should consider them all as being part of the Lord  
Himself. One derives the greatest satisfaction from the [vegetarian] food of  
the sages and not so much from food [obtained] by [needless] violence against  
animals. For persons desiring true righteousness there is no religion higher  
than this: to forsake in one's mind, words and actions all violence against  
other living beings.   
Persons who by fixing themselves on the true self are free from material  
desires, know very well the purpose of the sacrifices. Enlightened by  
spiritual knowledge these transcendentalists know that some sacrifices,  
[animal sacrifices] have karmic consequences. Living beings seeing a  
sacrificer, become afraid when a creature is to be sacrificed. They think: 'This ignorant, unfriendly person most certainly will very soon kill us!' He  
who knows what dharma means is therefore supposed to perform, day after day,  
with satisfaction, his regular and occasional duties with the food that is  
given by God, the [vegetarian] food of the sages. Vidharma, paradharma,  
upadharma, abhasa and chala-dharma are the five different forms of  
irreligion,and,by those who are faithful to the scriptures,are considered the  
adharma, the unrighteously being engaged. What obstructs the original purpose  
of one's own duty is vidharma(detriment to dharma,to righteousness,  
naturalness), misconceived or strange to one's own duty is paradharma,  
directions that are turned against one's purpose in life are upadharma,or a  
pretending of dutifulnes; and one speaks of chala when by an opponent the  
words of the scripture are twisted and covered with pretense. That what by  
persons whimsically, as a dim reflection, is done in defiance of the purpose  
of one's own order of life [one's as'rama] is abhasa;. In what respect would  
that, what to one's own nature is the appropriate dharma, not be capable of  
bringing peace?   
 Where would he, who driven by lust and greed for the sake of riches wanders  
here, there and everywhere, find the happiness of the contented person who not  
endeavoring for his maintenance is happy from within?   
Or, o King, why should a person of peace not live happily on even a bit of  
water, when he from troublesome dealings with his genitals and tongue becomes  
a man not better than a household dog? For sure will of a discontented man of  
learning, because of his greed, gradually dwindle the strength of his senses,  
his education, austerity and fame andhis spiritual knowledge vanish. For  
someone who is hungry and thirsty desires find their end [upon eating],one is  
relieved of anger once it is expressed in a certain way but a person will not  
get over his greed when he delights in conquering all the directions of the  
globe. O King, many scholars, many persons of varied experience, many an  
expert in legal advice, or many a candidate for the office even, has landed in  
hell simply from lacking in contentment.   
With determination lust should be overcome, anger by means of forsaking the  
object of desire, for greed to disappear one must consider the fact that  
possessions make one possessed, and fear is overcome by contemplation on the  
truth.Deliberation on spiritual matters is the cure for lamentation and  
illusion, false pride is cured by service to a great soul, silence overcomes  
the obstacles on the path of yoga and no longer hankering after one's sense  
gratification remedies hostility. With compassion, [pity and concern] for  
others one can alleviate distress as caused by other living entities or by  
nature and by systematic meditation in yoga one can end one's own [karmic]  
suffering. Sleep one can conquer by practicing goodness. By serving the  
spiritual master with devotion one can easily in the mode of goodness conquer  
all these [symptoms] of being attached in passion, in ignorance and in  
goodness also. The Guru,who is the light on the path should directly be  
considered the Supreme Lord; he who considers him and all that belongs to the  
Veda as mortal and timebound, is like an elephant taking a dustbath. He [the  
teacher] who is the Supreme Lord in person, the ruler over the original cause  
of matter [pradhana, the primal ether] who is the original person as also the  
Lord of Yoga whose feet are sought by the masters of yoga, is by the common  
man taken for a normal human being.One has wasted one's time when all the  
prescribed activities and observances, designed for the definite subjugation  
of the six departments [of the five senses and the mind], have not lead to the  
ultimate goal.   
Just as occupational duties performed with the interest of acquiring an income  
do not serve the interest of yoga, do also traditional public works of piety  
that are performed by a materialistic person, not contribute [to the necessary  
unification of consciousness. He who wants to conquer his mind must alone and  
in a solitary place, without the dependence of an attached company [like a  
family] as a renounced person live on charity and eat little. In a clean,  
leveled place oh King, he must arrange for a seat and steadily, comfortably  
and equanimously sit down, keep his body straight and thus practice the  
Pranava He should arrest the incoming and outgoing air by stopping his  
exhalation and inhalation and that very moment give up all desires that occupy  
his mind. While staring at the tip of his nose he must turn the mind, that  
wanders here and there, away from whatever. A learned yogi should from the  
core of his heart step by step put an end to the mind that was defeated by  
lust. Persevering like this the practitioner, [with his mind] like a fire  
that extinguishes without fuel, will soon succeed in attaining the pure state  
[nirv?na]. Not being drawn away by the various desires the mind becomes calm  
and peaceful in all its movements.   
They who first consider their body as something separate from the soul, as  
something mortal meant for stool, worms and ashes, and then again glorify that  
body and identify themselves with it, are useless fools. For householders to  
forsake their duties, for celibates to give up on vows, for withdrawn persons  
to submit themselves as a servant of the common man and for renunciates to  
hanker after the senses, is for all the as'ramas a most abominable form of  
behavior in which one cheats the spiritual order. One should be indifferent  
about those who are thus bewildered by the external energy of the Lord, they  
are pitiful.   
 Once one has understood what the soul [and the Supersoul] entails, once one  
from the beyond has cleansed one's consciousness with spiritual knowledge,  
what is there left to hanker for, why would one still be a slave of the body  
that one maintains? One says that the body is the chariot, that the senses are  
the horses, that the mind - the master of the senses - is there as the reins,  
that the sense objects constitute the paths followed, that intelligence  
[reason] is the charioteer and that consciousness [goodness, character] is the  
great bond created by the Lord. The spokes of the wheel are the ten airs in  
the body [called prana, apana, samana, vyana, udana, naga, kurma, krikala,  
devadatta and dhananjaya], the inside and outside of the wheels are religion  
and irreligion, the one being driven is the individual self that is falsely  
identified, the Pranava is the bow and the individual soul is the arrow, but  
final beatitude is the target.   
Attachment and aversion, greed and lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false  
prestige, insult, fault-finding and deception, violence and jealousy, unrest,  
bewilderment, hunger and sleep are one's enemies; these and others are the  
consequence of passion and ignorance but sometimes they sprout from [being  
attached to] the mode of goodness. As long as one has this human form, that  
as a chariot with all its subordinate parts depends on one's control, one  
must, being of service at the lotus feet of the most venerable ones, hold on  
to the, by the strength of the Infallible One, sharpened sword of knowledge  
until the enemy is defeated. When one thus found satisfaction in one's  
transcendental bliss, this body can be given up. Not doing so being  
inattentive and motivated for what is untrue, the senses that act as the  
horses will lead the charioteer on the road of desire. There the driver falls  
into the hands of rogues, the sense objects [who rule with vishaya, eating,  
sleeping and mating] because of whom he, together with the horses and the  
rest, will land in the dark, blind well of material existence and suffer the  
great fear of death. To be inclined towards or to cease from material  
engagement [pravritti and nivritti], are the two types of activities mentioned  
in the Vedas. Being materially inclined one keeps returning [to a worldly  
existence], but ceasing one enjoys the nectar of eternity.

**_The Glories of the Lord Ananta_**  
_S 'r? S'uka said:  'At a distance of thirty-eight thousand yojanas beneath the base of Patala,  
He is situated who, as a part of the Supreme Lord, relates to the darkness and  
is called Ananta [the eternal one]. Wise ones describe Him as Sankarshana, the  
ruler of the ego,or I that is characterized by self-awareness (pride,  
identification), because He unites - 'draws together' \- the seer and the  
seen, the subject and the object. The celestial sky around the earth, this  
universe, sustained on only one of the thousands of hoods of the Supreme Lord  
in the form of Anantadeva, is seen as a,tiny white mustard seed (like a  
single galaxy among many, many others in deep space). Because of His desire  
to destroy,in the course of time this world, a Rudra named S?nkarshana arises  
from between His angrily contracted, beautiful eyebrows, who manifests in the  
form of eleven three-eyed expansions holding up pointed tridents. With the  
effulgence of the glittering earrings that decorate their cheeks, the leaders  
of the snakelike ones, who together with the best devotees in unalloyed  
devotion offer Him their prayers, in the round surfaces of the brilliant pink  
gemlike toenails of His lotus feet see their faces beautifully reflected. It  
is a sight which enraptures their minds. The marriageable princesses of the  
serpent kings hoping for His blessings, smear with an ointment of saffron,  
aloe and sandalwood paste the gleaming roundings of His auspicious, beautiful,  
spotless, fair arms resembling columns of silver. With their hearts beating  
faster with the ecstasy of Cupid,they with attractive delicate, beautiful  
smiles bashfully look at His,in love delighted, rolling, reddish eyes and  
kindly glancing lotuslike face. He, Ananta, is the Supreme Lord, the  
reservoir of all transcendental qualities and the original Godhead who in  
restraint of the force of His intolerance and wrath (belonging to his mission  
of destruction) resides in His abode for the welfare of all the living beings  
of all worlds. Being constantly meditated upon by scores of enlightened and  
unenlightened souls, the semi-divine snakelike ones, the ones of perfection,  
the heavenly singers, the ones founded in knowledge and the wise, He in  
rapture under the influence rolls His eyes to and fro. With the nectar of a  
fine choice of words and sweet song His associates, the leaders of the  
different groups of demigods, please Him whose luster never fades, He who is  
ever fresh with the fragrance of the tulsi flowers, and beautiful Vaijayanti  
flower garland,that with its honey madden the bees. Clad in blue with only a  
single earring and the beauty of His auspicious hands placed on the handle of  
His plow He, wearing a golden belt and as invincible as the elephant of the  
first one among the gods Indra, is engaged in His transcendental pastimes as  
the Supreme Lord in person. They who seek liberation and through the  
tradition hear about the glories of this one Lord, will very soon cut with the  
age-old knot of maya consisting of passion, goodness and ignorance which as a  
consequence of the propensity for karmic actions was tied firmly in the core  
of their hearts.   
The greatly powerful son of Brahma, Narada accompanied by his instrument  
Tumburu, describes Him in the brahmin assembly with a selection of verses: 'How can one with certainty understand the path of Him,who is the One, and yet  
diverse in His manifestation, of Him of a unlimited form that has no  
beginning, of Him by whose glance the modes of material nature - headed by  
goodness - were enabled to function as the primary causes of creation,  
maintenance and destruction? Out of His mercy for us He, completely  
transcendental to this manifestation, exhibited His existence in different  
forms, He who, reclaiming the minds of His devotees, in His pastimes shines as  
the most liberal and powerful master of all beings,without material  
impurities. Any person in distress who accidentally heard about Him,or any  
fallen soul who just to participate repeated or chanted His name, will be  
instantly freed from all sins.. Of whom else but Lord Ananta S'esha should any  
seeker of salvation take shelter? Whoever, however many tongues he would have,  
can enumerate the Supreme Lord His potencies? For His groundless powers are  
immeasurable. This universe with its mountains, trees, oceans and beings is  
nothing but an atom fixed on one hood of Ananta, He who has thousands of  
hoods.   
 Such is the majesty of the Supreme Lord Ananta: relying on His own power, He  
at the basis of the entire universe constitutes the greatness of all qualities  
and glory,and engaged in pastimes for the sake of her maintenance, keeps the  
earth from the fall.'

**_The Killing of the Demon Putana_**  
 **That one called Putana, who could travel by air, once flew to the village  
of Nanda, converted herself by mystic power into a beautiful woman,and, moving  
about at will, penetrated wherever she wanted. With her hair arranged with  
jasmine flowers, with her very big breasts and hips that outweighed her slim  
waist, with her nice clothes and the earrings she wore, with the brilliance  
and great attraction of her face, that was surrounded by her black hair, and  
with the appealing glances she threw at everyone, she as a beauty attracted  
the attention of everyone in Gokula. To the gopss it seemed that she, so  
ravishing with a lotus in her hand, was the Goddess of beauty who had come to  
see her Husband. In the house of Nanda looking for children,the baby  
murderess saw there lying Lord Krishna,the Child Who Putts an End to all  
Untruth, whose unlimited power was covered, just like fire hidden within  
ashes. Understanding that she was there to kill babies He, the Unlimited Soul  
of the Animate and Inanimate,closed His eyes the moment she, unaware like  
someone who takes a sleeping snake for a rope, placed Him, her own death, on  
her lap.**   
**With an evil mind acting most pleasantly she was like a sharp sword in a  
nice scabbard. The mothers Yas 'oda and Rohini seeing her in the room were so  
impressed by her beauty,that they stood rooted to the spot. The terrible  
woman placed Him on her lap and on the spot pushed her breast into His mouth.  
The breast was smeared with a strong poison, but the Supreme Lord in response  
squeezed her painfully hard with both His hands and vehemently sucked both the  
poison and the life out of her. She being completely exhausted from the core  
of her being cried 'stop, stop, enough!' and severely perspiring opened her  
eyes wide and violently struggled, beating over and over with her arms and  
legs. The very deep and powerful sound she produced made the earth with its  
mountains and outer space with all its stars above and the worlds below  
tremble in all directions. People who felt the vibrations feared to be hit by  
lightening and fell flat to the ground. Thus squirming,being tormented at her  
breasts, she, with her mouth wide open and all of her arms, legs and hair  
spread out, gave up her life. Thereupon she expanded to her original demoniac  
form and collapsed on the pasturing grounds oh King, just as when Vritrasura  
was killed by Indra's bolt. As her body fell down it smashed all trees twelve  
miles around oh King, for it was wonderfully gigantic.   
The gopas and gops, who in their hearts, ears and heads were already shocked  
by the loud yelling, were terrified to see that massive body. The mouth had  
fearful teeth as high as a plow, the nostrils were as big as mountain caves,  
the breasts were like huge boulders, the scattered hair looked like copper,  
the deep eye sockets were like overgrown wells, the thighs were like river  
banks, the limbs resembled dams and the abdomen looked like a dried up lake.  
And on top of it the child was fearlessly playing. It was quickly picked up by  
the approaching gopis who all were greatly excited. Together with Yas'oda and  
Rohini they waved a cow's tail around the child in order to assure it of full  
protection against all dangers...   
The gopis took a sip of water and after placing the letters of the following  
mantra on their bodies and two hands, they proceeded with the child: 'May Aja protect Your legs, may Maniman protect Your knees, may Yajna protect  
Your thighs, may Acyuta protect You above the waist, may Hayagriva protect  
Your abdomen, may Kes'ava protect Your heart, may Is'a protect Your chest, may  
Surya protect Your neck, may Vishnu protect Your arms, may Urukrama protect  
Your mouth and may Is'vara protect Your head. May CakrI protect You from the  
front, may the Supreme Personality of Gadadhari, the carrier of the club,  
protect You from the back and may the killer of Madhu and Ajana, the carrier  
of the bow and the sword protect Your two sides. May Lord Urugaya, the carrier  
of the conch shell, protect You from all corners, may Upendra protect You from  
above, may Garuda protect You on the ground and may the Supreme Person of  
Haladhara protect You on all sides. May Your senses be protected by  
Hrishikes'a and Your life air by Narayana, may the Master of S'vetadvipa  
protect Your memory and may Your mind be guarded by Yoges'vara. May  
Pris'nigarbha protect Your intelligence, may Your soul be protected by  
Bhagavan, may Govinda protect You when You play and may Madhava protect You in  
Your sleep. May the Lord of Vaikunthha protect You when You walk, may the  
Husband of the Goddess of Fortune protect You when You sit down and may Lord  
Yajnabhuk, the fear of all evil planets, protect You when You enjoy life. The  
demoniac women, devils and haters of children that are like bad stars, the  
evil spirits, hobgoblins, ghosts and spooks, the ogres, monsters and witches  
like Kothara, Revati, Jyeshthha, Matrika and Putana who drive people mad, are  
the ones who bewilder the memory and hinder one's body, life air and vitality.  
May those nightmarish beings who cause so much trouble for both old and young  
people, all be vanquished, may they all be scared away by the chanting of Lord  
Vishnu's names.'   
 The inhabitants of Vraja cut the mass of the body into pieces with the help  
of axes. Then it was thrown away in a distant place, covered with wood and  
burned to ashes. When they cremated the body, the smoke produced turned out to  
be as serenely fragrant as aguru incense. Being sucked by Krishna that body  
had been instantly freed from all contaminations. If Putana, that child  
murderess and she-devil hankering for blood, despite her lust to destroy,  
could attain the supreme destination after offering her breast to the Lord,  
then what to say of those with faith and devotion who, just like His  
affectionate mothers, offered the one most dear, Krishna, the Supreme  
Personality, what He needed? The Supreme Lord embraced her breast and trod  
her body with His lotus feet, which devotees always have in their hearts and  
are held in devotion by the ones praised everywhere. When she, by assuming  
the position of a mother, went to heaven even though she was a murderess, then  
what would that mean for the motherly cows that by Krishna were sucked for  
enjoying the milk? Oh King, for all women whose milk was flowing for love of  
the child,milk that He, the Supreme Lord, the bestower of Oneness, Giver of  
Liberation and son of Devaki, drank to His satisfaction, for all the ones who  
constantly made Krishna their maternal concern,like gopis,it can never be so  
that they return to the material ocean where one lusts in ignorance.

**_Krishna Chastises the Serpent Kaliya_**  
_Sri S 'uka said: 'In the Kalindi there was a certain lake where Kaliya serpent resided and its  
water boiled because of the fire of his poison. Birds flying over it would  
fall dead into its waters. All plant and animal life on the shore died because  
it came into contact with the poisonous vapor,that by the wind was carried  
from the waves. Krishna had descended to subdue the wicked ones. Seeing how  
severely the river was contaminated by the terribly effective, powerful  
poison, He climbed in a Kadamba tree, slapped His arms, tightened His belt and  
jumped into the poisoned water. From the force of the fall of the Essential  
Person,the water of the serpent's lake in turmoil from the poison that the  
snake was vomiting, started to overflow on all sides,so that its fearsome  
waves washed over the shore for a hundred bow lengths. What an immeasurable  
strength that was! My best one, when the snake heard the sound that Krishna  
produced while He, playing like a big elephant, with His mighty arms was  
engaged in whirling the waters around, he rushed forward, unable to tolerate  
the violation of his territory. And while He, so attractive in His yellow  
garments and as delicate as a glowing white cloud, with the S'rivatsa, His  
smiling beautiful face and with His feet resembling the inside of a lotus,  
thus fearlessly was playing, He was angrily bitten in the chest by Kaliya and  
enveloped in his coils. Seeing Him being immobilized in the grip of the  
snake's coils, His dear friends, the tenders of the animals, were greatly  
disturbed. With their intelligence bewildered, in pain and full of remorse and  
fear, they fell to the ground, for they had dedicated everything, themselves,  
their relations, their wealth, their wives and objects of desire to Krishna.  
The cows, the bulls and the she-calves with their eyes fixed on Krishna, cried  
out loudly in great distress while they fearfully lamented in shock.   
Thereupon most fearsome, ominous disturbances arose in Vraja. Three kinds of  
signs in the sky, upon the earth and in the living beings, heralded imminent  
danger. The cowherds headed by Nanda who saw these signs were beset with  
fear. They knew that Krishna herding the cows had left without Balarama. Not  
knowing His prowess, they were overwhelmed by pain, grief and fear. Because of  
those bad omens they thought that something bad had happened and could only  
think of Him who was their very life breath. The children, the elderly ones  
and the ladies,my best one, all felt as wretched as a cow missing her calf and  
anxiously set out to look for Krishna. Balarama, the Sweet Supreme Lord,  
seeing them that distressed, gently smiled and did not speak a word, knowing  
well the power of His younger brother. Searching for their dear most Krishna  
they followed the trail marked by the footprints of the Lord. They lead to the  
bank of the Yamuna. Quickly they followed the marks of the lotus, the  
barleycorn, the elephant goad, the thunderbolt and the flag of the Master of  
their community,that they here and there, dispersed between other footprints  
saw on the cow path. When they at a distance saw Krishna motionless within  
the lake,enveloped by the coils of the snake body,and the cowherd boys laying  
unconscious in the flooded water with all the animals crying around them, they  
in their distress were in the greatest despair. Now that their sweetheart was  
seized by the serpent, the gopis who in their hearts were so attached to Him,  
the Supreme, Unlimited Personality, while remembering His loving smiles,  
glances and words were tormented by the greatest agony. Being deprived of  
their darling, they experienced the three worlds as being completely empty.  
Holding back Krishna's mother, they with their eyes fixed upon her son,  
equally pained shed a flow of tears. Standing there like corpses they stared  
at Krishna's face and one by one recounted the stories about the Darling of  
Vraja. Seeing Krishna, their life and soul,Nanda and his men, were by the  
All-powerful Lord Balarama,who knew well the might of Krishna, withheld to  
enter the lake. When He, the only one they had, for some time was caught in  
that position and saw how His cowherd folk on His behalf was standing there in  
utter despair together with the women and children, He put an end to His  
imitation of the mortal way,and rose up from the coils of the serpent. By  
expanding His body the serpent was forced to let Him go because of the pain.  
Kaliya thereupon furiously raised his hoods high, breathed heavily through his  
nostrils,that were like two vessels of boiling poison,and stared the Lord in  
the face with eyes like firebrands. Kaliya, moving his double-pointed tongue  
to and fro between his two lips and with his terrible look full of poisonous  
fire eagerly spying for an opportunity to strike, was playfully approached by  
Krishna from all sides,moving around him like He was Garuda,the king of the  
birds. Thus turning around him Krishna exhausted him and forced him to bend  
down his highly raised shoulders. The Lord thereupon climbed on top of the  
broad heads and then, as the Original One, the First Spiritual Master of All  
the Arts, started to dance. His lotus feet in touch with the snake therewith  
turned red from the many jewels on the many heads._**   
_That very moment His servants arrived together with their wives: the  
heavenly singers and perfected souls, the sages and the venerable ones. Taking  
notice of Him being engaged in His dancing, they all were greatly pleased,and  
played two-sided clay drums, smaller drums and large drums, with songs,  
flowers and other forms of praise. Whichever of Kaliya 's one hundred-and-one  
heads would not bow down,they were immediately trampled down by Krishna. The  
Lord who with His kicking feet punishes the evil ones, made the serpent that  
hardly moved spit horrible,poisonous blood from its mouth and nostrils,while  
it experienced the greatest anguish. Poison oozed from his eyes,and whichever  
vomiting head would he rise,breathing heavily in his anger, Krishna, while  
dancing, with His foot forced down into submission. Every time that happened,  
He with flowers was worshiped for being the Original Person. Profusely  
vomiting blood, with his numerous hoods broken and with his body defeated by  
His amazing dancing oh ruler of man, Kaliya remembered the oldest person, Lord  
Narayana, the spiritual master of all moving and nonmoving entities. Within  
his mind he turned to Him for shelter. Seeing that the serpent got tired of  
the heavy weight of the heels of Lord Krishna, in whose abdomen the entire  
universe is found,and that his umbrella-like hoods were shattered by His  
trampling, his wives in distress approached the Original Lord with their  
clothing, ornaments and locks of hair in disarray. Innerly totally upset  
approaching for shelter, they laid their bodies and children on the ground  
before Him, the Lord and Refuge of All Creatures. They bowed down, saintly  
joined their hands and solicited the liberation of their sinful husband._**   
_The wives of the serpent said: 'The punishment for this person who acted against the rules is deserved. With  
an equal vision towards sons and foes, You descended in this world to subdue  
the wicked ones and punish for the sake of a positive result. This punishment  
of the falsehood administered by You is actually a form of mercy,because by  
dispelling the contamination, as You did with his appearance as a serpent, You  
even being angry are of grace in accepting the ones embodied. Of what kind of  
properly performed penance has he been in his former lives, with which he,  
free from pride and thinking of others, religiously or otherwise being of  
compassion with everybody, has satisfied You, the Good Self of all living  
beings? We don't know what of his actions led to this result oh Lord. To be  
qualified to touch the dust of Your lotus feet is something for which the  
Goddess of Fortune, the best of all women, has performed austerities, has  
given up all desires by keeping to her vow for a long time. They who attained  
the dust of Your lotus feet neither desire heaven nor rulership over all,  
neither want to be the topmost creator nor the master of the world and neither  
wish the perfections of yoga nor freedom from rebirth.   
Even though he, the king of the serpents being born in the mode of ignorance  
oh Lord, was under the sway of anger, he has achieved that what is so  
difficult for others to achieve. For those who filled with desires are covered  
by a physical body and wander through the cycles of material existence, all  
opulence will manifest itself before their eyes because of the dust of Your  
feet. We offer You, the Supreme Lord, the Original Person and the Greater  
Soul, You, the Shelter of All that Exists, the Supreme Primordial Cause and  
the Supreme One in the Beyond, our obeisances. For You, the Ocean of  
Spiritual Knowledge and Wisdom, for You, the Absolute Truth of an unlimited  
potency, for You who are free from the modes and free from all changes of  
form, for You, the Prime Mover, there is our reverence. We pray for You as the  
Time, for You as the Certainty with the Time and for You as the Witness of all  
Time measures. Our prayers are there for You in the Form of the Universe, for  
You as the One Supervising it All, for You as the Creator and for You who are  
the Final Cause of the Universe. Our obeisances for You who are the Soul and  
refuge for the intelligence, the spirit, the life breath and the senses, for  
You who constitutes the subtle basis for the perception and the material  
elements, for You from whom one falsely identifies with the three modes so  
that one's self-awareness is covered. We pray to You, the Unlimited One, the  
Transcendental One who are the center to the multitude, You who are the  
omniscient one and He who accepts the different doctrines and constitutes the  
power of the expression of ideas and words. Again and again we prove our  
respects for the foundation of all authoritative proof, for the author of the  
revealed scriptures and for the source of the Vedic texts that both restrict  
[nivritti] and incite [pravritti]. We bow before Lord Krishna and Lord Rama,  
the sons of Vasudeva, as also before Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Our obeisances  
to the Master of the Satvatas,the devotees of Krishna. Our salutations are  
there for Him who manifests the various qualities, He who disguises Himself by  
the modes but also because of the functioning of the modes can be  
acknowledged, He, who by His devotees is known as the independent witness of  
the modes. Oh Controller of the Senses, let there be our reverence for You who  
are so inscrutable in Your unmanifest state and so perfect in the state of all  
Your manifest forms, for You who acts so silently with the silent ones. We  
worship Him, the Knower of the Higher and Lower Destinations, the Regulator of  
All Things, You who stands apart from the universe and [yet] are the universe  
itself, You who are the Overseer of That and the Root Cause of this all. You  
are the Almighty Lord of the Creation, Maintenance and Destruction of this  
universe who, beginningless and without acting with the modes, with the  
potency of Time endeavors,to promote the balance, in relation to the modes.  
While impeccably playing Your game, You by Your glance awaken the distinctive  
dormant characteristics of each of these modes. The ones of peace, the  
restless ones and those born in slowness are Your material embodiments in the  
three worlds. Wishing to maintain the dharma You are present in this world in  
order to protect the saintly and the peace-loving ones dear to You. The master  
for once should tolerate the offense that was committed by his own subject.  
You oh Peace Personified, should forgive it this foolish one our husband who  
failed to understand You. Oh Supreme Lord have mercy, the serpent is breathing  
his last. Since we women are pitied by the saints, our husband should be  
granted his life. Please tell us, Your maidservants, what we should do. By the  
faithful execution of Your command one will surely be released from all  
fear._**   
_Sri S 'uka said:  'He, the Supreme Lord, thus extensively praised by the wives of the stupefied  
snake, thereupon released him whose heads were defeated by His trampling feet.  
Slowly he with difficulty regained his senses and vital force. Breathing  
normally again and miserable, Kaliya spoke submissively to Krishna,   
'We [snakes] so vicious and ignorant by birth, are of a constant anger. For  
normal living beings it is difficult to give up the propensities by which they  
hold on to that what is untrue oh Lord! Oh Creator, oh Lord of the Time and  
the Seasons, You are the one who generated this universe filled with the  
appearances of the natural modes,endowed with different personal propensities  
in varieties of talents and physical capabilities, wombs and seeds, with  
different mentalities and forms. And we present here in this world oh Supreme  
Lord, are because of the serpent species bound to anger. How can we in our  
bewilderment on our own accord get rid of Your insuperable Maya? Let there be  
from Your good self as the cause in this matter, as the Knower of this All, as  
the Master of this Universe, for us the arrangement You think fit, whether it  
concerns Your mercy or Your punishment.'   
 S'uka said: 'The Supreme Lord, in the role of a human being thus hearing the  
words then said:  'You, oh serpent, must not stay here any longer. Go directly to the ocean  
with your folk, your children and women. May the wealth of the river be  
enjoyed by the human beings and the cows. Any mortal being who remembers this  
command of Mine to you and recites it at the beginning and the end of the day,  
will not become afraid of you. He who at the place of this pastime of Mine  
bathes and gratifies the gods and others with the water, will, when he  
remembers Me, is of worship is free from all sins. Afraid of Garuda you  
abandoned the island Ramanaka and took shelter of this lake, but now that you  
are marked by My feet he will not devour you.'

The following verse and the Padigam by Jnana Sambandhar, has been composed   
and sung in the Siva temple, in Tirup paachil achiaamam. This place is near   
Bhikshandar Kovil railway station, on the train route between Tiruchirapalli

requested him to cure her by praying to Siva. The saint poet sang the Padigam   
and the girl got cured.

to make this girl suffer in delusion like this?

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva of Tiruvalangadu, (Pazhaiyanur). This place is in Thondai   
Kingdom (present Kanchipuram and Chingleput Districts of Tamizh Nadu).   
The Padigam is in Saiva Canon 1.45.   
Siva - Urthva thaandeswarar.   
Uma - Vandaar kuzhali Ammai.   
Holy Waters - Mukti tirtham.   
Holy Tree - Jackfruit tree.   
This place is also called Pazhaiyanur. The story is interesting. There was  
one   
brahmin lady, by name Navajnani. A brahmin boy promised to marry her but  
cheated   
her, killed her and married some one else. The lady wanted to punish him. In  
the next birth she was born as a daughter of one Purisai Kizhaar, an  
agriculturist. The brahmin   
boy took birth in a chettiar (trading community) family and was named Dhana  
Chetty. The lady came as a ghost at night and threatened him. The boy  
fearing death, went and surrendered to 70 agriculturists (who were famous for  
their sacrifices), who gave refuge to him. However, the brahmin lady who was  
born in the agricultural family, took the   
boy by seducing him to come to a lonely place, and killed him. The 70   
agriculturists, who guaranteed his safety, on knowing his death, jumped into   
the fire and killed themselves.   
The above story is indicated by Jnana Sambandhar in one of his verses.   
Karaikkal Ammai, another Saiva saint, who witnessed Siva's dance (URTHAVA  
THAANDAVAM) in this (the place is called Rarna Sabha). The place also refers  
to this story in her verses, vide Saiva Canon. 11.*   
* Tiruvalankattu Mootha Tirupadigam.   
 Tiruvalankattu Tirupadigam   
 Athpudha Tiruvandadi.   
கந்தங் கமழ்கொன்றைக் கண்ணிசூடி கனலாடி   
வெந்த பொடிநீற்றை விளங்கப்பூசும் விகிர்தனார்   
கொந்தண் பொழிற்சோலை யரவின்தோன்றிக் கோடல்பூத்   
தந்தண் பழையனூர் ஆலங்காட்டெம் அடிகளே.   
He is wearing fragrant konrai flowers' garlands. He is also having fire on  
one   
of His palms. He is adorning His body with brilliant vibhuti. He is having His   
temple in this place, which is full of orchards and flower gardens. The  
kanthal   
flowers in the gardens are well blossomed and appear like serpents' heads.   
He is the Lord of this cool, cool, Pazhaiyanur - Alankaadu.   
Arunachala Siva.

kedilam   
river. Here in the cool waters of the river, the kendai fish jump now and  
then.   
He is wearing garlands of konrai flowers which are swarmed by bees.   
The temple is quite ancient, built by one of early Pallavas, and later   
renovated/improved by latter Chozhas, latter Pallava kings and Nayakkars  
(chief-   
-tains).

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed by Jnana Sambandhar   
on the temple of Siva in Tiru NallaaRu. It comes in Saiva Canon 1.49.   
Tiru NallaRu is nowadays famous for propitiating the planet Saturn at the time   
of its moving in not too good houses in zodiacal chart of one's horoscope.   
Nala is said to have prayed to Siva here when he was suffering from poverty   
separated with her wife etc., when Saturn was moving in harmful house in his   
birth chart.   
Jnana Sambandhar when he had debate with Jainas, placed palm leaf containing   
this Padigam in the fire and the palm leaf was taken out without any damage.   
Whereas the Jainas placed a palm leaf containing their mantras, it got burnt   
and charred. In Tamizh, the debate is called anal vaadham - debate with  
fire.   
This happened in Madurai in the presence of Pandyan King. The Padigam -   
Bhogamaartha poon mulaiyaaL... \-- is therefore called Pachai Padigam, the  
green   
(palm leaf) Padigam.   
Siva - NallaaRar; Siva Surya Narayana Swami.   
Uma - Bhogamaartha poon mulaiyal.   
Holy Tree - Bhilva tree.   
Holy Waters - Nala Tirtham.   
This place is also one of the 7 places of Siva's dance, Saptha vitanga   
sthalam. Here the dance is called Unmaththa Natanam - the dance of the mad.   
தோடுடைய காதுடையன் தோலுடை யன்தொலையாப்   
பீடுடைய போர்விடையன் பெண்ணுமோர் பாலுடையன்   
ஏடுடைய மேலுலகோ டேழ்கடலுஞ் சூழ்ந்த   
நாடுடைய நம்பெருமான் மேயது நள்ளாறே.   
He is wearing ear stud in His ear. He is wearing only skin as His dress.   
He is having a bull as His vehicle, that has got endless glory. He is having   
the lady in one half of His form. He is staying in NallaaRu, in a country  
which is surrounded by the heavens and seven seas.   
Arunachala Siva.

1.50. The temple is near Tiruk kuvalai, in Tiuvarur District.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru   
Jnana Sambandhar on Siva of the temple in Tiru Othur, in Nadu kingdom,   
the present Tiruvannamalai, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts of Tamizh  
Nadu. 'Othu'   
means Vedas. Since Siva is said to have discoursed on Vedas to devas   
and rishis here, the place got that name. The temple is near CheyyaRu taluk,   
of Tiruvnnamalai district.   
Siva - Veda Nathar.   
Uma - ILamulai Nayaki.   
Holy Tree - Palm tree.   
Holy Waters - CheyyaRu, a river.   
One agriculturist took the lands of the temple on lease and grew palm trees.   
All the palm trees were male trees without yielding fruits. He prayed to the   
saint Jnana Sambandhar for help. The saint sang a Padigam and the male   
trees became female ones and yielded fruits!   
தாதார் கொன்றை தயங்கு முடியுடை   
நாதா என்று நலம்புகழ்ந்   
தோதா தாருள ரோதிரு வோத்தூர்   
ஆதீ ரேயருள் நல்கும   
All are praying to Him, as "O Father, the one who has konrai garlands on His   
matted locks, O the Master" and describe your good nature, is there any one   
who is not praying to You? He who resides in Tiruvothur, that Ancient, will do  
all   
good for them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Siva, who is naturally free from all bondage who has Uma, who has soft breasts  
like the buds of the lotus,   
and who can grant salvation! The mystic who has naturally the eight  
miraculous powers!   
Siva, who shows the path to acquire those eight miraculous powers! who is  
eminent among the   
celestial beings, like the lion among beasts! Who is affectionate towards His  
devotees!   
The supreme being who is praised by many pious people! The Chief who desires  
Pazhaiyanu, the God in Alankadu, definitely I shall always be a slave to your  
devotees.

Why this lovely body and life   
He parts?   
That mystery, I knew.

பாவும் தனைக்காண்டல் மூன்றும் படர்வற்ற

Beyond Kevala, Sakala and Self-Realization States is Suddha Avasta   
The Jiva in its primal condition   
Is in the Kevala State;   
When it mixes with Tattvas   
It departs and enters the Sakala State;   
Released from there,   
It realizes the Self,   
When it transcends all the states three,   
It enters the Jagratatita State;   
There it is Pure (Suddha).   
Arunachala Siva.

Of ever-during Aaroor which blazed like a peerless   
Golden city; the godly child of Sanbai. The wearer   
Of milk-white stripes of holy ash, sang   
Again and again, the melodic decad beginning   
With the words: "Parukkai yaanai?" and danced for joy;   
Thus he came to the limits of the holy city girt   
With gardens where the bees and their mates hum in joy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Down he descended from the palanquin of pearls   
Which cast their cool rays everywhere;   
It was as if the swelling flood of love overflowed   
From his heart and shone bright on earth;   
In all reverence he scattered from his roseate hands   
Flowers the adoration; he, the master of Tamizh,   
Hailed the city in Tiruvirukku-k-Kural and bowed low   
Before the city of Aaroor ruled by his Ruler.

of deers get echoed in the hills. The bhilwa trees are flush with green  
creepers and leaves.   
The crescent moon is rising over the gardens/ponds. The Lord of  
Ilambaiyankottur   
has robbed my beauty!   
Arunachala Siva.

The following and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva in the temple of Tiru Achirupakkam. The Padigam is   
in Saiva Canon 1.77.   
Siva - Pakka puriswarar.   
Uma - Sundara Nayaki   
Holy Tree - Konrai tree   
Holy Waters - Veda tirtham.   
The temple/town is near Madhuranthakam in Kanchipuram diatrict. One   
can reach the place from Kanchipuram or by train in Chennai - Mayiladuthurai   
route.   
The temple/place got its name as follows. 'achu' means axle. achiru means  
'where   
the axle of a ratha, car is broken. According to Puranas, when Siva went to  
war with   
Tripura samhara, since He had not worshipped Ganesa beforehand, Ganesa caused   
obstacle by making the axle of Siva's ratha break. Siva then went and paid His   
greetings to Ganesa.   
Another story is when a king was traveling in a ratha near this place, the  
axle   
for his ratha broke and he got down not knowing what to do. He then found   
the temple and saw it needed renovation, which he did immediately.   
The first story is described by Arunagiri Nathar in his Tiruppugazh song.   
கைத்தல நிறைகனி அப்பமொ டவல்பொரி   
கப்பிய கரிமுகன். ..... அடிபேணிக்

He has bright locks with threads of golden hairs, which flow like waves.   
They are like corals on the ocean waves. He has two hill like shoulders,   
with broad chest, where the white sacred thread is glistening with sacred  
ashes.   
He has on the left of His form, lightning like bright lady, with slender  
waist, and who speaks and moves softly. He is the One and also the Two. He is  
ruling from this temple,   
in Achirupakkam.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and Padigam has been composed by Tiru Jnana Sambandhar,   
on Siva of the temple in Chidambaram. This is in Saiva Canon 1.80.   
Chidambaram is the Ultimate for all Saiva saints and devotees. All the four   
great saints have sung about Siva of Chidambaram. However only Saint   
Manikkavachagar had merged with Siva here. Chidambaram is simply referred   
to as "Koil" \- the Temple, by Saivites.   
The temple is in Chidambaram, and there is a Railway station in Chennai -   
Thanjavur train route. There are buses from Chennai to this place from North,   
in Tamizh Nadu, and from Madurai in South in Tamizh Nadu.   
Siva - Sabha Nayakar, Ananda Natarajar, Tirumoola Nathar.   
Uma - Sivakamavalli.   
Holy tree - Kalpaga tree.   
Holy Waters - Sivaganga tank.   
கோணா கணையானுங் குளிர்தா மரையானுங்   
காணார் கழலேத்தக் கனலாய் ஓங்கினான்   
சேணார் வாழ்தில்லைச் சிற்றம் பலமேத்த   
மாணா நோயெல்லாம் வாளா மாயுமே.   
He stood as a huge and tall Light, whose crown and feet could not be   
fathomed by Brahma, on the lotus and Vishnu, with unfailing arrow.   
He is in Thillai with great glory, in Chitrambalam, Hall of Consciousness   
and one who sing His glory, will be cured of all diseases, which never get   
cured, (including bhava roham).   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva in the temple of Tirumarperu. It is in 1.114 of Saiva  
Canon.   
The location of the temple, names of Siva and Uma, the holy tree and the holy  
waters   
have all been given under another Padigam on the same temple elsewhere.   
குருந்தவன் குருகவன் கூர்மையவன்   
பெருந்தகை பெண்ணவன் ஆணுமவன்   
கருந்தட மலர்க்கண்ணி காதல்செய்யும்   
மருந்தவன் வளநகர் மாற்பேறே.   
He is in tender stem, the plant young, the flower, the vegetable coming out of  
it,   
and the fruit -- all is He. He is the male, and the female. He is the medicine  
-   
the consort of the lady with broad, flower like but dark eyes. He stays in the   
temple of Tirumarperu.   
If you take the first word 'kurunthu' i.e. kurunthai tree, then it means the   
Guru who was sitting under kurunthai tree, Siva, for Manikkavachagar.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed to request to Siva,   
to cure the high fever (which had been afflicting the entire townspeople, as  
an epidemic)) of the people of Tiruk kodi madach chengunrur*, and when this  
was observed by Tiru Jnana Sambandhar during his visit to the town. It is in  
1.116 of Saiva Canon.   
* Tiruchengode.   
காவினை யிட்டுங் குளம்பல தொட்டுங் கனிமனத்தால்

We are the devotees of Siva, and have grown gardens, and dug tanks and   
have matured spiritually. He is the One who burnt Tripura, and let us pray to   
Him by placing flowers on His flower like feet. No miseries from our past   
karmas will touch us. This is a swear in the name of Tiru Neelakantam!   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva in the temple of Sirkazhi. This is in 1.117 of Saiva Canon.   
The location of the temple, names of Siva and Uma, the holy tree and the   
holy waters have been given under the first Padigam on Sirkazhi elsewhere.   
This Padigam is called 'mozhi matru' i.e 'change of word'. It is a Padigam   
in which the last word indicating the name of Sirkazhi has been changed   
giving different names of Sirkazhi. The ten verses are indicating 10  
different   
names of Sirkazhi.   
கற்றைச் சடையது கங்கணம் முன்கையில் திங்கள்கங்கை   
பற்றித்து முப்புரம் பார்படைத் தோன்றலை சுட்டதுபண்   
டெற்றித்துப் பாம்பை யணிந்தது கூற்றை யெழில்விளங்கும்   
வெற்றிச் சிலைமதில் வேணு புரத்தெங்கள் வேதியரே.   
He is the brahmin, living in Venupuram, (one of ten different names of  
Sirkazhi),   
surrounded by large walls (for the temple), and He has bracelets of serpents  
on   
His hands, and on His matted locks, the crescent moon and Ganga. He has  
burnt Tripura. He has held brahma-kapalam, skull of Brahma, as His begging  
bowl.   
He has kicked and driven away Yama, god of death, for the sake of the boy  
Markandeya.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva of the temple of Tiru Indraneelap Paruppatham. This in  
1.118   
of Saiva Canon.   
'Paruppatham' in Tamizh means 'a large mountain.' In the verses, it is also   
mentioned as 'indra neelap parppatham' \- 'a large blue mountain prayed to   
by Indra.' While some consider this to mean Mallikarjunam / Srisailam in   
Andhra Pradesh, others presume this to mean Hardwar or even Himalayas   
as seen from Hardwar.   
We take the former version. It is in Andhra Prasesh State. One can go from   
Chennai to Nandyal and from there up to Atmakur. From there by bus.   
Nowadays there are long distance buses from Chennai, directly to Sri Sailam.   
There is one Kotiswara Rao, who is an exponent of Siva literature in Sanskrit   
and Telugu. He is from Sri Sailam. He gives absorbing discourses in Telugu   
in some Telugu TV channels. I used to listen to them.   
Siva - Parvatha Nayakar / Mallikarjuneswarar.   
Uma - Parvtha Nayaki /Tiru Neela Nayaki.   
Holy Waters - Parvatha Tirtham.   
சுடுமணி யுமிழ்நாகஞ் சூழ்தர அரைக்கசைத்தான்   
இடுமணி யெழிலானை யேறலன் எருதேறி   
விடமணி மிடறுடையான் மேவிய நெடுங்கோட்டுப்   
படுமணி விடுசுடரார் பருப்பதம் பரவுதுமே   
He is having as His codpiece the fierce serpent that emits gem. He is not   
having elephant with bells on both its sides, as His vehicle but the bull.   
He has ruby like mark of poison on His throat. Let us pray to Him who is   
in the tall mountains, with shining lights called Paruppatham.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse and the Padigam has been composed and sung by Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar on Siva in the temple of Tiruk kaLLil. The Padigam is in 1.119   
of Saiva Canon.   
Tiruk KaLLil is in Tiruvallur district, near Thandamangalam. One can reach  
the   
place from Tiruvallur or from Chennai by bus.   
Siva - Sivanandeswarar.   
Uma - Ananda Valli Ammai.   
Holy Tree - kaLLi tree - a type of cactus.   
Holy Waters - Nandi tirtham.   
ஆடலான் பாடலான் அரவங்கள் பூண்டான்   
ஓடலாற் கலனில்லான் உறை பதியால்   
காடலாற் கருதாத கள்ளில் மேயான்   
பாடெலாம் பெரியார்கள் பரசு வாரே.   
He is a great singer; He is a great dancer. He adorns serpents on His body.   
Without the begging bowl, He has no vessels to eat with. His dwelling place   
is only the cremation ground. He is residing in KaLLil. The elders praise Him   
with great stotras.   
Arunachala Siva.

He will snap the two karma effects of the devotees and grace them as they   
pray and submit to Him. He wears skin (tiger's skin) as His waist cloth and   
He wears sacred thread also. He has serpents and the shell of tortoise on His

Verse 4: சூழுமிதழ்ப் பங்கய மாகஅத்   
 தோட்டின் மேலாள்   
தாழ்வின்றி யென்றுந் தனிவாழ்வதத்   
 தையல் ஒப்பார்   
யாழின் மொழியிற் குழலின்னிசை   
 யுஞ்சு ரும்பும்   
வாழும் நகரம் மதுராபுரி   
 என்ப தாகும்.   
There dwells Lakshmi, fadeless and peerless,   
As on the petaled lotus-flower; there dwell women   
Like unto her; in their Yazh-like speech and locks of hair,   
Flourish sweet music and bees that hum;   
The city goes by the name Mathurapuri.   
Arunachala Siva.

Academies are there where poetical works are tested   
Before they are allowed to pass muster; in that city,   
\-- Vast and hoary and beauteous --, where ever abides   
Tamil threefold of sublime loftiness, are schools   
For learning; there are also fields toward which   
Chanks crawl; there are pools, rich in leaping Kendai fish,   
Into which rush buffaloes from whose udder flows   
Milk profuse and streams on honeyed lotuses.   
Arunachala Siva.

Chains of pearls are on the sandal-pasted breasts   
Borne by the roseate hands of damsels whose pastime   
Is to play with balls in the pandals of foreyards   
Where southerly wafts gently; pearls of dewy sweat   
Are on their lotus-faces bright with dangling ear-rings.   
Arunachala Siva.

He would explicate graciously the sublime meaning   
Of the Tamizh woks rich in truth; even He who is   
Enshrined at Tiru Aalavai and He who will redeem us   
From the cycle of transmigration, presided over the Sangam;   
Such was the hoary city, the greatest in the triple worlds.

He came to be born as a result of the holy askesis   
Wrought by a hoary, glorious family, ever to be lauded,   
Which hailed from the mercantile clan of the golden city;   
He quelled every type of desire and held fast,   
In ever-growing love, to the sole desire true of hailing   
The feet of the Lord whose mount is the Bull.

 மூர்த்தி யார்தாம்.   
Quotidian grew his great love and into passion bloomed;   
He rated not kith and kin and friends as aught of worth;   
Neither did he hanker after even flawless beatitudes;   
His sole concern was the pair of the Lord?s lotus-feet;   
He was a moorti of love and Moortiar was he called.   
Arunachala Siva.

He daily and without fail ground sandal-powder   
For besmearing its paste on Him; he dedicated himself   
To this sacred service to the delight great of devotees.

Of the city and undid the heroic glory of the Pandya,   
The ruler of Tamizh Nadu of the Potiyil girt with gardens   
Of sandal trees, and vanquished him;   
He made Madurai of fragrant gardens, his capital   
Whence he wielded his scepter.

Of the Tamlzhs, but would not duly foster it;   
By lack of knowledge he would not be established   
In the devotee?s way of the holy ash of the Lord   
Who bent the Mount Meru into a bow; he chose to   
Get sunk in the way of the Samanas.
