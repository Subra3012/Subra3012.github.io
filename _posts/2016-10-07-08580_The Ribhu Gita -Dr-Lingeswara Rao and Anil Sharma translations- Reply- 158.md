29. I am alone the immortal and liberation. I alone am the unmoving. I alone am the ever present Self.   
I am the emancipated, there is no doubt.   
30. I alone am the ever pure. I alone am the attribute-less. I am purged of the world. I am devoid of   
body.   
31. I am bereft of desire. I am devoid of delusion. I am the Self prone to errors. I am devoid of the wheel   
of transmigration.   
32. I am Siva devoid of volition and vacillation. I am the Self of the fourth state. I alone am the blemish-less.   
33. I alone am the light, always. i alone am the Lord, always. I alone am the Brahman. I alone am the   
supreme, always.   
34. I alone am the knowledge, always. I alone am the ever smooth. I alone am the mind and I am   
devoid of pride.   
35. Ego is the cycle of life and death. Ego is ever unreal. I alone am just consciousness. Apart from me   
there is nothing, nothing indeed.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
