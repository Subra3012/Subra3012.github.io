this is a long interview with a western advaitin, a great text and of course  
beneficialthere are parts that can be a little shocking, but what is  
shocked is ignorance anyway....   
so please have a look: http://www.shiningworld.com/Books%20Pages/HTML%20Books/Ramana's%20Teachings.htm

Dear Matthias,   
Regarding Who am I?, it is a simple 8-page teaching which can be   
easily understood by anyone who has been brought up under Hindu   
traditions. In case, you find that there is any shocking in the text   
that you are referrring from that web.text, please let me know. I   
shall clarify the correct position, as far as I know, to you. I do not   
want to read that full text myself.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have gone through the text.It is not a commentary on "who am i".The only  
shocking thing is that there is nothing in it.There is no clarity   
in conveying what he wants to tell.

Dear Matthias,   
Dr. Raju has answered your point succinctly. As there are bogus   
ascetics, there are bogus Who am I? also. I would like to inform   
Sri Ramanasramam, about it.   
Arunachala Siva.

I dont think that it is neccessary to inform ramanashram...   
it is not a big deal I think   
I know this is very commun way to talk about the truth in th western  
hemisphere...it is neo-advaita and mostly total crap...   
but in fact there are parts that are good..

Dear Matthias,   
I will not inform Sri Ramanasramam. As you might have already   
experienced through your practices, there is no Neo-Advaita.   
Advaita is as old and as beginningless as the Self. There can only   
be neo-Hegelism and Neo-marxism.   
Arunachala Siva.
