## Poosalar Nayanar (63 Siva Saints)  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 15, 2008, 10:48:24 AM  
---  
Poosalar Nayanar belonged to a village called Ninravoor, near   
Kanchipuram. He wanted to build a temple for Siva, and he   
went around for funds, but could not get much. So he decided to   
build one, in his mind! With great devotion, he buillt that inner   
temple, brick by brick, planted the Siva Linga inside the shrine,   
constructed a beautiful golden dome, and a deep tank within the   
temple precincts, all in his mind. Around the same time, the king   
of Kanchi was constructing a temple, and after completion, he   
asked Siva to come and inaugurate the temple, consecrate, and bless the  
devotees. Siva told him, that one temple by Poosalar is already ready   
and he had asked for the same date for consecration and so the king   
had to wait. The king was perplexed as to how there could be another   
new temple nearby. So he went around places and came to Ninravur,   
and asked the saint. Poosalar replied that he has constructed a temple   
only in his mind and Siva has agreed to inaugurate! The king waited   
there patiently and found on that day, Siva coming with his Uma,   
blessing Poosalar and taking him to His Abode, on the bull!   
This story incidentaly, is more related to the Verse 4 of Upadesa Saram. This  
explains the verse more vividly.

Dear Matthias,   
Regarding Who am I?, it is a simple 8-page teaching which can be   
easily understood by anyone who has been brought up under Hindu   
traditions. In case, you find that there is any shocking in the text   
that you are referrring from that web.text, please let me know. I   
shall clarify the correct position, as far as I know, to you. I do not   
want to read that full text myself.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have gone through the text.It is not a commentary on "who am i".The only  
shocking thing is that there is nothing in it.There is no clarity   
in conveying what he wants to tell.

Dear Matthias,   
Dr. Raju has answered your point succinctly. As there are bogus   
ascetics, there are bogus Who am I? also. I would like to inform   
Sri Ramanasramam, about it.   
Arunachala Siva.

I dont think that it is neccessary to inform ramanashram...   
it is not a big deal I think   
I know this is very commun way to talk about the truth in th western  
hemisphere...it is neo-advaita and mostly total crap...   
but in fact there are parts that are good..

Dear Matthias,   
I will not inform Sri Ramanasramam. As you might have already   
experienced through your practices, there is no Neo-Advaita.   
Advaita is as old and as beginningless as the Self. There can only   
be neo-Hegelism and Neo-marxism.   
Arunachala Siva.
