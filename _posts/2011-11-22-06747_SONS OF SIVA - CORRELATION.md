## SONS OF SIVA - CORRELATION

Om Namo Bhagavathe Sri Ramanaya!  
Recently I have a thought on sons of Siva in correlation to Sri Ayyappan.  
Besides Ganapathy and Subramanian, Sabarimala Sri Ayyappa Bhagavan and  
Tiruvannamala Sri Ramana Bhagavan both are believed to be sons of Siva.   
Is there any correlation between the forms of Swamy Ayyappan and Sri Ramana  
Bhagavan?

Dear Sreeswaroop,   
Lord Ayyappa is said to have born to Siva and Vishnu, when the latter had  
taken the form of an   
attractive young girl, see the Daruka Forest story, in Skandam.   
Muruga was born from the third eye of Siva, when gods wanted a son to kill  
Surapadma and   
his brothers, the demons, who were troubling devas, gods.   
Ganesa as per Ganesa Puranam, evolved from the turmeric bathing paste of  
Parvati.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni had a vision of Sri Bhagavan as Muruga. This he has  
described in   
Sri Ramana Gita. Many devotees of Sri Bhagavan considered Him as an  
incarnation of Muruga   
Arunachala Siva.

Om Namo Bhagavathe Sri Ramanaya!  
One was adapted into a Kshatriya family, fulfilled his mission in human form  
and settled in Sabarimala and exists as embodiment of TATWAMASI. The second  
one was born in to a Brahmin family, settled in Arunachala and fulfilled the  
mission in the human form and exists as the Sun of self enquiry.
