**When Adi Sankara wanted to explain this process of simultaneous creation,  
He gave the example of a city which is seen reflected, in a mirror. Visvam  
darpana drisyamana nagari  (the opening words of Dakshinamurti Stotram). In  
his time no better example than that was available. But if he were living  
nowdays,he would certainly have given the very apt example of a cinema  
projector.**   
Let us therefore see how Sri Bhagavan used to explain the creation of the  
world   
with the example of a cinema projector.   
In a cinema projector there is a bright arc-lamp,in front of which passes a  
film, and in front of that there is a lens. The rays of the light which comes  
from the arc-lamp pass through the film, are enlarged by the lens and create a  
large picture on the distant screen. The arc-lamp in the projector is similar  
to Self, which shines within our body.   
The film which is close to the arc-lamp is similar to the very subtle  
tendencies or vasanas accumulated within us.   
**The lenses by which these tendencies are enlarged and made gross are the  
five sense organs.When the tendencies, which are thoughts in their very subtle  
seed-form, are projected out through the five senses by the light of Self,  
they are made gross and are seen as the picture of this outside world  
consisting of so many different names and forms,which are merely the five  
sense-knowledges.**   
That is,the multitude of very subtle tendencies which exist within us is seen  
by us as the vast universe outside.Therefore everything which is seen outside  
is in truth only what was already existing inside.   
Know clearly that everything which is perceived having come (out) through the  
mind (and the five senses), was already existing as tendencies (vasanas) in  
the heart, like a hidden treasure, and (therefore merely) an old story which  
has come out to be seen.   
 Guru Vachaka Kovai verse 84.   
If there were no arc-lamp in the cinema projector,the picture show could not  
appear on the screen.Similarly, if the light of self were not present, the  
creation, sustenance of this world could not take place. The light of Self is  
that which is commonly known by the name God.   
 **If the film-reel were not in the projector, the picture-show consisting of  
names and forms would not appear on the screen. Instead only a bright light  
would be seen there.   
Similarly, what shines in the outlook of the Jnani, in whom all the tendencies  
have been destroyed, is not this world picture consisting of names and forms;  
what the Jnani experiences is only Himself, the unlimited light of  
Selfconsciousness.**

Dear prasanth,   
Excellent.   
Bhagavan Ramana says this in His Verse 6 of Sri Arunachala   
Ashtakam: "You alone exist, O Heart, the radiance of Awareness. In You   
a power mysterious dwells, a power which without You is nothing.   
From it [this power of manifestation] there proceeds, along with the a  
perceiver, a series of subtle shadowy thoughts which, lit by the reflected  
light of mind amid the whirl of prarabdha, appear   
within as a shadowy spectacle of the world, and appear without   
as the world perceived by the five senses, as a film is projected   
through a lens. Whether perceived or unperceived, these thoughts are nothing  
apart from You, O Hill of Grace!"   
Heart is Sivam, Arunachaleswara.   
power of manifestation is Sakti, Apeetakuchambal.
