## Visiting Tiruvannamalai  
Author: abhilash.ayyagari   Date: September 01, 2013, 11:05:07 AM

Hello all,   
I am planning to make a trip to Tiruvannavamalai after Dussera and before  
Diwali. Since Karthika Maasam starts after Diwali, i understand it will be a  
busy period for a month from then, i wanted to know how busy the period  
between Dussera and Diwali (14th October to 1st November) will be. Ideally i  
would like to visit when the crowd is less both in Ramana Asramam and the Big  
temple.   
Please advice.

Dear abhilash,   
Between Dasara and Deepavali, if you choose week days and also non-full moon  
days, it will be less crowded.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am in Mumbai and you are in Pune, you called me, but still I am not in  
right mindset to call you bad, time and again I think of you Ji, sorry,  
before you make a trip I will meet you to give you few orders from Ramasramam.

Dear friends,   
After a lot of delays, i have finally managed to make reservations to travel  
to Tiruvannamalai on the 28th Feb. I wrote to the ashram to request for  
accommodation but they are unable to provide any on account of Mahasivaratri  
on the 27th. They have recommended Andhra Siva Sannidhi. I wanted to know if  
any of you have stayed at this place and how the accommodation was.   
Also, i was under the impression that the days after Mahasivaratri may not be  
very crowded, would you know how easy/difficult the darshan would be during  
this period. Reason i want to know is, i am taking my parents along and this  
is their first visit to Tiruvannamalai and they would find it difficult to  
stand in long queues for darshan due to old age.   
Any other options available for accommodation would be greatly helpful.   
Regards,   
Abhilash Ayyagari

Dear abhilash.ayyagiri,   
On Mahasivaratri days only the Big Temple will be crowded and there will not  
be that much crowd in the Asramam.   
About Andhra Siva Sannidhi, I have no idea.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you Vinod and Subramanian Sir.   
Vinod - Is there any mail id that i could write to, to confirm the booking? i  
spoke to someone on the phone who took down the details but i am skeptical as  
he mentioned i should call back before we arrive to confirm again. I tried one  
id mentioned on their website but mail has bounced back. There was another  
blog i found called Arunachala grace who had pictures of Siva Sannidhi and the  
rooms and said they do bookings on their behalf so i have written to them too  
but no response yet. please advice the best way to secure an accommodation in  
advance with them.   
And i will be visiting the day after Mahasivaratri, i.e on the 28th Feb. I  
hope the crowds won't be too much on the day after the festival.   
Thank you once again.

Thanks Vinod. I trust Bhagavan and Arunachala to take care of us if he has  
called us at that time I am sure we can manage.   
Many thanks for your inputs.

Namaste Jewell and Vinodji: Yes, it will be nice to have more trees on the left side of the road and  
regular trimming of the ones on the right.   
I can't say that about dogs. Much as I love them, their barking (all night  
long) disturbs me.   
Tiruvannamalai is very noisy and some of the noise is from TV sets. If you  
live in Ramana Nagar you know what I mean.   
Early morning when the rest of us are just waking up, doing sun salutation,  
meditating or generally enjoying the quiet and beauty of Arunachala, TV sets  
will be turned on full blast to some Guru talking in some Indian language. So  
if you have two or three neighbours, there are two or three TV sets that are  
blasting out the same damn talk.   
I have promised myself that I will never donate to this guru who used to come  
to Tiruvannamalai regularly and cannot any more. Arunachala kept him away. HA!  
HA! The lesson for him was that if you are guru, you are responsible for how  
your disciples/ devotees behave _(or in this case misbehave and disturb the  
peace of their neighbours)._   
So, yes, I would recommend that there be no TV sets, radios or loudspeakers  
allowed within the city of Tiruvannamalai just as it is banned in Tirupati and  
Vaishno Devi.   
Frankly, in my opinion, if you live in Tiruvannamalai and feel the need for a  
TV, then you are not ready for Arunachala. That is a dead giveaway. YOU ARE  
JUST NOT READY FOR ARUNACHALA. "We have the money", "we are spending our  
retirement years here" or any such excuse is not acceptable. Find another  
place to pollute.   
Also, there are some people who talk very loudly and disturb the peace and  
then there are some who are so peaceful. When I asked my maid servant why  
that is so in Tiruvannamalai, she replied: "Those people (not her community)  
eat a lot of salt and chillies. It makes them very agitated."   
Maybe community leaders or the local media can increase public awareness about  
this. People on the spiritual path should eat sattvic food without a lot of  
salt and chillies. If you love your salt and chillies or pizzas for that  
matter, then find some place else to live until your vasanas let go of you.   
Vinodji, I agree about the building of houses but that I am sure will come in  
time as the government, the Arunachaleswarar temple and Ramana Ashram play a  
greater role in the development of Tiruvannamalai.   
Come, let us pray that Arunachala blesses them with making the right decisions  
and they have the money, technology and will power to quieten and beautify  
Tiruvannamalai quickly. I have faith it will happen. The government has  
managed to enforce order in Tirupati and Vaishno Devi, I am sure it is capable  
of doing it in Tiruvannamalai as well.

Namaste dear Child of Arunachala and dear Vinod!   
Indeed,all You both mentioned should be done. I am for that,that in all places  
around the world should be preserved nature and animal life. I prefer when it  
is untouched and wild nature more,than buildings,houses and traffics.  
Somehow,we spoil everything we come in touch with.   
So also about Tiru and Arunachala,such Holy place,Lord Shiva Himself,Reality  
itself.   
I also love dogs,animals of all kinds and nature. By respecting this beautiful  
place,we get respect from it too. Not to mention enjoyment of walking  
beautiful green paths,with birds singing and heartbreaking site to watch.   
I never have been to Tiru,but i truly hope i will come one day in one peaceful  
and serene town.   
Regarding pictures,i find them all by chance. For this one i tiped "burning  
candle animated gif".   
I also found one excellent community site with lots of rare  
photographies,named "pinterest".   
With love and prayers,
