## Meditation

Meditation is a deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher states of  
consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of meditation is the art of  
shifting the focus of attention to ever subtler levels, without losing one's  
grip on the levels left behind. The final stage of meditation is reached when  
the sense of identity goes beyond the "I-am-so-and-so", beyond "so-I-am",  
beyond "I-am-the-witness-only", beyond "there-is", beyond all ideas into the  
impersonally personal pure being. But you must be energetic when you take to  
meditation. It is definitely not a part-time occupation. Limit your interests  
and activities to what is needed for you and your dependents' barest needs.  
Save all your energies and time for breaking the wall your mind had built  
around you. Believe me, you will not regret.   
\- Nisargadatta Maharaj

...without losing one's grip on the levels left behind  
This would seem like a key element of what Nisargatta is saying here.   
The first thing that occured to me was the idea in Kabbala that the Crown  
(Keter) is in the Kingdom (Malhut).   
The second thing that occured to me was the Biblical injunction that one who  
seeks JHVH (Lord God) should look "with all your heart and all your soul"  
(Deut. 4:28:29). (I was told long ago by the then chief rabbi of Denmark that  
JHVH looks like a past present and future form of the verb, "to be" \--   
The third thing that occured to me is that, although I really don't know what  
I'm talking about, I find Nisargatta's words, what shall I say -- infectious?  
That is, they have a way of boring in to you.
