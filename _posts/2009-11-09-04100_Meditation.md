## Ashta Virasthanams  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 09, 2009, 07:37:45 AM

Ramanaduli asked about the Ashta Virasthanams, the 8 Heroic   
Deeds of Siva, a couple of weeks back. I checked up with   
Tirumandiram of Saint Tirumoolar, one of the 63 Saints of Siva,   
in Periya Puranam. In Tantra II of the said book in Chapter 2,   
there is a reference to the 8 heroic deeds of Siva. Eight Temples   
are there, to commemorate these heroic deeds. Remember, the   
eight temples do not indicate that the places where the heroic   
deeds took place, but were constructed by Tamil kings only   
to commomerate the deeds.   
1\. The first is Tirukkoilur, in Chingelput District of Tamil Nadu.   
This is to remember the killing of Antakasura, a demon by Siva.   
Tirumoolar sings: Antaka the Asura   
Frightening unto God of Death   
Whose name he bore   
Armed with boons divine   
Harassed worlds all,   
\-- Thus the celestials moaned to the Lord, And the Lord,   
Lifting high his trident sharp   
Pierced him to certain death.   
2\. The second is Daksha. The temple is there in Tirupparialur,   
in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu. This is to remember killing   
of Daksha by Siva. Daksha was the father of Katyayani, Parvati, who was born  
to him, by penance. She is Siva's wife. When   
Daksha performed a sacrifice, for which he ignored Siva, and also caused shame  
to Parvati, Siva killed him, in the form of Veerabhadra.   
Tirumoolar sings: Daksha, the son of Brahma fatally erred;   
Deadly was his sin,   
To defy the Lord's primacy,   
And the Lord smote his head,   
And consigned to flames,   
And then bethought,   
"Such like are needed for this world   
And object lesson to serve"   
And so, fixed a sheep's head to the trunk   
Thus let him be.   
This is also described by Saint Manikkavachagar in his   
Tiru Undiyar, in Tiruvachakam.   
3. The third is punishment to Brahma and Vishnu. This temple is in Tirukandiyur, in Thanjavur District, Tamil Nadu. Brahma at one time was five-headed as Siva. Brahma and Vishnu, encouraged by the flattery of gods and sages challenged Siva's supremacy.   
Siva, assuming the form of Kala Bhairava, pinched away one of the five heads  
of Brahma with his finger nail. Bearing Brahma's   
flesh oozing skull, Bhairava demanded Vishnu to drain out his blood into the  
skull and fill it up. Vishnu in fear obeyed. thus were the two gods shown  
their place.   
Tirumular sings: All pervasive are the Lord's feet,   
All worlds they support,   
All life they sustain,   
That this heavenly being may know   
In mounting rage, he nipped Brahma's head,   
And in the skull drained Vishnu's blood,   
When they, His supremacy defied.   
4\. The fourth is Jalandhara, a giant, the foster son of Varuna, the sea-god.  
By virtue of his prenances, he received a boon that no one could kill him. He  
thus became all powerful and began to harass the celestials. They took refuge  
in Siva. Siva confronted Jalandhara and drew a circle around him. He  
challenged the giant to lift the earth within the circle. Jalandhara lifted  
the circle and immeditely the circle became a powerful discus and destroyed  
him. Thus Jalandhara destroyed himself as per the boon. This heroic deed is  
remembered in Tiruvirkudi, near Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.   
Tirumular sings: The Lord pervades all,   
My heart too He fills with joy,   
He spoke the Vedas, and scriptures all,   
Him - the haughty Jalandhara challenged in duel,   
And the Lord with his toe marked a circle,   
And into it He saw the monster's final end.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says that the discus was presented later to Vishnu, as  
his weapon.   
to be continued....   
Arunachala Siva.

## Ashta Virasthanams - 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 09, 2009, 07:59:50 AM

Tirumular continues: 5\. The fifth is Tripura Samhara, the vanquishing of three cities,   
where in three demons had lived and travelled. The demons   
ruled over from the three fortresses, they landed on cities of the   
celestials and destroyed them at their will. Siva proceeded for   
war against these three demons. The chariot was ready, but the wheel broke.  
Vishnu then became a bull and Siva ascended it,   
and Siva had only one arrow, which was again Vishnu. But he   
never used it. He just smiled at the three cities and three demons within,  
and they got burnt.   
The temple to remember this, is in Tiruvadigai, a town near   
Cuddalore, in Tamil Nadu.   
Saint Tirumular sings: The Primal Lord,   
who on His matted crimson locks,   
Wears Ganga's sacred water,   
He destroyed the cities three,   
\-- Thus say the ignorant,   
The three cities are three impurities,   
It is them He burnt,   
Who knows the this Truth thereof, except the Jnanis?   
6\. The sixth is the killing of elephant-demon, the one sent   
by Daruka forests sages. Siva killed the elephant, and wore   
the elephant's skin as his upper garment. The temple is in   
Tiruvazhulur, in Tamil Nadu. The elephant demon was called   
Gajasura.   
Tirumoolar sings: They lit the fires three,   
The sacrificial blaze roared high,   
and from inside it arose,   
An elephant with evil power,   
Whose hide the Lord peeled,   
Why the Lord did it, they know not,   
Seeking to rival the Lord's might   
the Heaven's beings performed a homa unholy,   
And all those who from that fire arose,   
The Lord smote for the very fire to consume.   
Tirumoolar adds here that in the sacrificial fire, the celestials   
of evil intent were immolated in the very same fire.   
7. The seventh is the punishment meted out to Yama, god   
of death. Yama came to take the life of Markandeya, the sixteen year old boy  
who was an ardent Siva devotee. The boy hugged   
the Siva Lingam, in Tirukadaiyaur, near Mayiladuthurai, in   
Tamil Nadu. When Yama threw his whip around Siva Lingam,   
Siva came out and gave him a nice kick. He told him: Markandeya's life of 16  
years will never be over. He will be   
ever 16 since I have frozen the time for him. Markandeya is   
one of the Chiranjeevis, the ever living, as per Siva's holy texts.   
Tirumoolar sings: The Kundalini Fire coiled in Mooladhara,   
Upward He cursed to hollow on top,   
That fiery yoga way, He scorched the god of death,   
That was in Kadaiyur, his holy shrine here below.   
8. The eighth is killing of Manmatha, the god of love. Manmatha, the god of love, came to Siva, who was in penance, to distrub Him with his arrows of flowers, so that Siva could unite with Uma for getting a son for killing the the three demon brothers. Siva opened His eyes, and Manmatha was burnt to ashes. Siva of course, sent out the fire from his third eye and Skanda was born to kill Tarakasura and his two brothers. Manmatha was given a body, to be seen and enjoyed only by his wife Rati. He is otherwise invisible. The temple is in Tiru Korukkai, in Tamil Nadu.   
Tirumoolar sings: The Lord was seated in Yoga,   
His thoughts stilled in deep meditation,   
Lo! there came Manmatha,   
To tempt the Lord with shafts of love,   
But the Love-God's wiles, the Lord foiled in Yoga way,   
And burnt Manmatha into ashes,   
And He did this in Tiru Kodukkai, the shrine Divine.   
Thus came the 8 heroic deeds and the temples to commemorate these deeds.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Meditation  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 09, 2009, 11:24:32 AM  
---  
Meditation is a deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher states of  
consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of meditation is the art of  
shifting the focus of attention to ever subtler levels, without losing one's  
grip on the levels left behind. The final stage of meditation is reached when  
the sense of identity goes beyond the "I-am-so-and-so", beyond "so-I-am",  
beyond "I-am-the-witness-only", beyond "there-is", beyond all ideas into the  
impersonally personal pure being. But you must be energetic when you take to  
meditation. It is definitely not a part-time occupation. Limit your interests  
and activities to what is needed for you and your dependents' barest needs.  
Save all your energies and time for breaking the wall your mind had built  
around you. Believe me, you will not regret.

This would seem like a key element of what Nisargatta is saying here.   
The first thing that occured to me was the idea in Kabbala that the Crown  
(Keter) is in the Kingdom (Malhut).   
The second thing that occured to me was the Biblical injunction that one who  
seeks JHVH (Lord God) should look "with all your heart and all your soul"  
(Deut. 4:28:29). (I was told long ago by the then chief rabbi of Denmark that  
JHVH looks like a past present and future form of the verb, "to be" \--   
The third thing that occured to me is that, although I really don't know what  
I'm talking about, I find Nisargatta's words, what shall I say -- infectious?  
That is, they have a way of boring in to you.
