Dear Friends,   
I was reading the Siva Puran by Ramesh Vishnu.At one of the places it was  
mentioned that Siva and Vishnu were eternal while even Brahma was subject to  
cosmic dissolution.   
Here one question did arise in my mind. Bhagavan when informed by someone, as  
having had visions of Siva and Vishnu dismissed them stating that their  
severe contemplation giving them the vision. At the same time, when asked  
whether Siva and Vishnu were real, he mentioned that they were as real as  
you- meaning the one who asked the question- and me.(Bhagavan)   
We also have read in the sories about the famous saints of Maharahstra where  
one of the saints was taken by Lod Vishnu in his Garuda vehice and which was  
seen by many observers.   
This seems to suggest that while in the absolute sense only the eternal self  
is real which we reach by various means like self enquiry, Bhakti, Jnana etc,  
it is equally true that Gods like Lord Siva,Vishnu among perhaps others are  
overseeing the empirical reality of jivas and on being worshipped will  
defintely bless and guide them to reach the supreme self.   
Kindly comment on this perspective.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Anand,   
Sri Bhagavan wanted to stress that Brahman, the formless and nameless One was  
the only eternal thing. The gods are only   
superimposition on Brahman. But when you pray to a god with form, it will  
take you formless Brahman.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sir,   
What I wanted to ask was whether Shiva and Vishnu as eternal entities are  
existing, blessing devotees and finally guiding them to the formless?   
Do we really have a Hanuman who who will manifest in some form - wherever in  
the universe there is a story of Ram being told with devotion?   
Or are they mere conceptualisations of an individual or multiple individuals  
as in the case of the witnessing of the taking away of Sant Tukaram by Lord  
Vishnu in his Garuda Vimana?   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

Dear Anand Sundaram, Intrensting,that i was just reading the story about  
Hanuman and Rama yesterday. My thinking is that they are real,how much You  
take them to be real,and how much You take this world to be real. For me,they  
are real,Formless with form. It is true that i believe it is only a  
conceptualisation too,in essence,but,on other hand,real too. How much Bhagavan  
is real,in the same way,they are very real too. From this point of view. So,i  
would say,they exsist,guiding and blessing devotees eternaly. That is my  
looking on that,if,anyway,i explaned well what i think.

Dear Anand,   
These are all puranic stories and one can trust them if they want. Siva and  
Vishnu are the same formless Self in two forms.   
One can pray to any one of them and attain the meditation on formless Self. In  
Hindu pantheon only Brahman is real and all   
others are superimpositions. But this is necessary for practisers. One cannot  
directly meditate on formless Self and this reaches   
maturity in Sadhana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Anand,   
The Smritis do not say anything point blank. The Smritis are quite open. As  
the saying goes, Yad Bhavam Tad Bhavati. You attain God in the form you  
worship.   
It is said, Sri Rama Sita Lakshmana Anjaneya gave darshan to Thyagaraja Swami,  
can we interpret it as myth?   
Just look at yourself, we have limbs, eyes, nose, mouth, and we are well  
dressed, so what is not possible? The Supreme Truth can be seen in exactly the  
way you would desire to. Our Puranas, are a testimony.   
Every way is a possibility. The Shrutis are clear about only one thing, that  
is faith. As regards to Saguna Nirguna upasana, you can attain God in any way  
your heart appeals. God can be reached through Nirguna Upasana, Saguna  
Upasana, and other ways as well.   
Theories are just words, the mystic relationship between ones Soul and Supreme  
reality cannot be declared as this and that. Dvaita, Visishtaadvaita and  
other schools are as true. You reach God in the way you see.   
All truths are True.   
As the saying goes, from Tennyson _**" God fulfills himself in many ways. Let  
one good custom should corrupt the worldâ.By Tennyson"**_   
ॐ

Sri Anand,   
I happend to remember this in some other context, but it quite addresses your  
query: Once, when the urchava murti- the idol meant for procession, and was passing  
by the Ashram. The arati plate offered to Arunachaleswarar was brought to  
Bhagavan by Ashram devotees and Sri Bhagavan took a little Vibhuti (holy  
ashes) and applied it to his forehead, saying in an undertone âAppakku  
Pillai Adakkamâ (The son is beholden to the father). His voice seemed choked  
with emotion as he spoke. The expression on his face proved the ancient saying  
âbhakti poornathaya Jnanamâ (the culmination of devotion is knowledge).   
This bhava of a child before the father remained a feature of His relations  
with Lord Annamalai. He did not profess any separate will of his own other  
than the divine will. He never felt any grief nor any mundane happiness.   
ॐ

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. It is a touching story. It comes in the beginning of Suri Nagamma's  
Letters from Sri Ramanasramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anand   
Your question is very clear and valid. Answer is very much YES only.  
Shiva, Vishnu, Hanum, Ram definitely exist beyond the belief or non belief  
of the onlookers. They definitely function in their own ways and bring out  
final realization for sincere devotees.   
They definitely appear in visions also.   
When creation came out of the feeling "I", the Ishwara was manifested  
spontaneously as pure being of Self or Atman.   
The famous advaita saint Appaya Dikshitar has classified the various Gods --  
you can find more information in devaithin Kural.   
The Appaya Dikshitar has categorically procalimed that -- Amba, Shiva and  
Vishnu are very manifestations of pure Atman. So if you choose to worship any  
of them or their avatars, you are automatically getting connected with the  
grace of Self or Atman.   
They are non different. Even when you dont believe that they exist, even  
then, they DO EXIST.   
Even if entire humanity one day denies these deities as non existent, even  
then, neverthless they exist.   
Annamalai Swami once clearly told this in respect to Aruanchala mountain. He  
told that the power from Arunachala is not based on any belief, whether you  
believe it or not, the power is there.   
So what happens is this, all forms are not like Shiva or Vishnu or Ambaa or  
Rama or Hanuman.   
Some deity forms, we can also create out of our own minds, not us  
necessarily, our forefathers can create out of their own minds and worship  
them for thousands of years. Those gods are relative to our minds.   
But this cannot be applied to Shiva or Vishnu or Ambaa.   
Also in Deivathin Kural, Maha Perivaa says that if one worship even mind  
created gods with the attitude that they are Self or Atman, then even if  
those gods create mischief and obstacles on the path, the sadhaka worshipping  
such a being as full embodiment of Atman will attain final realization through  
that form only. But such a path requires more mental fortitude and mental  
strength.   
It is like we pave a new path, so it is very risky and challenging task.  
But still, if one sadhaka wants to follow that way, He can and find the Self  
in that normal deity or god.   
But with Shiva or Vishnu or Ambaa, the scenario is totally different. They  
are already pure embodiment of Self in the creation, path is traversed by  
many saints like 63 nayanmars or 12 alwars.   
One has to simply have faith and devotion. Shiva or Vihsnu will uplfit such a  
soul.   
So now we have two classes of Gods according to deivathin kural-- Shiva or  
Vishnu or Ambaa   
Another set like demi-gods like veeran, irulan, aiyyanar, warriro gods etc.   
With first category, path is very simple.   
With second category, it is first of all rare for a sadhak to pick such a  
demi god as absolute manifestation of Self and worship. But, even then, if  
still, a sadhak chooses to worship such a form as full embodiment of Self,  
in such a way that his faith is total, uncomprimising etc. , then and only  
then Self can bestow final realization.   
Either ways, one think is sure Anand.   
Somewhere in the corner of our mind, if we keep this imagination theory,   
somewhere in the corner, if we keep this illusionary forms theory, then it  
is not true devotion.   
in True devotion, one really believes -- onlookers may say n number of  
things but our faith should be uncomprimising.   
Shiva really exist, quite independently of my notion itself.   
That is why, those days they did not even open Advaita to beginners.  
Ribhu Gita and other advaitic texts are not meant to interpret Shiva as  
illusion.   
There is a beautiful incident related to this Ribhu Gita Tamil work and its  
author Ulaganadha Swamigal or Bikshu Shasthri. I will relate that episode  
later. It is very much related to your question.
