Dear All, I have one question. When i began with my search,if i can call it  
like that,i start changing. I was thinking lately:"Whats happening with  
me?".Like,im becoming selfish,i see more bad things in people,i dont have that  
much patience with wordly matters,and many more similar things which wasnt  
part of me before. I was talking with myself:" Where is old i?I want it back!I  
was better person before.Whats happening with me?" Then,i got answer that it  
is all part of transformation.But still,im not shure. I am not shure what shud  
i do now. What is the best way to get out from that state. Or,i shud wait and  
see what will come. And just procede with practise. Or something is wrong? I  
will be thankfull for your advice!

Every one is changing daily like growing into old outside. But inward changes  
only take place when you step into spiritual path. When you feel these changes  
one way it is good at the same time you must have guru like Ramana or very  
well realalised person. It is seeing our own face at the clean mirror.

That which is changing is not you, and that by which you are able to see that  
spiritual search is changing you, is You.

For the patient who had consumed poison, the doctor would give   
some liquids so that the stomach will be overhauled and the poison   
would come out with a quite a lot of vomiting. Like that, we are   
carrying inside, [but not in stomach], a lot of vasanas, and these   
vasanas should come out quickly to make you clean. That is why,   
one becomes somewhat selfish, does not like persons who are not   
by nature spiritual and sometimes there will be arousal of passions   
too. You will become more hungry for food and delicacies and more   
sensual. These will be brought out to make one clean. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say some devotees: "You will come, when the play   
is over!" The play should be over but we should not through the   
not easily conquerable ego, continue the play. We should not take   
care of that, by diverting our mind through meditation and thoughts   
about God.   
Arunachala Siva.

The personalty is always changing, but what you are is always the same, every  
day it's there.   
You are not your life.   
For what it's worth I went down to the bottom, thru drink and drugs and  
partners. I did all the wrong things and turned away from the path altogether.  
Now I don't think there is a spiritual path at all. When the cycle is over the  
person comes back to Ramana or whatever is right for each person.   
I remember the man who was crying to Ramana saying he will go to hell for the  
things he had done. Ramana said if you do I will come and get you.

Dear kde,   
Someone wrote about the aspect of guilt sometime back. The guilt   
is a more dangerous thing to harbor. Do not have regret for the past   
and have feeling of guilt. You have come out clean from the drug   
habits. I was also one but with some milder dozes. But it is for you   
start the search. Do not feel that there is nothing to do. There is always  
something more positive to do in our lives. The search does   
not end in coming out clean of our bad habits. Once you mind is free, there  
is something to start, this time more positive and towards God. That is the  
purpose of life. Pothana, a famous Telugu saint was compulsively indulging in  
sex. One fine morning,   
he came out and of it and started searching for the real purpose of life. And  
soon he became a saint. Bilvamangala, a Malayalam speaking person, was also  
in similar situation. Once he went to   
the harlot's house [balcony] by climbing with the help of a serpent, thinking  
that it was a rope! Only on reaching the balcony, his harlot - her name is  
Chintamani - told him about the futility of such efforts risking his life.  
Truth dawned on him. He became a saint   
and composed Sri Krishna Karanmrutam, a book of poems on Krishna. He started  
the work with the word Chintamani....   
If one door closes, another door is open. The door is the "I".   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian, I try not to have regrets over the past, after all it  
can't not be changed now. Sometimes I will be plagued by thoughts of it. Then  
I asked to who they come. Yet sometimes, I still find there is guilt until I  
remember to ask who. Identifying with the past is no help at all.   
Thank you for your kind words.

Thank you all for kind and wise words! In the same time i was confused and  
also knew that it is some proces of cleaning. Its strange...many times i have  
some questions regarding spirituality i start questioning,and  
then,voila,answer is there. But,i also saw how much spirituality can be  
dangerous without right guidance. It start effecting every part of my  
existence,outside and inner. Well,i hope it will pass soon. Coz it is  
happening with many other things,like very strange and unusual dreams,etc.  
First i was frightened coz i dnt have anybody who is spiritual even a litle  
bit. Then i saw i dnt need anyone. Everything is in me allready. And about  
your post Kde,Subramanian is correct. Guilt is poison,its not good for anyone.  
This moment is whats important. We all had past. And who knows what we were in  
our past lives. Thats all part of growth.

Are you supressing anything in the name of religion?   
Are you trying to control some thing?   
Are you trying to "hide" from something?

There is only one consiousness. Is not it. But one consiousness which dwell in  
one body asks doubts. Another consiousness which dwell in another body gives  
the answer. Because both are having different mind?   
The doubt also arising and wants to know to answer so it is asking. But it  
does not know the answer. So who is understanding, there is a doubt and have  
to know the answer. That WHO IS?

not,but unconsciously maybe. Well,thats question!

Dear Jwell,   
I understand.   
Dear Ramanaduli,   
The doubt is asked by the ego. It is answered by the ego.   
Another doubt arises. It is all ego's place. Consciousness does   
not have doubt. It simply IS.

Dear Jewell,   
 The Concept of a spiritual search is often misunderstood.   
A proper understanding is needed. So long before I start a "Spiritual Search",  
I should first search for what is true Spirituality.   
The problem is lack of understanding. .. and that is the cause for all  
scenarios.   
My suggestion is, please go through a proper tradition. Study the scriptures  
and understand things.   
That is important. Go through this process like a scientist. Questioning,  
understanding, dismissing wrong ideas. .. all that totally critically and  
scientifically: with an open MIND.   
yes MIND.   
you can try listening to some of the videos in: www.selfknowledge.in   
Love!   
Silence

If anybody who does not have any questions is a realaised person or he does  
not have any ego?   
Now I understand from your post that this question is arising from my ego.I  
pray to Bhagavan to have egoless state to me which is my true nature.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A Self Realized person (Brahma Jnani), will not have any doubts   
and he will not ask any questions. Bhagavan was in that state.   
Sometimes He would put a counter-question or ask "Find out who   
is the questioner?" or 'Doubt the doubter,' etc., These are all not   
questions but only to seek the stand of the questioner, more clearly.   
But the fact is all of us ask questions. Have doubts. This shows   
we are all not self realized though our levels of maturity to attain   
the goal may be different.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in His song Atma Viddai:-   
Verse 4: Of what avail is knowing things   
Other than the Self? And the Self being known   
What other thing is there to know?   
That One Light that shines as many selves,   
Seeing this Self within   
As Awareness' lightning flash;   
The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized person my have some doubts also   
for example if he does not know the way to a particular place... he may ask  
"what is the way to this place ?"   
and he may also have other doubts "where are you coming from? "   
or "how come u r doing this like this"   
lot of doubts can be there!   
why should a Self Realized person not have doubts?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Such simple doubts may arise in a Jnani too. It is like a Jnani   
eating, drinking water, attending to natural calls.   
But what is amazing in Bhagavan Ramana's life is He did not even   
ask these simple doubts! When He was traveling to Tiruvannamalai,   
it is one Moslem Moulvi who had said that He should get down at   
Tindivanam and catch a another train. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai and  
so He had no doubts as to the places where He   
had to go further. Whenever some new visitors came, He NEVER asked wherefrom  
he was coming or to which place he was going further.   
Narayana Guru came to see Bhagavan Ramana. He was in Virupaksha Cave.  
Narayana Guru saw Him from outside by looking into the cave. After some time,  
Bhagavan came out. Then He   
simply said "Let us take our lunch!" While Bhagavan took His usual   
ganji [rice gruel] served by Pazhaniswami, Narayana Guru took his special food  
brought by his disciples. They looked at each other for some minutes. Then  
Bhagavan Ramana simply left for stroll on the   
Hill!   
Narayana Guru was amazed. Here is a person, who does not   
ask wherefrom I am coming, what is my name, whereto I am going, what is my  
job, what is my caste.... He is ever in Nirvirtti! He   
is the Self which does not ask questions or doubts. This Narayanana writes  
this poem in reverence to this great Jnani!   
Like this he wrote five verses titled Nirvritti Panchakam, with a   
paper and pencil brought by his disciples and left the poem to   
Pazhaniswami. After this historic meeting, Narayana Guru stopped   
asking questions to his visitors and whenever someone had gone to Kerala from  
Tamizh Nadu, he only used to ask: "Did you meet   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi? Without meeting such a person,   
what is the point in running around to places and meeting gurus?"   
Arunachala Siva.

These story's of Ramana's life are excellent.   
There are many gurus and realized people, but none can compare to the effect  
Ramana had and still has on people.   
I wonder why Ramana is such a great force.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it  
something really like that,or not. I can ask "What is the soul?". Without  
expectation. Just ask. And i can ask "Is it soul that,or is it maybe something  
else?"

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.

Self realized person my have some doubts also   
for example if he does not know the way to a particular place... he may ask  
"what is the way to this place ?"   
and he may also have other doubts "where are you coming from? "   
or "how come u r doing this like this"   
lot of doubts can be there!   
why should a Self Realized person not have doubts?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Such simple doubts may arise in a Jnani too. It is like a Jnani   
eating, drinking water, attending to natural calls.   
But what is amazing in Bhagavan Ramana's life is He did not even   
ask these simple doubts! When He was traveling to Tiruvannamalai,   
it is one Moslem Moulvi who had said that He should get down at   
Tindivanam and catch a another train. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai and  
so He had no doubts as to the places where He   
had to go further. Whenever some new visitors came, He NEVER asked wherefrom  
he was coming or to which place he was going further.   
Narayana Guru came to see Bhagavan Ramana. He was in Virupaksha Cave.  
Narayana Guru saw Him from outside by looking into the cave. After some time,  
Bhagavan came out. Then He   
simply said "Let us take our lunch!" While Bhagavan took His usual   
ganji [rice gruel] served by Pazhaniswami, Narayana Guru took his special food  
brought by his disciples. They looked at each other for some minutes. Then  
Bhagavan Ramana simply left for stroll on the   
Hill!   
Narayana Guru was amazed. Here is a person, who does not   
ask wherefrom I am coming, what is my name, whereto I am going, what is my  
job, what is my caste.... He is ever in Nirvirtti! He   
is the Self which does not ask questions or doubts. This Narayanana writes  
this poem in reverence to this great Jnani!   
Like this he wrote five verses titled Nirvritti Panchakam, with a   
paper and pencil brought by his disciples and left the poem to   
Pazhaniswami. After this historic meeting, Narayana Guru stopped   
asking questions to his visitors and whenever someone had gone to Kerala from  
Tamizh Nadu, he only used to ask: "Did you meet   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi? Without meeting such a person,   
what is the point in running around to places and meeting gurus?"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A Self Realized person (Brahma Jnani), will not have any doubts   
and he will not ask any questions. Bhagavan was in that state.   
Sometimes He would put a counter-question or ask "Find out who   
is the questioner?" or 'Doubt the doubter,' etc., These are all not   
questions but only to seek the stand of the questioner, more clearly.   
But the fact is all of us ask questions. Have doubts. This shows   
we are all not self realized though our levels of maturity to attain   
the goal may be different.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in His song Atma Viddai:-

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, You are correct. Only,the point is sometimes just in  
different looking on things. Without hate or love. But,i will say you are  
correct. Humility is needed. And dear Srkudai, Thank you for the link you sent

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A Self Realized person (Brahma Jnani), will not have any doubts   
and he will not ask any questions. Bhagavan was in that state.   
Sometimes He would put a counter-question or ask "Find out who   
is the questioner?" or 'Doubt the doubter,' etc., These are all not   
questions but only to seek the stand of the questioner, more clearly.   
But the fact is all of us ask questions. Have doubts. This shows   
we are all not self realized though our levels of maturity to attain   
the goal may be different.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in His song Atma Viddai:-   
Verse 4: Of what avail is knowing things   
Other than the Self? And the Self being known   
What other thing is there to know?   
That One Light that shines as many selves,   
Seeing this Self within   
As Awareness' lightning flash;   
The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

for example if he does not know the way to a particular place... he may ask  
"what is the way to this place ?"   
and he may also have other doubts "where are you coming from? "   
or "how come u r doing this like this"

why should a Self Realized person not have doubts?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Such simple doubts may arise in a Jnani too. It is like a Jnani   
eating, drinking water, attending to natural calls.   
But what is amazing in Bhagavan Ramana's life is He did not even   
ask these simple doubts! When He was traveling to Tiruvannamalai,   
it is one Moslem Moulvi who had said that He should get down at   
Tindivanam and catch a another train. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai and  
so He had no doubts as to the places where He   
had to go further. Whenever some new visitors came, He NEVER asked wherefrom  
he was coming or to which place he was going further.   
Narayana Guru came to see Bhagavan Ramana. He was in Virupaksha Cave.  
Narayana Guru saw Him from outside by looking into the cave. After some time,  
Bhagavan came out. Then He   
simply said "Let us take our lunch!" While Bhagavan took His usual   
ganji [rice gruel] served by Pazhaniswami, Narayana Guru took his special food  
brought by his disciples. They looked at each other for some minutes. Then  
Bhagavan Ramana simply left for stroll on the   
Hill!   
Narayana Guru was amazed. Here is a person, who does not   
ask wherefrom I am coming, what is my name, whereto I am going, what is my  
job, what is my caste.... He is ever in Nirvirtti! He   
is the Self which does not ask questions or doubts. This Narayanana writes  
this poem in reverence to this great Jnani!   
Like this he wrote five verses titled Nirvritti Panchakam, with a   
paper and pencil brought by his disciples and left the poem to   
Pazhaniswami. After this historic meeting, Narayana Guru stopped   
asking questions to his visitors and whenever someone had gone to Kerala from  
Tamizh Nadu, he only used to ask: "Did you meet   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi? Without meeting such a person,   
what is the point in running around to places and meeting gurus?"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
These story's of Ramana's life are excellent.   
There are many gurus and realized people, but none can compare to the effect  
Ramana had and still has on people.   
I wonder why Ramana is such a great force.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it  
something really like that,or not. I can ask "What is the soul?". Without  
expectation. Just ask. And i can ask "Is it soul that,or is it maybe something  
else?"

Dear Subramanian,   
These story's of Ramana's life are excellent.   
There are many gurus and realized people, but none can compare to the effect  
Ramana had and still has on people.   
I wonder why Ramana is such a great force.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it  
something really like that,or not. I can ask "What is the soul?". Without  
expectation. Just ask. And i can ask "Is it soul that,or is it maybe something  
else?"

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, You are correct. Only,the point is sometimes just in  
different looking on things. Without hate or love. But,i will say you are  
correct. Humility is needed. And dear Srkudai, Thank you for the link you sent  
me!
