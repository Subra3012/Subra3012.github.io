7. The very foolish in the world are non existent. The most foolish people there are none. I alone am   
the supreme Brahman. I alone am verily Myself, ever.   
8. 'Here' and 'beyond' are non existent. Just I alone am. I am Brahman, the pure. All is indeed   
Brahman only.   
9. The whole world is ever non existent. Thought alone is the world in full. Thought alone is said to be   
the world. Thought alone is the cause of the body.   
10. Thought alone is the great folly. Thought alone is the small boy. Thought alone is this great   
soul. Thought alone is the great unreality.   
11\. Thought alone is the illusory Self always. Thought is like the hare's  
horn. 'Thought is naught' -   
is ever true. Thought is like the son of a barren woman.   
12. Thought is void - there is no doubt of this. Brahman alone is the whole world. Verily, I alone   
am consciousness. I am attribute-less indeed.   
13\. Mind alone is the transmigratory existence. Mind alone is the circle.  
Mind alone is the bondage.   
Mind alone is sin.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
