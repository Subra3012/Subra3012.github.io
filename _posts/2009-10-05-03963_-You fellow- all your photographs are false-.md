## "You fellow, all your photographs are false!"

A sixty year old man, was showing a video clipping of his   
young days to his grandchild. He told the grandchild, "Look,   
the kid in that video is me!" The grand child asked this   
old man, "O grandpa, but the kid is not like you. It is not   
you, you are not telling the truth." The old man insisted   
that it was he. He said: "O my child, the photograph is   
only me. But I have changed. But I am that only!"   
We are constantly changing. Every second, some of my   
body cells are dying and some are born anew. Science says   
that in seven years, all your body cells have become transformed.   
There is "parinama", change in every second. We do not know   
when I started becoming bald, when I started having white hairs,   
how many times, my nails have been cut and new nails have   
grown.   
The only unchanging truth is Atma. Atma never undergoes   
any change. It is ever new, ever young, eternal, untainted,   
ever in freedom, it is the Existence, Knowledge and Bliss.   
But due to our ignorance, we are taking birth and dying,   
in rhythmic regularity. There is no escape from this wheel   
unless we get a Guru and find release with his grace.   
Saint Ramalinga Swamigal says: How many billion births   
have I taken, O Siva. How much milk have I taken from   
mothers' breasts. This quantum of milk will even exceed   
the milky ocean of Narayana. When shall I get deliverence?   
O Guru who is also coming with me, in all these births without   
fail, please release me from this bondage with your Grace!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arcsekar,   
I have only an abridged edition of Saint Ramalinga Swamigal's   
poems. I checked up in that and I am not able to get this   
particular verse. The complete works of Saint Ramalinga Swamigal   
are in a massive 6 volume book, titled Tiru Arul Pa, the Holy   
Songs of Grace. I do not have these volumes immediately.   
Kindly give me some time.   
Arunachala Siva.
