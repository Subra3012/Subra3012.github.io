21. I alone am the Vedanta, the pinnacle of knowledge. I alone am the consciousness supreme.   
22\. I alone am the consciousness only. I alone am full of awareness. Being  
consciousness I am   
nothing else in the least. I am devoid of anything exterior.   
23. I am nothing at all. I am the Self that is Brahman. I am not anything else. I am the supreme.   
I am eternal, pure and free ever contented and stainless.   
24\. Bliss, the transcendental bliss. Nothing else, not at all. Nothing  
whatsoever, nothing at all.   
Beyond the supreme there is nothing at all.   
25\. All this world is only the Self. All that is mind born is verily the  
Self. All this happiness is only   
the Self. This world is the Self alone.   
26. Everything is Brahman, only consciousness. I am Brahman alone. Bliss is the highest measure.   
This visible thing is nothing at all.   
27. All that is seen is the supreme Brahman. That which is seen is ever non existent. Brahman   
alone is all thought. Nothing whatsoever but Brahman is the supreme. Bliss  
is the supreme   
measure. This, which is visible, is nothing at all.   
28\. Brahman is indeed Brahman, of the form of awareness. This world is full  
of consciousness,   
consciousness alone. The whole world is unreal. The phenomenal world is all  
unreal.   
29.'I alone am' is indeed unreal. 'You are alone' is indeed unreal. The modes  
of mind are unreal.   
Attributes and their absence are unreal indeed.   
30. The whole of earth is indeed is unreal. Water is always unreal indeed. Indeed the world and sky   
are unreal. Light is ever unreal indeed.   
Arunachala Siva.
