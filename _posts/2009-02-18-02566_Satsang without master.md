I'm planning to visit Arunachala on June 5 2009, I have written to Ashram  
requesting them to grant a room for my stay, me and father will be visiting  
Arunachala.   
Regarding the rooms, I want to know what kind of rooms are there in the Ashram   
 **Please note** I don't expect any AC rooms but just want to know about the  
kind rooms in the Ashram.   
I have requested them to grant room for just one night stay only.   
Thanks

In Sri Ramanasramam, rooms are available in their various   
guest houses. I know only about Mourvi Guest House, where   
two persons can stay in the room. There are Western and   
Indian toilets and one can ask for a specific type of toilet,   
if they are not quite well. No TV. There is one ceiling fan   
for each room and a good bath room. But only cold water   
is available. Rooms are given on first come first served   
basis, as per their earlier permission. In case you have   
got a written e mail approval, there is no difficulty.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
The rooms are outside the Asramam premises with in say,   
200 to 500 meters on the opposite side of the road. As   
you enter the Asramam, please remove your shoes and place   
them in the place indicated for them. You can go to Office   
and meet anyone and they would verify the email copy and   
give the room, with details of your address, signature etc.,   
on a record. Then, they give you the keys and also a printed   
pamphlet that contains details of time of breakfast, lunch etc.,   
and also puja and parayana in the morning and evening. You   
have to strictly observe these timings and rules. On your   
return, you can hand over the key to the watchman of the guest   
house and push off. There is no need to meet the President   
at any time. You can wear your full dress, but not the shoes   
or chappals at any place inside the Asramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sir, thanks for the information.   
I though they could give a room near the mountain side i.e towards the gate to  
the mountain path, small individual rooms.   
If I'm not to be mistaken, did you mean the entire Ashram or the road that  
divides Ashram and on other side where there are petty shops (in that side)?   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
All guest rooms now being alloted to visitors are on the   
opposite side of the Asramam, across the road, where   
there are a couple of compounds. A view of the Hill   
can also be had from these rooms if you go to the terrace.   
There are some cottages inside the Asramam, which are   
used only by resident ashramites. These are not for   
outsiders. Only in such cottages, Major Chadwick,   
Arthur Osborne, Yogi Ramaiah and others were staying   
in the olden days. Now these are exlusively for insider-   
ascetics and Vedapatasala boys.   
Arunachala Siva.

intension is to stay inside the Ashram but not out.

Dear karthikeyan.M,   
I leave it to you. Staying in the Asramam guesthouses,   
gives you an indirect Satsangh. All the neigbours have   
come there only to visit Sri Ramanasramam and stay for   
a few days, in His Presence. A hotel room, may have   
neighbours, who drink and make noise at night or come   
back after late night cinema show and bang the doors.   
Staying in the Asramam guesthouses, also entitle you   
to take food in the Asramam dining hall, which is an   
'experience' by itself.   
Arunachala Siva.

thanks Subramanian sir,   
Your word 'food in Asramam' change everything. Yes I have decided to stay in  
Ashram guest room.   
Now for some in detail information   
I will be departing to T.Malai from Bangalore on June 5, Friday around 7.30  
or 6.30 in the morning and reach there around say possibly 11-1 in the noon.   
You said 11 am is the lunch, so reaching there by 11 is not possible given  
departure time from Bangalore.   
12.30 is closing time at the big temple, i will have quick darshan of the lord  
and from there off the Asramam's guest room, as well quick have face wash and  
off to main Ashram hall to have darshan of Bhagavan. and around 4 again go  
back to big temple and have darshan.   
I have bough KSRTC bus tickets to Bangalore, the departure time of the bus is  
11.15 in morning.   
Do you have any suggestions on my plans to T.Malai and else.   
Your suggestions are welcomed   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
You make me mentally to go to Tiruvannamalai. If it is   
late for lunch which is at 11.30 AM, it does not matter.   
You can check in and then proceed to the Big Temple.   
Or otherwise, you can finish your nice tea in the Asramam   
which is at 4.00 PM. and then proceed to the Temple,   
have a relaxed evening darshan of Unnamulai and Annamalai   
and then return to the Asramam before 7.30 PM and have   
a simple dinner there. You have to be in the queue for   
lunch, tea and dinner at least 10 minutes before. The   
details are as under:-   
Morning breakfast (iddlies) and coffee - 7.00 am   
Lunch \- 11.30 am   
Tea/Milk - 4.00 pm   
Dinner - 7.30 pm   
You can meditate in the Old Hall if you want upto 11.00   
pm, with a water bottle on hand.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks   
Regarding the food, when we stay in Ashram guest room, and then enter the  
ashram for lunch/dinner, how does one(ashram staff) come to know that this  
person is staying in Ashram room and the lunch/dinner is given to those people  
only, i meant identification purpose   
And what plans could you suggest me on the next day, my bus timing is 11.15,  
so until that time any other visits.   
My plan on the next day, earlier in the morning like 5.30 or 6 off the big  
temple for darshan and return back by 7 for breakfast at the ashram or you  
suggest the opposite   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
The Asramam authorities know you by face, since you   
have gone to them for taking the guest room keys. Further,   
we always take the guest room keys to show them.   
Next morning, you may either visit Big Temple again or   
walk about 200 metres inside the Asramam from the back   
gate can go to Palakottu, where you can see Annamalai   
Swami's Samadhi. Here there are some old cottages, where   
stalwarts like Chadwick, Arthur Osborne, Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Sastri stayed. Near by are five Samadhis of   
Murganar, Viswanatha Swami, Kunju Swami, Cycle Ramaswami   
Pillai and Swami Rajeswarananda.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R sir, I want to know are there any beds in the guest rooms,  
regarding the lunch scheduled is at 11.00 or 11.30 a.m.   
I have decided to get down near Ashram as the bus could cross ashram in order  
to reach T.malai bus stand and go straight to the ashram authorities and show  
them the print copy of the e-mail. Is it possible to keep the luggage and  
proceed to lunch and then to the guest room, will there be space to sit for  
lunch or should we wait for turns to come (seating).   
Thanks

Thanks for the information, Subramanian.R   
Palakottu \- Just behind Mother's Temple. There is a small   
gate to enter the bushy forest area. After about 100 metres,   
you can see some cottages. This is where Annamalai Swami,   
Chadwick and other great men stayed. There is a Samadhi   
for Annamalai Swami.   
Guru Murtham - This is in Vetta Valam Road, about 3kms   
from Asramam inside the town. There is a Samadhi for   
Guru Jnana Desikar, with a Siva Lingam. Here Bhagavan   
and a few others stayed for 6 months, when there was   
no water in Virupakshi Cave area. There is a small temple,   
which is often closed. You have to check up with nearby   
houses. In one of the houses, there is a key, they will   
come and open the shrine. You can take some camphor   
and light it there. You may pay some amount for the house   
people since they invariably buy oil for the lamp.   
Isanya Math - This is on Giri Valam, main road. Towards   
the end, you have to take a deviation for about 200 mts.   
and you can see Isanya Desikar Math, which is managed   
by Kovilur Math. The trust member stays in the adjacent   
house, where there is a Veda Patasala. Here is where   
Isanya Jnana Desikar attained Samadhi. Bhagavan Ramana   
went for lunch one day, on the compulsion of the then Kovilur   
Math Head, who took him in a bullock cart, literally lifting   
Bhagavan up! Bhagavan Ramana went there, had a lunch   
and gave a small extempore discourse to students on Bhagavad Gita. He was  
hardly 25 at that time.   
Arunachala Siva.

I though putting this information in this thread will more useful for people  
seeking for a stay in the Ashram and thereby to visit these places where  
Bhagavan Ramana once visited and stayed.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
There are about 10 places all in Tiruvannamalai where   
Bhagavan Ramana stayed between a few hours to many   
days. These are apart from Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam. There is a  
small old Tamil book, with   
back ground stories about each place and the rough   
period during which Bhagavan Ramana stayed. Bhagavan   
never left Tiruvannamalai for 54 years! So all these places   
are either in town or in the Hill. I shall soon write about   
each one of them, Bhagavan willing.   
Arunachala Siva.

One more thing i forgot to mention of my journey to ashram,   
As the time was very short and not leave(office) i had to rush here and there  
and honestly, honestly speaking 'the food in the ashram' was all i could get.  
Next time I'm planing a three day visit exclusive to T.Malai and Ashram only.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
A three or four day visit makes you feel relaxed. You may   
visit the Big Temple [ 2 to 3 hours], sit in the Old Hall,   
[1/2 hour two or three times], attend to Parayana in the   
Samadhi Hall [ 1 hour, two days], visit Matrubhuteswara   
Temple [see Sri Dakshinamoorthy and Nataraja there relaxedly],   
visit Palakottu etc., [ 2 hours], Giri Pradakshina [ 4 to 5 hours],   
and Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam [ 3 hours between   
themselves], browse in the book shop [ 1hour]. You can   
plan these things with proper spacing.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan,   
There is a request stop in front of the Asramam for any   
bus. You can tell the conductor in advance. The lunch   
is at 11.30 AM. You have to check in at the office, leave   
the luggage there after collecting keys. You can go then   
for lunch, paying namaskarams to Matrubhutesawara and   
Ramaneswara Mahalinga. If you can make it doing all these,   
and stand in the lunch queue say by 11.20 AM, you are in.   
Otherwise the night food is there at 7.30 PM.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
Normally there are rooms with two beds. I am also told that   
there are larger rooms or halls for more people to stay. Here   
they should sleep on mattress on the floor and not on the cots.   
Everytime, be it breakfast [7 am], or lunch [11.30 AM] or   
tea [4.00 PM] or dinner [7.30 PM], the visitors should stand   
in the queue ten minutes beforehand. It will simple break   
fast or lunch or dinner and these are served with table and   
chair facility. No second helping, except for rice, unless you need it  
specifically.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
I wish you a happy journey and nice stay. Cry before   
Bhagavan, melt before Him. This is a sure way to obtain   
His abundant Grace. If you go one step towards Him, He   
will rush ten steps towards you. Bhagavan Ramana has   
sung in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai: "You the Ocean   
of Grace, in Hill form, You please shower Your Grace upon   
me and bless me! O Arunachala!"   
Arunachala Siva.

The people who for girivalam, can they go to the back side and visit all the  
samadhis? Or people are allowed those who are staying in ashram.   
I want to visit those samadhis. I do not know when Bhagavan would call me.   
By the way I read about APPICHI SASTHRIGAL. N. Subramaniyan from south arcot.  
in Ramanodhyam mag. Very fortunate soul.

**Bus:** I left to T. Malai from my house around 5.30 early in the morning  
reached the satellite bus stand, happen to see KSRTC bus that was about to  
depart to T.Malai, we asked what time is the departure, he replied 6.00 am,  
that was the time showning in my watch.   
We board to bus only to realise that the bus was empty and to comply with us,  
an lady with her son join our journey I was really thrilled I calculated that  
we could make to T.Malai within 10.30 am, so that things could move easily.   
The bus driver sensing emptiness thrive the bus to Majestic to get more  
people, ok.   
We bypassed Housur by 7.20 and I was counting on the arrival time to much  
earlier that I calculated. The bus halted at the famous (infamous) eat out  
that was located just after/before Krishnagiri. Then things happen to worry to  
some reason, may be because of the bus speed and getting people into the bus  
made me sicker of the time passing by. We reach T.Malai 11.10 am.   
 **Ashram:** Halting the bus on it way to Bus stand at Ramana Ashram we  
quickly rushed to the staff rooms holding in one hand the luggage and on the  
other hand the print copy of the e-mail. One of the staffers directed us to  
corner room, we went inside produce the papers to him, he turned a big open  
book that appear like addresses book on my side and now I got it, I took my  
pen starting writing my address, no. of day stay and no. of persons,  
he(staffer) had a narrow look what I have written, got up and brought a key to  
guest room, he replied in American accent '' Keep your luggage in the office,  
have darshan and proceed for lunch and then to the guest room''. He then gave  
directions for the guest room; I had no time to grasp all the words he utters  
to the directions. Keeping the luggage in the office we proceed to Amma temple  
and then to the main hall, walked around the Samadhi and sat for a while, I  
slightly looked at my watch it was showing 11.25 am, we got and rushed to find  
where the lunch was served (because Subramanian.R said we have to be at leash  
10 minutes earlier and stand in the queue so that we are in), of course, I  
knew where the lunch was served but to be more cautious enough not to miss it  
we enquire and he directed us to the door that had a name plate reading  
'Dinners only guest and invites' so we decided to stand little aside near the  
meditation hall, 11.30 more people gather we got more closer the door, the  
bell rang we got inside.   
We passed by large room decorated or to say adored by Bhagavan's photo's (all  
black and white ones, it was rare opportunity to have a glimpse of those  
inaccessible photos) no time (made to move quickly) to stand and have clear  
look at those beautiful photos. We entered one large room with banana leafs  
that were lined up for the lunch. When staffer began the serving the food,  
when the food was served I remembered what Subramanian.R said 'the food in the  
ashram' I got the answer that was in front of me and Ramana offer the answers  
(food) to eat. I don't know exactly how to explain the food in the ashram,  
taste and quantity of the food does not appear in my mind but something that  
was divine. After the lunch we left the ashram in search for the guest room.   
Guest room:** Trying to remember the staffer directions to the guest room, we  
search here and there, finally with some help reached Sri Ramanashram sub Post  
Office guest room, we arrived and again began to search for the room number  
and there it was R-19. We open the doors of our guest room and was simply  
shocked to see how decent the room was, it had fly shield all around the  
windows and doors, we took some rest around 1.30 pm we left to Thirukkoil to  
have darshan at Perumal temple.   
 **Thirukkoil:** we board the bus from T.Malai to Thirukkoil arrived there  
around 3.20. The temple main door (inner door) was close and they said it  
could reopen only at 4.00 pm. we sat down and went around inner parakarms of  
the temple. 4.00 Perumal open the doors for us, we rather waited and decided  
not to rush in for darshan because of the crowd. Latter not to insult ourself,  
we went to darshan, sat for a while and waited for bus to T.Malai, one thing  
that will happen in Thirukkoil is that, bus transport to T.Malai is very rare.  
Ok we waited for nearly a hour or so and there one of them we got in sight we  
quickly boarded and I was planning to visit big temple in T.Malai and at same  
time I don't want to miss the dinner invitation from Bhagavan Ramana. I looked  
out of the bus window, Rudra was sighted and expected heavy rain. Reached  
T.Malai around 7.10 pm.   
 **Dinner:** 7.15 pm rushed to guest room, quickly rush back to Ashram, I  
wanted to buy some book 'Sadhus Remenisence'by Chadwick, but unfortunately  
found book store close, walked straight to dinner hall waited for few minutes  
the queue was formed we sat down for dinner, again the food was simply divine  
in nature. After the dinner we went to main hall did namskar for Bhagavan,  
headed back to guest room   
 **Morning:** Got up very early, we had time for breakfast at the ashram so as  
we were staying Sri Ramanashram Post Office guest room area which is nearer to  
Yogi Ramsurat Kumar Ashram we decided to pay visit to the Ashram, describing  
the Ashram, it is vast that is that is bounded by walls.   
 **Ashram:** The numbers in my digital watch was changing fast to 7.00 am, a  
few spell of rain, made us to rush to the Ashram (Ramana's force).We infact  
got into Ashram, says 10 minutes earlier prior to Breakfast time, devotees  
were singing divine songs, we sat in the hall, after the puja we received milk  
and head to dinner hall, the Breakfast was also divine in nature. we went to  
the book shop, brought some books, head back to guest room, backed our bags  
headed back to the ashram, thanked the ashram staff and contributed to Ashram  
and headed straight to the big temple.   
 **Big Temple:** I was ashamed entering the big temple, because bhagavan used  
to say first visit the temple and then me, this time it was opposite. We  
brought Rs 20 tickets, but the priest and staff did not allow us to sit near  
the lingam as earlier he used to do, we were taken back, just then I  
remembered the words '"What cannot be acquired without great pains - the true  
import of Vedanta (Self-Realization) - can be attained by anyone who looks at  
(this hill). from where it is visible or even mentally thinks of it from  
afar."   
It was 10.30 it was to leave for bus stand to head back to home.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Absolutely nice recordings. You had one darshan and hereafter   
He will call you again and again. You can go only when He wills,   
not a day before or after. Our job is to repose faith in Him.   
To see Arunachala Hill or Bhagavan Ramana or Arunachaleswara   
and Apeetakuchamba in the Big Temple, you can have any order you life.  
Bhagavan went there first because He had a call from   
Arunachala Siva and so He had to report to Him first. We can   
have any order we like. In fact, during my three days usual   
visits, I see Ramaneswara Lingam on the first day. Big Temple   
is always on the second day. The third day, I have giripradakshina, some rare  
places like Palakottu, Gurumurtham   
and Isanya Math etc., No problem. I have so far not mixed up Tirukkoilur or  
Desur or any other pilgrim centres.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Karthikeyan.M   
Thank you very much. While reading your post it gave me such a feeling that I  
was also visiting those places.   
I went for girivalam with a group. I could not spend much time in Ashram as we  
had to go for girivalam on full moon day.   
As Subramaniyan ji said it is His will. So I am waiting for His call.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Dr. Raju also asked for a meeting of like-minded people   
at Tiruvannamalai. Bhagavan Ramana willing, it might   
happen. As for my wife and me, we go there at least   
once in three months or even earlier. The last visit was   
on 30th April-3rd May 2009.

Dear Munagala,   
To be in need of a Guru physically present and living with us, is   
natural for most of us. In fact, I wrote once in this Forum, that   
I wished I had lived during the period of Ramanatha Brahmachari,   
and other young devotees, who were constantly in His Presence.   
But later, I felt that Bhagavan Ramana cannot go on taking births   
in every 100 years. He has Himself said: "Where can I go? I am   
always here." That is the assurance that we have. To go to Sri   
Ramanasramam, as frequently as possible, is one way of spending   
some time in His Sannidhi, in His most powerfully overflowing Presence.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Munagala,   
Even I also have the same yearning for Bhagawan. How I wish even I was able to  
see Bhagawan and serve his Holy Feet.   
But I keep consoling myself with Bhagawans words: He always used to tell that  
we give too much importance to body. Like Subramanian mentioned, when He has  
said 'Where can I go, I am Here' He is here and now. Even in this Forum  
guiding all of us.   
Like we have been discussing various spiritual topics, just believe that this  
body is nothing, believe that what is expressing is that All Glorious 'I'   
Even when we talk with our family, relatives and friends, remember that 'I'  
which is expressing itself out of the flesh and bones. Remember this body as  
just a puppet to that All Glorious 'I'   
Since we have always seen that All Glorious 'I' \- Bhagawan express himself  
through flesh and bones and not as the All Glorious 'I' we are not able to  
feel the presence of the Bhagawan without the Body, for we are ridiculed how  
that All Glorious 'I' can express itself without a Body and thats what makes  
us sad when we think about Bhagawan.   
Just firmly believing in the All Glorious 'I' which is free of any form -  
body. just go inwards and inwards to your centre of the cavity of your heart,  
there Bhagawan is present and just fall at his feet. He is here, feel that All  
Glorious 'I' He is reading this for you and his captivating eyes are now  
seeing you. Bhagwan is here and Now.   
O Bhagwan I love you.
