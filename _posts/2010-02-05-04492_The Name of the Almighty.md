## The Name of the Almighty

In most religions, though not in Christianity, (where invocation   
is not direct but mediate - as for instance in the prayer of the   
heart-, invocation of the Divine Name is one of the most important   
techniques of bhakti marga.   
Saint Namadev says:-   
The name permeates everywhere, from the heavens to the lower   
regions of the entire universe. Who can tell to what depths in   
the nether regions and to what height in the heavens it extends?   
The ignorant undergo endless types of births without knowing the   
Essence. The Name is immortal. Forms are innumerable but the   
Name is all.   
Swami Ramadas also, like most bhaktas, prescribed the invocation   
of the Name. "God and His name are not different from one another.   
Name is God Himself. The moment we think of the Name our mind   
is filled with the presence of God."   
Bhagavan Ramana says mental repetition of the Name is be far   
more effacious than the verbal repetitions. (Upadesa Saram).   
Still, many find rare experiences of sweetness and joy derived   
by uttering the Name aloud.   
In Islam, as one would expect from a religion, whose very name   
denotes "submission", no technique is more priced than the invocation of the  
Divine Name. "The food and drink of the saint   
is remembrance of the Name of the Lord," said Abu'l Hasan.   
For the Sikhs, there is no more patent technique than the invocation of the  
Divine Name, as the following hymns from the Granth Sahib,   
shows:-   
Hearkening to the Name bestows   
Truth, divine wisdom, contentment.   
To bathe in the joy of the Name,   
Is to bathe in the holy places.   
By hearing the Name and reading it   
A man attains to honour;   
By hearkening the mind may reach   
The highest blissful poise   
Of meditation on God.   
Saint Nanak, the saints are always happy.   
By hearkening to the Name   
Sorrow and sin are destroyed.   
Buddhism is the most impersonal of religions. Its essential and   
original teaching seems to have no place for a Path of Devotion   
or for personal worship. In the Pure Land School, however, in China and  
Japan, Mahayana Buddhism has developed such a Path for those who need it. A  
passage in Zendo's Commentary on the Pure Land   
Sutras, runs as follows:-   
"Only repeat the name of Amitabha with all your heart, whether   
walking or standing, sitting or lying, never cease the practice for   
a moment. This is the work which unfailingly issues in salvation,   
for it is in accordance with the original vow of Amida Buddho."   
It was on the basis of this instruction Honen founded the Japanese   
School of Jodo.

Sri Ramakrishna says about Japa: Japa meditation means silently repeating God's name in solitude. When you  
chant his name with single-minded devotion you can see God's form and realize  
him. Suppose there is a piece of timber sunk in the water of the Ganges and  
fastened with a chain to the bank. You proceed link by link holding on to the  
chain and you dive into the water and follow the chain. Finally you are able  
to reach the timber. In the same way by repeating God's name you become  
absorbed in Him and finally realize Him.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. Name is quite important in bhakti marga. Though Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Who am I?: The One who sacrifices his own self   
to the Atma and stays as Atma Nishtapara, is the greatest bhakta,   
He recommended Japa for some devotees who are already attuned   
to that. He recommended Siva, Siva... to Annamalai Swami, Muruganar and to an  
unknown Harijan. When someone else asked   
Him, whether he could chant Ramana....Ramana, instead of the present practice  
of Rama..Rama, He said: "Why change? Rama and   
Ramana are one and the same. Sri B.V. Narasimhaswami in his   
Self Realization, has mentioned about 20 aspects which are common to Rama and  
Bhagavan Ramana.   
Bhagavan Himself has said in Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai,   
Verse 104:-   
"Let me be a devotee to the devotee of the devotees who LISTEN   
your holy name, O Arunachala!" He said that even listening to a   
holy name will bring forth the results!   
Arunachala Siva.

The subtle essence is just merging of Jeevatma into/to/as Paramaatma. The  
peformer of Japa (becoming) one with the Name of the almighty. A similar  
essence is also reflected in the very first Askara mana malai: Arunachalam ena agame ninaipavar, Agathai ver aruppaai Arunachala.   
Those who think Arunachala as the Self - real I - as the only Aham, will  
Himself cut the roots of Aham - ego I.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
