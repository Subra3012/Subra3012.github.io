Is it true that we ourselves are the goal that we seek?

All goals being mental there is no where to reach. Mentally motion is  
possible. Physically motion is possible. for the Self, where is the question  
of motion? It alone being, where does it move and from where ? It being beyond  
time there is no seeking, no goal etc. The mind can continue seeking, the body  
can continue moving the Self just IS.   
There is a Zen story: The laughing buddha was a zen monk who used to distrubute sweets to children.  
he used to carry a bag full of sweets. Some one went to him and asked, sir  
"what is Self realization?" he simply dropped the bag he was carrying [meaning  
to see oneself as totally actionless] and then he asked how would one live  
after self realization, he simply took the bag and went along ! [meaning,  
having known the self as motionless, let things be as they are... nothing has  
to be done in particular].

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai. Nice question. Nice Zen story.   
We are the goal, the path and the traveller in the Self.-enquiry.   
All become goal at the end. As T.S. Eliot said: "There will be time,   
there will be time, when everything looks alike." "I have measured   
my life in coffee-spoons!"

Dear srkudai,   
 The zen story is significant.Leaving the bag is symbolic of state of enlightenment.   
 Taking the bag again is symbolic of state "Beyond enlightenment".   
 Creating a goal is a trick of the mind to elude us from positing in the self.

Dear Raju,   
Thats an interesting perspective. An alternative perspective is   
Leaving the bag is a sign of enlightenment   
but picking up the bag is : knowing that its all a dream, one may continue  
ones usual life style.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Nice exchange of ideas. "We   
are all such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded   
with a sleep." There is a story about Kaduveli Siddhar, a Brahma   
Jnani. The King wanted to test him and sent a courtesan to attract   
him. The lady won the battle, Kaduveli Siddhar married her, begot   
a kid and was looking after the kid, whenever the lady went for   
a dancing job. She told the King also about her victory over the   
Siddhar. One day, when she was away, the baby cried for milk,   
and the Siddhar ran to the King's court to give the baby to the   
lady, who was dancing. Everyone was laughing at the Siddhar.   
"See here is a man who is said to be a Brahma Jnani but had a   
baby through illicit relationship.". The lady was dancing, and   
suddenly her anklet got snapped and she was bending to set it   
right. The Siddhar said, "I shall set right the anklet, and meantime,   
you feed the baby." The King roaring with laugher asked the   
Siddhar, "Are you a Brahma Jnani, still?" Then the Siddhar   
said pointing to a stout pillar in the hall, " Oh Pillar! If you   
are the Brahman and I am a Brahma Jnani, please open up   
and consume me!". The pillar opened up, the Siddhar went into   
the pillar and the pillar got closed as before!   
Dear 'kudai', Ultimately, the bhavana that comes out of faith,   
is a great thing in our path for self enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Yes that is very true. Firm conviction that "i am Awareness" is very important.   
BTW, you can call me udai. my name is udai. srk when i created my mail id,  
i was a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna[srk] and followed bhakti marga. I still  
consider him as my guru and follow bhakti, but no more am emotional abt it as  
i was earlier. right now, to me, Self Inquiry is the highest kind of Bhakti  
too!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Yes, all paths lead to the Ramana Way. He had   
no quarrel with any other paths. When Aurobindo said that   
there is a Super Mind, which is beyond mind, Bhagavan said: there are no two minds, but only one mind and only vasanas   
are many. But He permitted certain devotees to go to Aurobindo   
to puruse the path most suited to them.   
Arunachala Siva.

 When subramanian says forgetfulness is a sin,it is not literal,he means self-forgetfulness is inimical to spiritual growth.

Dear Vladimir and Raju, All sins are predestined incidents.   
But here, what Bhagavan refers is the Forgetfulness of the Self,   
which is our permanent nature and this forgetfulness is the sin.   
Whether, this is also happening as pre destined, is depending   
on one's carry of 'vasanas', our inherent tendencies acquired   
out of previous births.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Nice to hear about your words and your success in spiritual quest.   
This is what a spiritual person does.   
It is as if a diver had entered deep inside the sea, came out and tells what  
is inside the sea.

Dear grhluna,   
Yes, the life of Anandamayi Ma is very interesting and moving. Teachings wise,  
Krishnamurti comes closest to Bhagawan though he spoke mainly at the absolute  
level.   
Anandamayi Ma visited the ashram in Tiruvannamalai and also met Krishnamurti.  
She had simply looked at a photograph of Krishnamurti and realized he was  
"very great". Krishnamurti was always embarassed at being called a guru, but  
Anandamayi Ma called him the guru of gurus.   
For ajnanis, it is hard to make logical sense of the behaviour of jnanis. Best  
not to compare jnanis but simply read their accounts and let it be.

Dear grhluna,   
You are just a kid. I can barely remember my late twenties.   
A mind with a multitude of thoughts often in conflict cannot be a jnani and I  
am not one by any means.   
Quote  
sometimes i feel why be bother to people why not throw my body over a cliff  
What makes you feel you are a bother to people? The body is the creation of  
accumulated karma that must be worked out in life. Throwing it over a cliff  
may only result in another body that has to work out the same karma.   
Quote  
But i know my life is nothing but a dream the body included  
Then you are not a bother and there is nobody else to bother. And no real body  
to throw over a cliff.   
Quote  
Who can understand such being? Can you? I can't  
Ramana and Krishnamurti can be understood only by realizing the Self. Any  
other claim of understanding them is only delusion.

Dear grhluna,   
About that Bhagavan Ramana's photograph of 1900, when He was just 21   
years old, this was taken by one Pillai of Kumbakonam. I think Bhagavan   
was at the entrance of Virupaksha Cave, for the sake of proper lighting!   
One photographer in later years wonders: Why that camera and the stand   
(old type tripod stand cameras with frames), and the photographer did not   
explode into pieces, when he looked into the lens to see the figure of  
Bhagavan? It is like seeing the Sun through a telescope, without filters!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Quote  
To my mind, many can intellectually grasp what they are talking about, but to  
really start listening and go together with them, is quite a task to a human  
being.  
Even intellectual understanding at some depth is not as easy as we think,  
which is why most people who claim it end up arguing and disagreeing most of  
the time. That is because they can only understand certain words as spoken by  
their guru, his explanations, his examples. When another jnani speaks, they  
are unable to comprehend even intellectually since the words, descriptions and  
examples appear different on the surface. Which leads to the 'my jnani is  
better than your jnani' syndrome.   
There is an incident in one of the books where Bhagawan mentions why he simply  
told people to follow whatever method they like and in due course they could  
realize the Self. Otherwise, he said, people will get depressed at the  
enormity of the job! In another instance he says that people did not  
understand how difficult Self realization is.
