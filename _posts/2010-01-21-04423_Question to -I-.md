## Erich Segal  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 21, 2010, 02:12:02 PM  
---  
Erich Segal died last Sunday in his London home. He became famous   
after his book The Love Story, which was his first book and later   
a Hollywood movie. He was 33 then! It gave him tons of money   
for the rest of his life.   
Erich Segal was born to a Jewish parents in New York. His father   
was a Jewish rabbi who wanted his son also to become a Rabbi.   
But Segal showed interest in classical languages and poetry. He   
studied Hebrew, Latin and Greek and Shakespeare, at Princeton, Yale and later  
in Oxford. He was a good poet too, even though people know him only as great  
novelist. He got an award for his Latin erudition and writing poems in Latin  
( an award held previously only by T.S. Eliot). He taught in Oxford, married  
an English girl and settled down in England.   
His later years were full of tragedy. He took to Parkinson's   
disease which restricted his mobility and writing capability.   
He wrote a scholarly work titled The Death of Comedy in the   
year 2000, about the degradation of comedy in the world   
and its people, in the 20th century.   
He was 72 when he died.   
He is survived by his wife and two daughters.   
His famous quote in Love Story: "Loving is not saying sorry."   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan Ramana says that the only desire that one should have   
is desire for the Self. This desire for the Self is also called Self-   
Knowledge - Atma Bodham, to use Sri Sankara's words. All other   
knowledge is useles tinsel. Bhagavan says in Upadesa Saram,   
Verse 27: The Knowledge which is without knowledge and ignorance   
is the true Knowledge. There is nothing else to learn.   
Now, why do we need the Self Knowledge? It is natural for for   
all living beings. It is like a new born child, looking for mother's   
breast, as soon as it is taken on the lap. It is natural for any   
living being to know the Self, the Source, like the river flowing in   
all sorts of lands, finally reaching the ocean back, its Source.   
Arunachala Siva.

which knowledge you want to know? To live in this world we need some  
knowledge. This is worldly knowledge.   
After geting bored, it is quite natural for jivas to know about him, i.e.  
spiritual knowledge. In the begining for both knowledge we need some path,  
quide and of course dedication. That is all. Rest will come from grace. The  
self will be known by itself.

Verse 27: The Knowledge which is without knowledge and ignorance   
is the true Knowledge. There is nothing else to learn.   
Now, why do we need the Self Knowledge? It is natural for for   
all living beings. It is like a new born child, looking for mother's   
breast, as soon as it is taken on the lap. It is natural for any   
living being to know the Self, the Source, like the river flowing in   
all sorts of lands, finally reaching the ocean back, its Source.

which knowledge you want to know? To live in this world we need some  
knowledge. This is worldly knowledge.   
After geting bored, it is quite natural for jivas to know about him, i.e.  
spiritual knowledge. In the begining for both knowledge we need some path,  
quide and of course dedication. That is all. Rest will come from grace. The  
self will be known by itself.

Bhagavan Ramana says that the only desire that one should have   
is desire for the Self. This desire for the Self is also called Self-   
Knowledge - Atma Bodham, to use Sri Sankara's words. All other   
knowledge is useles tinsel. Bhagavan says in Upadesa Saram,   
Verse 27: The Knowledge which is without knowledge and ignorance   
is the true Knowledge. There is nothing else to learn.   
Now, why do we need the Self Knowledge? It is natural for for   
all living beings. It is like a new born child, looking for mother's   
breast, as soon as it is taken on the lap. It is natural for any
