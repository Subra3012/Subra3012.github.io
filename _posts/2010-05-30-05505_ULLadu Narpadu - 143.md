T.R. Kanakammal writes the following comments under ULLadu   
Narpadu Verse 24:- (abridged)   
The perceived body does not have the nature of engaging itself   
in activities with the awareness of the "I". The Atman, the Perceiver, is  
ever still or immovable (achala) by nature, and there is no 'other' in Atman.  
Hence It cannot engage in any activities whatsoever.   
Something appears betwixt the body and Fullness, considering   
the body as its limit and acting with a sense of doership. This   
has many names like Chit-Jada granthi, subtle body, ego, samsara,   
bondage and mind. All these refer only to the mind, the subtle body. It is  
also called Jiva.   
The mind is that which immediately on rising as 'I' creates many   
appearances, ahandai (ego), says Bhagavan. The ahandai, lives   
relating the chit vastu to the body, and acquires the nature of 'I',   
called Jiva bodha. That which appears in a subtle form, within   
the gross body, with seeming existence, is the subtle body, or   
"nutpa mei" or sukshma sarira. The ego, imagining itself to be related to  
totally unrelated things, thereby getting attached to,   
and being whirled around in repeated cycles of births - is samsara. The  
"eternally free" Chit Vastu appearing to be bound by the body is bondage,  
bhandam.   
If "I" is neither the Atman nor the body, what then is "I"?   
Subsiding in sleep and rising as "I" on waking up, the Jiva bodha   
(the individual awareness), the dehatma bhava (I am the body   
notion) is that "I".   
Purely an imaginary being, this Jiva is born out of the superimposition of the  
consciousness of Atman onto the body   
and the blemishes of the body onto the Self. Thus, the ego   
partakes of the character of both the body and the Self. It is both extensive  
and limited. It is an intangible link between body and   
pure Consciousness. The Self is pure and not aware of any   
'other' to say "I".   
This knot chit-jada granthi, is unreal. The Jiva is unreal. Equally unreal  
are the creations of the Jiva or ego, like ignorance bondage etc., Other than  
this Jiva, there is no individual. Individuality is the bondage, which when  
removed, the non dual Atman alone remains. It is the subtle body that is  
distinctive of each individual, persisting till the gain of Jnana. Ego, or  
mind, is the main factor of the subtle body, which moves from one body to  
another, thus inextricably caught up in the wheel of transmigration, called  
samsara.   
Cutting off the knot is too difficult to be accomplished by one's own effort.  
Guru's grace alone can accomplish it. Wisdom lies in the   
sole reliance on the saving grace of the guru. Bhagavan Ramana   
completes the ULLadu Narpadu, with the words, ahandhai uru   
azhithale mukti... The destruction of the ego is liberation. All our efforts  
are only towards this, for which Guru's grace is essential.   
All our devotion, along with simultaneous self enquiry is only to   
obtain the guru's grace in large measure, by making us fitting   
receivers for the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ULLadu Narpadu - 143  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 30, 2010, 11:12:02 AM

In Verse 23, Bhagavan Ramana described the body, which says   
"I" in the waking state but in deep sleep, it does not say "I".   
So the body which is insentient is not the true "I". In Verse 24, Bhagavan  
Ramana describes the knot that binds the body and   
the Truth. It is known in various names - ego, knot, bondage,   
subtle body, mind, realm of becoming and the individual.   
Verse 24:- Bhagavan Ramana's Tamil Version: Jada udal naan ennadu satchit udiyaadhu   
Udal aLave naanondru udikkum - idaiyil idu   
Chit jadak granti bandam jiva nutpa mei ahandhai   
Icchamusara manm eN.   
Verse 24:- Ganapti Muni's Sanskrit Version: Deho na jaanaati sato na janma   
Deha-pramaano'nya udeti madhye   
Ahamkrti-granthi-vibandha-sukshma-   
Sarira-cheto bhava-jiva naama   
Verse 24:- Sri Lakshmana Sarma's Sanskrit Version: Bruyannaahamiti svayam jadavapuh satyaa chitrinodiyaat   
Tanmadhye tu vapuhpranamaanahamityaavirbhavet kinchana   
Etaddhyeva bhavenmano jadachitorgranthirbhavto' hankritih   
Bandhah sukshmasarirametaduditam jivasya tattvam svyam   
Comments: The body does not know itself or anything else. It is inert.   
Being inert, it undergoes change, birth, decay and death. The   
ego however, has sentiency, therefore it is not the body. The truth or  
existence is birthless (Verse 1), therefore deathless. The ego however, has  
birth and death, therefore it is not the Turth.   
Being different from the body and the Truth, it still has characteristics of  
both. It cannot be found either in the body or the Truth, i.e. they are both  
free from ego. At the same time, the ego can never be found outside the body.  
In no object or being outside the body, do we have the "I" notion. Now  
strangely we realize that the ego is neither in the body nor outside the body?  
Where does one catch this undeniably existing entity?   
This ego arises as though in between the sentient Truth and the inert body.  
Since it has no independent existence, it takes the support of both. For  
example, the sun and the water, there would be no reflection. The reflection  
takes its illumination from the sun and its unsteadiness from the water. If I  
wanted to experience the reflection alone, nothing would come to mind.   
This ego parades under various names. Every particular name that we have is  
his name alone. For example, I am Subramanian, I am fat, I am an engineer,  
etc., Here are a few common names that we as egos share.   
a. Ahankara. The notion of doership in every action.   
b. Granthi. Knot. As thought, it ties the inert body and the sentient Self  
together. It thus sustains the chain of ignorance, desire and action, which  
are called the knots of the heart.   
c. Vibandha - well bound/bondage. It binds us to the body and its  
limitations and to the objects of the world through then notion of 'my-ness'.  
It alone is the cause of the bondage of birth and death.   
d. Sukshma sarira - Subtle body. It is not perceived by the senses like the  
gross body, therefore subtle. It is perishable like sarira.   
e. Chtah - mind. bodha lakshana. It has the capacity to reflect the  
consciousness and know. It is as though closer to consciousness   
(Chit) than the body.   
f. Bhavah - realm of becoming. Its existence depends on becoming something.  
So all the time, it prompts man into action to become. I want to become a  
doctor. I want to become good etc.,   
g. Jiva - individuality. It enlivens the body and the mind. It always   
maintains its identity or personality as "I".   
Arunachala Siva.

Does the ego create God also. Because in deep sleep there is no idea about  
God, Guru, temples or scriptures etc.etc. Is it right? As soon as I wake up  
someday it is blank for few seconds. Then slowly the mind or ego starts  
functioning. Due to the age the deep sleep also vanishes some days.

That force or energy by which you are able to cognize that there is no idea  
about God, Guru, temples or scriptures etc,.. in sleep that effelgence by  
which you are able to cognize that when you wake up someday, you are blank for  
few seconds... and to whom the movement of mind or ego starts functioning,  
etc.. etc... That is the Self which is In All. And THAT by which you are now  
witnessing even this. That Effulgence is the Truth. Even to say that That  
effulgence is you would not be apt because, it is again happening in presence  
of effulgence itself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I? in answer to a question   
of M. Sivaprakasam Pillai says: What is Real is only Atma Swarupam   
only. The world, the Jivas and the Gods are only imaginations.   
So all the gods, we describe as Siva, Vishnu and Brahma and others   
are all mental imaginations. The Effulgence or the Swarupam is the   
only Real. But we have to go from duality to non dualtiy and so   
the scriptures have described so many gods. Muruganar says that   
Sivam - not Siva is the Self, the Awareness. But in actual practice,   
we are praying to all sorts of gods. All are mental imaginations   
or ego's sprouts only. Bhagavan Ramana said this when He was   
just 21. He must be a great revolutionary in that sense.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes. He only inspired to start this forum for the seekers like me. Slowly my  
mind gets quiented after reading Bhagavan's teachings. I came from a very  
traditional family where I cannot practice anything as my elders were   
practicing. Day and I night I used to think what it happen to me for not  
practicing rituals. After coming to this   
forum and reading senior members like Mr. Raju, Mr. Udai and Subramaniyan's  
post I could understand little bit.   
Now a days I feel little happy. Long time ago I read Udai ji's post where he  
told nothing can touch us because we are self which is ever shining.All the  
traditional practices only helping to clean up our mind but it never can show  
the self. Still I got lots of soldiers who are coming out daily. Once again I  
thank all the members who are giving guidence through their posts.

My dear matthias,   
Thank you. The Forum is really warming up, thanks to many   
new participants.   
My dear Ramanaduli,   
Keep on pursuing the Self within. Perseverance is the keyword.   
Let a million thoughts come. They will all be killed once you   
kill them one by one. Bhagavan Ramana's grace is always there.   
Place faith in Him.   
Arunachala Siva.
