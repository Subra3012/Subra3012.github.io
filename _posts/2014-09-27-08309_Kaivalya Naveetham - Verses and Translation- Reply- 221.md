Verse 113 of Kaivalya Navaneetham: Even after the devil is exorcised, just as the person who was possessed is  
further protected by a talisman against   
any return of the trouble, so also though my ignorance has already been  
dispelled by your teaching, yet, sir, I seek   
more from you that I may be firmly fixed in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
