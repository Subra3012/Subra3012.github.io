In the understanding and perception of false as false there is revelation of  
Truth.   
All thoughts are welcome.

I request readers to access the above link to read all the 50 divine  
thoughts.i will paste here few important ones.   
The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable faith  
in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows. Bhakti  
alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are the  
agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all  
places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our  
gratitude to God.   
In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need must be with  
reference to another **.Let action be out of love. Passions such as desire and  
hatred, anger and malice must be totally eschewed.** If love becomes the  
grounding principle of all deeds. then most of the ills of the world will  
vanish.   
What is the purpose of human birth? To earn, to eat, to undergo misery  
everyday and finally to die? Instead of earning and suffering, can we not die  
now? The purpose of birth is to avoid re-birth. Except man, all animals grow  
horizontally. Only man grows vertically. Instead of growing horizontally, it  
is God's will that he should grow vertically in order to look up. God has  
given to animals devices for self-protection; to man alone He has given  
intelligence. **By doing nothing, we avoid re-birth; By giving up attachment,  
we avoid sins.**   
When any object is consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black residue  
is burnt again, it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain white even  
when burnt again. This shows that white is the ultimate and black is proximate  
to it. Science tells us that diamond and coal are basically one. White and  
black are not colours. The primary colours get separated from the objects to  
which they are attached when subjected to the test of fire and ultimately  
white.Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the Ultimate Reality is  
Siva, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who is dark. When we test  
everything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge, the residue is Siva. Ash  
in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the spiritual plane. **We smear  
our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves of Siva and the fact that  
the ultimate goal of life is Siva.**   
Right education should make us know that God is the Truth. Knowledge must fill  
one with good qualities, through which one can realise the Truth, that is God.  
Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the understanding of the Ultimate Truth.  
The first fruit of education must be humility and self control.   
 **Why so many Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak  
of one God only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to  
satisfy hunger, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger. Then  
why can 't we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side dishes?  
So, if we eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food tasty to  
the palate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a particular God  
he worships that.   
By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty. What is essential for life and  
honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is for  
this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should not  
increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their  
prosperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we  
increase our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it  
will only produce poverty and sorrow.**   
Vedanta which is the peak of the Vedas teaches the way for the removal of  
sorrow. Hatred and desire arise only in respect of the objects other than us.  
That desire will not arise if those objects are rendered identical with us, if  
there is nothing other than us, then desire will not arise. **If there is no  
desire, there will be no effort and no sin. When there is no sin, there will  
be no body and there will be no misery.**   
 **Our religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -  
purification. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and conflict.  
The reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of Hinduism, in  
spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure of money, etc.,  
is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are impressed. We  
develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion. There is a text in  
the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees automatically. If we  
examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect, the world will follow  
him.**   
 **It is clear to us that there is birth and there is death.Passion is the  
cause of birth. Time is the cause of death. What is created by passion is  
destroyed by time.** If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the  
tree dies. Kaalo Jagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate when  
time comes. If there is no passion, there is no production. If there is no  
time then there is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and  
Kaama. Iswara burnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is  
neither birth nor death for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father  
and Mother.   
**Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as iron filings  
are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;  
the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.**   
A mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and  
eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child.  
Similarly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire picture of  
life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the past  
and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper  
perspective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper  
setting.   
Whenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must remember the divine  
source from which he derived the qualifications to receive that honour, and  
feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - importance.   
 **Cultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;   
Look at others as yourself;   
Give up war; give up jealousy;   
Don't commit aggression without reason;   
Mother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;   
The Lord God is like father showering mercy   
People of the World !   
Live with discipline;   
Live with charity;   
Live with mercy;   
May all people attain greater well - being**

## Re:[1] Professional singing!

Dear SLakshmi,   
Many singers and great poets have become dumbfounded in the   
presence of Bhagavan Ramana. Not because they are afraid.   
They only become choked with emotions. They could not sing   
or read their poems. It is like lighting a candle before the Sun.   
However, Bhagavan Ramana encouraged them all. He told   
Sampurnamma: Even if you do not understand head or tail, it   
does not matter, please read Ribhu Gita. Muruganar, the great   
poet (he was a Tamil teacher) came with a poem before Bhagavan   
Ramana when he came for the first time. It was Desika Padigam   
in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. Muruganar could not read even   
one line properly. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye, please give that   
paper to me." And then He read the poem written on Himself by   
Muruganar.   
Many great Tamil pandits cannot read the first Benedictory Verse   
of ULLadu Narpadu in one stretch without getting stuck. The words   
are closely packed and reading is very difficult. Understanding it   
is much more difficult.   
There is also one story about Professional Wailers. About this   
later....   
Arunachala Siva.
