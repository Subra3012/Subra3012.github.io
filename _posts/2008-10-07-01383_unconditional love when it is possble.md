## unconditional love when it is possble

Dear sir   
All the realised souls talk about the unconditional love. Is it possible to  
have unconditional love for unrealised soul?   
I feel, unless you become brahman this is not possible. The saints who became  
brahman they showed that type of love and saved all the being.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Kindly see for yourself whether putting conditions are possible in the state of love.

Dear Ramanaduli, Unconditional love is possible with constant   
practice, to abhor hate which is an antithesis for love. Do not   
expect anything in exchange and love others and that is unconditonal   
love. Bhagavan says: "One who gives others, is giving it for himself.   
If one understands this, how can anyone be without giving!" (Who   
am I?) If you love others, you are loving yourself. If you hate   
others, you are hating yourself. If you give more than the usual   
fare to the autorickshaw fellow, even if he does not thank you,   
and you do not expect it and you get immense happiness. If you   
argue with him on the fare, and even if he does not get angry,   
illfeelings come to your mind. Try this. Again Manikkavachagar!   
He is not leaving me today. He says in Kuzhaittha Pathu, Decad   
on my melting!   
You know all that I want from you,   
You will give me all that I want,   
You are unreachable for Brahma and Vishnu, (who want you in   
 exchange for their love to you)   
You wanted me and took me as your servant,   
You gave me your Grace, without my wanting anything in exhange for   
 you,   
And if I do not want even that,   
And you give me something else, even that is your Grace!   
Arunachala Siva.

I am not at that stage where I can give unconditional love to all. But I can  
give unconditional feelings of neutrality, this is a step away from the  
negative, and is useful for changing feelings towards those who may inspire  
negative feelings towards them.

Dear Paintbrush,   
Welcome to the Forum. I think, I am not sure, unconditional feelings of  
neutrality are possible for happenings far away from us. For example, in a  
tennis match, whether Nadal wins or Federar wins,   
it may not concern us, and on such occasions, neutrality is possible.   
When things happen very near, then feelings have to be expressed.   
It is like a road accident just before your eyes or somewhere in another  
country. Today I have written about one European devotee, who visited  
Arunachala. Kindly read that and react further.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Paintbrush,   
I have written about that European devotee, a few days before,   
under MIRACLES DO HAPPEN. Please go through.

Thankyou Subramanian.R,   
Having read this post re: European devotee, I am pleased that they had such  
swift instruction while encountering the afflicted woman. I am not sure how  
this directly relates to my post re: neutrality - would you wish for me to  
foster the same initial attitude as the devotee if I was confronted with the  
same situation? Does my post infer that I would react with disgust if I had  
encountered this ill woman and is this why you have directed me??   
So I ponder further the meaning of your post in relation to my thoughts on  
neutrality - let me recount a personal story.   
I once worked for a manager who was ruthless in business and saw people only  
as tools to be commanded or stamped on in their ambition. I found this  
unethical and raised my concerns when I was asked to perform a task that I did  
not believe was right or moral. After this, our relationship swiftly  
deteriorated and I was treated very badly. I subsequently left the company,  
with relief but was very angry and bitter at the treatment I had recieved. My  
feelings towards my ex boss were very negative - but I did not want to carry  
such feelings towards another person and a wise elder I knew gave me the  
advice - "if you can't send love - send neutrality". I ask you - in what  
spirit towards my ex boss did I seek advice in how I felt towards them? Surely  
it is out of concern for them and myself that I wish to rid myself of these  
negative feelings towards them. It was in this spirit of love that I send them  
neutrality. It worked, for now I can send them love,

Dear Paintbrush,   
What I am trying to convey is: (1) Neutrality is possible only when   
things happen far away or for others. In the example cited above,   
if someone else had suffered under the same boss, you might have   
been neutral to the incident; or at best, you might have sympathized   
within you or you might have taken sides with him, outside the office,   
in a restaurant. (2) Feelings either good or bad, are possible when things  
happen near you within your eyesight or to you. In the same   
case you did not care to lick the boss's boots but you got yourself   
discharged from the office. (3) Bhagavan Ramana says: You show   
love to the people who are suffering before you. Do not run away.   
When accident happens on the road, many people go away because they are afraid  
of police stations, standing as witness to the accident   
in the courts. Only a few go and help the victim. Here in this Hill   
case, the European showed disgust and revulsion. Since he was perhaps fit for  
Bhagavan Ramana's intervention, the lady appeared   
as a Sadhu and made him to salute her and give plantains too.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: Love, hate - both should be   
hated. We all know that 'hate' should be hated. But how 'love' should be  
hated. The idea is: Just be a Witness, without any doership, help the people  
without a trace of ego in you, without the sense of doership. This might be  
difficult to understand and will be more difficult to practise. But this is  
Ramana Way.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in the same Who am I?, next sentence: "Whatever one gives to another, he is giving it to himself". What is this? If  
my autorickshaw fellow demands Rs 2 more and if I give it   
without any ego, then I am giving a lot of mental peace to myself.   
If I fight with him for that Rs 2, he goes away with grumble and bad   
words. And you sufffer a sense of unhappiness. After all, I am drawing a  
salary of Rs 30,000 per month, why should I have fought for this Rs 2.00?  
Muriel James says: It is Gestalt. Gestalt should be complete. An incomplete  
Gestalt, will make you suffer within. Gestalt is a German word, which means  
Completeness, the Poornam in   
Sanskrit which is nothing but the Self!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
I understand the wisdom - and yes, it is difficult to practice (though not  
always) - but it is indeed the Ramana Way. Very similar to Buddhist  
understanding of attachment and non attachment. Thankyou for your  
clarification, I feel we sing from same hymn sheet. I am glad I am on this  
forum,   
Kindest Blessings
