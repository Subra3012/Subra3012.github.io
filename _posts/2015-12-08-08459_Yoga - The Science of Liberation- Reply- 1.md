The entire metaphysics of existence is explained in four chapters known as,  
i) Samadhi Pada,   
ii) Sadhana Pada, iii) Vibhuti Pada and iv) Kaivalya Pada.   
The Samadhi Pada extensively dilates on the gnostic knowledge which enables  
one to sunder the   
spirit from matter.   
The Sadhana Pada talks about the practical implications.   
The very first sutra of Patanjali in Samadhi Pada defines Yoga as pure  
attention or awareness   
inhibiting the fluctuations of the mind, which are five fold. When the  
fluctuations come to a stop,   
the Seer, that is Purusha, abides in himself, taking the form of these  
fluctuations otherwise, which   
are either hindered or unhindered, being grouped under the following: right  
knowledge, wrong   
knowledge, predicate relations, sleep and finally memory.   
The right knowledge constitutes perception, inference and verbal  
communication. Wrong knowledge   
is an erroneous idea about some thing. The predicate relation, which can be  
equated with fancy or   
being in brown study, is devoid of any objective content. Sleep is that state  
of inner being totally   
bereft of any mental content, the bare light of Purusha illumining the  
undifferentiated matter, known   
as Avidya, the metaphysical ignorance of the nature of the Self. Memory is  
that faculty of the thought   
process having the capacity to recollect the past, either a reality or a  
delusion. According to Vyasa   
and Vachaspati Misra, the commentators of the Yoga Sutra, the reason for  
memory being placed   
as the last mental state is that it is the resultant of the earlier mental  
states, being generated from them.
