I opened this topic on request of Sri Krishna(ksksat27).   
Dear Sri Krishna,   
I am not sure i understood anything,but anyway,i will write what i think i  
understood.   
What Maharaj teaches is pretty much the same thing all Great Sages teach,and  
our Bhagavan too.   
How i see it,ultimatievly,there is no teaching,there is only wisdom and  
life,alive wisdom,so to say. There is not any goal to reach,no realisation in  
a way i imagined it to be,some sort of some special illumination or  
explosion,where i will be all powerful and wise. Only droping of this  
prison,this weight in a way of I. Now,i see that there is only Life and  
Wisdom,Wisdom which comes when we drop the mind. And this life goes by  
itself,leading,unfolding itself in a most beautiful way,when we are  
surrendered to it. There is no single universal teaching,one which all can  
embrace,only wisdom for each of us,valid in some particular moment and  
situation. Something utterly alive,,and Eternal.   
It is only important to watch this mind,its behaviour,how operates,how it is  
capable to catch hold of us. I noticed it needs food,just one touch,one little  
grip,and than it grows,it grab us deeper and deeper when our guard is down.  
And it feeds on everything,litteraly. All these things which we took like  
"I",this person. Most important thing is too be just indifirent watcher,to  
watch our behaviour,impulses,thoughts,and to see how they operate,how they  
lead us to completely wrong conclusions,and beliefs,how all unfolds when  
brought in touch with awareness. How it is not what we are. Not to condemn,not  
to praise,just to watch itvpatiently,and only than we will see it in right  
light,what it truly is.   
Like Maharaj loved to say,to drop all concepts. Whenever i come to some  
conclusion,after some time this gets destroyed too,and i am left empty handed.  
I was sooo irritated so many times coz of it. Thinking and imagining that  
something is like this,like :' Ooooo,this is how it is!' Than i see,or read  
something different,where some more explanation is given,and i think in line  
like:"What is the Truth for Gods sake!!! Would i ever understand it?! Can  
someone just tell me raw Truth,without tricks,symbols,alegories...!" And than  
i saw that is actually the point. To destry all concepts,all imaginations,all  
pictures we had in mind. To drop the mind itself. What is left than,is only to  
follow Life,to discriminate always,to recognise mind always when it is doing  
its usual things,in a very usual pattern.   
The metod itself i understood to be all this and traying to catch and hold  
this very I,in a way of selfenquiry. And ultimatievly,to drop doership. I see  
it like only thing which constitute this person. Whithout it,there is only  
That,our very Self,God Almighty,and all is well. Ultimatievly,this little self  
is only Him too,and there is nothing appart from it. How,why,what,when,all  
this must be droped too.   
I do not know,what ever i say there is a new thought and seeing which anulate  
it. So,no conclusion. Just adopting the metod we like the most,with love  
toward our Guru or God,with endurance,preservance,patience and determination.  
And above all Faith. But Faith is all this anyway.   
There is one important thing i forgot to say,how much i love Maharaj's way of  
teaching,and teaching itself. When i read about His way of life,His words,that  
is all in union. It does not betray one anither. And i believe that was His  
message too,like He said it. To live this wisdom.   
And that is indeed hardest for me. [edited later].   
This is how i see all Maharaj's words. For now. :-)   
What are Your thoughts?   
With love and prayers,

Jewell, wonderful. For me, the below conversation is so enlightening.  
Please read and ponder over.   
Especiall the bold statements. It looks like this very moment, my existence  
(however pathetic existence it may be) that Knowledg that I exist itself is a  
great maya gift and great energy. That I am sure I am existing is the  
greatest gift of the Consciousness. I leave it to the original words and  
reproducing that small dialogue. One can ponder over th ebelow bold statement  
for a life time I think.   
 **Now you know that you are. Prior to this moment, did you have this  
knowledge that you exist? This consciousness, beingness, which you are  
experiencing now, was it there earlier?**   
V: It has been, on and off.   
 **Maharaj: This confidence that you are, the knowledge of your existence, was  
it there earlier?**   
Visitor: When I do what Maharaj tells me, it is very clear. It is still in an  
infantile stage, but my sense of "me" is completely undone, and there arises  
great happiness, peace and clarity; but it comes and goes, and I forget.   
M: Its inherent nature is time-bound. It has appeared as childhood and it is  
there now; but it wasn't there some years back. So you cannot possibly say  
that it is the Eternal. So don't believe that it is true.1 And so long as you  
are having this "I"-consciousness, you will be trying to acquire things; so  
long as you know that you are, the things that you possess have an emotional  
significance to you. Now there is the fact that your "I"-consciousness itself  
is time-bound. So when this dissolves, what is the value of all those things  
which you possessed?   
V: Nil.   
M: As long as you have not understood this child-consciousness, you'll get  
involved in the world and its activities. Therefore, the real liberation is  
only when you understand that child-consciousness. Do you agree?   
V: I do agree.

Dear Sri Krishna,   
This is indeed essence of Maharaj's teachings,and the words He stressed over  
and over again. To hold that only thing which is sure in this moment,our very  
existence,and than taking us beyond even this.   
I always loved that term 'child consciousness'. It describes beautifuly the  
way selfenquiry should be done,so to say. I understood it like,just being  
awake,holding this wakefulness itself,like in some sort of pure wonder. Or it  
is not even wonder,but just being conscious. In a way that should be without  
thoughts or whatsoever,but just pure holding of that ecistence,consciousness  
that i am,i exist. Just that first touch of it.   
And i adore His questions :"What you were 8 days prior to conception,or  
birth?." Consciousness there,you exist,you know,consciousness not there,there  
is not existence too. This is off course what we experience,and this is not  
true existence. Some sort of limited perception only,confined on some sort of  
body,any tipe of body. And that we are not. Coz there is no we,me,them,which  
is just empty imagination. Where our True Self is beyond all this,All  
embracing,body consciousness and uncounsciousness,Pure Awareness burning  
brightly behind all these wails,and making them burn too.   
But,i must say,i can hear this a thousand times,but only when i see it for  
myself,i can understand it,or go beyond understanding. Somehow,when these  
words and our experience match,that we see it directly,step by step,only then  
it is a true course. When every single thing is experienced directly,from  
smallest to bigest. But that was the point from the very begining.   
Beautiful words indeed. "Wake up!"\ I always imagine Him saying this in His  
powerful and known way.   
With love and prayers,

Dear Jewell   
Thanks for your reply.   
There are few observations and questions: you said below:  _" To hold that only thing which is sure in this moment,our very  
existence,and than taking us beyond even this. "_   
Now I think going beyond the I am feeling is something we cannot do now or we  
cannot comprehend it now. The only thing that is feasible now is to stabilize  
ourselves in teh innermost feeling I am.   
When I deeply think this is what Maharaj says, let us assume one sunny day  
you travel in a crowded rural bus truck in a remote village surrounded by  
fully crowded men. Or a boring day in a hot desert all alone. Or whatever is  
terribly uncomfortable depending on one's culture or whatsover. Now the vital  
clue Maharaj states is that, "you have a sense of existence, in that  
sweating crowded irritable atmosphere. It it is a greatest gift, that you are  
conscious, you are aware that you exist, strange enough it is awarded to you  
unasked for, there is a sense of dwelling with self conscious state. It is  
only body consciousness, there is no strange experience, still you feel the  
sweat, you feel your limbs, you feel the pain but still you are" Maharaj wants  
to mediate on this existence, the feeling that you exist, something that has  
come unasked for.   
In this regard he wants us to ask question such as "how did i feel 8 days  
before conception". It was actually a nirvana state where there was no time  
and space. It was the same state that was present 200 years before my  
conception. So suddenly, all of a sudden, from non existence,I started to  
feel that I exist and this is the vital clue, this is that child  
consciousness.   
It is very interesting if you re-call your childhood events and associate with  
this teaching, one can literally feel that these events are going picture  
after picture.

Dear Sri Krishna,   
I am very sorry for late reply.   
Quote

> to stabilize ourselves in teh innermost feeling I am.  
This is absolutely true. It is pure speculation. Even if it seems that this  
feeling too becomes an object of perception or witnessing. Same is with what  
You have said about nirvana.   
When i think about it,almost all is a borowed knowledge. I was thinking how  
there could be no actual trancedence,or going beyond,coz the one who wants to  
go cannot,it is ego notion only,and the One who is our True Nature,is already  
there. But than i realised that is also what i heard from Maharaj and  
Bhagavan. And i feel,to realize,we need to empty ourselves of all this,and see  
it directly,in a way it is. When we feel it is an obstacle.   
Somehow,i noticed that this kind of analize of Reality only slows me down,that  
i cannot have assumptions and the Truth in the same time. Only pure  
selfenquiry helps,in a way of analise of my behaviour,and sure,being that very  
presence. I only find it hard not to analize it whille meditating. Very  
annoying habbit.   
And indeed,Maharaj is speaking about this very existence. We must exist in  
order to experience anything. What ever we do this Presence is there,in a  
crowded place,like You said,what ever we do. Whille  
eating,walking,talking,this presence is there,You are there.   
There is one Maharaj's saying over which i pondered very long. I cannot  
remember exact words,but it was something like this:"When the knowledge and  
feeling merge..." He was talking about realisation. I find this very  
intruiging.   
Anyway,i do not have a clue,i must see all this with my own eyes,so to say,and  
so far,only practice truly helps,or even an attempt even. It does not matter  
are we doing it right much,most important is that we are eager to do it,our  
sincere longing and thirst for Truth.   
That is what i realised recently. If we truly,Truly want it,it is  
there,without any question whatsoever. The thing is,when i see how much is  
burried under surfice of the mind,i do not have a clue what i want. I know  
only what i must,coz it seems that is only right thing to do. It is simply  
pulling us toward Itself. Our True Nature,our Father,our Mother,our  
Beloved,our God Almighty!   
With love and prayers,

I read your reply but want to read again. Thankyou, wonderful.   
Meanwhile what you are saying is this much is it: whatever we speak of within the I am consciosuness, even when it is about  
Nirvana or Absolute, it is still within I am. So only stabilize in the deeper  
most I am feeling -- am I right?

Dear Sri Krishna,   
Well,this is what Maharaj is saying,to catch hold of this I am,to Be. Just  
simply watching Yourself,being Yourself,turning all Your attention and  
perception on I am,that conscious presence. I was searching some words of Him  
which describe well what He said,and i found these interesting words.   
_ Do nothing, absolutely nothing! Just be, be the knowledge ?I am?  
only and abide there. To imbibe this meditate on beingness only. Catch hold of  
the knowledge ?I am? in meditation. In this process, the realization occurs  
that ?I? the Absolute am not the ?guna? ?I am?; therefore in meditation  
nothing is to be retained in memory. Nevertheless something will appear on the  
memory screen, but be unconcerned, just be, do nothing. Refrain from grasping  
anything in meditation; the moment you do, otherness begins, and so does  
duality. Nothing is to be done. Then all your riddles will be solved and  
dissolved. ?Moolmaya? ? that is, the primary illusion ? will release her  
stranglehold on you and will get lost. _**   
I also saw You are reading Sri Saddhu Om. His explanation of selfenquiry is  
excellent too!   
With love and prayers,

Namaste, everyone,   
I'd like to say what was my misunderstanding of Nisargadatta Maharaj's  
teachings.   
I used to think there were some objective 'Nisargadatta Maharaj's teachings'  
separate from myself which I should understand or experience as an individual.   
It is not like this at all. The real Knowledge comes from inside only as your  
own knowledge. No difference between Guru and yourself. Any logic is broken.  
It's mystical process which is possible to pass through but impossible to  
explain.
