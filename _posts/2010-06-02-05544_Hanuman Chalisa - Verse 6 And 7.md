## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 6 And 7  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 09:24:18 AM

**Verse 6**   
 _Kanchan varan viraj subesa   
Kanan Kundal Kunchit Kesa_   
 **Verse 7**   
 _Hath Vajra Aur Dhuvaje Viraje   
Kandhe moonj janehu sajai _   
**Verse 6 Meaning:**   
Your physique is beautiful golden coloured and your dress is pretty. You wear  
ear rings and have long curly hair.   
 **Verse 7 Meaning:**   
You carry in your hand a lightening bolt along with a victory (kesari) flag  
and wear the sacred thread on your shoulder.   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 7 it is mentioned that Lord Hanuman wears sacred thread.Sacred  
Threads are generally wore by brahmins.   
But guru ramana says many times who is a real brahmin.   
Bhagavan Ramana says,A brahmin is one who has realised Brahman.   
More Over In Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata it says,   
Acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not. Performing all rituals  
and sacrifices does not make a Brahmana. There is only one bondage, namely,  
that caused by desire. He who is free from this bondage is a Brahmana. He who  
restrains his senses, who is constantly in yogic samadhi is a Brahmana: he is  
distinguished above all others, and derives his joys from the Self alone.  
**(Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata)**   
Yet the Brahmins as a caste have done a lot of good to India and to the world  
by saving the Shastras from destruction, through staunch adherence to  
tradition.   
Swami Vivekananda says,   
 **It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work for the salvation of the  
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, and so long as he does that, he is  
a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he goes about making money.**   
He only is the Brahmin who has no secular employment. Secular employment is  
not for the Brahmin but for the other castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that  
they must work hard to raise the Indian people by teaching them what they  
know, by giving out the culture that they have accumulated for centuries.

There is a Tv. serial i.e. called where is brahmin. Very interesting. It is  
written by Cho. Ramaswami who himself is a brahmin. The title is ENGE  
BRAHMANAN. In the way it is good to know atleast to be called brahmin we  
should follow particular systems. But it is very difficult to live in these  
kali yuga as it is said in varnasrama. There are very few one or two villages  
where only brahmins are living and following daily Agni hotram. It is not  
enough to observe the rules of brahmin tradition but also very important to be  
brahman himself always. But most people live for money in this kali yuga as a  
brahmin.

Dear prasanth/Ramanaduli,   
Yes. No one can live as a true Brahmin as propounded by   
Vedas. The minimum things that one can do is to do Sandhya   
Vandhanam or at least Gayatri mantra, along with exhibiting   
other qualities of not being greedy, not needing too many fashionable   
clothes, jewels and also no harming any other living beings. Agnihotram and  
Oupasanam are more difficult to perform daily.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu and ramanaduli garu,   
What you say is correct.   
These days it is becoming hard to find true brahmins.   
i know few brahmins   
a) who drink alcohol and smoke cigarates.   
b) who eat non-vegetarian happily with no concern.   
c) who cheated few girls in name of love/marriage and happily married another  
girl   
d) who are atheists   
e) fake sanyasis   
f) few temple priests who demand money by asking you to tell your gotram etc (  
This is not really their fault as their salaries are very less and so they  
came down to this level)   
g) in tirupati one priest stole one goddess gold idol and with help of that he  
has done his daughter marriage. ( This is not really their fault completely as  
their salaries are very less and so they came down to this level)   
h) there are many brahmin hero/heroines who do all kind of stupid things in  
movies and earn illegal money.   
list will be endless sir...   
What to do ??

There is a Tv. serial i.e. called where is brahmin. Very interesting. It is  
written by Cho. Ramaswami who himself is a brahmin. The title is ENGE  
BRAHMANAN. In the way it is good to know atleast to be called brahmin we  
should follow particular systems. But it is very difficult to live in these  
kali yuga as it is said in varnasrama. There are very few one or two villages  
where only brahmins are living and following daily Agni hotram. It is not  
enough to observe the rules of brahmin tradition but also very important to be  
brahman himself always. But most people live for money in this kali yuga as a  
brahmin.

Dear prasanth/Ramanaduli,   
Yes. No one can live as a true Brahmin as propounded by   
Vedas. The minimum things that one can do is to do Sandhya   
Vandhanam or at least Gayatri mantra, along with exhibiting   
other qualities of not being greedy, not needing too many fashionable   
clothes, jewels and also no harming any other living beings. Agnihotram and  
Oupasanam are more difficult to perform daily.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu and ramanaduli garu,   
What you say is correct.   
These days it is becoming hard to find true brahmins.   
i know few brahmins   
a) who drink alcohol and smoke cigarates.   
b) who eat non-vegetarian happily with no concern.   
c) who cheated few girls in name of love/marriage and happily married another  
girl   
d) who are atheists   
e) fake sanyasis   
f) few temple priests who demand money by asking you to tell your gotram etc (  
This is not really their fault as their salaries are very less and so they  
came down to this level)   
g) in tirupati one priest stole one goddess gold idol and with help of that he  
has done his daughter marriage. ( This is not really their fault completely as  
their salaries are very less and so they came down to this level)   
h) there are many brahmin hero/heroines who do all kind of stupid things in  
movies and earn illegal money.   
list will be endless sir...   
What to do ??

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Chinmayananda

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinmayananda   
http://www.chinmayamission.com/   
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2059111871.cms   
H.H. Swami Chinmayananda (8 May 1916  3 August 1993), **born Balakrishna  
Menon (Balan) was an Indian spiritual leader, and teacher, who inspired the  
formation of Chinmaya Mission in 1953 to spread the message of Vedanta.**   
 **Chinmaya Mission has over 300 centers in India and the world over.**   
He was a disciple of Swami Sivananda at Rishikesh, who founded the Divine Life  
Society.   
Balakrishna Menon (Balan) was born in Ernakulam, **Kerala** in a devout Hindu  
noble family called "Poothampalli" of Makia Awwa and Kuttan Menon. Upon his  
birth, his father called for an astrologer, who stated that Balan's birth was  
an auspicious one, and that he was destined to be a king. He graduated from  
Madras University in 1939 and went on to do graduate study in English  
literature from Lucknow University.   
Swami Chinmayananda started the tradition of Gyana Yagnas, in an effort to  
spread the message of the Geeta and the Upanishads, thus the first such Geeta  
Gyan Yagna was held in Pune between December 31, 1951 and April 1952   
He founded the Chinmaya Mission in 1953 and later played an important role in  
the formation of Vishva Hindu Parishad in 1964. He became the first president  
of Vishva Hindu Parishad and served VHP in the role of a spiritual advisor  
thereafter. During his forty years of travelling and teaching, Swami  
Chinmayananda opened numerous centres and ashrams worldwide, he also built  
many schools, hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. His interest in helping  
the villagers with basic necessities lead to the eventual creation of a rural  
development project, known as the Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development  
or CORD. Its National Director, Dr. Kshama Metre was recently awarded the  
Padma Shree National award in Social Work.   
Swami Chinmayananda died on 3 August 1993 in San Diego, California, and his  
mortal remains were placed in a Samadhi on 19th August, 1993, at the Sidhbari  
Ashram in the Himalayas.

## Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 6 And 7  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 02, 2010, 12:54:18 PM  
---  
**Verse 6**   
 _Kanchan varan viraj subesa   
Kanan Kundal Kunchit Kesa_   
 **Verse 7**   
 _Hath Vajra Aur Dhuvaje Viraje   
Kandhe moonj janehu sajai _   
**Verse 6 Meaning:**   
Your physique is beautiful golden coloured and your dress is pretty. You wear  
ear rings and have long curly hair.   
 **Verse 7 Meaning:**   
You carry in your hand a lightening bolt along with a victory (kesari) flag  
and wear the sacred thread on your shoulder.   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 7 it is mentioned that Lord Hanuman wears sacred thread.Sacred  
Threads are generally wore by brahmins.   
But guru ramana says many times who is a real brahmin.   
Bhagavan Ramana says,A brahmin is one who has realised Brahman.   
More Over In Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata it says,   
âActs alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not. Performing all  
rituals and sacrifices does not make a Brahmana. There is only one bondage,  
namely, that caused by desire. He who is free from this bondage is a Brahmana.  
He who restrains his senses, who is constantly in yogic samadhi is a Brahmana: he is distinguished above all others, and derives his joys from the Self  
alone.â **(Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata)**   
Yet the Brahmins as a caste have done a lot of good to India and to the world  
by saving the Shastras from destruction, through staunch adherence to  
tradition.   
Swami Vivekananda says,   
 **It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work for the salvation of the  
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, and so long as he does that, he is  
a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he goes about making money.**   
He only is the Brahmin who has no secular employment. Secular employment is  
not for the Brahmin but for the other castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that  
they must work hard to raise the Indian people by teaching them what they  
know, by giving out the culture that they have accumulated for centuries.
