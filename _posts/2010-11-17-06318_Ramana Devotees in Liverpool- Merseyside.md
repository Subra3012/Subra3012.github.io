I post this more in hope than anything else! Liverpool seems to be stuck in a  
negative cloud when the subject matter of spirituality arises! However, I may  
be surprised and so if you do live in or near to me do please get in touch - I  
don't bite! Plus I make great herbal teas!!! Enjoy laughter and meeting like  
minded folk. So Lenny is waiting..............first meeting to take place in a  
coffee bar/cafe.........:-)   
revzen aka Lenny aka Gaz   
PS Lenny is my stage name, and online people know me as Lenny   
confused!   
I am!!!

I do not know how far is London from Liverpool. There is a Ramana   
Center in London, I am told.   
Arunachala Siva.
