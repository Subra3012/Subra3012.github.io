Not everyone resonates with "Who am I?" Sri Ramana Maharshi said japa is also  
a valid means for ridding oneself of the imagined ego (p.306). In fact,  
Maharshi stated supreme devotion and jnana are identical in revealing swarupa  
(p.313).   
 _ Questioner: Is not nama-japa helpful to attain jnana?   
_   
 _ Bhagavan: Yes (p.312)._   
Maharshi said, with unceasing japa: mind becomes one-pointed and strong (p.329), and all other thoughts are warded off (p.308).  
vasanas and mental impurities perish (p.329).  
the person who owns the name is reached (p.312).  
the ego will return to the Source (p.311).

Sri Lakshmana Swamy undertook japa of _**Hare Ramana**_ right up until the  
moment of Self-realisation.   
refer pages 14 and 16, _No Mind, I am the Self_,   
and also this video by Mr Godman, go to 7:40

Even if you do nothing more than **unceasingly think**   
of that first name 'I-I'   
with the attention focused on that **' I' sense**,   
that practice will take you **to the Source**.....   
(pg. 311, verse 716, _Guru Vachaka Kovai_, Godman's compilation)   
*in _Talks_, Sri Ramana Maharshi says you can use whichever name you prefer
