Dear ksksat27 sir   
I am a diabetic for the past 10 years due to heriditary. I am living in  
france, origin of Pondicherry.   
I am a vegetarian. I take morning 3 tablets Metformine 850 gms. Amarel 2mg.  
Onglyza. I walk 45 mins on sunday morning in a neary by park. Sometimes I  
take some 48 herbs of "Sakkari Kolli". My father got from local " Nattu  
Marundhu Kadai" at Pondicherry. My friends living here take insulin now. If  
you regulate your food we can bring control the sugar levels. Avoid rice and  
Maidha. Take 100 percent wheat and fibre foods. Morning Oats milk is good.  
Eat green vegetables. Sometimes I get hungry at about 11 o clock morning. Pl  
Buy a Appartment Cycle and do exercise or yoga. Add stevia sweetner 0  
colories sugar.

Dear Krishnan,   
I am a marginal diabetic, dependent on only Acarbose. No other tablet. Since  
father was also a medicine-dependent diabetic,   
he told me to stop sugar from the age of 40.   
1\. I have stopped sugar completely. No sugar for coffee or tea. No sweets. No  
ice creams etc..   
2\. Among fruits I take only oranges and koyya fruit, which helps with no  
sugar content.   
3\. I don't take payasam even in festival days.   
4\. I take wheat rice instead of paddy rice, for the past 5 years.   
5\. Take less of rice and more of vegetables.   
6\. Do not take high salted groundnuts or even channa nuts.   
7\. When hungry, take only two or three Brittania Marie biscuits or take oats  
gruel with buttermilk, with very little salt.   
8\. I walk for thirty minutes daily.   
9\. Go for sugar check up and BP check up (they are cousins) once in thee  
months. Increase or decrease medicines according   
to the reading, AFTER CONSULTING A DOCTOR.   
10\. AT NIGHTs if you are hungry, take again biscuits (Brittania Marie) and  
some water.   
Arunchala Siva.

**What is Anatomic Therapy ( The Art of Self Healing )?**   
Our body contains a gland that secretes a fluid inturn possesses the ability  
to cure all ailments within our body. On an average our gland continues to  
secrete this fluid for as long as 120 years of our lifespan.   
What is this Gland? Where this gland placed in our body? What this phenomenal  
fluid called? How we make our body to secrete this fluid with ease?  
Irrespective of your gender, religious beliefs, and social status Healer's  
Baskar will enlighten you how you can make 'your body work for yourself' to  
generate this fluid thus walking through a healthy living.   
This treatment as preached by 'Healer Baskar' does not require you undergo any  
medication, painful injections, processes nor any form of yoga, acupuncture or  
reiki. All you would learn at the end of this treatment is that following  
Baskar's guidance you can make this gland secrete this fluid the next 48hours  
which can help relieve from any form of physical ailment within 120 to 360  
days.   
This treatment of curing any of your physical illness diseases though own body  
defense mechanism is what 'Healer's Baskar' calls 'Anatomic Therapy' also  
known as 'Sevi Vazhi Thodu Sigichai' in its native origin of Tamil language.  
Entire treatment would take as less as 6hours and most pleasing is at the end  
of the treatment you are free for intake any form of your favorite food  
without any hesitation and infact neither would you be required to undertake  
any of second session of this treatment.   
The contamination of blood is the root cause for all diseases.  
By cleansing the impurities of blood all diseases will be cured.  
By regulating the food, drinking water, breathing air, sleep and work or physical activity the blood can be purified.  
By regulating the food 50% of the diseases can be cured.  
But, only by regulating the drinking water, sleep, physical activity, and breathing air, the permanent cure can be maintained.  
Learn how to regulate all these things through the DVD which is produced by Healer's Baskar.   
Please watch these worthy videos.

Okay, this post was made a year ago. I am a general nurse by my profession,  
and if you or any other have more medical problems, I am not a doctor and I  
can't diagnose or treat someone, but I can talk, and make some good advices  
concerning your or others medical problems. But finally you must go to the  
proper physician where you will undergo proper treatment. His words are final.   
Diabetes mellitus although (mostly) chronic disease that means it can't be  
cured totally (according to the view of western scholar medicine), it can be  
controlled, make your life less painful or similar. But man in problem must  
also cooperate, at first wish good to his own self, and accept the help and  
advices of the health professionals. Without proper control it can run out of  
the control and it can make more complications, more unnecessary problems,  
etc.

I have something very joyous to share with you all.   
After vigorous diet and jogging, my fasting sugar and post prandial were well  
below 100 mg/dl. HbA1c also found to be normal. Considering consistent good  
values well in normal, doctor has advised to stop the tablet and continue  
monitoring only with jogging and diet restrictions.   
This comes a major relief for me that I dont have to depend on tablets  
anymore.   
All this should be invested in sadhana to gain firm conviction that one is not  
the body during illness or cure of the illness.   
It is as if Bhagavan Ramana asking, 'you say it is now safe', which is safe?  
how long? against which it is safe? what is its nature? is it spirit that is  
safe now or is it matter that is safe now? or the intermediary that is safe  
now?

Thank you sir, I should thank you definitely   
We dont know our body instincts and we mis-judge when there is a problem or  
when there is not a problem. We need others and tests to tell us about our  
body.
