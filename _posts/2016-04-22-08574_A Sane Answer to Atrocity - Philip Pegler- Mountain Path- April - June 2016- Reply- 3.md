Difficult as it is to accept as a basis for a realistic world view,  
nevertheless the background peace in the unseen   
ever remains untouched by vicious hatred, cruelty or oppression. In the  
manifest world on the other hand,   
things are ever changing -- constantly in flux \- governed it seems by an  
increasingly dangerous volatility.   
Here, in the challenging foreground of daily life, where we all need to  
function, one crisis follows another.   
There is precious little time left to attend to the root of suffering, which  
is ignorance of the way things truly   
are in reality.   
Nobody - whosoever they may be and whatever their station in life -- is spared  
the fleeting pleasures   
and intermittent discomfort of physical embodiment. Modern living imposes a  
level of stress inconceivable   
to previous generations and our intransigent human nature does much to enhance  
our woes.   
Yet in just the same manner as night follows day, so alert intelligence flows  
naturally from healthy living.   
We should never forget how much has been achieved with skill and unselfish  
dedication in the field of human   
endeavor. Nevertheless we can hardly deny the fact that some aspects of  
normal, contemporary   
living -- currently regarded as acceptable and harmless enough -- are in fact  
totally unsustainable and even   
perverse because they are contrary to our best interests. Perhaps it is  
simply a denial of the straight facts   
of our human predicament through lack of clear seeing that is coming us most  
dear.
