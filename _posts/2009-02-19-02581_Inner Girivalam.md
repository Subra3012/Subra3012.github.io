## Inner Girivalam

Recently I heard from someone that there is an inner Girivalam route and  
people who are familiar with the inner route always do the pradakshinam in the  
inner hill. It is very calm and serene and much more graceful than to do it on  
the road because there are always some disturbances. Has anyone any  
information about where to start the inner Girivalam from ?

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
I have already written about this. There are three roads for giri-   
pradakshina. One is the inner-most road, which is extremely   
difficult to negotiate. The second, the middle one is also skirting   
the Hill, and is equally difficult to negotitate. It is in this road,   
that Bhagavan Ramana and His early devotees were doing pradakshina and you can  
see Skandasramam, Virupakshi Cave,   
Tortoise Rock, etc., The third, the outermost road, is the one   
presently used by most of the people. This is a tar road, and as   
you proceed, you may see vehicles, road junctions etc., and you   
finally complete the pradakshina by coming into the town and reaching the  
Asramam in Chengam Road. It is better to take this   
road always, even in nights.   
Arunachala Siva.

So can we do the Girivalam from Skandashram or Virupaksha Cave? I have in mind  
to do it from inside the next time I am able to visit Arunachala

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
You can take the inner middle road. Normally the practice is to start from  
the Asramam and come back to the Asramam which is the   
Source of all actions! You can cover Virupaksha Cave, Skandasramam, Parrot  
Cave and Mango Tree Cave, by taking diversions at some points. With  
tangential diversions, it may take   
about 6 to 7 hours, by slow walking. Gurumurtham, Pachai Amman Kovil,  
Palakottu are all in foothills.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 My relative Sri Narayana Raju used to do Girivalam mentally touching every spot on the Girivalam mentally.I feel it is as effective as physical one if we do it sincerely and is more relevent to old people who cannot   
walk 14 kms round the hill physically.But only highly devoted persons can do  
this.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU,   
Its relevant only for old people, but also for young people. ultimately what  
does one strive doing Girivalam for? pure concentration, stopping the mind  
wavering. This seems to be a wonderful new way of meditating.

Dear Dr. I am happy to see your post in the Forum, after quite   
sometime. As you and Ganesh_b01 have said, mental giripradakshina is equally  
good for anyone, particularly for old   
people who cannot walk 14 kms. Bhagavan Ramana used to quote   
Ribhu Gita where it is said: "I am Brahman and all the universes   
are revolving around me!" Once Bhagavan Ramana and Nayana went   
for giripradakshina. Suddenly Bhagavan Ramana told Nayana: "Nayana, I am seeing the sun and moon and all the worlds are   
revolving around my waist!" Nayana became speechless.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I also remembered the same story which you just posted here about Bhagwan and  
Nayana. I was just very happy to see it already posted.
