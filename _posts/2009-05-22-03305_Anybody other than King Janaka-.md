## Anybody other than King Janaka?  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: May 22, 2009, 03:37:50 PM

I wonder, if there is anybody other than King Janaka who realised without  
really going away from his home! all others have actually left their home! It  
actually is difficult to uphold to the Truth in midst of Samsara and family!  
Even Ramanar had left his home and stayed alone everafter! Who can we look for  
an example to lead a life of realised person at home in midst of day to day  
life here in thick of reality of our life! Even though all realised souls have  
said one need not take up sanyasa to realise truth! But who is there?  
Sometimes I feel, Sanyasa is essential to live in solitude to realise the  
truth, though I also know that Sanyasa is not really necessary as it is mind  
that need to renounce itself! But Mind has so much fuel here in the Samsara to  
feed upon!   
Here in thick of life, I have come to a point where certain usual things of  
mundane life don't interest me, but at the same time, if you are not doing  
that, you are forced to do that! one more example is earning money is  
mandatory! We just can't JUST BE ! sometimes I wonder Sanyasa is essential!

Mr.Nagaraj   
Many saints are there like, Thiyagaraja, in recent times. and lots of saints  
from maharashtra like gora kumb, shaku bai, Tukaram.Thruvalluvar was also   
realaised soul. He got married and he wrote many couplets about the marriage.  
I think their society was different. Our society is different now. We have to   
work and earn money to run our family. But there is hope as we follow  
Bhagavan's teaching, we will be Janaka one day.

Dear Nagaraj, ramanaduli,   
King Janaka is always the standard example to show how   
a person can attain Jnana and also RULE the kingdom. He   
was not merely a householder but a ruler who ruled a big   
country called Mithila. But if you take householders, there   
are many who attained Jnana despite being in a house,   
doing all the householder's duties. Some of the 63 Siva   
Saints were married and and were running a family, raised   
children but continued their intense devotion to Siva and   
attained Jnana. Thyagraja is another example. If you want   
a king as an example, we can say Koch Chengot Chozhan who   
finds a place under 63 Saints. He was also ruling Chozha kingdom, built 40  
large temples for Siva, went for wars etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs.   
I came to know that Krishnapremi wrote a book in which he covered all saints  
and yogis from India. But I have not seen the book.   
Even though the enlighten people lived in family and raised their children,  
but what about their children who were not enlightened.   
I think it is individual effort and their karma vasana which takes to this  
goal. Otherwise all enlightened people's children also would   
be enlightened. aware of their awarness.

Dear Nagaraj,   
What you are saying is correct.   
Sri Ramakrishna has suggested seekers to go to solitude now and then for  
spiritual practice:  _In the beginning a man should try to concentrate his mind in a lonely place;   
otherwise many things may distract him.   
If we put milk and water together, they are sure to get mixed;   
but if milk is changed into butter by churning,   
the transformed milk (i.e. butter) instead of mixing with water, will float  
upon it.   
So when a man has gained the power of mental concentration by constant  
practice,   
his mind will always rise above his environment and rest in God, wherever he  
may stay._   
This does not require leaving home permanently, but one should have sufficient  
space in life to go to solitude now and then;   
If this is not possible, a person can go to a nearby temple or Mutt for  
meditation;   
If even this is not possible, one should have a solitary corner within one's  
own house.   
The surest way of spiritual progress is if you can make provision to stay in  
Thiruvannamalai or in a similar holy place for a few weeks.   
Om Shanti. ..

we know those names are in printed book. on the other hand there may be many.  
I missed the golden chance of having darshan of Anandamayi ma in 1965.   
My friend asked me no. of times to go with her. After many years I read her  
book. now I feel very bad. My bad karma only did not allow me to do so. Yogi  
yogananda had come to have darshan of Bhagavan. but I am not sure whether  
Anandmayi ma came or not. She was always in bliss. She also got married   
but her husband became of her deciple.

Dear ramanaduli,   
Ma Ananda Mayi had visited Bhagavan Ramana. So also   
Papa Ramadas, Papaji. Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati,   
Jamnalal Bajaj, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the late President of   
India, Maharaja of Mysore, Maharaja of Cochin, Maharani   
and Princess of Dewas and a few others who were fortunate.   
Mahatma Gandhi could not see Bhagavan even though he   
had a desire and he missed, due to 'busy schedule' fixed   
by Rajaji. Rajaji also did not see Him, even though he came   
to Arunachaleswarar Temple, to inaugurate the renovated   
Patala Lingam temple, under the auspices of Mrs. Talyarkhan,   
in 1949.   
Many cannot see Him,   
Some could see Him,   
But only a few are called,   
And a fewer are chosen!   
Arunachala Siva.

I am really jealous of all those people who got chance to see Bhagawan, more  
jealous of all those people who were able to converse with Bhagawan even more  
jealous with all those people who lived with Bhagawan. How lucky indeed all  
these people are.   
To be born with spiritual mind is very good, and they are really fortunate who  
are able to pursue their spiritual Sadhana. Even more fortunate are those who  
spiritual Sadhana is accepted whole heartedly by their near and dear ones -  
family and allow them to pursue their Sadhana.   
Dear Subramanian, though what you say is true -   
Many cannot see Him,   
Some could see Him,   
But only a few are called,   
And a fewer are chosen!   
I have a mixed feeling within me which cries "why not me?, why not me?"

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. He will, He will. He will. If one could genuinely seek His   
guidance, He will not only call him, but also choose him.   
He has Himself said: WHERE CAN I GO? I AM HERE!"   
Onc can visit Tiruvannamalai, as frequently as possible,   
depending upon one's health, family and some money.   
His Presence is felt more intensely in Sri Ramanasramam,   
to strengthen our trust in Him. But this is definitely not   
a 'must' for who cannot make it. Intense devotion with   
the conviction that "He is my Guru" and living a life according   
to His Words are more than sufficient.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Your words are so very True. I just cant wait to go to Ramanashram and sit in  
front of Bhagawan in the Old Hall. Only he has/can to arrange for it to  
happen!   
As he has said, look with physical eye, you see only the world and look with  
Jnana-Kann or with divine eye and you will see me everywhere.   
Only he has to refine me enough and grant me those Jnana-Kann   
With Prayers..

For every well known saint, there could be tens or hundreds of realised souls  
living unknown, perhaps intentionally, as householders or otherwise. As in all

Dear mmohan,   
You are quite correct. There was one Norwegian who came   
to Bhagavan Ramana after Bhagavan's Mahanirvana. He   
could not even see Him. But he realized the Self, due to   
His Grace and is called Swami Ramanagiri. His Samadhi   
is near Madurai. There is no mention about him, even   
in Sri Ramanasramam books. David Godman reserached   
and wrote an article about him. See his blog www.davidgodman.org.

we know those names are in printed book. on the other hand there may be many.  
I missed the golden chance of having darshan of Anandamayi ma in 1965.   
My friend asked me no. of times to go with her. After many years I read her  
book. now I feel very bad. My bad karma only did not allow me to do so. Yogi  
yogananda had come to have darshan of Bhagavan. but I am not sure whether  
Anandmayi ma came or not. She was always in bliss. She also got married   
but her husband became of her deciple.

Dear ramanaduli,   
Ma Ananda Mayi had visited Bhagavan Ramana. So also   
Papa Ramadas, Papaji. Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati,   
Jamnalal Bajaj, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the late President of   
India, Maharaja of Mysore, Maharaja of Cochin, Maharani   
and Princess of Dewas and a few others who were fortunate.   
Mahatma Gandhi could not see Bhagavan even though he   
had a desire and he missed, due to 'busy schedule' fixed   
by Rajaji. Rajaji also did not see Him, even though he came   
to Arunachaleswarar Temple, to inaugurate the renovated   
Patala Lingam temple, under the auspices of Mrs. Talyarkhan,   
in 1949.   
Many cannot see Him,   
Some could see Him,   
But only a few are called,   
And a fewer are chosen!   
Arunachala Siva.

I am really jealous of all those people who got chance to see Bhagawan, more  
jealous of all those people who were able to converse with Bhagawan even more  
jealous with all those people who lived with Bhagawan. How lucky indeed all  
these people are.   
To be born with spiritual mind is very good, and they are really fortunate who  
are able to pursue their spiritual Sadhana. Even more fortunate are those who  
spiritual Sadhana is accepted whole heartedly by their near and dear ones -  
family and allow them to pursue their Sadhana.   
Dear Subramanian, though what you say is true -   
Many cannot see Him,   
Some could see Him,   
But only a few are called,   
And a fewer are chosen!   
I have a mixed feeling within me which cries "why not me?, why not me?"

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. He will, He will. He will. If one could genuinely seek His   
guidance, He will not only call him, but also choose him.   
He has Himself said: WHERE CAN I GO? I AM HERE!"   
Onc can visit Tiruvannamalai, as frequently as possible,   
depending upon one's health, family and some money.   
His Presence is felt more intensely in Sri Ramanasramam,   
to strengthen our trust in Him. But this is definitely not   
a 'must' for who cannot make it. Intense devotion with   
the conviction that "He is my Guru" and living a life according   
to His Words are more than sufficient.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Your words are so very True. I just cant wait to go to Ramanashram and sit in  
front of Bhagawan in the Old Hall. Only he has/can to arrange for it to  
happen!   
As he has said, look with physical eye, you see only the world and look with  
Jnana-Kann or with divine eye and you will see me everywhere.   
Only he has to refine me enough and grant me those Jnana-Kann   
With Prayers..

I think we are all called that is why we are here in this forum. But we do not  
know who is the lucky being chosen.

For every well known saint, there could be tens or hundreds of realised souls  
living unknown, perhaps intentionally, as householders or otherwise. As in all  
fields, what comes out and become well known is only tip of the iceberg.

Dear mmohan,   
You are quite correct. There was one Norwegian who came   
to Bhagavan Ramana after Bhagavan's Mahanirvana. He   
could not even see Him. But he realized the Self, due to   
His Grace and is called Swami Ramanagiri. His Samadhi   
is near Madurai. There is no mention about him, even   
in Sri Ramanasramam books. David Godman reserached   
and wrote an article about him. See his blog www.davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.
