I am happy to inform the fellow members that my son's betrothal   
for wedding took place this morning in Bangalore. The girl is also   
a B.E., M.B.A working in Delhi. The girls' people are from Hyderabad.   
It is proposed with Bhagavan Ramana's grace, that the wedding   
will take place on 13th December 2009 at Hyderabad/Chennai.   
My Hyderabad/Chennai colleagues may kindly send their house   
addresses through my personal e mail ID. g337h4@yahoo.com,   
so that I can send the invitations in due course.   
With kind regards to everyone,   
Arunachala Siva.

My well wishes to your son's marriage.   
Dear Subramanian R sir, will you not invite Bhagavan Ramana's disciples (that  
is us) for you son's marriage apart from your colleagues?

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
I meant only devotees of Bhagavan Ramana in the Forum,   
by the word 'colleagues.'   
Arunachala Siva.
