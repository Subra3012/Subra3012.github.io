I always wondered this but its just out of longing for Bhagawan. Whenever  
great souls have appeared here, people have always considered them as avatars  
of various Gods. like Shankara was an Avatar of Siva, Rama, Krishna, avatars  
of Vishnu, Arunagirinather and even our beloved Ramana is popularly considered  
as an avatar of Murugan. where can an ordinary person like me ever attain the  
Brahman when all previous great people are verily Gods own manifestations? I  
am just an ordinary person, How can I know that Brahman and get merged with  
that Brahman? Is it not the duty of our Guru/father to hold our hands and take  
us all to our homes? its like leaving a small baby alone in a big busy market.  
I am lost. how can he be so irresponsible? All I seem to have is just a  
photograph of my father. Everybody recognizes him very well, but nobody knows  
where he is to be found! O Father aren't you searching for me? why are you  
taking so long? after all am I not lost in your own place? Or are you waiting  
for me to come to you finding my own way? How cruel of you O father, This  
world is round, and I am coming back to the same place again and again, where  
else to go? no other place I know. It was your mistake to have not been  
careful enough to look after me. you left my hand and I got lost. O Bhagwan  
come now take me, I want to sleep in your lap peacefully. I want to hold your  
index finger and walk with you. Take me along. I want to be with you.   
O Father where are you?

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Bhagavan Ramana and Jnana Sambandha are avatars of Murugan.   
Sankara is an avatara of Siva. They come down to serve as gurus.   
Their cases did not much involve search. But others, however, have   
to 'search' for the Self or the Guru or Siva. Bhagavan Ramana assures us that  
He is within. Not outside. We are going round and round, only to stay where  
we are. The only thing that is required   
is removal of the ego's dirt, the halahala poison, as you have correctly  
mentioned. Upadesa Saram of Bhagavan Ramana, Verse 10 says the same thing.  
All that we have to do is to remain where we are, and this is karma, bhakti,  
yoga and jnana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Your post is very touching and reflects the longing of a seeker.   
About grace Sri Ramakrishna has said:  _The breeze of His grace is blowing day and night over your head. Unfurl the  
sails of your boat (mind), if you want to make rapid progress through the  
ocean of life._   
The saints and sages are an ocean of compassion. They are always eager to show  
us the path of Truth.   
That was why Bhagavan had kept his body for so long after self realization.   
However in the divine scheme of things, a person cannot comprehend the truth  
till a certain stage is reached by doing sadhana.   
That is why one requires to unfurl the boat through sadhana and surrender.   
Even Devi Sati and Devi Parvati, who were incarnations of the Divine Mother  
Herself had to undergo rigorous sadhana in order to attain Lord Shiva. Swami  
Brahmananda, who is considered the spiritual son of Sri Ramakrishna had to  
undergo such rigorous sadhana during the lifetime and after the passing away  
of the master.   
Like, if one invests money in the bank, one finds the interest credited at the  
year end, when one sincerely invests oneself in sadhana, the fruits of the  
sadhana are invariably "credited". The breeze of the grace which is blowing  
day and night gradually reveals the spiritual reality.

Dear silentgreen,   
Guru's sangha is like a southern breeze. It is Sat Sanga. When there   
is a southern breeze, why pick up a hand fan and wave it at your face?, says  
Bhagavan Ramana in one of His poems. Sri Ramakrishna, Bhagavan Ramana, all  
have said the same thing, the devotion, surrender, self enquiry and unswerving  
faith in Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.
