**Working with devotion**   
Q. By what kind of work can God be attained?   
A. There is no difference in work.   
Do not think that this work will lead to God and that will not.   
Everything depends upon His grace.   
To have His grace, whatever work you perform, do it with sincerity and earnest  
longing for Him.   
Through His grace the environment will become favorable and the conditions of  
realization will become perfect. If you want to renounce the world, and if  
your family depends upon you, perhaps your brother will assume its  
responsibility for you. Perhaps your wife will not hinder you in your  
spiritual life, but will rather help you; or perhaps you will not marry at all  
and will not be attached to the world in any way.   
\- Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen,   
Devotion [bhakti] will lead one to surrender [saranagati],   
and after Saranagati nothing excepting He remains, He is   
the One without the second. Saint Tayumanavar says: After I know You, I feel that there is only You and not me."   
Arunachala Siva.

Without God or Guru's Grace, one cannot even a open   
a book on spiriutality or visit Temples. I could not   
visit Tiruvannamalai for 4 long years. From May 2008   
to May 2009, I could visit Tiruvannamalai five times. I   
can go to Him again only when He calls. Our faith is   
only waiting for His Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.
