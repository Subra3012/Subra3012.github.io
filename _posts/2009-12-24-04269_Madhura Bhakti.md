Once Balakrishna, stealthily entered the house of a milkmaid and brought down  
the milk pot held in the suspended net sling. In the mean while he heard the  
footsteps of Gopika. In a split, Balakrishna broke open the pot and the milk  
was split all over the floor. He drenched His tiny feet in the milk an ran out  
hurriedly leaving a trail of His footprints behind. The Gopika entered the  
scene and got irritated at the sight of the split milk. She wailed, Oh Lord!  
How to get along with with this disastrous Balakrishna? Day by day He is  
crossing all limits. Swearing thus she followed the fresh footprints of the  
tiny feet and caught the thief, who was awaiting for her. Overcome by anger  
she raised her hand to slap him. Balakrishna pretended as if in fear, and  
slyly looked at her (just like the graceful eyes of our beloved Ramana)   
Gopika struck by the graceful frightened look, felt helpless and defeated. The  
hands, which were raised, to beat suddenly grabbed Him and embraced Him. she  
covered Him with shower of kisses.   
Why did this "Chitta Chora" the thief of Chittam, leave His footprints openly?  
The reason is cleaar, so that the milkmaid could come face to face with Him,  
with the help of His footprints. By this act He enlightened the world the  
eternal truth that one can reach Him only through the refuge of His Feet.  
Following His footsteps is the right path for liberation.

Thanks for sharing this anecdote and the clear message to grab the Lotus Feet  
of Lord. I wish to narrate one more Balakrishna Leela. A Gopi struggling to  
lift the milk pots sought the help of Krishna, the Menace. He just shrugged  
and refused. Still, he surreptiously followed her and when she reached a  
house and was about to unload her pots, there Krishna appeared. He offered  
her a helping hand. The Gopi chided and tried to drive him away with the  
remark ' You let me down when I wanted your help and now rushing to help me--  
out--'   
Krishna retorted 'I never attempt to add burden to anyone and make things  
difficult, I always help to lighten and share any burden from a person"

Talking about Tiruppavai and Andal,   
In a place of Srivilliputtur in Tamil Nadu there was a great devotee called  
Vishnu Chitta. As we can guess by his name, he was an ardent devotee of Sriman  
Narayana. His house was surrounded by big garden and he took great care and  
put much effort earnestly in maintaining the various flowering plants. His  
daily routine was to make a big garland out of these flowers to adorn his  
Deity, Sriman Narayana. One day when he was digging the ground, he heard some  
bells ringing, tinkling sounds and he went closer and carefully pushed aside  
the plants and, he removed a very beautiful box and in it he found a cute and  
beautiful baby girl with a sweet angel like face. He took her into his arms  
and proceeded to his his house and as there were no females, it was difficult   
for him to foster the baby, but as she was a God given gift he undertook the  
task enthusiastically. He brought her up with lot of love and affection. He  
named her as 'Godha' simply meaning "that which has been gifted by mother  
earth" (Kodai in tamil - "the beauty of rising out due to curly shining  
hair"). Vishnu Chitta began to call her 'Andal' which means, "one who attracts  
everybody" she was a darling of everybody.   
She grew up and helped him in his daily chores. She would pluck flowers and  
made them into beautiful garlands. She would be so fascinated at the galands  
that she stealthily wore them on herself and put them back into the basket  
without anybody's knowldge. Vishnu Chita discovered thsi and he as deeply  
hurt. He was taken by grief an was shocked, because the garlands were menst  
for the lord. He warned the girl not to do such a thing again. His heart would  
not permit him to adorn this garland to Lord Vishnu, thus there was no garland  
that day. But he heard his Lord Vishnu say that the garland worn by Godha was  
filled with devotion so it is very much liked by Him. From that day on Vishnu  
Chitta would adorn the Lord with the garland that has ben already worn by  
Godha. This is a very good example of the one who has realised Advaita, Non-  
Duality.   
Godha was so devoted to Lord Vishnu that she always uttered his name as  
'Ranganatha' and considered Him as her husband. She grew up to a marriageable  
age. She vowed that she would not marry any one bu her Sri Ranganatha. This  
perturbed Vishnu Chitta very much and was worried. But Godha Devi did not lose  
hope, in the month of Margasshirsha (now) she got up early at Brahma Muhurtam  
and had cold water bath and observed the Vratam in order to please Sri  
Ranganatha. one night, Vishnu Chitta, in his dream, Sriman Narayana advised  
him to give Godha in mariage to Him. Godha Devi beautifully dressed like a  
bridegroom reached the temple of Lord Vishnu in Sriragam. The marriage was  
conducted on a very grand scale.   
She was always immersed in sweet thoughts of Sri Ranganatha and got herself a  
position as a 'Devi' eigible for prayer. This great devotion of hers is a  
wonderful eample of Madhura Bhakthi, which made her exempplary in the history  
of Lord Ranganatha and remaining as his beloved.   
She composed the famous Tiruppavai which is sung in most temples in Tamil Nadu  
wih great ferver.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj, arcsekar,   
Thanks for the nice stories on the pranks of Balakrishna. The story   
about AndaL's birth and growing with Vishnu Chitta, who is her foster   
father is also beautiful. AndaL was not born from the womb of a   
mother. She is Lakshmi, divine incarnation, suddenly found by   
Vishnu Chitta one morning under the tulsi plant of the gardens.   
She is called Godha Devi in North India and Kodai / AndaL in   
South India. Srivilliputtur, where I lived for 5 years and had   
my school education because my father was the District Educational   
Officer there is still rich in my memory. There in our street, every   
girl was either Kodai or Andal or Lakshmi or Ranganayaki and every   
boy was either Kannan, Srinivasan or Ranga Mannar. In fact, my   
mother named her last girl child (my youngest sister as AndaL.   
We were the only Smarthas (Advaitis) in that street! But neighbours   
moved with us without hesitation and mingled with our family.   
For my Upanayana, when I was 12 years old, the Sri Vaishna houswives and girls  
took food in our house, which is prohibited   
as per their religious practices!   
Krishna Mathuryam is Ramana Jnanam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
I cant tell how much fortunate you are to have been grown up in such a town  
that has so much legend about its history compared to my generations, we are  
born in midst of TV, Concrete buildings, Money, all all the filth of  
corruption of Kali. No to deny that this existed in your days but there is  
quite a difference. People in the colony knew everybody each other. Today,  
people dont even have time to talk.   
Those days there was Satsang between people naturally, but its a sad story  
today because Satsang is an event Management, Paid, costly. That simplicity  
and innocence of people seem to have lost today.   
Yes Krishna Maadhuryam melts the heart. That boy, who is he? like Ramana,  
comes and verily pulls us with his twine like Yama Deva with his Death Twine  
or (Paasha Kairu in Tamil)
