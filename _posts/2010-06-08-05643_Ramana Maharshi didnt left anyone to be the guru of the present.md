Dear friends, One question is bothering me these days.Whay many gurus,realy  
realised souls,like Ramana Maharshi,Yogananda,Swami Vivekananda didnt left  
anyone to be guru in the present time.Sri Ramana Maharshi left his  
teachings,told us that He is always with us.Vivekananda also in some other  
way,and Yogananda said also that love will be our guru.I know that we dont  
need leaving master to grow spiritualy and realise ourselfs. But,before every  
guru was putting some other realised soul on his place to lead humanity.Whay  
then that is not necesary now?What is the real reason behind that?Coz many of  
them did the same thing.Im intersted what any of you think. Thank you! And im  
sorry for my bad writhing eanglish.

Yes,it can be all that.Well i was intersted in that coz they had many  
folowers...But i think your signature(Ramana Maharshi tehnique) answered in  
the best way.So many times i had that sort of questions,and then after talking  
with myself i see how stupid and meaningless it was.:-) Thank you!

A.   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi had no guru in body. He has clarified   
this position many times in His conversations: 1. He said that there might have been a Guru for Him in the   
previous birth and that guru's work was over and so he did not   
come in the present birth.   
2. He said that Atma is the Guru, who pulls you into the Heart,   
and prevents your mind jumping outside for any worldly activities,   
which are not essential.   
3. He has also said Arunachala Himself was His Guru. This is   
more evident from Verse 19 of Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai   
and other poems.   
4. Bhagavan Ramana has also said a few times, the guru in   
physical body, will attract you on his own, at the appropriate time,   
and you need not make deliberate search for him.   
B.   
For the same reasons, Bhagavan Ramana did not leave any   
guru-paramapara (lineage of guru, like Sri Sankara, through his   
four Maths) and left individual devotees to make their own choices. But the  
fact remains, that many devotees had come to Him after   
His leaving the mortal remains, since they 'found' in his Samadhi,   
the Guru they needed. This is the power, He is emanating from   
His Samadhi.   
Arunachala Siva.

nobody becomes Guru nor is a Guru made, It is not knowledge that makes one a  
Guru, its not respect a person gets that makes a Guru, Guru is not something  
attained, It is not some siddhi that makes one Guru.   
Guru is that Tattva which cannot be explained at all. It is nothing that we  
even think of makes one Guru. It is that Aatma Tatva itself, which is  
impossible to understand.   
Entire Vedas themselves fall short to describe that effulgence. how then can  
we know what determines a Guru.   
all of the greats - Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Yogananda, Sri Ramakrishna did  
not assume Guru-hood nor they even cared about the title "Guru"   
They are beyond any thing that we catagorise them to be.   
They are not at all identifyable with the body. they are not "Person" as well.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
