Major A. W. Chadwick, later Sadhu Arunachala was a very rare   
Western devotee. There are a number of special things about him.   
His name and incidents connected with his life and his experiences are   
narated in a number of Ramanasramam books, including Talks.   
He has also written a book tiitled: A Sadhu's Reminiscences.   
A few rare things about this great seeker are:-   
1\. He came to Bhagavan in 1936 and never returned to his place   
or country.   
2\. He showed great interest in Veda Parayana, Sri Chakra Pooja   
and other ancient rituals.   
3\. After Bhagavan's Maha Nirvana, he used to sit between 8 a.m   
to 10 a.m. and again between 5 p.m to 7 p.m. in front of Bhagavan's   
Samadhi and meditate.   
4\. He was helpful in organizing a Veda Patasala inside Ramanasramam   
and also organized Sri Chakra Pooja in Mathrubhutesvarar Temple.   
5\. He used to delight in Narayana Suktam of Maha Narayana Upanishad,   
which was chanted in Asram.   
A few more things/incidents, I shall post in due course, with due   
credit to books of Sri Ramansramam and Sadhu Arunachala's   
own reminscences.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Bhagawan indirectly indicated to his close disciples that Major Chadwik is his father.

Dear Raju, Thanks. I have no heard about this. It could have   
been mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
