## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Srila Prabhupada on Profit and Loss  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:44:36 AM  
---  
In the evening, Srila Prabhupada lectured again on Bhagavad-gita. He chose  
Text 13 of Chapter Two: dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara. As he  
started to explain the meaning, a child began to cry. Prabhupada chuckled.  
Generally, he became annoyed when interrupted in class. When the devotees saw  
their spiritual master take the disturbance in stride, they were relieved and  
also laughed. Prabhupada used the child's crying to make a point: "So on one  
side, profit; on one side, loss. On one side, you get a child; and on the  
other side, you cannot hear. This is the material world. **As soon as you get  
some profit here, on another side, there is loss. As soon as you want to  
construct a big skyscraper, on another side-digging earth. "**   
Srila Prabhupada derided the foolishness of modern man, who engages in  
"digging and piling," never questioning the usefulness of his endeavor. He  
never considers that he will soon have to leave his body against his will, and  
he shows no interest in the message of Bhagavad-gita that you are not this  
body, but the proprietor within.   
Prabhupada next explained that the word "occupier" is more appropriate than  
the term "proprietor": " **If you rent a house, the proprietor is a different  
man. The tenant is the occupier; no proprietorship. So I am the spirit soul. I  
am not the proprietor. I am simply an occupier. The rascal materialists do not  
know that the proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He is  
giving me a particular apartment according to my capacity for paying rent. "**   
" **This is my position; otherwise, why doesn 't everyone get a first-class  
body, a king's body or rich man's body? One child is born-immediately he is a  
rich man. So there is no arrangement? And another child born at the same  
moment is a very poor man. Why?** Because if I am able to pay more rent, I  
transfer to another, very luxurious apartment. Or if I cannot pay the present  
rent, then I have to move to another, less expensive apartment."   
 _Then Srila Prabhupada described how the environment affects our  
consciousness: "A poor man living in a poor cottage or very unclean apartment-  
his mentality is one way. Another respectable gentleman living in a very nice  
house, his mentality is different. So according to the circumstances, the  
mental changes are there, but both men are human beings. Similarly, there are  
so many apartments, or different types of bodies-8,400,000 types of bodies.  
The occupier, the living being or the soul, is of the same quality, but  
according to the apartment or body he has occupied, he has developed a certain  
consciousness and mentality."_   
Prabhupada reminded his young audience that their birth in a developed country  
such as Germany was testimony of past pious activities and offered them a  
great opportunity for self-realization: "If you have done nicely to occupy a  
first-class apartment, then nature will give you a nice body. Therefore I say  
repeatedly that you Western boys and girls-you are given a very good chance by  
nature. Once upon a time, the European people were dominating all over the  
world, because they are very intelligent. They have got good resources, good,  
nice body, beautiful body. Everything is very good. But don't spoil it; use it  
for understanding further good."   
 **He said that misidentification with one 's land of birth should not let us  
forget that God is the creator and therefore the actual proprietor of  
everything: "Why I am falsely identifying myself with the land? 'I am German  
because I am born in this land of Germany.' That is also false. No land is  
Germany or France or England. Land is land. You have falsely named it: 'This  
is Germany.' What is this Germany? Say two or three hundred years ago, there  
was no Germany. The land was created by God. So it is God's property. Where is  
the difficulty to understand? You did not create anything, not even your own  
body. That proprietor is also Krsna. Because as soon as Krsna asks you,  
'Please vacate,' you must vacate immediately. Can you remain in this body? The  
proprietor asks you to vacate. So you have to vacate. Or the proprietor does  
not repair it. Then you voluntarily vacate: 'This is not useful anymore.'"**   
Returning to the Sanskrit verse, Prabhupada illustrated another meaning of it,  
namely, the imperceptible nature of the bodily changes and how the soul, as an  
observer, is always the same: "So it is to be understood that I existed in the  
past in a different body. As I existed, say seventy years before in a  
different body, I was jumping as a boy. Now I cannot jump; now I have to use  
the cane. This is a different body. If the same body still existed, then I  
could jump like a boy. I remember that I jumped. But now it is not possible. I  
have to take the help of three men." Prabhupada laughed, and the devotees  
joined in. He was in a jolly mood, pleased to see many young faces. He hoped  
that they would take Krsna consciousness seriously before their bodies  
dwindled with old age and the great opportunity to achieve perfection within  
this lifetime was lost.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Dayananda Saraswati  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 04, 2010, 10:58:39 AM

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayananda_Saraswati   
http://www.satyarthprakash.com/   
Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati(February 12, 1824  October 31, 1883) **was an  
important Hindu religious scholar, reformer and the founder of the Arya Samaj,  
"Society of Nobles", a Hindu reform movement, founded in 1875.**   
**He was the first man who gave the call for Swarajya - "India for Indians" in  
1876 which was later furthered by Lokmanya Tilak.** Denouncing idolatry and  
ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards  
reviving Vedic ideologies, subsequently philosopher and President of India, S.  
Radhakrishnan, later called him one of "makers of Modern India" as did Sri  
Aurobindo.   
One of his notable disciples was Shyamji Krishna Varma who founded India House  
in London and guided other revolutionaries like Madam Cama, Veer Sawarkar,  
Lala Hardyal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Bhagat Singh and others. His other disciples  
were Swami Shraddhanand, Lala Lajpat Rai and others who got their inspiration  
from his writings.   
**His book Satyarth Prakash contributed to the Indian independence movementis  
one of his great contributions.**   
He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from his boyhood, and a scholar, who believed in  
the infallible authority of the Vedas.   
Among Maharishi Dayananda's contributions are his promoting of the equal  
rights of women - such as the right to education and reading of Indian  
scriptures - and his translation of the Vedas from Sanskrit to Hindi so that  
the common person may be able to read the Vedas.   
Dayananda was born on on February 12 in 1824, in the village of Tankara near  
Morvi (Morbi) in the Kathiawar region (present Rajkot district), of the  
princely state of Gujarat, into a affluent and devout Brahmin family of  
Krishna Lal Tiwari and Yashodabai.   
**Swami Dayananda 's creation, the Arya Samaj, is a unique contribution in  
Hinduism.** The Arya Samaj unequivocally condemns idol-worship, animal  
sacrifices, ancestor worship, pilgrimages, priestcraft, offerings made in  
temples, the caste system, untouchability, child marriages and discrimination  
against women on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. The Arya  
Samaj discourages dogma and symbolism and encourages skepticism in beliefs  
that run contrary to common sense and logic. To many people, the Arya Samaj  
aims to be a "universal society" based on the authority of the Vedas.

## Nisargadatta Maharaj: "to say 'I do' is altogether false.  
Author: Joey_               Date: June 04, 2010, 11:43:44 AM  
---  
"The witness is that which says "I know". The person says "I do". Now, to say  
"I know" is not untrue, it is merely limited. But to say "I do" is altogether  
false, because there is nobody who does; all happens by itself, including the  
idea of being a doer. The universe is full of action, but there is no actor.  
There are numberless persons small and big and very big, who, through  
identification, imagine themselves as acting, but it does not change the fact  
that the world of action (mahadakash) is one single whole in which all depends  
on, and affects all. The stars affect us deeply and we affect the stars.  
**Step back from action to consciousness, leave action to the body and the  
mind; it is their domain. Remain as pure witness, till even witnessing  
dissolves in the Supreme. "**   
\- I Am That

The _Arunachala Mahatmyam_ was serialised in _The Mountain Path_ in English in  
the 60s and 70s. A bound copy of all the installments is in the ashram  
library. Motilal Banarsidass also brought out a translation in their Purana  
translation series. It is part of the _Skanda Purana_, but the portion that  
contains _Arunachala Mahatmyam_ is in a separate book.   
The _Arunachala Puranam_ has never been published in English, but a  
translation of the chapter about King Vallalan's quest for a son was published  
in _The Mountain Path_ about twenty years ago.
