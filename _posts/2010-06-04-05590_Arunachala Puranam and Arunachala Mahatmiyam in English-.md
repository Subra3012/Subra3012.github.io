Arunachala Maahatmyam, Tamil version is available in the Asramam.   
I am not sure about the English version. Regarding Arunachala Puranam, this  
original Tamil work is again available in the Asramam.   
You may kindly write to Asramam, Tiruvannamalai 606 603, India   
and find out.   
Arunachala Siva.

The _Arunachala Mahatmyam_ was serialised in _The Mountain Path_ in English in  
the 60s and 70s. A bound copy of all the installments is in the ashram  
library. Motilal Banarsidass also brought out a translation in their Purana  
translation series. It is part of the _Skanda Purana_, but the portion that  
contains _Arunachala Mahatmyam_ is in a separate book.   
The _Arunachala Puranam_ has never been published in English, but a  
translation of the chapter about King Vallalan's quest for a son was published  
in _The Mountain Path_ about twenty years ago.
