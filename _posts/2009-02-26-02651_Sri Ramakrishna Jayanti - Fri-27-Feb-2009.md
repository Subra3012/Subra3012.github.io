The Jayanti celebrations of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in 2009 will be  
observed on Friday, February 27th. This birthday (Jayanthi) celebration is  
based on the Hindu lunar calendar, which falls on Phalgun Shukla Dwitiya.  
According to the English calendar or the general Indian Calendar, Sri  
Ramakrishna was born on February 18, 1836. Numerous spiritual programs and  
discourses are being organized by Ramakrishna mission in India and in several  
countries around the world on the day.

Dear silentgreen,   
Thank you for the information. I used to go for the Kalpataru Day,   
the 1st of Jan. which date is easy to remember. SRK touched and   
graced everyone who came to see Him on that day.   
Arunachala Siva.
