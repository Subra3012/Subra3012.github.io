I met one gentleman, Swami Mathurananda, during my recent visit   
to Tiruvannamalai. He is in his mid-30s, in simple white dhoti   
and jubba and he is tall and fair complexioned. He is an Indian.   
He told me that he has been living in Tiruvannamalai for the last   
9 years, but in his own little home, and visiting the Asramam frequently but  
otherwise staying at home, meditating and reading.   
What was surprising to me was his earlier history. He joined   
Sri Ramakrishna Math, spent about 11 years there, obtained   
sannyasa diksha as well as mantra diksha. After this in another   
one year, that is totally at the end of the 12th years, he felt   
that he should leave Ramakrishna Order and be independent for   
his sadhana. Thereafter, he felt like staying in Tiruvannamalai   
and he seems to have anchored himself in T'malai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
Atman   
\   
dive deep within   
you can bypass the illusion of nature   
you can learn her secrets   
A very good poem indeed.   
\   
All learning, all personal glory has taken a few steps and turned their faces;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.   
All words, all synonymns have done their jobs and won't move one step further;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.   
A personal life lived and could not come out of its cocoon;   
Only aspiration and deep yearning can measure the glory of the Atman.
