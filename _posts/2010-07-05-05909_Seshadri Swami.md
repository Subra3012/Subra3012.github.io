I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Really dangerous person wasnt he ?   
is the environment around Arunachala especially peaceful? Are we allowed to  
climb the hill and see places, unexplored?   
Are there unexplored places in and around the hill still?

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

climb the hill and see places, unexplored?   
Are there unexplored places in and around the hill still?

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness

Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Really dangerous person wasnt he ?

Are there unexplored places in and around the hill still?

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Really dangerous person wasnt he ?   
is the environment around Arunachala especially peaceful? Are we allowed to  
climb the hill and see places, unexplored?   
Are there unexplored places in and around the hill still?

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.

lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Once Sheshadri Swami was forced by his relatives to comeback to his native  
place and they forcibly put his body in the train   
but train stopped at the outskirts of Tiruvannamalai.It only moved after  
Sheshadri Swami got down from the train and started walking back to  
Tiruvannamalai town.Like Bhagawan he insisted in staying Tiruvannamalai and  
left his body there only.

Dear srkudai, Dr. Raju,   
There is one Tamil biography on Seshadri Swami by one Kuzhumani   
Narayana Sastri. It gives a lot of incidents and 'miracles' of Seshadri  
Swami. The train incident mentioned by Dr. Raju, is one such event.   
Once there was one Mudaliar [I think he was called Thoppiah   
Mudaliar] who brought tins of gingely oil for lighting 1 lakh   
lights in Tiruvannamalai to celebrate Mahadeepam. Seshadri   
Swami came to him and asked with a roaring laugher: "O Mudaliar,   
you are going to light 1 lakh lamps, is it so? hi...hi...." He   
then went away. Mudaliar who knew Seshadri Swami became somewhat confused.   
On that Mahadeepam day, there were heavy winds almost like   
a storm! Not a single lamp would remain lighted for even a   
few seconds. They all got put off, by heavy winds. Swami   
came to Mudaliar and told him: "Why are you doing all these?   
There is a light on the Hill. Why not see it and be happy. Go   
and buy a lot of pumpkin and bags of rice and prepare nice food   
and feed everyone who come to Arunachalam for darshan!"   
Mudaliar immediately rushed to the grocers and bought everything and food was  
arranged for that night to thousands of pilgrims on that night.   
Arunachala Siva.

## TAT TVAM ASI Seshadri Swami

I was reading Seshadri Swamiji's biography published by Bhavan's.   
Its really excellent.   
Seshadri Swami shows great vairagya from the very beginning of his life. he  
practiced japa sitting in cremation grounds   
and always remained detached.   
its really a wonderful feeling to read such great lives of saints.

Dear srkudai,   
Seshadri Swami was from Kanchipuram. He had no father. His   
mother, while dying called the young boy and touched his chest   
and said: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva..... Seshadri Swami   
after some time, left for Tiruvannamalai. His apparent lunatic   
behavior was only to ward off unwanted visitors and crowd. But   
with some sincere devotees, he had behaved very normally.   
Akhilandamma had served both Bhagavan Ramana and Seshadri   
Swami. She had once, called him and given him a good oil bath,   
and gave him hot food. Seshadri Swami, who never stays in one   
place for more than a few minutes, stayed with Akhilandamma and   
accepted the elaborate bath and good food.   
He knew the people's mind. One guy who was giving money and   
taking high interest payments, came to him. He said: I am having a salary of  
Rs 1000/-. The Chinna Seshadri (Bhagavan Ramana)   
is having a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not at least earn   
Rs 100/- for your moksham? The guy understood this. Others could   
not. He was discreet in criticizing people.   
People often told Bhagavan Ramana that Seshadri Swami was a   
mad cap.   
Once Bhagavan Ramana said: "There are three lunatics in this   
place. One is Arunachaleswara [who has given half his body to   
his wife], the other one is Seshadri and the third is mine!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Is there anything else known about interactions between Ramana and Seshadri

Dear srkudai,   
Once Seshadri Swami and Bhagavan Ramana sat together for   
eating food. Both were given leaves and both were served.   
[I think it must have happened during Virupaksha days, when   
Akhilandamma served food]. Seshadri Swami started throwing   
the cooked grains in all 8 directions, saying that 'this is for   
Varuna, this is for Indra, this is for Vayu....' etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana, as you know never liked wasting even a grain of rice.   
He mildly chided Seshadri Swami: "What is all this? Eat without   
throwing the food like this!" Seshadri Swami kept quiet and started   
taking food.   
Arunachala Siva.

One morning Sheshadri Swami is paying respects to holy hill of Arunachala and  
Bhagawan is passing by.   
Bhagawan remarked do you still feel separation from the Siva consciousness  
pointing to Sheshadri Swami.   
Yes said Sheshadri Swami,praying Arunachala i am blissful though it is in  
dimension of duality.   
Bhagawan said sari,sari which means you have freedom to do what you like.He  
won't interfere in other's devotion unless   
the other is willing to grow further.

 I guess Even Seshadri Swami was totally Advaitin. He even demonstrated it by his wierd activities.   
how come he was involved in duality?

Dear srkudai,   
 Once Echammal or someone was taking food to the Hill for   
Bhagavan Ramana in a brass vessel. Sri Seshadri Swami who   
was seen on the way remarked: "Oh, She is going to the samsari   
on the Hill. There is also some nice pickles taken for Him!  
Once one brahmin lady came to meet him. Seshadri Swami suddenly   
grabbed her ear and pulled down the ear stud. This lady ran away   
crying. With in two days, she was presented diamond ear studs by her husband!   
But on a different occasion, for the same apparently cruel act   
of Seshadri Swami with another lady, she lost her husband and   
she had to remove her ear studs [as was the practice in the olden   
days]!   
Who can understand a Siddha's mind?   
Seshadri Swami was not only a siddha purusha but also a Brahma Jnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Really dangerous person wasnt he ?   
is the environment around Arunachala especially peaceful? Are we allowed to  
climb the hill and see places, unexplored?   
Are there unexplored places in and around the hill still?
