## Suruttapalli Siva  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: May 31, 2009, 07:19:09 AM

There is a small town called Suruttapalli, near Kanchipuram.   
There is a Siva temple there. Here Siva is in a different form,   
which is rare. Here He is lying like Mahavishnu, on the laps   
of Uma. The Puranic story goes that after consuming halahala   
poison, Siva became tired and was resting, keeping his head   
on the laps of Uma. This Siva temple also follows some   
different procedure. They place shadari [paduka] on your   
head and give you only spoons of water. No vibhuti. No   
breaking of coconuts.   
This Siva temple was renovated some years back, by Kanchi   
Kamakoti Math. When Kanchi Sri Chandrasekhara went to   
that temple, he composed a Sanskrit verse: "O Father!   
Please take rest. You have done something which even   
Vishnu could not do. You have driven out the fears of devas   
about the poison. Please wake up early and bless us all."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir,   
Adi sankara sings the glory of Uma. Due to Uma her husband is saved. It comes  
in sowdharyalahari. He says "Thatanka mahima".   
There is another story also. Some poet was asked to sing on the glory of the  
king pallavan. He said he would not sing except the Lord.   
King became angry and asked the poet to leave his village. When lord's devotee  
was leaving the town, the Lord also collected his bed   
and came along with his devotee (poet). IN TAMIL THEY SAY, PAIYAI (MAT)  
CHURUTIYADAL it is called churuttapalli.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. This is a story from Sri Vaishnava devotees. There   
was one devotee by name Kani KaNNan. He was in   
Kanchipuram. The Pallava King wanted him to write a   
poem on him. Kani KaNNan said that he would not sing   
on any mortals but only on Narayana. [Remember Muruganar   
refused to write anything other than Bhagavan Ramana after   
he became His devotee]. The king wanted him to out of   
Kanchipuram. The devotee Kani KaNNan told Narayana   
who was lying on Adisesha also to go with him. Narayana   
also left Kanchipuraam, fold his mat [Adisesha]! The devotee   
and Narayana stayed for one day in a near by village called   
Or-Irukkai [one day seat!]. The king came to the devotee   
and prostrated before him, requesting him to come back. Kani KaNNan composed  
another song asking Narayana to fold back   
his mat and come back with him. Narayna promptly agreed!   
This story comes in Kanchi Puranam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir.   
Thank you very much. Long time back I read so I could not recollect the names  
of the Bhakta.   
It takes so many births to become a good bhakta. After that everything is  
over. God becomes adiyarkku adiyen and listens every thing. I remember   
Bharathiyar song. Engirudo vandhan iddaichadhi nan enran... God does all the  
work for the sake of His devotee.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. God always likes a person who is devoted to His   
devotees. Many saints in Periya Puranam, [e.g. Appoothi   
Adigal] prayed only to Siva's devotees, like Tiru Navukkarasar.   
Yazhapanar, a low caste violinist prayed only to Tiru Jnana   
Sambandhar and played his violin only for his songs. Bhagavan   
Ramana says in Verse 104 of Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai: Let me be a devotee of the devotees of the devotees,   
who listen to Your name with love!   
Please bless so, O Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

A very popular example which everyone would have come across.   
Take different brands in Chocolates - Cadburys, Nestle, Amul, Ravalgon,  
Parrys, etc... (Various Gods)   
The Sweetness remains the same in all the brands. Seek for the sweetness and  
not the Brands (Various Gods).   
All Brands Give same sweetness. For Some like Cadburys, some Amul, etc... but  
they derive same ecstasy as what other would get from a different brand.   
Seek the sweetness in and not the God.   
So when we see Rama, we should just not see the figure. see that which you  
will find even in Krishna and Shiva, Murugan, Devi, Aiyappa, Ramana,  
Ramakrishna, etc...   
When you begin to see what it is, you will discover that it is LOVE.   
 **The Truth is God is a very poor man, He can only Give us LOVE alone, he  
cannot give anything else for he does not have anything to give. If you ask  
for LOVE he will give you in Abundance and then by this our life will begin to  
brim with happiness.

I was contemplating on this Spider and the Bumble Bee... Suppose our near and  
dear one is trapped in a Lion's Den and is stuck, unable to pull out the  
stone, would we simply let it be as it is? will we let even our near and dear  
one also be food for the lion! This will be the real test for us!

Nagaraj.. The thing with all these ethical choices is that you can speculate  
all you like   
but when confronted with the real situation you will do something or you won't  
.   
and some would say your choice is actually an illusion because it was  
inevetable according   
to your natural tendencies.

True. That's why it is said you cannot remember God at the time of your death  
unless you have remembered him constantly and established a relationship with  
him throughout your life. But most of us tend to postpone this till our ripe  
old age when we can do nothing and spend all our good times playing with the  
world.

Dear skyperson & mmohan,   
Yes. What mmohan says is correct. Our choices vary   
according to our circumstances. But Prarabdha is god's   
scheme of things. This can never be changed. At best,   
according to Saiva Siddhantis, Praradha can be thinned   
by God. When you have to lose your head, you lose only   
your headgear. Bhagavan Ramana also said Destiny decides   
everything. You can at best pray. Or be a Jnani and take   
it without any pain on your body-mind complex. I was   
wondering about this incident some years back. Once   
a group of devotees, who went to Sabarimala for darshan,   
after 48 days of penance, had a darshan and when they   
were returning to their hometown, their van met with an   
accident and everyone died. How did it happen? Why   
did it happen? These questions have no answers. At   
best it could be "our various theories".   
Arunachala Siva.

Probably destiny might have decided to hasten their (the Sabarimala pilgrimage  
victims) Prarabdha and finish off their backlog once for all and given them  
moksha or release from this cycle of birth and death. Or probably a better  
next birth more conducive for sadhana. Who knows?   
This brings another question I wanted to ask. I have heard some jnanis and  
speakers say that once you are on the spiritual path, at some stage, destiny  
takes over and to speeden up things might cause havoc with our lives in order  
to deepen our Vairagya to the world and release our backlog of karma (this is  
generally said of Siva devotees as Siva is considered the destroyer). I wonder  
how far this is true. Sure, most of us need shocks every now and then to come  
back to the path and progress, but is it a must? Sounds scary as our perceived  
world and luxuries might crumble any minute. Might be the reason why many  
perfer to stay at a safe distance from the path and progress as slow as  
possible (like treading unchartered waters) !!!

Yes. Destiny takes its own course. Bhagavan Ramana had   
the death experience, around mid-July 1896, and He   
could not stay in that state for long. Six weeks went with   
immense pains. Everyday, He went to Meenakshi Temple and cried before 63  
Saints, how long, how long? Destiny fixed it   
as end August 1896. The money came to Him, and He had   
to utter a lie. He left Madurai and reached Tiruvannamalai   
on 1st September 1896. He went inside the Arunachaleswarar   
Temple; It was around 10.45 AM. There were none [!] inside   
the Temple. He went to Arunachala [linga], and embraced   
him. He found an all-engulfing Light. He said: "O Father! I have reported  
as per Your command!" Arunachala took care of Him for 54 years!   
Then, think of His departure! How can He depart? The body   
had to go through a little of prarabdha. He took upon Himself,   
a terrific disease, for which no medicine was available. Devotees tried four  
surgeries on Him. He had to find an excuse for departure! He left as a  
glorious light. One sentence,   
we should all remember. He had said: "Where can I go?   
I am here!" Only His body disappeared. He is very much   
with us, once you repose faith in Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

My reaction to the original post was that I would help to save the bee.   
While out walking with the dog this morning there was young thrush walking  
near by. It didnt fly away, I wandered whether it was injured. So I waited  
and watched, it hopped over to the longer grass and started pecking, the next  
second it had something in its beak. There was a worm struggling to get free,  
trying to get back into the ground. In this instance I didnt do anything. A  
thought went through my mind that I couldnt help every living creature. I  
carried on with the walk not knowing whether the thrush needed help or whether  
the worm wriggled free.

Dear Paul,   
Well thats all is in our hands, just watch. What else can we do? The one that  
had the thought of whether to save it or leave it or the thought of no being  
able to help all creatures is the Ego's. The Consciousness is least affected  
by all these.   
That which gets affected is only the Ego because its agenda of saving it, not  
saving it, not being able to do anything is affected.

Dear Nagaraj, it is very difficult to watch without all sorts of thoughts and  
emotions getting in the way. Even if one sets out to practise Self-enquiry the  
ego rears its head and starts an internal conversation about Self-enquiry,  
which is no good at all. When this happens sometimes I pray to God that he  
will help me to surrender. Thats all I can do and trust it will happen in its  
own time.

Dear Paul,   
Yes surender is the way. In the world every being is created   
and one becomes the food of others. Even human beings   
who are vegetarians have to kill the plants to eat food. A   
fly is eaten by a lizard, a cow by tiger, a tiger by a man etc.,   
This chain continues ever and for ever. We can at best help   
the suffering beings to the extent possible. Suppose we   
save a deer from tiger, the tiger would look at us and ask: Who are you to prevent my food? We have no answer.   
Surrender to God or Guru is the best way. All things   
are done by one Parameswara Sakti. Our job is to stay   
away from thinking that I shall do this or do that.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hello all   
Yesterday in my garden I noticed a Bumble Bee had been caught in a spider's  
web and was frantically trying to   
get free. The spider was watching. Close to this another bee was on a flower  
being free.   
I could have easily intervened and helped the Bee to escape, but i didn't.   
This reminded me of the story of the monk who freed a deer from a tiger's  
grasp, but then realised he had denied the tiger   
his lunch so he gave himself to the tiger, who then ate him.   
Peace sky.

Very good. Everything to it's own fate. Accept everything as it is. The less  
we interfere with nature the better for the world. Left to itself this world  
and all it's creatures manage fantastically. It's only human beings wrong  
interpretations and manipulations that interfere with nature's smooth  
functioning. Let everything be as it is.   
Now my question is : if I see an accident happening on the road before my  
eyes, should I interfere and help the victim or leave the scene without  
letting that affecting me? How is this situation different from the earlier  
one? How do we decide to just witness or to intervene in any situation we  
confront? Invite you all to throw some light on this dilemma.

Let me put it this way. Suppose I see another man being attacked by a lion.  
Obviously the lion is hungry and trying to get its lunch. As another human  
being, do I try to save the man by killing the lion (with a gun of course) or  
let the lion have its lunch as nature intended? Anyway we end up doing wrong  
to one or the other. Where do we draw the line? Do we interfere only if human  
beings are involved?

Dear sir,   
To save a person if we kill other one is good or bad.This is a question now.  
Well. The whole mahabharatha story is based on this line only. All Gods have  
weapon. why.To save other person. i.e. to save the Dharma. That is why Krishna  
insisted Arjun to kill his cousins. Sometimes we have this dilemma DHARMA  
SHANKATAM.   
We have to listen our heart. Without expectation any reward we have to save  
the person. Rest leave to God.

This is a classic case of "Dharma Sankatam" \- "what to do" "This" or "That".  
If you are impelled to save, then so be it, if you are impelled to leave it,  
then also so be it. Whatever you decide is Ok and acceptable. and one has to  
remember that, one does not decide whether one has to save or not, it is  
already destined. we should never forget that we are only an instrument.   
By saving, do we actually Give Life to the Bumble bee? or what makes us think  
that we are giving food to the Spider?   
Even in this post, it is destined that the Bumble bee be as it is, it is also  
destined that Sky Person be just as he is, without saving it. Nobody did  
anything, or nobody does anything at any time.   
Dot not take the Doership.   
Whatever you do - you don't do   
Whatever you don't do - you actually don't do it   
All the rumble noise about all these is only the Ego's which is non existent  
and has got nothing to do with any thing that happens around us.   
You are not the Doer at any cost at all times!

Dear mmohan, skyperson and others,   
There are always two sides of a coin. How to reconcile?   
Bhagavan Ramana says: Whatever one gives to someone else,   
he gives it to himself. When you harm others, in fact, you   
are harming yourself. The situations become different.   
The spider is still in its place most of the times. Hence when   
a prey comes to its net, it has to eat. It does not go out   
much like other insects like butterfly, cockroach etc.,   
Hence it should take its food, that is made available to it.   
The man who met with an accident, needs help. Because,   
he is suffering, may be due to his negilgence or the motorist's   
negilgence. Still help is essential.   
A lion taking a man. Here, man should be saved, because,   
he is in distress. A lion may get some other animals and it   
need not be a human being.   
Everywhere Prarabdha or destiny plays a key role. Bhagavan   
Ramana says: "Praradha will feed you, whether you like it   
or not." The feed may be good food or poison and other miseries.   
Arunachala Siva.

DEar Nagarai ji and Subramaniyan ji   
As it is the prarabda, sometimes we get confused and sometimes we do not and  
carry on the work. But sometimes we do realise that we could have done   
in better way. In this place we feel little disturbed. AT this point, is our  
ego gets disturbed? I think before steping into spirtual studies, we should  
know   
how the ego came in to us, and how and when all it plays its trick. When some  
one says I am suffering, it does mean that there is no real suffering to him   
only his ego is suffering. Is it correct? At that time what is our duty  
towards the person. Ignore him or to help him.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
If you study yourself carefully, you will discover that there is pinch of  
desire for the result. this is the problem which most of us face. We have to  
wipe out/dissolve this salt so that the pure self remains like a Spatika  
without any desire about the outcome. It does not matter what the fruits are  
going to be.   
The Ego gets disturbed only because of this reason alone - having some sort of  
desire about how the outcome has to be.   
In Upadesa Saaram, Ramana has said -   
_kartur äjnayä präpyate phalam   
karma kim param karma tajjadam   
By the will of the Creator, action bears fruit. Is   
action, then, supreme? No, it is inert, unconscious.   
_**   
We don't have any rights whatsoever on our part as to what fruits we are going  
to get.   
 _ **éshvar-ärpitam necchayä krtam   
citta-shodhakam mukti-sädhakam   
That action which is done without personal desire   
and whose fruits are surrendered to the Lord,   
purifies the mind and leads to Liberation.**_   
By consciously praying to oneself that my duty is to only perform actions and  
have no rights on fruits, one will abide in peace. Remember the eternal  
teaching of Bhagawan, whenever you get disturbed -   
**_The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their  
prarabdhakarma. Whatever is destined not to happen will not happen, try as  
you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to  
prevent it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is to remain silent.   
_**   
Reflecting thus, the mind-ego will get pacified and abide as peace.   
Before performing any actions consciously telling to ourselves that Now, I  
have only this action to perform, this duty to perform, I will perform it to  
the best of my abilities. I know that I don't have any rights on what I am  
going to get back. But Lord give me the strength to accept whatever you give.  
and at the same time, I also pray Lord to give me strength to bear all  
difficulties.   
By such constant practice in daily life, every moment, the Ego will be trained  
like a Tiger of the circus. It has to be trained.   
Bhagawad Gita also says the same -   
_**karmany evadhikaras te   
ma phalesu kadacana   
ma karma-phala-hetur bhur   
ma te sango 'stv akarmani   
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to  
the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results  
of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.**_   
I have come to understand by my own experiences that Spiritual successes only  
come after this has been mastered.   
Sri Ramana

Dear Ramanaduli & Nagaraj,   
When Bhagavan Ramana was in His last days [ He had pain,   
which should have been unbearable for anyone else], the   
attendants asked Him: "Bhagavan! Is it paining too much?"   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Yes, the body is paining!" He was   
not the body or the mind.

Dear Nagaraj, beautifully put. But it takes a hell of an effort to master this  
in real life. Many a time we stand at crossroads confused as to what our  
dharma is and worried whether we are commiting a sin by either doing or not  
doing. This dilemma is all the more when you are halfway in the spiritual  
path. A completely materialistic person as well as the jnani has no such  
problems as they are fully comfortable with whatever they do or don't do. As  
it is rightly said in the scriptures, to escape from darkness to light, we  
have to successfully pass through greater darkness or confusion (the dark  
night of the soul?). Only complete faith in God/Guru can take us through  
without getting mad. Again what is right for one person in his path may be  
completely unsuitable for another. Hence each one of us have to find our own  
unique way to salvation.

Dear sirs,   
In hindu tradition, there are so many gods, to grant our wishes. like for  
education, saraswati is there, for money lakshmi is there the list is endless.   
We (I) pray to all these gods, for each one of these grants. That time my mind  
is expecting the result. I cannot sit simply when my family faces   
problem. I pray to God to grant my wishes. If does not take place, then I  
remember all philosophical saysings, It may be easy if you are all alone.   
Sometimes I used to feel if I would be able to talk to Bhagavan I would say,  
how it is difficult to live in the family, seeing the sufferings and read   
all spiritual books. My ego is very strong never admits anything if something  
goes wrong.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
That is why the saints have said pray to one god. Choosing   
different gods for different boons is not correct. Even this   
one god cannot answer your prayers all the time. This is   
where our Prarabdha comes into picture. We should learn   
to accept the pains and sorrows. We should learn not to   
get elated by the pleasures and comforts. This is easier   
said than done. But this is the fact of life. One God is   
sufficient. Saint Manikkavachagar sings in Tiru Thellenam,   
in Tiruvachakam: For the One who does not have even one name and one form,   
Let us pray with one thousand names,   
Play Tiru Thellenam!   
Thellenam is a game for the girls, where they use small   
stones or tamarind seeds and throw them up and catch   
them again.   
Arunachala Siva.

A very popular example which everyone would have come across.   
Take different brands in Chocolates - Cadburys, Nestle, Amul, Ravalgon,  
Parrys, etc... (Various Gods)   
The Sweetness remains the same in all the brands. Seek for the sweetness and  
not the Brands (Various Gods).   
All Brands Give same sweetness. For Some like Cadburys, some Amul, etc... but  
they derive same ecstasy as what other would get from a different brand.   
Seek the sweetness in and not the God.   
So when we see Rama, we should just not see the figure. see that which you  
will find even in Krishna and Shiva, Murugan, Devi, Aiyappa, Ramana,  
Ramakrishna, etc...   
When you begin to see what it is, you will discover that it is LOVE.   
 **The Truth is God is a very poor man, He can only Give us LOVE alone, he  
cannot give anything else for he does not have anything to give. If you ask  
for LOVE he will give you in Abundance and then by this our life will begin to  
brim with happiness.

Dear skyperson & mmohan,   
Yes. What mmohan says is correct. Our choices vary   
according to our circumstances. But Prarabdha is god's   
scheme of things. This can never be changed. At best,   
according to Saiva Siddhantis, Praradha can be thinned   
by God. When you have to lose your head, you lose only   
your headgear. Bhagavan Ramana also said Destiny decides   
everything. You can at best pray. Or be a Jnani and take   
it without any pain on your body-mind complex. I was   
wondering about this incident some years back. Once   
a group of devotees, who went to Sabarimala for darshan,   
after 48 days of penance, had a darshan and when they   
were returning to their hometown, their van met with an   
accident and everyone died. How did it happen? Why   
did it happen? These questions have no answers. At   
best it could be "our various theories".   
Arunachala Siva.

Probably destiny might have decided to hasten their (the Sabarimala pilgrimage  
victims) Prarabdha and finish off their backlog once for all and given them  
moksha or release from this cycle of birth and death. Or probably a better  
next birth more conducive for sadhana. Who knows?   
This brings another question I wanted to ask. I have heard some jnanis and  
speakers say that once you are on the spiritual path, at some stage, destiny  
takes over and to speeden up things might cause havoc with our lives in order  
to deepen our Vairagya to the world and release our backlog of karma (this is  
generally said of Siva devotees as Siva is considered the destroyer). I wonder  
how far this is true. Sure, most of us need shocks every now and then to come  
back to the path and progress, but is it a must? Sounds scary as our perceived  
world and luxuries might crumble any minute. Might be the reason why many  
perfer to stay at a safe distance from the path and progress as slow as  
possible (like treading unchartered waters) !!!

Yes. Destiny takes its own course. Bhagavan Ramana had   
the death experience, around mid-July 1896, and He   
could not stay in that state for long. Six weeks went with   
immense pains. Everyday, He went to Meenakshi Temple and cried before 63  
Saints, how long, how long? Destiny fixed it   
as end August 1896. The money came to Him, and He had   
to utter a lie. He left Madurai and reached Tiruvannamalai   
on 1st September 1896. He went inside the Arunachaleswarar   
Temple; It was around 10.45 AM. There were none [!] inside   
the Temple. He went to Arunachala [linga], and embraced   
him. He found an all-engulfing Light. He said: "O Father! I have reported  
as per Your command!" Arunachala took care of Him for 54 years!   
Then, think of His departure! How can He depart? The body   
had to go through a little of prarabdha. He took upon Himself,   
a terrific disease, for which no medicine was available. Devotees tried four  
surgeries on Him. He had to find an excuse for departure! He left as a  
glorious light. One sentence,   
we should all remember. He had said: "Where can I go?   
I am here!" Only His body disappeared. He is very much   
with us, once you repose faith in Him.

My reaction to the original post was that I would help to save the bee.   
While out walking with the dog this morning there was young thrush walking  
near by. It didnt fly away, I wandered whether it was injured. So I waited  
and watched, it hopped over to the longer grass and started pecking, the next  
second it had something in its beak. There was a worm struggling to get free,  
trying to get back into the ground. In this instance I didnt do anything. A  
thought went through my mind that I couldnt help every living creature. I  
carried on with the walk not knowing whether the thrush needed help or whether  
the worm wriggled free.

Dear Paul,   
Well thats all is in our hands, just watch. What else can we do? The one that  
had the thought of whether to save it or leave it or the thought of no being  
able to help all creatures is the Ego's. The Consciousness is least affected  
by all these.   
That which gets affected is only the Ego because its agenda of saving it, not  
saving it, not being able to do anything is affected.   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj, it is very difficult to watch without all sorts of thoughts and  
emotions getting in the way. Even if one sets out to practise Self-enquiry the  
ego rears its head and starts an internal conversation about Self-enquiry,  
which is no good at all. When this happens sometimes I pray to God that he  
will help me to surrender. Thats all I can do and trust it will happen in its  
own time.   
Paul.

Dear Paul,   
Yes surender is the way. In the world every being is created   
and one becomes the food of others. Even human beings   
who are vegetarians have to kill the plants to eat food. A   
fly is eaten by a lizard, a cow by tiger, a tiger by a man etc.,   
This chain continues ever and for ever. We can at best help   
the suffering beings to the extent possible. Suppose we   
save a deer from tiger, the tiger would look at us and ask: Who are you to prevent my food? We have no answer.   
Surrender to God or Guru is the best way. All things   
are done by one Parameswara Sakti. Our job is to stay   
away from thinking that I shall do this or do that.   
Arunachala Siva.

Seriously, they offer encouragement.
