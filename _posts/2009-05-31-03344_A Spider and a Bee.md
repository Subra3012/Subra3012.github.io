## A Spider and a Bee  
Author: sky person          Date: May 31, 2009, 11:24:48 AM

Hello all   
Yesterday in my garden I noticed a Bumble Bee had been caught in a spider's  
web and was frantically trying to   
get free. The spider was watching. Close to this another bee was on a flower  
being free.   
I could have easily intervened and helped the Bee to escape, but i didn't.   
This reminded me of the story of the monk who freed a deer from a tiger's  
grasp, but then realised he had denied the tiger   
his lunch so he gave himself to the tiger, who then ate him.   
Peace sky.

Very good. Everything to it's own fate. Accept everything as it is. The less  
we interfere with nature the better for the world. Left to itself this world  
and all it's creatures manage fantastically. It's only human beings wrong  
interpretations and manipulations that interfere with nature's smooth  
functioning. Let everything be as it is.   
Now my question is : if I see an accident happening on the road before my  
eyes, should I interfere and help the victim or leave the scene without  
letting that affecting me? How is this situation different from the earlier  
one? How do we decide to just witness or to intervene in any situation we  
confront? Invite you all to throw some light on this dilemma.

Bhagavan said that we are free only for choosing to turn toward the Self or  
not, but that as for the rest everything is predestinated since the very  
moment the body is born, even if you save a bee or not from a spider, and  
there is nothing to do about it. What do you say?

Dear siirs   
There is a story goes like that. One scorpian was sinking into the river.  
Seeing this a monk wanted to save it. But he was bitten by scorpian. Still the  
monk   
did not give up. Seeing this action repeatedly, his deciple asked why you are  
helping it bearing the pain. The monk said, it is his tendence to bite whereas   
it is my dharma to save it/ Now we have to decide whether we want to be monk  
or scorpian

Let me put it this way. Suppose I see another man being attacked by a lion.  
Obviously the lion is hungry and trying to get its lunch. As another human  
being, do I try to save the man by killing the lion (with a gun of course) or  
let the lion have its lunch as nature intended? Anyway we end up doing wrong  
to one or the other. Where do we draw the line? Do we interfere only if human  
beings are involved?

Dear sir,   
To save a person if we kill other one is good or bad.This is a question now.  
Well. The whole mahabharatha story is based on this line only. All Gods have  
weapon. why.To save other person. i.e. to save the Dharma. That is why Krishna  
insisted Arjun to kill his cousins. Sometimes we have this dilemma DHARMA  
SHANKATAM.   
We have to listen our heart. Without expectation any reward we have to save  
the person. Rest leave to God.

This is a classic case of "Dharma Sankatam" \- "what to do" "This" or "That".  
If you are impelled to save, then so be it, if you are impelled to leave it,  
then also so be it. Whatever you decide is Ok and acceptable. and one has to  
remember that, one does not decide whether one has to save or not, it is  
already destined. we should never forget that we are only an instrument.   
By saving, do we actually Give Life to the Bumble bee? or what makes us think  
that we are giving food to the Spider?   
Even in this post, it is destined that the Bumble bee be as it is, it is also  
destined that Sky Person be just as he is, without saving it. Nobody did  
anything, or nobody does anything at any time.   
Dot not take the Doership.   
Whatever you do - you don't do   
Whatever you don't do - you actually don't do it   
All the rumble noise about all these is only the Ego's which is non existent  
and has got nothing to do with any thing that happens around us.   
You are not the Doer at any cost at all times!   
Nagaraj

Dear mmohan, skyperson and others,   
There are always two sides of a coin. How to reconcile?   
Bhagavan Ramana says: Whatever one gives to someone else,   
he gives it to himself. When you harm others, in fact, you   
are harming yourself. The situations become different.   
The spider is still in its place most of the times. Hence when   
a prey comes to its net, it has to eat. It does not go out   
much like other insects like butterfly, cockroach etc.,   
Hence it should take its food, that is made available to it.   
The man who met with an accident, needs help. Because,   
he is suffering, may be due to his negilgence or the motorist's   
negilgence. Still help is essential.   
A lion taking a man. Here, man should be saved, because,   
he is in distress. A lion may get some other animals and it   
need not be a human being.   
Everywhere Prarabdha or destiny plays a key role. Bhagavan   
Ramana says: "Praradha will feed you, whether you like it   
or not." The feed may be good food or poison and other miseries.   
Arunachala Siva.

DEar Nagarai ji and Subramaniyan ji   
As it is the prarabda, sometimes we get confused and sometimes we do not and  
carry on the work. But sometimes we do realise that we could have done   
in better way. In this place we feel little disturbed. AT this point, is our  
ego gets disturbed? I think before steping into spirtual studies, we should  
know   
how the ego came in to us, and how and when all it plays its trick. When some  
one says I am suffering, it does mean that there is no real suffering to him   
only his ego is suffering. Is it correct? At that time what is our duty  
towards the person. Ignore him or to help him.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
If you study yourself carefully, you will discover that there is pinch of  
desire for the result. this is the problem which most of us face. We have to  
wipe out/dissolve this salt so that the pure self remains like a Spatika  
without any desire about the outcome. It does not matter what the fruits are  
going to be.   
The Ego gets disturbed only because of this reason alone - having some sort of  
desire about how the outcome has to be.   
In Upadesa Saaram, Ramana has said -   
_kartur äjnayä präpyate phalam   
karma kim param karma tajjadam   
By the will of the Creator, action bears fruit. Is   
action, then, supreme? No, it is inert, unconscious.   
_**   
We don't have any rights whatsoever on our part as to what fruits we are going  
to get.   
 _ **éshvar-ärpitam necchayä krtam   
citta-shodhakam mukti-sädhakam   
That action which is done without personal desire   
and whose fruits are surrendered to the Lord,   
purifies the mind and leads to Liberation.**_   
By consciously praying to oneself that my duty is to only perform actions and  
have no rights on fruits, one will abide in peace. Remember the eternal  
teaching of Bhagawan, whenever you get disturbed -   
**_The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their  
prarabdhakarma. Whatever is destined not to happen will not happen, try as  
you may. Whatever is destined to happen will happen, do what you may to  
prevent it. This is certain. The best course, therefore, is to remain silent.   
_**   
Reflecting thus, the mind-ego will get pacified and abide as peace.   
Before performing any actions consciously telling to ourselves that Now, I  
have only this action to perform, this duty to perform, I will perform it to  
the best of my abilities. I know that I don't have any rights on what I am  
going to get back. But Lord give me the strength to accept whatever you give.  
and at the same time, I also pray Lord to give me strength to bear all  
difficulties.   
By such constant practice in daily life, every moment, the Ego will be trained  
like a Tiger of the circus. It has to be trained.   
Bhagawad Gita also says the same -   
_**karmany evadhikaras te   
ma phalesu kadacana   
ma karma-phala-hetur bhur   
ma te sango 'stv akarmani   
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to  
the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results  
of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.**_   
I have come to understand by my own experiences that Spiritual successes only  
come after this has been mastered.   
Sri Ramana

Dear Ramanaduli & Nagaraj,   
When Bhagavan Ramana was in His last days [ He had pain,   
which should have been unbearable for anyone else], the   
attendants asked Him: "Bhagavan! Is it paining too much?"   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Yes, the body is paining!" He was   
not the body or the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj, beautifully put. But it takes a hell of an effort to master this  
in real life. Many a time we stand at crossroads confused as to what our  
dharma is and worried whether we are commiting a sin by either doing or not  
doing. This dilemma is all the more when you are halfway in the spiritual  
path. A completely materialistic person as well as the jnani has no such  
problems as they are fully comfortable with whatever they do or don't do. As  
it is rightly said in the scriptures, to escape from darkness to light, we  
have to successfully pass through greater darkness or confusion (the dark  
night of the soul?). Only complete faith in God/Guru can take us through  
without getting mad. Again what is right for one person in his path may be  
completely unsuitable for another. Hence each one of us have to find our own  
unique way to salvation.

Dear sirs,   
In hindu tradition, there are so many gods, to grant our wishes. like for  
education, saraswati is there, for money lakshmi is there the list is endless.   
We (I) pray to all these gods, for each one of these grants. That time my mind  
is expecting the result. I cannot sit simply when my family faces   
problem. I pray to God to grant my wishes. If does not take place, then I  
remember all philosophical saysings, It may be easy if you are all alone.   
Sometimes I used to feel if I would be able to talk to Bhagavan I would say,  
how it is difficult to live in the family, seeing the sufferings and read   
all spiritual books. My ego is very strong never admits anything if something  
goes wrong.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
That is why the saints have said pray to one god. Choosing   
different gods for different boons is not correct. Even this   
one god cannot answer your prayers all the time. This is   
where our Prarabdha comes into picture. We should learn   
to accept the pains and sorrows. We should learn not to   
get elated by the pleasures and comforts. This is easier   
said than done. But this is the fact of life. One God is   
sufficient. Saint Manikkavachagar sings in Tiru Thellenam,   
in Tiruvachakam: For the One who does not have even one name and one form,   
Let us pray with one thousand names,   
Play Tiru Thellenam!   
Thellenam is a game for the girls, where they use small   
stones or tamarind seeds and throw them up and catch   
them again.   
Arunachala Siva.
