## A criteria for spiritual progress  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 08, 2010, 03:48:23 PM  
---  
Thinking deeply on a criteria for spiritual progress, I felt that bliss is the  
most dependable criteria.   
The following conditions however need to be met: 1\. The bliss should not be due to sexual instinct, either active or passive.  
This is easily recognized by any person and does not require any special  
training.   
2\. The bliss should not be dependent on any objects like drugs or drinks,  
neither on any events like good news, dreams etc.   
3\. The bliss should not be due to contrasting situations like jumping and  
then resting, going out in hot and then entering in cold etc.   
4\. The bliss should not be generated due to any activities like singing and  
dancing, nor should it stop due to any activities.   
If the above conditions are satisfied, I feel that there is no way bliss can  
come other than realising one's deeper self, realising the Ananda of the Sat-  
Chit-Ananda. Everyone feels Existence (Sat) and Consciousness (Chit) at all  
times. The first two aspects therefore does not serve to indicate spiritual  
progress. However everyone cannot say that I am always in bliss (provided one  
is truthful). Recognition of bliss is tangible and does not require any  
reading of books or other training. There is no need for argumentation and  
logic. Deep within all human being yearns for bliss. If there is no bliss, I  
feel that one should doubt one's spiritual progress, however free one feels  
within.

Dear Silentgreen,   
May I suggest another point of view to consider: Bliss is a reliable criteria only if it is permanent. But if the bliss is  
permanent, there is no need to have any criterias at all -- everything is  
clear. In ANY cases bliss comes it will inevitably go away. So, only  
recognition you are always in bliss but do not notice it can lead you to  
eternal.   
But it's very hard to trust "I am always in bliss", coz body-mind are not in  
bliss. And if one identifys oneself with body-mind it is impossible to  
experience permanent bliss. Here a tricky mind gives one a false prompt: "Even  
a shorttime bliss is OK if it meets certain conditions".   
Shall we trust it? As to me it's better to trust "I am always bliss", even if  
it souds paradoxicaly.   
By the way, why it sounds paradoxically? may be, becouse we got used to  
believe it's impossible. We are thoroughly tought to believe it's impossible  
from our early childhood. But when a realized Master tells you: "It is so" and  
you trust him, all the picture of this world starts changing.

Bliss is a reliable criteria only if it is permanent.  
The four conditions given above are to eliminate the situations where bliss  
obtained will not be permanent. Inspite of not taking recourse to any of the  
external conditions if bliss comes forth from the depth of the self, it can  
only be due to revealation of the deeper self.   
By referring to permanent things, it is not often possible to understand  
progress. For example, our sense of being is permanent throughout our  
lifetime. It does not serve to indicate spiritual progress. Our breathing is  
more or less permanent throughout our lives. It does not indicate spiritual  
progress. But when bliss spontaneously comes from within (without taking  
recourse to external conditions) there is no question of trusting. It is  
revealed within the heart as it is beyond doubt. And it will not come without  
purity of mind and surrender to God.   
I think that Bhagavan and Anadamoyi Maa were always in bliss although they did  
not often show it by singing and dancing. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa gave  
full expression to the bliss since that was the purpose of his incarnation; to  
show to mankind how to milk the cow of divine bliss.

Abidance in non dependent bliss is criteria.   
Abidance in non dependent peace is criteria.   
These lead to permanent Bliss and Peace.   
That is Sat-Chit Anandam.

Four conditions are too less. They are countless: any personal action, I  
think.   
For example, when I come to a lake, sit down and concentrate on water, after  
sometime bliss comes. This bliss is not conditioned by four enlisted causes. I  
repeated this action many times and bliss always comes.   
But this is a temporary experience only and I give it no value. It depends on  
my actions: coming to water, sitting down and concentrating.   
Moreover, if I estimate my 'spiritual growth', I'm already in a trap, for I  
have separated myself from the Whole and try to estimate the 'growth' of this  
separate entity. In this case I just 100% trust my ego.

Bhagavan IS Bliss.  
Quote  
This is plainly an error to imagine Bhagavan and bliss as separate.  
I am in agreement with this. But just for the sake of clarity let us proceed a  
step forward.   
Bhagavan is bliss. Bhagavan and bliss are not separate.   
Then are we separate from Bhagavan?   
If not why don't we experience bliss always?   
If Self is described as "Sat-Chit-Ananda", then if Self is always with us, all  
three of its attributes should be there.   
Sat and Chit is always felt, so there is no question on that. Then why does  
Ananda not there always?   
Does the Self hides some of Its attributes and presents itself?   
Or does It give itself out in installments (like first installment it gives  
out Sat, next Chit and lastly Bliss)?   
If mind is the cause of the problem, then mind is always going to stay, for a  
person has to go for work and earn a livelihood. It is not practically  
possible to live without thoughts in society, because individuals have to  
exchange things in society and sustain each other. If a person is not working  
in society it means somebody else has to work and earn for him (and hence  
think for him) unless he survives on fruits etc from trees.   
Quote  
if I estimate my 'spiritual growth', I'm already in a trap, for I have  
separated myself from the Whole and try to estimate the 'growth' of this  
separate entity.  
I appreciate this outlook. However, does the Whole gives bliss? If yes, it is  
very good. If it does not give permanent bliss, why does'nt it? Is it a  
separate entity from Self? But since it is Whole, it cannot be separate. So  
what is the factor? Is it the mind cover? But mind is always going to be for a  
person living in society? Is it due to Maya covering the Self and we are  
helpless? In that case how is the Maya going to go away? Will it automatically  
vanish? Or do we need to make effort? If we need to make effort, how shall we  
know that our effort is successful?

Living a life with independent bliss, which shows itself up, while seeing a  
bird flying,   
or a steam of water falls, etc., are all manifestations of that bliss, the  
everlasting   
Bliss.

Dear Silentgreen,   
I do not feel I'am competent enough to answer all your questions. I just know  
exactly from my own many years personal experience that to depend on temporary  
bliss is a deadlock.

It is correct. To depend on temporary bliss is a deadlock.   
However it is not exactly a question of dependency, neither a question of  
temporary bliss. The heart yearns for permanent bliss. Most of the spiritual  
aspirants do spiritual practices hoping to get permanent bliss because deep  
within they feel there is a permanent bliss. So it is simple matter of getting  
what the heart really yearns for. A common sense feedback mechanism.   
You (i.e. your heart) asked for permanent bliss? Did you get it, or  
approaching it?   
For bliss people resort to external conditions like drinks, drugs etc. For a  
sincere spiritual aspirant who can discriminate between external conditions,  
this bliss becomes a good indicator. It is like the ego-I. If turned towards  
the world, it will create problems. If turned towards the deeper self during  
self-enquiry, it leads to liberation. So the ego-I seems to be a potentially  
dangerous thing, but any sincere spiritual aspirant will not turn it towards  
the world.   
Bliss is not an ultimate indictor. Non-doership, love, compassion, expansion,  
detachment from "I am the body" idea comes in advanced stages and can serve as  
stronger indicators. But bliss is a sufficiently strong initial indicator and  
will also accompany any other indicators of advanced spiritual stages. Once  
external conditions are identified and eliminated, bliss of a permanant nature  
will not come unless one's vasanas have really decreased and abidance is in  
the deeper self. Also it is very easy to recognize bliss since our heart  
yearns for that.   
Without an indicator there are chances of doubts in the initial stages.   
Lets take some examples.   
1\. While doing self enquiry, one reaches a silence.   
Does it indicate the deeper self?   
If there is no bliss, one needs to doubt it.   
Either one needs to dive deeper and/or eliminate vasanas.   
2\. The scriptures say that we are already the Self. Should we just relax  
then?   
If we are already the Self, why don't we feel the bliss within, what our heart  
yearns for?   
The Self is described as Sat-Chit-Ananda. So that means just sitting idle will  
not do.   
We have to dive deep within and find the bliss.   
3\. Someone says, just recognize the Self within. All is done. We recognized;  
Yes consciousness is there, of the nature of permanent existence. But where is  
the bliss within, which our heart yearns for? So just recognition will not do.  
We have to dive deep within and find the bliss.   
4\. A person undertakes spiritual practices for many years and still feels a  
void within, something missing. He might have been involved with superficial  
activities like reading books, going to temple regularly, mechanically  
performing some rituals etc. Had he initially oriented himself towards bliss  
he would have got the right feedback from within. After all there is no  
downfall for him. Being a sincere spiritual aspirant he is not going to resort  
to drugs and drinks for bliss. Instead he will look for eliminating his  
desires and praying to God, meditating etc. Ultimately he will dive deep  
within himself to find that bliss.

Mind never allows to trust oneSelf, which IS Bliss. Who wants bliss? The mind  
only, which is afraid of suffering. This mind wants to get permanent bliss,  
but agrees on at least temporary as well just for inicial period, does not it?   
It's OK, no problem. Let it desire, it is its nature. But why to be deceived  
with mind's desire? Why not to trust oneSelf that desires nothig, that IS  
everythig.

Quote  
But isn't it that all the imaginative separation is the veil of the bliss?  
This is very true.   
Quote  
Is there a step to be taken forward?  
In spirituality things are subtractive so a step forward should be taken in  
that sense only.   
Quote  
Who wants bliss? The mind only.  
Self is bliss. There is no choice on that. Mind does not separately create any  
desire for bliss.   
Quote  
If there is "me" bliss is always temporary.  
In waking state there is individuality. What is the alternative for  
individuality to exist without "me"? Or do you mean in waking state permanent  
bliss is not possible.   
Now this fact that "Self is Bliss", many many sages have  
understood/experienced and declared. Many other people who are also living do  
not experience bliss like saints. Why? So it is said that there is the veil of  
maya. So spiritual practices are undertaken to remove this veil. Then what  
becomes the indicator that the veil is getting removed? When the original  
thing shines as it is in all its purity. Self being bliss itself should be  
revealed as bliss itself. In that sense bliss becomes the indicator.   
If I smear a white cloth with colors and give it to you for washing, what is  
the indicator that the dirt is removed? The cloth will shine as white again.  
Plain and simple. If the cloth is smeared in a very bad way such that the  
original color is totally hidden, then somebody has to tell what was the  
original color. Otherwise a blackish color when partially washed looks  
brownish and one may think that the original color of the cloth was brown and  
leave half-washing. The sages have told us that the Self is Bliss. Now they  
must have felt it as Bliss and therefore declared so.   
Spiritual practices are not exactly analogous to cloth-washing but this is  
just for the purpose of illustration. I know the objection to be raised here.  
It is: Who will do the washing? If the mind does the washing, will it not add dirt  
instead of removing it? Self is always white. It is the desire to wash by the  
mind that makes it dirty.   
Let it remain open for an honest introspection along these lines.   
\- Self IS Bliss. So it must be "felt" as Bliss only, always. Do we "feel" it  
as it is, its true nature?   
\- If we just be still, will it be "felt" as Bliss, its true nature?   
\- Does spiritual practices add dirt of mind over the Self?   
Saints have been doing spiritual practices for ages. Even to declare that  
"Self is Bliss", sages have done spiritual practices. The truths of the Vedas  
have taken centuries to be established. Have the sages increased the veil over  
the Self by doing spiritual practices?   
(Do not treat it as serious arguments but joint discussions, not like bull-  
fight but bulls grazing together. I am not saying we are bulls, this is just  
for the purpose of illustration)

very interessting topic.   
you know that line of buddha: "there is no way to happiness, happiness is the  
way"   
I understant it in two ways...   
number one is: it is allready there   
number two is: if we feel miserable along the way we will end up feeling  
miserable (permanent)   
if we feel happy and good along the way, we will end up feeling happy  
(permanent)   
now both ways lead nowhere   
so what did the buddha mean?

The Self, as silentgreen said, is Bliss. Mind is not bliss. But   
Mind wants bliss, in million odd ways, (like women, tobacco,   
ice creams, picnics, cinemas, even books) and misses out the   
true bliss. In Sanskrit, these small blisses are santosham or   
happiness and Sukam or Anandam is the true Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

The second way in "happiness is the way", seems to have been used figuratively  
like a highway.   
A highway supports all vehicles which run over it, itself remaining the  
substratum.   
The figurative highway is such that it is underlying all the roads.   
So there is no way to reach the highway, since if you want to reach the  
highway you are trying to reach the highway by walking over it.   
Then what is misery?   
Looks like a vehicle which broke down, tyre punctures or the highway getting  
covered with snow.   
In all the cases the highway is still there.

Quote  
Or do you mean in waking state permanent bliss is not possible.  
Of course not. In any state nothing permanent possible. Only temporary.  
Otherwise it is not a state. Bhagavan was not a person in states. He is  
Bliss, he is impersonal consciousness.   
Quote  
\- Self IS Bliss. So it must be "felt" as Bliss only, always. Do we "feel" it  
as it is, its true nature?  
No. It must not be felt, because It IS Bliss. It is not an object of  
perception.   
Quote  
\- Does spiritual practices add dirt of mind over the Self?  
What people call spiritual practices can be very different. I don't think  
self-inquiry can add dirt of mind over the Self... though if a person try  
hard, nothing's impossible:)   
What is the dirt of mind? Distrust to the Self. Mind dare not to admit even  
a hint that You Are the Self. Really. Even for 1%. Why to feel Bliss, You  
Are Bliss. Believe? Allow this thought to settle in mind. What tries to push  
it away?   
Quote  
Saints have been doing spiritual practices for ages. Even to declare that  
"Self is Bliss", sages have done spiritual practices. The truths of the Vedas  
have taken centuries to be established. Have the sages increased the veil over  
the Self by doing spiritual practices?  
Who told you about those saints, sages and ages? About maya, Vedas and  
spiritual practices? Who are you? Was it really told to You or to imaginary  
separate entity? Aren't you the One who created all this? If you say I am the  
Self trust what you say. Really. Once only.   
Permanent Bliss  is a kind of bliss that can disappear only with I am,  
the beingness itself. Correct? If such a bliss recognized, yes, it is a sign  
of spiritual progress.   
Quote  
Do not treat it as serious arguments but joint discussions  
Yes, yes. It is a simple discussion only. Just exchange of personal views.  
It's very nice of you. My great respect.

Mind wants bliss, in million odd ways, (like women, tobacco,   
ice creams, picnics, cinemas, even books) and misses out the   
true bliss.  
If it's allowed to quate Nisargadatta: "The ambitions of the so-called Yogis are preposterous. A man's desire for a  
woman is innocence itself compared to the lusting for an everlasting personal  
bliss. The mind is a chit. The more pious it seems, the worse the betrayal"  
\-- from "I Am That" chapter 63.

No. It must not be felt, because It IS Bliss. It is not an object of  
perception.  
It IS Bliss, i.e. We are Bliss.   
So why do Self-Enquiry? What is lacking?

Having attained the Self, one can never desire anything since he   
has no mind-body consciousness. Such a desire, if at all it happens,   
is the desire of the Self. Kaduveli Siddhar married a dancer, begot a child  
etc., He did that without any desire, but only to satisfy the desire of the  
dancer.   
*   
Since we are all the Self, why should there be self enquiry at all?   
The Self enquiry is only to remove the dirt that hides the Self.   
The Self enquiry is basically an enquiry into the nature of non-Self.   
It is Anatma Vicharam. Atma does not need any Vicharam because,   
where is the 'second' to do Vichara?   
Arunachala Siva.

Who is this "we"? If this "we" has no doubt in "We are Bliss", trust it  
completely, question of self-inquiry does not arise.   
If I do not feel "the world inside me" but feel myself as a separate entity  
which belongs to the world, self-inquiry helps to figure out what is what.

Dear Vladimir,   
This is what the first and second verse of ULLadu Narpadu tells   
us. We have seen the Verse 1. We shall see the Verse 2 soon.   
Arunachala Siva.

If everything is bliss, always, why does the "we" ever have a doubt that it is  
not bliss?   
And self-enquiry is needed to find what is what.   
After all, the "we" never has any doubt that it exists, and no enquiry is  
required to find that.

Thanks everyone for their inputs. It was a fruitful discussion. Let us end it  
here itself.   
People have different ways of expressions but deep within is in touch with the  
same essence.
