291: Within my heart He kindled, as true realization, the auspicious flame of  
divine silence, growing   
ever more intense until the hostility of ego grew weak and disappeared. Know  
that there, in the   
state of all-embracing realization of the Self that fills the heart like the  
empty sky, the knowledge   
that involves knowing objectively is a mere illusion.   
236: Like fire rising up from the root, the supreme state of divine silence shone  
with a beautiful radiance   
within my heart as the awareness of being, driving out the imaginary concepts  
of time, space, and doership,   
and revealing to me my very nature as peace, abundant and supreme.   
378: Through the awareness in which I gave myself up as a prey to You, I have  
experienced in my heart final   
liberation, the grace of divine silence, as my greatest birth right, that  
which is most deeply to be desired.   
You it is I cherish as the good fortune that is my own self.   
137: Sunk in darkness, my heart had become a battlefield through its entrenched  
self conceit. But when the   
Lord brought me to dwell in peace as His grace-bestowing feet, I gained the  
state of transcendental realization*, as one of the wise.   
(*Jnana Samadhi)   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
