## Guru Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 23, 2009, 07:19:27 AM

The following are some of the verses that describe the word Guru.   
The letter 'Gu' denotes darkness, the letter 'Ru' denotess the remover of  
darkness. Brahman who is capable of swallowing up ignorance is certainly the  
Guru. (Sloka 44)   
'Gukara' means the diseases of birth and death. 'Rukara' means the destroyer  
of births and deaths. One account of the power of destroying the disease of  
birth and death, the teacher is known by the significant name, 'Guru'. (Sloka  
45)   
The letter 'Gu' denotes that he is above the three Gunas and 'Ru'   
denotes that he is beyond forms. Because he is free from gunas and forms he  
is called 'Guru.' (Sloka 46)   
The first syllable 'Gu' creates or makes manifest Maya and the gunas.   
'Ru' is Para Brahman that removes both Maya and delusion, viz.,   
I am the body, I am the mind etc., (Sloka 47)   
Thus, the state of the Guru (Gurupada) is great and sublime, very difficult  
for even devas to attain and worthy of worship by Garuda,   
serpents, Gandharvas, Siddhas and the celestials. (Sloka 48)   
Guru Tattva is supreme. There is nothing greater than Guru. One   
should worship his Guru and dedicate himself -- body, mind and soul -- unto  
the Guru. (Sloka 49)

Dear Munagala,   
Welcome to the Forum. We look forward to your active participation.   
Your name reminds me the great Mungala Venkatramaiah, the compiler of Talks  
that gives wealth of information on four years of   
Bhagavan's Life and Teachings in Arunachala. The compiler became   
later, Swami Ramananda Saraswati.   
Arunachala Siva.
