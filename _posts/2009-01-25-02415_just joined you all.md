## Eight Heroic Deeds of Siva  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 19, 2009, 07:52:28 AM  
---  
Siva performed eight mighty deeds of punishing the demons or the erring devas  
in eight places. These are called Ashta Veerasthanam.   
This is described by Tirumoolar, (one of the 63 Siva Saints), in his   
famous 3000-verse book called Tirumantiram, in Second Tantra.   
Tirumoolar was a Sivaraja Yogi, who lived in Chidambaram. This book is full  
of raja yoga details and details of Saiva Siddhanta philosophy.   
1\. Destruction of Antaka, the death god.   
Antaka, the Asura   
Frightening unto God of Death   
Whose name he bore,   
Armed with boons divine   
Harassed the worlds all, --   
Thus Celestial Beings moaned to the Lord   
And the Lord   
Lifting high His trident sharp   
Pierced him straight to certain death.   
(This happened in Tirukoyilur, near Chengalpattu, in Tamil Nadu)   
2\. Punishment to Daksha   
Daksha, the son of Brahma, fatally erred   
Deadly was his sin,   
To defy the Lord's primacy;   
And the Lord smote his head   
And consigned it to flames   
And then bethought,   
'Such like are needed for this world,   
An object lesson to serve,'   
And so, fixed a sheep's head to the trunk   
Thus let him be.   
(This happened in Tirupariyalur, in Tamil Nadu)   
3. How the Lord punished Brahma and Vishnu   
All pervasive are the Lord's feet   
All worlds they support   
All life they sustain;   
That this the Heavenly Beings may know   
In mounting anger He nipped Brahma's head   
And in the skull drained Achutha's blood   
When they His supremacy defied.   
(This happened in Tirukandiyur, near Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu)   
4\. How the Lord destroyed Jalandhara   
The Lord pervades all,   
My heart too He fills with joy,   
He spoke the Vedas and scriptures all,   
Him -- the haughty Jalandhara challenged in duel,   
And the Lord with his toe marked a circle   
And into it He saw the monster's final end.   
(This happened in Tiruvirkudi, near Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu)   
5\. How the Lord burnt the three cities, Tripura   
The Primal Lord,   
Why on His matted crimson locks   
Wears Ganga's water sacred,   
He destroyed the Cities Three   
\-- Thus say the ignorant,   
The three cities are the Triple Impurities*   
It is them He burnt   
Who Knows his truth thereof?   
(This happened in Tiru Adigai. Saint Tirumoolar says that the burning of  
three cities is the burning of three malas, ego, karma   
and maya.)   
6\. The Lord Unsloughed the Elephant   
They in the Fires Three   
The sacrificial blaze roared high;   
And from insaide it arose,   
An Elephant of Evil Power,   
Whose hide the Lord peeled,   
Why the Lord did it, they know not,   
Seeking to rival the Lord's might   
The Heaven's beings performed it homa unholy   
And all those wh from that fire arose,   
The Lord smote for the very fire to consume.   
(This happened in Tiruvazhulur. This is the story of Darkua forest   
sages.)   
7\. The Lord scorched the God of Death, Yama.   
The Kundalini Fire coiled in Mooladhara   
Upward He coursed it to Hollow on top;   
That Fiery Yoga Way, He scorched the God of Death   
That was at Kadavoor, the holy shrine below.   
(This happened in Tirukadaiyur, near Mayiladuthurai, in Tamil Nadu. The Sage  
Markandeya, who was threatened by Yama, was saved by the killing of Yama, by  
Uma's kicking with her leg. Markandeya held on to the Siva linga and got  
protected. Siva kicked Yama, with his left leg, and Uma is on his left, Uma  
is said to have kicked Yama.   
Further, the allegory of Kundalini is only to indirectly mention about Uma.)   
8. The Lord vanquished Kama, Manmatha, the God of Love.   
The Lord was seated in yoga   
His thoughts stilled in meditation deep;   
Lo! there came Kama   
To tempt the Lord with shafts of love   
But the Love-god's wiles, the Lord foiled in Yoga way;   
This He did at Korukkai, the shrine divine.   
(This happened in Tiru Korukkai, in Tamil Nadu. Saying that the Lord  
vanquished Manamatha through Yoga way, indicates how Yogis can overcome lust,  
through their raja yoga marga.   
(Tirumantiram is a wonderful book and many verses have got inner layers of  
meaning, alluded to sivaraja yoga marga. There is only onetime edition of  
the translation of this book, (written by Dr. B. Natarajan) and published by  
Sri Ramakrishana Math, Chennai in 1991, under the auspices of Dr. N.  
Mahalingam, an industrialist from Coimbatore. Dr. Mahalingam himself was a  
follower of Siva tradition.)

## Guru Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 21, 2009, 09:47:40 AM  
---  
It is by the grace of the Guru that Brahma, Vishnu and Siva became   
capable of performing their respective duties -- creation, preservation and  
dissolution. (Sloka 103)   
Even the devas, the kinnaras, gandharvas, pitris, yakshas and sages   
like Tumburu and others do not know the right technique of service   
to the Guru. (Sloka 104)   
People who are well versed in Tarkasastra, in the Vedic chandas,   
knowers of divine beings like goods, Karmavadins, people well   
versed in worldly sacrifices -- none of them knows the Guru Tattva   
in its entirety. (Sloka 105)   
On account of great egoism, pride, power of Tapas and education   
people roam about in this world like pots in a Persian wheel.   
(Sloka 106)   
Neither those who perform great sacrifices, nor Yogis, nor those   
who practisse severe austerities are liberated without the true   
knowledge of Guru Tattva. (Sloka 107)   
Those who are averse to the service of the preceptor, cannot expect   
to be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, Samsara, even if   
they are Gandharvas, Pitris, Yakshas, Charanas, Rishis, Siddhas   
or Devas. (Sloka 108)   
(Source: Guru Gita. Pub: Divine Life Society. Uttaranchal.)

## Guru Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 23, 2009, 07:19:27 AM  
---  
The following are some of the verses that describe the word Guru.   
The letter 'Gu' denotes darkness, the letter 'Ru' denotess the remover of  
darkness. Brahman who is capable of swallowing up ignorance is certainly the  
Guru. (Sloka 44)   
'Gukara' means the diseases of birth and death. 'Rukara' means the destroyer  
of births and deaths. One account of the power of destroying the disease of  
birth and death, the teacher is known by the significant name, 'Guru'. (Sloka  
45)   
The letter 'Gu' denotes that he is above the three Gunas and 'Ru'   
denotes that he is beyond forms. Because he is free from gunas and forms he  
is called 'Guru.' (Sloka 46)   
The first syllable 'Gu' creates or makes manifest Maya and the gunas.   
'Ru' is Para Brahman that removes both Maya and delusion, viz.,   
I am the body, I am the mind etc., (Sloka 47)   
Thus, the state of the Guru (Gurupada) is great and sublime, very difficult  
for even devas to attain and worthy of worship by Garuda,   
serpents, Gandharvas, Siddhas and the celestials. (Sloka 48)   
Guru Tattva is supreme. There is nothing greater than Guru. One   
should worship his Guru and dedicate himself -- body, mind and soul -- unto  
the Guru. (Sloka 49)   
(Source: Guru Gita. Pub. Divine Life Society. Uttaranchal.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Munagala,   
Welcome to the Forum. We look forward to your active participation.   
Your name reminds me the great Mungala Venkatramaiah, the compiler of Talks  
that gives wealth of information on four years of   
Bhagavan's Life and Teachings in Arunachala. The compiler became   
later, Swami Ramananda Saraswati.   
Arunachala Siva.
