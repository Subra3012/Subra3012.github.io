## Where the Eyes may lie  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 08, 2009, 08:19:12 AM  
---  
Fool, I am, unsafe   
and loud, when faced   
by loveliness, whose shine   
creates these shadows,   
which appear to be   
the x-rays of the horrid side of me.   
If it were possible, I'd hide   
behind a mask   
whcih has no holes for eyes,   
because it's so much safer   
when there is no one to see.   
But here outside, I laugh   
at these dramatic thoughts that wed   
these visions   
of an overactive head.   
For all the time   
the me, that chose these roles   
is seen, by I.   
who merely moves about   
so deeply touched by all it finds   
that no words need come out.   
(Source: Mountain Path, Jan-Mar 2007. A poem by Kevan Myers.)

## Why was Krishna weeping?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 08, 2009, 08:32:02 AM

Krishna is a god incarnate. He gave Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna,   
and wanted him to be a Stita-Prajna. However, on the evening   
of the war, when Abhimanyu was killed, Arjuna wept inconsolably.   
Krishna was looking at him, wondering, "What a fool he is! What   
is the use of giving Gita to him?" He became thoughtful for a while.   
Then, Krishna started weeping with a huge cry. Arjuna was dumbfounded. "Why  
this chap weeping?" He told Krishna: " Alright, I am Abhimanyu's father, so I  
was weeping. You are only his uncle.   
Why are you weeping more than me?" Then Krishna asked him: "O Arjuna, you were suffering from acute stomach pain a few days back, due to  
tape-worms in your stomach. You were weeping. Then I gave you some medicine.  
The tape worms got killed in your stomach and you became alright. Why did you  
not weep then for the death of tape worms?"   
Arjuna said: "Why should I weep for tape worms?"   
Krishna said: "Look! The tape worms are your own. They were born in your stomach and were  
living happily. They are more owned by you,   
because, you created them. But Abhimanyu, was created not by   
you alone, but by union with Draupadi and so Abhimany was only   
your own partly. When you were not weeping for death of tape worms, you are  
now weeping for Abhimanyu! What a wonder!"   
Arjuna understood and then told Krishna: "Ok, I understand now.   
I should not have wept for Abhimanyu also. I am sorry. But how   
come, you were weeping?"   
Krishna said smilingly: "I wept because all my Gita became a total waste, when sorrows surrounded you!  
What is the use of such Gita? So I wept more than you!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Great information   
Does it shows that the great Arjun lost all the Gita because he was one among  
the humans or whatever takes place on earth is attach or bounded to sorrow.   
When Bhagavan Ramana's mother passed away, Bhagavan didn't feld sorrow as he  
said what has to happen will happen and what should not, will not.   
Does this tells as that there is a difference between humans that being Arjun  
a warrior and Ramana a rishi.   
Does it say that Gita is not require for a yogi

Dear Subramanian,   
Its a beautiful story, enjoyed it. I liked the typical Krishna Attitude and  
his response to Arjuna. Its his own unique style of teaching.   
There is a small correction to your post. Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and  
**Subhadra** and not Arjuna and Draupadi.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
You are correct. When a Jnani knows about the Self, there is no   
need for any reading, leave alone Gita. Bhagavan Ramana says   
in Who am I?: "Since the end-advice of all spiritual books is only   
destruction/control of mind, what is the use of reading books   
endlessly?" The Self is beyond book-learning. But people like   
us, including Arjuna, forget the purport of spiritual books, at   
the times of crisis. Like the parrot which was always chanting   
Krishna...Krishna, but when confronted by a ferocious cat, started   
crying: Ayyo, ayyo..!   
Bhagavan Ramana never needed any books. All the reading and writing He did  
later, was for the sake of others. He also found from   
there that what He had experienced and what was explained by   
Sankara were one and the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj Garu,   
AS subramanian garu said people like us forget our real nature quite often so  
it is suggested to read gita and bhagavan books daily and get the essence.   
Bhagavan Ramana himself suggested to read gita daily in one of the talks.   
In Bhaja Govindam Text 21 it is written   
Quote  
TEXT 21   
bhagavad giitaa kijnchidadhiitaa   
gangaa jalalava kanikaapiitaa   
sakridapi yena muraari samarchaa   
kriyate tasya yamena na charchaa   
Let a man read but a little from the Bhagavad-Gita, drink just a drop of water  
from the Ganga, worship Murari (Krishna) just once. He then will have no  
altercation with Yama (the lord of death).

was weeping. You are only his uncle.   
Why are you weeping more than me?" Then Krishna asked him: "O Arjuna, you were suffering from acute stomach pain a few days back, due to  
tape-worms in your stomach. You were weeping. Then I gave you some medicine.  
The tape worms got killed in your stomach and you became alright. Why did you  
not weep then for the death of tape worms?"   
Arjuna said: "Why should I weep for tape worms?"   
Krishna said: "Look! The tape worms are your own. They were born in your stomach and were  
living happily. They are more owned by you,   
because, you created them. But Abhimanyu, was created not by   
you alone, but by union with Draupadi and so Abhimany was only   
your own partly. When you were not weeping for death of tape worms, you are  
now weeping for Abhimanyu! What a wonder!"   
Arjuna understood and then told Krishna: "Ok, I understand now.   
I should not have wept for Abhimanyu also. I am sorry. But how   
come, you were weeping?"   
Krishna said smilingly: "I wept because all my Gita became a total waste, when sorrows surrounded you!  
What is the use of such Gita? So I wept more than you!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Great information   
Does it shows that the great Arjun lost all the Gita because he was one among  
the humans or whatever takes place on earth is attach or bounded to sorrow.   
When Bhagavan Ramana's mother passed away, Bhagavan didn't feld sorrow as he  
said what has to happen will happen and what should not, will not.   
Does this tells as that there is a difference between humans that being Arjun  
a warrior and Ramana a rishi.   
Does it say that Gita is not require for a yogi

Dear Subramanian,   
Its a beautiful story, enjoyed it. I liked the typical Krishna Attitude and  
his response to Arjuna. Its his own unique style of teaching.   
There is a small correction to your post. Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and  
**Subhadra** and not Arjuna and Draupadi.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
You are correct. When a Jnani knows about the Self, there is no   
need for any reading, leave alone Gita. Bhagavan Ramana says   
in Who am I?: "Since the end-advice of all spiritual books is only   
destruction/control of mind, what is the use of reading books   
endlessly?" The Self is beyond book-learning. But people like   
us, including Arjuna, forget the purport of spiritual books, at   
the times of crisis. Like the parrot which was always chanting   
Krishna...Krishna, but when confronted by a ferocious cat, started   
crying: Ayyo, ayyo..!   
Bhagavan Ramana never needed any books. All the reading and writing He did  
later, was for the sake of others. He also found from   
there that what He had experienced and what was explained by   
Sankara were one and the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj Garu,   
AS subramanian garu said people like us forget our real nature quite often so  
it is suggested to read gita and bhagavan books daily and get the essence.   
Bhagavan Ramana himself suggested to read gita daily in one of the talks.   
In Bhaja Govindam Text 21 it is written   
Quote  
TEXT 21   
bhagavad giitaa kijnchidadhiitaa   
gangaa jalalava kanikaapiitaa   
sakridapi yena muraari samarchaa   
kriyate tasya yamena na charchaa   
Let a man read but a little from the Bhagavad-Gita, drink just a drop of water  
from the Ganga, worship Murari (Krishna) just once. He then will have no  
altercation with Yama (the lord of death).

is the use of giving Gita to him?" He became thoughtful for a while.

said what has to happen will happen and what should not, will not.   
Does this tells as that there is a difference between humans that being Arjun  
a warrior and Ramana a rishi.   
Does it say that Gita is not require for a yogi

Dear Subramanian,   
Its a beautiful story, enjoyed it. I liked the typical Krishna Attitude and  
his response to Arjuna. Its his own unique style of teaching.   
There is a small correction to your post. Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and  
**Subhadra** and not Arjuna and Draupadi.   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M   
You are correct. When a Jnani knows about the Self, there is no   
need for any reading, leave alone Gita. Bhagavan Ramana says   
in Who am I?: "Since the end-advice of all spiritual books is only   
destruction/control of mind, what is the use of reading books   
endlessly?" The Self is beyond book-learning. But people like   
us, including Arjuna, forget the purport of spiritual books, at   
the times of crisis. Like the parrot which was always chanting   
Krishna...Krishna, but when confronted by a ferocious cat, started   
crying: Ayyo, ayyo..!   
Bhagavan Ramana never needed any books. All the reading and writing He did  
later, was for the sake of others. He also found from   
there that what He had experienced and what was explained by   
Sankara were one and the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks for the correction. Both Bheema and Arjuna have got moe than one  
wife. There was a confusion.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj Garu,   
AS subramanian garu said people like us forget our real nature quite often so  
it is suggested to read gita and bhagavan books daily and get the essence.   
Bhagavan Ramana himself suggested to read gita daily in one of the talks.   
In Bhaja Govindam Text 21 it is written   
Quote  
TEXT 21   
bhagavad giitaa kijnchidadhiitaa   
gangaa jalalava kanikaapiitaa   
sakridapi yena muraari samarchaa   
kriyate tasya yamena na charchaa   
Let a man read but a little from the Bhagavad-Gita, drink just a drop of water  
from the Ganga, worship Murari (Krishna) just once. He then will have no  
altercation with Yama (the lord of death).
