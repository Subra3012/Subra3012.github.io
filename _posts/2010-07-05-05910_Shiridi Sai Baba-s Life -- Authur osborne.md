## TAT TVAM ASI Shiridi Sai Baba's Life -- Authur osborne

Authur Osborne [i guess i have got the spelling correct.] is a devotee of  
Ramana.   
he has written a very small but excellent biography of Shiridi Sai Baba.   
Its a very nice work.   
I was going through the book where he explained a nice story.   
Ramana's devotee went to Ramana and he was supposed to go somewhere and was  
worried if it might rain. Ramana looked at the sky and saw the clouds and  
said, it may not rain. and indeed it did not rain.   
In a similar scenario, Sai Baba explictly asks the clouds to stop raining!   
the book is really nice to read.

Dear srkudai,   
Once a mantra vadi came and told the people that Shirdi Baba was   
only a fake. He will accept him (Baba) if he could do one siddhic   
work that he is able to do. He and some Baba devotees went to the   
mosque. There, inside they found, that Baba's legs, hands, trunk   
etc., had been lying separately in various places inside the Mosque!   
Some were even afraid that he had been murdered!   
Once Shirdi Baba stopped the incoming hurricane into the town,   
by looking at the fast moving mind and making a hoomkara. The   
hurricane did not touch the town.   
I constantly find in his life story, that Baba always indicated Malik   
or God as in Heavens. Allah Ooopar hai. Sabko Malik oopar hai.   
Thus he considered himself as a great bhakta, with total surrender.   
But Bhagavan Ramana said You are the Malik. You are the Allah.   
There is no duality between God and the Jiva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sai baba also was purely non-dualistic in his approach.   
He was perhaps more outgoing kind of a person.   
It is said that there are two types of approaches.   
madhukar vritti [like a honey bee, suck honey from everyone whom you meet or  
happen to come across]   
and   
ajagar vritti [like a python, lie as if dormant. .. but if someone approaches  
near enough, he gets totally consumed [   
Ramana seems to have depicted the second way.   
it is said that after realization a person can take the attitude of a child, a  
stone, a mad man etc. Ramana perhaps took the attitude of Arunachala. .. still  
like a mountain. and Ramakrishna took the attitude of a child and some times a  
mad man. and Sai Baba or Seshadri swami took the attitude of mad men!
