## What does Bhagavan mean to me?

Wolter A. Keers writes in the Birth Centenary Volume of Bhagavan   
(1980): "What has Bhagavan meant to me, and what does He will mean to me?" I find  
that it is impossible to give a neat answer to this   
question.   
The first thing, perhaps, is that He opened my heart. Immediately   
when I saw Him, even from a distance, I recognized that this was   
what I had been looking for. But when I say that this was 'radiating',   
all-penetrating and all-overthrowing love striking me with the power   
of lightning, I know that only those who had the same experience   
will know what I mean. To anybody else, this is all a verbiage, at   
best, creating an image of someone very magnificent.   
Inside and outside the ashrams in the world, crowds of people   
put on their face saying, "Oh, how marvelous, such a Maharshi,   
such a wonderful teaching."   
Beware, let us face it. In the eyes of common sense, an appearance   
like Sri Ramana Maharshi is the embodiment of the most outrageous   
and perhaps even dangerous lunacy that man could think of!   
Well, Sri Ramana Maharshi was the Unimaginable, and therefore   
the Indescribable.   
Perhaps it is after all, not such a blessing to India that in that   
country (and there is no country I love and respect more than   
India), one can believe and say all the right things without being   
locked up. For it makes it possible to repeat the right words   
and remain fast asleep. But if you live in London or Melbourne   
or Ottawa or Amsterdam, and you go to baker early in the morning   
and you tell him, "Of course, I was never born!" and you repeat   
it to the green grocer and to a policeman and to a doctor, I would   
like to see how long you still roam about free in the streets of   
such cities, (without being taken custody by police!).   
It is perhaps not such an undivided blessing that the one whom   
some of us regard as their master has become so accepted and   
respected. For to go to the Asramam and to read the Talks with   
Ramana Maharshi, requires no guts these days.   
But to see what He meant; that you, fool, are one big bankruptcy;   
that.....

I found this from David Godman's interview on Nisargadatta Maharaj.   
 "Then he glared at me (David) and added, 'Don't waste your time giving spiritual talks until you are enlightened yourself, until you know from direct experience what you are talking about. **Otherwise you will end up like that Wolter Keers. '  
 Wolter Keers was a Dutch advaita teacher who toured around Europe, giving lectures on advaita and yoga in at least three different languages. **He was a very fluent and informative teacher and he used to come to see Maharaj regularly. Every time he came, Maharaj would shout at him, telling him he wasn 't enlightened, and that he shouldn't set himself up as a teacher until he was.** I got the message. I have never given a public talk since then.   
And this is from Osho: "The crowd that surrounded Beedie Baba was also of the  
same quality... rickshaw wallahs waiting for their passengers, sitting by the  
side of Beedie Baba. **And when he said he would not speak to anybody unless  
it was this Dutchman... So he spoke to the Dutchman, who has now compiled  
books on Beedie Baba. Now in India it is almost parrot-like, but to the  
Westerner it seems to be a tremendous revelation -- when Beedie Baba said,  
"Aham brahmasmi; I am God, I am that" the young Dutchman immediately wrote a  
book: I AM THAT!** Because for the West, spirituality is a foreign affair,  
just as for the East, science is a foreign affair. !   
I know that he is speaking aobut Wolter Keers, because he translated I Am That  
in dutch. So he seemed to be a good student of Nisargadatta until he  
proclaimed to be enlightened himself and Nisargadatta went ballistic over  
that.

Dear Joey,   
I read your post and noted the contents. These anecdotes of   
Nisargadatta Maharaj and Osho, I have not heard before.   
For that matter, it was the practice of Nisargadatta to criticize   
some of the devotees of Bhagavan Ramana. I do not know why he should have  
done that. If you read how Wolter Keers laid his life, you will be surprised.   
He lived in his home for some time. (I do not know much about   
his European tours as well). He became silent. He had only   
Bhagavan's photo in his room. One evening, he called his friends   
for a tea. When it was over, he said: Okay, let me leave. He   
prostrated before Bhagavan's photograph and did not rise up!   
This is again from David Godman.   
Regarding Osho, I never want to react. He had an aids-carrying   
body, 364 Rolls Royces and zero self knowledge. That is all   
his achievements. He spoke very badly about Ramana Himself.   
Please read David Godman's one of the recent articles in his blog.   
Bhagavan Ramana has once said that when a seeker leaves his   
body, after being unconscious and without combing back from   
unconsciousness or coma, he would not have been liberated.   
Nisargadatta left his body, after being unconscious for sometime,   
without coming back to consciousness. If it is blasphemy, I am   
sorry.   
Arunachala Siva.

No comments on Nissarga   
But Osho clearly does not understand the Truth.

Hey, I agree with you about Osho (for the most part). I only quoted him  
because according to the quote it seemed that Nisargadatta saw great potential  
in Wolter Keers.   
And Nisargadatta had enormous respect towards Bhagavan. He once said to  
Ganesan: "I never had a chance to prostrate to your great-uncle Ramana  
Maharshi, so I am prostrating to you instead. This is my prostration to him."   
He also said that one of his few regrets in life was that he never met  
Bhagavan in person.

Dear Amiatall,   
For someone to be a jnani, he should first and the foremost, have understood  
the Truth!   
Osho does not qualify this itself.   
he has not understood the Truth.   
Nissargadatta passes it, beyond all traces of doubt. But somehow i feel, his  
teachings are not properly presented at certain places.   
Love!   
Silence

some of the devotees of Bhagavan Ramana.  
Nisargadatta seemed often harsh to people but it didn't matter at all to him  
wheter they were christians, jews, hindus, buddhists or devotees of Bhagavan.

Famous american Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield described his experience with  
Nisargadatta Maharaj like this: "Being with Nisargadatta gave me the deepest  
experience that I have ever had, of closeness to a human being who was truly  
free. And that freedom was filled with love and aliveness and spontaneity and  
fearlesness and place of absolute stillness beyond all of that. He also said: "Part of what made it so extraordinary to be with Nisargadatta, was to be with  
someone who wanted nothing from you. I have never in my life been with other  
person who wanted less from me or anybody. And in that 'not wanting' there was  
a sense of tremendous freedom and tremendous love."   
And this comes from a man who has met countless saints and sages and even  
spent time in Thailand's forest monastery with legendary Ajahn Chah.
