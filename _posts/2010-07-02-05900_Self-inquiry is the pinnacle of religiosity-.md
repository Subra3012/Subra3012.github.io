If the ego identifies itself with the subtle mind, as in dream, the   
perceptions are subtle also. But in sleep there are no perceptions.   
Was there not the ego still? Unless it was, there cannot be the   
memory of having slept. Who was it that slept? You did not say in   
your sleep that you slept. You say it now in your wakeful state. The   
ego therefore is the same in wakefulness, dream and sleep. Find   
out the underlying Reality behind these states. That is the Reality   
underlying these. _ **In that state there is Being alone. There is no you,   
nor I, nor he; no present, nor past, nor future. It is beyond time and   
space, beyond expression.**_

Dear Nagaraj,   
It is the daily glimpse for the mind, which curls up in the Self to   
have a foretaste of the Self. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman   
says it is the drowning in Svatma Tirtham, for a few hours every   
day, a gift of God to all beings.   
Maandukya Upanishad describes it in verse 5: That is the state of deep sleep wherein the sleeper does not   
desire any objects nor does he see any dream. This third quarter   
is the Prajna whose sphere is deep sleep, in whom all experiences become  
unified or undifferentiated, who is verily, a mass of Consciousness entire,  
who is full of Bliss, and who experiences   
Bliss, and who is the path leading to the knowledge of the other two states.   
Arunachala Siva.

It is only when the mind dies, God with form disappears.   
AAMM 59: When I melted away and merged in you, my refuge, you stood there naked, O  
Arunachala   
AAMM 91: In the house of open space; where there is neither night nor day, come let us  
enjoy ourselves, O Arunachala   
The world is in the mind. When the mind is in the heart, the world disappears  
in pure awareness. In the state of pure awareness, the Heart is one vast,  
empty, effulgent space. with no cloud of thought, no object. The spiritual  
heart is pure being as awareness-bliss. It has no night or day, no sleep or  
waking, no time of space.

Dear Nagaraj,   
I read AAMM and the remaining four songs on alternate days.   
This morning I was reading AAMM. Everyday about 10 verses   
would attract me more. Today I found the three verses, if what   
is stated in them, happen to a sincere devotee, there is nothing   
else needed: Verse 102: Arunai enru enna... The moment I thought of You as   
Arunachala, you caught me in the noose of grace. Can the net of   
your grace ever fail to catch and hold its prey, O Arunachala?   
Verse 94: Varumpadi sollilai.... You asked me, did you not, to   
come to You? Very well, I have come. Now you come and assume   
the burden of maintaining me. Go on suffering thus. It is your   
fate to look after me!   
Verse 104: Anbodu un namam keL.... Let me be a loving servant of the devotees  
of those devotees who hear your Name, with love, O O Arunachala! [Many hear,  
few utter His Name].   
The first two represent His works. The third is what we should do.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ How I came to the Ramana Maharshi By Francis Allen  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: July 01, 2010, 11:08:47 PM  
---  
This is the story of how Bhagavan, whom I never met, came, I believe, into my  
life.   
During World War II, I was posted from England to Ceylon, where I became so  
interested in Theravada Buddhism that I deter-mined to enter the Sangha. I was  
informed by monks there that they could not give me ordination without first  
obtaining my parents' consent.   
After being demobilised in England I joined a small London group studying  
Theravada, another member of which was a lady who, it transpired, had been to  
Tiruvannamalai.   
For the first time in my life I then heard the name Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
 **I made up my mind there and then to break my return journey to Ceylon at  
Tiruvannamalai.Unfortunately, although my father had agreed to my ordination  
as a Buddhist monk, my mother withheld her permission, fearing it was merely a  
passing impulse(A sudden desire) on my part.   
That day was April 14th, 1950. The very day that, miles and miles away from  
London, Bhagavan left the body. It was not until I arrived in Bombay that I  
discovered this; and imagining that Bhagavan was no more, I went on to Colombo  
...**   
After that, with the assistance of Ronald Rosa, I arrived at Sri Ramanasramam.

## Self-inquiry is the pinnacle of religiosity.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: July 02, 2010, 10:57:31 AM

Usually by using the word religion we mean doing rituals, repetition of a  
sacred word,   
following a mental discipline which further strengthens the mind,a vow of  
silence with   
mental activity intact,observing celibacy with the sexual desire  
intact,physical fasting   
hoping to change the disordered mind,belief,dogma,following the sayings of a  
master.   
All these are useful to impress the society that we are religious and get  
recognition   
from a corrupt society that we are a religious being.The human life is based  
on   
acquisitiveness which is both psychological and  
physical,envy,greed,ambition,fear.   
All these anomalies of human psyche are not touched or transformed in the  
above   
mentioned way of life.There can be no fundamental transformation in that way  
of   
doing things in the name of religion.Actually such way of life brings  
conflict,strengthens   
the fear of not achieving the Self,a goal created by the mind.It strengthens  
tyranny.   
It is strange that we worship such persons as god men.The other day i was  
reading   
an interesting news in the news paper.A dog knowingly or unknowingly started  
doing   
Pradakshina(going around) the statue of Lord Anjaneya Swamy and people started   
worshiping that "divine dog".Such is the understanding of religion of an  
average   
human being.We do not want that which is pure,true in itself.We want  
interpreters,   
masters as a medium through which to attain something sacred.People are  
exploited   
in this so called religion.If each one of us could think very clearly or  
reeducate ourselves   
to think clearly we will be free of all beliefs,dogmas,rituals,physical  
fasting and celibacy etc.   
If we do not think clearly there is mere reformation of the disorder of the  
mind which is   
nothing but the continuation of the same disorder in a modified form.Where as  
in Self-inquiry   
we put aside the whole disordered entity by watchfulness of the activity of  
the disordered mind in   
passive awareness.There is no attempt to manipulate to correct the disorder  
because   
any such manipulation further strengthens the disorder.Self-inquiry does not  
mean watching   
the disordered mind with another part of disordered mind.In Self-inquiry  
watching of the   
disordered mind with passive witnessing consciousness brings about order to  
the mind.Just the   
perception of disorder brings about order to the mind.Self-inquiry is the way  
of intelligence of   
passive awareness.In Self-inquiry we become a light unto ourselves and so we  
do not depend   
on some other's psychological authority.So we are not dependent on any  
belief,dogma, or religion.   
We go beyond all these if we are really doing Self-inquiry. A man of Self-  
inquiry does not belong to corrupt society with its religion   
and so untouched by the ways of corrupt society and its organized  
religion.Because he does not   
belong to any conventional religion he looks irreligious from the angle of  
vision of the society.   
But he is religious without belonging to any religion.So a man of Self-inquiry  
is a pinnacle of religiosity.   
He is above the ways of society and its religions which are nonsensical.   
In him there is no reformation of the old mind but qualitatively new mind  
happens to him   
through psychological transmutation which is the only real revolution brought  
about by   
Self-inquiry.All other revolutions are bound to fail because they are a  
continuation of   
old patterns of human mind in new form.This psychological revolution which  
happens   
through Self-inquiry brings us immense psychological freedom,awareness,bliss.   
So Self-inquiry is the pinnacle of religiosity.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Excellent. All religions in the conventional sense, assume a formful   
god or gods and even those religions which do not believe in idol worship,  
have to keep some numbers of their holy book as a drawing or photograph for  
remembrance. They look at West and pray because the holy shrine is towards  
India's west.   
The Self enquiry pre-supposes that the Self is a formless and nameless entity,  
all pervading and eternal. It is Swarupam which   
is only Sat Chit Anandam. Even the second and third characteristics   
become derivatives and only ULLadu, Sat is the only description.   
Hence self enquiry goes beyond conventional religions and this   
aspect makes it go beyond sampradaya,- customs, and naimittika   
and nitya karmas, - rituals. Any "religious" Guru will ask his disciple to  
convert himself into his religion. Whereas Bhagavan   
Ramana said: "You can be a Christian and by being a good Christian you can  
pursue self enquiry!" That is why people of   
all religions, [Westerners, Dr.Syed, Dr. Karamchandani and conventional Hindu  
brahmins, Mudaliars, Pillais, Reddys...] came to Him. He has often said that  
Atma has no religion.   
Padamalai Verses of Muruganar: Verse 1032: The doctrines of all religions contradict each other.   
They wage war, collide with each other, and finally die.   
Verse 1033: On this battlefield all the religions retreat defeated   
when they stand before Mauna, which abides beneficently, sustaining them all.   
Verse 1034: The rare and wonderful power of Mauna is that it remains without  
enmity towards any of the religions.   
Verse 2838: The many different religious are appropriate to the   
maturity of each individualo, and all of them are acceptable to   
Reality.   
There are also some GVK verses. I shall look into them and write   
again.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 1176: Do not vainly argue through reasoning power of the   
intellect, which ignores the Self and clings to the non-Self, that   
'reality exists', 'it does not exist'; 'it is form'; 'it is formless';   
'it is dual'; 'it is non dual'. Only the Mauna that shines forever   
as the unfailing experience of Sat Chit Ananda, is TRUE RELIGION.   
[Bhagavan Ramana says this in Verse 34 of ULLadu Narpadu]   
Verse 1177: The life of grace is only the observance of the original  
religion, the mind-transcending mauna that is extolled by the great ones.  
Through this life of grace becoming established in a person's   
heart, true Jnana should arise in him. When it has not arisen, not an iota of  
that feeling of differences which obstructs intense peace, the Jnana  
experience, will leave him merely through a multitude   
of karmic observances performed in the delusion that such caste   
and religious rituals are alone Sat-achara [abiding as Sat, Being].   
Verse 1178: The many rivers flow towards the ocean and merge   
with it. Similarly, all the religions have as their goal merging with the  
ocean of Sivam, the ever-full bliss of Consciousness. As they [the religions]  
becomes wholly Sivam, there is no room for any differences among there.   
Arunachala Siva.

Pradakshina(going around) the statue of Lord Anjaneya Swamy and people started   
worshiping that "divine dog".Such is the understanding of religion of an  
average   
human being.We do not want that which is pure,true in itself.We want  
interpreters,   
masters as a medium through which to attain something sacred.People are  
exploited   
in this so called religion.If each one of us could think very clearly or  
reeducate ourselves   
to think clearly we will be free of all beliefs,dogmas,rituals,physical  
fasting and celibacy etc.   
If we do not think clearly there is mere reformation of the disorder of the  
mind which is   
nothing but the continuation of the same disorder in a modified form.Where as  
in Self-inquiry   
we put aside the whole disordered entity by watchfulness of the activity of  
the disordered mind in   
passive awareness.There is no attempt to manipulate to correct the disorder  
because   
any such manipulation further strengthens the disorder.Self-inquiry does not  
mean watching   
the disordered mind with another part of disordered mind.In Self-inquiry  
watching of the   
disordered mind with passive witnessing consciousness brings about order to  
the mind.Just the   
perception of disorder brings about order to the mind.Self-inquiry is the way  
of intelligence of   
passive awareness.In Self-inquiry we become a light unto ourselves and so we  
do not depend   
on some other's psychological authority.So we are not dependent on any  
belief,dogma, or religion.   
We go beyond all these if we are really doing Self-inquiry. A man of Self-  
inquiry does not belong to corrupt society with its religion   
and so untouched by the ways of corrupt society and its organized  
religion.Because he does not   
belong to any conventional religion he looks irreligious from the angle of  
vision of the society.   
But he is religious without belonging to any religion.So a man of Self-inquiry  
is a pinnacle of religiosity.   
He is above the ways of society and its religions which are nonsensical.   
In him there is no reformation of the old mind but qualitatively new mind  
happens to him   
through psychological transmutation which is the only real revolution brought  
about by   
Self-inquiry.All other revolutions are bound to fail because they are a  
continuation of   
old patterns of human mind in new form.This psychological revolution which  
happens   
through Self-inquiry brings us immense psychological freedom,awareness,bliss.   
So Self-inquiry is the pinnacle of religiosity.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Excellent. All religions in the conventional sense, assume a formful   
god or gods and even those religions which do not believe in idol worship,  
have to keep some numbers of their holy book as a drawing or photograph for  
remembrance. They look at West and pray because the holy shrine is towards  
India's west.   
The Self enquiry pre-supposes that the Self is a formless and nameless entity,  
all pervading and eternal. It is Swarupam which   
is only Sat Chit Anandam. Even the second and third characteristics   
become derivatives and only ULLadu, Sat is the only description.   
Hence self enquiry goes beyond conventional religions and this   
aspect makes it go beyond sampradaya,- customs, and naimittika   
and nitya karmas, - rituals. Any "religious" Guru will ask his disciple to  
convert himself into his religion. Whereas Bhagavan   
Ramana said: "You can be a Christian and by being a good Christian you can  
pursue self enquiry!" That is why people of   
all religions, [Westerners, Dr.Syed, Dr. Karamchandani and conventional Hindu  
brahmins, Mudaliars, Pillais, Reddys...] came to Him. He has often said that  
Atma has no religion.   
Padamalai Verses of Muruganar: Verse 1032: The doctrines of all religions contradict each other.   
They wage war, collide with each other, and finally die.   
Verse 1033: On this battlefield all the religions retreat defeated   
when they stand before Mauna, which abides beneficently, sustaining them all.   
Verse 1034: The rare and wonderful power of Mauna is that it remains without  
enmity towards any of the religions.   
Verse 2838: The many different religious are appropriate to the   
maturity of each individualo, and all of them are acceptable to   
Reality.   
There are also some GVK verses. I shall look into them and write   
again.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 1176: Do not vainly argue through reasoning power of the   
intellect, which ignores the Self and clings to the non-Self, that   
'reality exists', 'it does not exist'; 'it is form'; 'it is formless';   
'it is dual'; 'it is non dual'. Only the Mauna that shines forever   
as the unfailing experience of Sat Chit Ananda, is TRUE RELIGION.   
[Bhagavan Ramana says this in Verse 34 of ULLadu Narpadu]   
Verse 1177: The life of grace is only the observance of the original  
religion, the mind-transcending mauna that is extolled by the great ones.  
Through this life of grace becoming established in a person's   
heart, true Jnana should arise in him. When it has not arisen, not an iota of  
that feeling of differences which obstructs intense peace, the Jnana  
experience, will leave him merely through a multitude   
of karmic observances performed in the delusion that such caste   
and religious rituals are alone Sat-achara [abiding as Sat, Being].   
Verse 1178: The many rivers flow towards the ocean and merge   
with it. Similarly, all the religions have as their goal merging with the  
ocean of Sivam, the ever-full bliss of Consciousness. As they [the religions]  
becomes wholly Sivam, there is no room for any differences among there.   
Arunachala Siva.

Usually by using the word religion we mean doing rituals, repetition of a  
sacred word,   
following a mental discipline which further strengthens the mind,a vow of  
silence with   
mental activity intact,observing celibacy with the sexual desire  
intact,physical fasting   
hoping to change the disordered mind,belief,dogma,following the sayings of a  
master.   
All these are useful to impress the society that we are religious and get  
recognition   
from a corrupt society that we are a religious being.The human life is based  
on   
acquisitiveness which is both psychological and  
physical,envy,greed,ambition,fear.   
All these anomalies of human psyche are not touched or transformed in the  
above   
mentioned way of life.There can be no fundamental transformation in that way  
of   
doing things in the name of religion.Actually such way of life brings  
conflict,strengthens   
the fear of not achieving the Self,a goal created by the mind.It strengthens  
tyranny.   
It is strange that we worship such persons as god men.The other day i was
