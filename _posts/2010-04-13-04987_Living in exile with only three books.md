## Bhagavan's view

We know Bhagavan witness us but with our physical eyes we cannot see or talk  
to Him. Suppose if He is in human frame and Annamalai swamy also   
and if someone shows this forum, what would be His views and answers. I think  
He would say, the sugar doll is asking how does the sugar taste.

Bhagavan Ramana and Annamalai Swami are the Self, Atma, within   
us. He cannot be seen with our physical eyes. He can be seen only   
within in our Heart, by constant meditation. The Self is the eye of   
the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says these aspects beautifully in Sri Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Verse 15: Kannukku kannai kanninri kan unaik   
 Kanuvadhu evar par Arunachala!   
Who can ever find Thee? The Eye of the eye art Thou, and   
without eyes Thou seest, Oh Arunachala!   
Then how to see the Self? The Self Itself should show It, to you.   
There is no other way!   
Verse 43: Thaane thaane tattuvam idhanait   
 Thaane kattuvai Arunachala!   
Reveal Thyself! Thou only art Reality, Oh Arunachla!   
Okay, for this, what should we do?   
Verse 44: Thirumbi ahanthanai thinam ahak kan kaan   
 Therium enranai en Arunachala!   
"Look within, ever seeking the Self with the inner eye, then will   
it be found", Thus didst Thou direct me, beloved Arunachala!   
Bhagavan Ramana and Annamalai Swami have not gone anywhere.   
Their Presence is ever within us. Let us not insist on physical form.   
The Self which they are, have no form and name. They can be   
seen within us through our looking within, with inner eye.   
It is the Self which is directing us about the teachings of   
Bhagavan Ramana, in this Forum, if we have faith and conviction.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Verse 43:

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the reply. In day to day life every moment when the things happen  
as people wish we get happiness. On the other hand when it turns upside down,  
people   
get unhappy. The people who does atma vicharam, in the beginning ego does not  
want to accept the unhappy situation so people start argue and fight. Bhagavan   
who is inside of us He also witness the people's struggle, How much it is  
difficult to witness the fight in between the ego and the pure mind. That time  
our patience also get disappeared. How long this drama will take place and  
starts asking ENGE UNNADHU KARUNAI KANGAL.   
Ramanaduli

the wish to " get something " is based on the belief that you dont have it.   
wanting to get something ( happiness ) or to get rid of something (  
unhappiness/sadness ) are 2 sides of the same coin. the ego (mind ) uses both  
sides of the coin to avoid truth. the drama is ALL in the mind. all the  
fighting is in the mind. look to see what is DRAMALESS. just stop for one  
moment and be unhappy all the way with no chance of ever being happy. .. what  
a relief it will be to not have that burden, and in that peace see if there  
is a difference between the peace and yourself. there is no difference. ...  
what a joy !

How pleasant! A year old mail from last Spring that sprouts new leaves!   
I loved in particular the humor bubbling in the choices and reasons for  
choices, but it was Subramaniam's choice of a 4th book that sparked a reply  
from me.   
D. T. Suzuki's "Essays in Zen Buddhism" was a mainstay for me for many years.  
It's odd, in a way the texts are tedious to read with words and concepts I  
could barely grasp, like a slow sonorous chanting of sutras I saw on TV once,  
then -- suddenly -- a flash of light of insight of understanding that  
disappear almost before I could recognize them.   
Then, one morning, alone on a night shift, about 3 in the morning, I closed  
the copy of the essays I was reading - suddenly, I was up out of my chair  
dancing across the room, on the floor, on the table tops, singing a song.  
Surprised, I then scratched the words down on a manila envelope I pulled out  
of a waste basket:  **You are reality, beyond all belief   
You are the living tree, nourishing my green leaf   
You are the hight, the footstep and the path   
You are the answer, with no questions asked   
You are the beauty shining in each lover's face   
You are that certain place of no time or space   
 Smaller than an atom   
 Bigger than a star   
 Able to go slowly fast,   
 You stay quickly far   
You are, you are, you are...   
You are the holy rock   
You are the distant shore   
You are life itself and even death   
 pales before   
Your emptiness   
Ah, but my books? I dunno, I really don't know, many clamor for attention,  
the thick ones claim they have more to say and the thin ones say that their  
conciseness and brevity is what increases their value -- so, a couple of  
books, one thick, one thin, and a picture of Ramana -- sigh -- but which  
picture?

I have to search for the three volumes of Essays in Zen Buddhism.   
I feel like reading them once again. I bought it in Adyar Library   
of JK in Chennai about ten years back. The new copies would cost me at least  
Rs 2000/=.

Subramiam R.,   
I just checked Amazon for the heck of it - series 3 (the three volumes) costs  
25£ (used) and series 2 (the one I have) 5£.   
A little known work which I got almost by accident is his "Swedenborg, Buddha  
of the North", goes for 3.60£ - it's one of his earliest works and  
introduced me to Swedenborg, a difficult fellow to get to know.   
love - being -aware

Dear Chuck Cliff?

Principle?

Dear srkudai,   
Thanks. I think some "unlearning" has already started in me!
