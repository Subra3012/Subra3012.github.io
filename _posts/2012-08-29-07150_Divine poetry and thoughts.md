Dear friends, I am reading these days the book from Sri Ganesan "The Human  
Gospel of Sri Ramana Maharshi". Sri Ravi shared link for us,and i am amazed  
with it,with such a Great souls. It is Truly inspiring! Also,i am puzzled with  
Ratnammal. But Sri Ganesan left somehow unfinished story about her,not writing  
anything much about her life. So,my question is,does anyone knows something  
about Ratnammal? Maybe is some reason behind it,i supouse it is,so You can  
answer me in private message. Or here,if that is not the case,and those facts  
are known by everybody.

Dear Jewell,   
There is no recorded information more than what has been presented in Sri  
Bhagavan's books. She was a devadasi (temple dancer).   
She came with her cousin one day, when Sri Bhagavan was in the Temple, washed  
Him completely with soap and water and also   
fed Him on that day and subsequently for some days. Sri Bhagavan accepted her  
love and devotion and took the food (perhaps a   
small quantity) on those days. Only on the first day, He agreed for a bath.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian sir, Thank You Very much! I was so puzzled with her story,and  
still i am,but,anyway,it is not so important. More important is the fact that  
she was devotee of Bhagavan Ramana.

**_Do not bother about anything you want, or think, or do, just stay   
put in the thought and feeling, I am, focusing I am firmly in   
your mind. All kinds of experience may come to you  remain   
unmoved in the knowledge that all perceivable is transient and   
only the I am endures._**

**M: What were you actually experiencing when you were in the right mood?   
Q: A sense of inner stillness, peace and silence.   
M: Did you notice yourself becoming unconscious?   
Q: Yes, occasionally and for a very short time. Otherwise I was just quiet,  
inwardly and outwardly.   
M: What kind of quiet was it? Something akin to deep sleep, yet conscious all  
the same. A sort of wakeful sleep?   
Q: Yes. Alertly asleep. (jagrit-sushupti).   
M: The main thing is to be free of negative emotions -- desire, fear etc.,  
the 'six enemies' of the mind. Once the mind is free of them, the rest will  
come easily. Just as cloth kept in soap water will become clean, so will the  
mind get purified in the stream of pure feeling.   
When you sit quiet and watch yourself, all kinds of things may come to the  
surface. Do nothing about them, don't react to them; as they have come so will  
they go, by themselves. All that matters is mindfulness, total awareness of  
oneself or rather, of one's mind.   
Q: By 'oneself' do you mean the daily self?   
M: Yes, the person, which alone is objectively observable. The observer is  
beyond observation. What is observable is not the real self.   
Q: I can always observe the observer, in endless recession.   
M: You can observe the observation, but not the observer. You know you are  
the ultimate observer by direct insight, not by a logical process based on  
observation. You are what you are, but you know what you are not. The self is  
known as being, the not-self is known as transient. But in reality all is in  
the mind. The observed, observation and observer are mental constructs. The  
self alone is.   
Q: Why does the mind create all these divisions?   
M: To divide and particularise is in the mind's very nature. There is no harm  
in dividing. But separation goes against fact. Things and people are  
different, but they are not separate. Nature is one, reality is one. There are  
opposites, but no opposition.   
Q: I find that by nature I am very active. Here I am advised to avoid  
activity. The more I try to remain inactive, the greater the urge to do  
something. This makes me not only active outwardly, but also struggling  
inwardly to be what by nature I am not. Is there a remedy against longing for  
work?   
M: There is a difference between work and mere activity. All nature works.  
Work is nature, nature is work. On the other hand, activity is based on desire  
and fear, on longing to possess and enjoy, on fear of pain and annihilation.  
Work is by the whole for the whole, activity is by oneself for oneself.   
Q: Is there a remedy against activity?   
M: Watch it, and it shall cease. Use every opportunity to remind yourself  
that you are in bondage, that whatever happens to you is due to the fact of  
your bodily existence. Desire, fear, trouble, joy, they cannot appear unless  
you are there to appear to. Yet, whatever happens, points to your existence as  
a perceiving centre. Disregard the pointers and be aware of what they are  
pointing to. It is quite simple, but it needs be done. What matters is the  
persistence with which you keep on returning to yourself.   
Q: I do get into peculiar states of deep absorption into myself, but  
unpredictably and momentarily. I do not feel myself to be in control of such  
states.   
M: The body is a material thing and needs time to change. The mind is but a  
set of mental habits, of ways of thinking and feeling, and to change they must  
be brought to the surface and examined. This also takes time. Just resolve and  
persevere, the rest will take care of itself.   
Q: I seem to have a clear idea of what needs be done, but I find myself  
getting tired and depressed and seeking human company and thus wasting time  
that should be given to solitude and meditation.   
M: Do what you feel like doing. Don't bully yourself. Violence will make you  
hard and rigid. Do not fight with what you take to be obstacles on your way.  
Just be interested in them, watch them, observe, enquire. Let anything happen  
-- good or bad. But don't let yourself be submerged by what happens.   
Q: What is the purpose in reminding oneself all the time that one is the  
watcher?   
M: The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the background of  
awareness, which does not change. The mind must come to know the true self and  
respect it and cease covering it up, like the moon which obscures the sun  
during solar eclipse. Just realise that nothing observable, or experienceable  
is you, or binds you. Take no notice of what is not yourself.   
Q: To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.   
M: To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware anyhow,  
you need not try to be. What you need is to be aware of being aware. Be aware  
deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being  
conscious.   
Q: As I can make out, you give distinct meanings to the words 'mind',  
'consciousness', and 'awareness'.   
M: Look at it this way. The mind produces thoughts ceaselessly, even when you  
do not look at them. When you know what is going on in your mind, you call it  
consciousness. This is your waking state -- your consciousness shifts from  
sensation to sensation, from perception to perception, from idea to idea, in  
endless succession. Then comes awareness, the direct insight into the whole of  
consciousness, the totality of the mind. The mind is like a river, flowing  
ceaselessly in the bed of the body; you identify yourself for a moment with  
some particular ripple and call it: 'my thought'. All you are conscious of is  
your mind; awareness is the cognisance of consciousness as a whole.   
Q: Everybody is conscious, but not everybody is aware.   
M: Don't say: 'everybody is conscious'. Say: 'there is consciousness', in  
which everything appears and disappears. Our minds are just waves on the ocean  
of consciousness. As waves they come and go. As ocean they are infinite and  
eternal. Know yourself as the ocean of being, the womb of all existence. These  
are all metaphors of course; the reality is beyond description. You can know  
it only by being it.   
Q: Is the search for it worth the trouble?   
M: Without it all is trouble. If you want to live sanely, creatively and  
happily and have infinite riches to share, search for what you are.   
While the mind is centred in the body and consciousness is centred in the  
mind, awareness is free. The body has its urges and mind its pains and  
pleasures. Awareness is unattached and unshaken. It is lucid, silent,  
peaceful, alert and unafraid, without desire and fear. Meditate on it as your  
true being and try to be it in your daily life, and you shall realise it in  
its fullness.**

**_The Maya is so powerful that it gets you completely wrapped up   
in it. Maya means I am, I love to be, It has no identity except   
love. That knowledge of I am is the greatest foe and the greatest   
friend. Although it might be your greatest enemy, if you propitiate   
it properly, it will turn around and lead you to the highest state.   
If you want to remember this visit, if you have love for me,   
remember this I am principle and without the command or   
direction of this principle, do nothing. _**

**_Most essential is that knowledge I am. Claim it; appropriate it as   
your own. If that is not there, nothing is. Knowledge of all stages   
will be obtained only with the aid of this knowledge I am From   
the Absolute no-knowing state, spontaneously this consciousness I   
am has appeared  no reason, no cause.   
In this spiritual hierarchy, from the grossest to the subtlest, you are   
the subtlest. How can this be realized? The very base is that you   
dont know you are, and suddenly the feeling of I amness   
appears. The moment it appears you see space, mental space; that   
subtle sky-like space, stabilize there. You are that. When you are   
able to stabilize in that space, you are space only.   
When this spacelike identity I am disappears, the space will also disappear,  
there   
is no space. When that space-like I am goes into oblivion, that is   
the eternal state, nirguna, no form, no beingness. Actually, what   
did happen there? This message I am was no message. Dealing   
with this aspect, I cannot talk much because there is no scope to   
put it in words.   
Understand that it is not the individual that has consciousness; it is   
the consciousness which assumes innumerable forms. That   
something which is born or which will die is purely imaginary. It is   
the child of a barren woman. In the absence of this basic concept I   
am, there is no thought, there is no consciousness.   
Whatever I am telling you, is not the truth, because it has come out   
of this I am. The truth is beyond expression. I am taking you   
again and again to the source of the spring. Once you go to the   
source you will come to know there is no water, water is the news   
I am. _**

**Questioner: Repeatedly you have been saying that events are causeless, a  
thing just happens and no cause can be assigned to it. Surely everything has a  
cause, or several causes. How am I to understand the causelessness of things?   
Maharaj: From the highest point of view the world has no cause.   
Q: But what is your own experience?   
M: Everything is uncaused. The world has no cause.   
Q: I am not enquiring about the causes that led to the creation of the  
world. Who has seen the creation of the world? It may even be without a  
beginning, always existing. But I am not talking of the world. I take the  
world to exist -- somehow. It contains so many things. Surely, each must have  
a cause, or several causes.   
M: Once you create for yourself a world in time and space, governed by  
causality, you are bound to search for and find causes for everything. You put  
the question and impose an answer.   
Q: My question is very simple: I see all kinds of things and I understand  
that each must have a cause, or a number of causes. You say they are uncaused  
-- from your point of view. But, to you nothing has being and, therefore, the  
question of causation does not arise. Yet you seem to admit the existence of  
things, but deny them causation. This is what I cannot grasp. Once you accept  
the existence of things, why reject their causes?   
M: I see only consciousness, and know everything to be but consciousness, as  
you know the picture on the cinema screen to be but light.   
Q: Still, the movements of light have a cause.   
M: The light does not move at all. You know very well that the movement is  
illusory, a sequence of interceptions and colour­ings in the film. What moves  
is the film -- which is the mind.   
Q: This does not make the picture causeless. The film is there, and the  
actors with the technicians, the director, the producer, the various  
manufacturers. The world is governed by causality. Everything is inter-linked.   
M: Of course, everything is inter-linked. And therefore everything has  
numberless causes. The entire universe contributes to the least thing. A thing  
is as it is, because the world is as it is. You see, you deal in gold  
ornaments and I -- in gold. Between the different ornaments there is no causal  
relation. When you re-melt an ornament to make another, there is no causal  
relation between the two. The common factor is the gold. But you cannot say  
gold is the cause. It cannot be called a cause, for it causes nothing by  
itself. It is reflected in the mind as 'I am', as the ornament's particular  
name and shape. Yet all is only gold. In the same way reality makes everything  
possible and yet nothing that makes a thing what it is, its name and form,  
comes from reality.   
But why worry so much about causation? What do causes matter, when things  
themselves are transient? Let come what comes and let go what goes -- why  
catch hold of things and enquire about their causes?   
Q: From the relative point of view, everything must have a cause.   
M: Of what use is the relative view to you? You are able to look from the  
absolute point of view -- why go back to the relative? Are you afraid of the  
absolute?   
Q: I am afraid. I am afraid of falling asleep over my so-called absolute  
certainties. For living a life decently absolutes don't help. When you need a  
shirt, you buy cloth, call a tailor and so on.   
M: All this talk shows ignorance.   
Q: And what is the knower's view?   
M: There is only light and the light is all. Everything else is but a picture  
made of light. The picture is in the light and the light is in the picture.  
Life and death, self and not-self abandon all these ideas. They are of no  
use to you.   
Q: From what point of view you deny causation? From the relative -- the  
universe is the cause of everything. From the absolute -- there is no thing at  
all.   
M: From which state are you asking?   
Q: From the daily waking state, in which alone all these discussions take  
place.   
M: In the waking state all these problems arise, for such is its nature. But,  
you are not always in that state. What good can you do in a state into which  
you fall and from which you emerge, helplessly. In what way does it help you  
to know that things are causally related -- as they may appear to be in your  
waking state?   
Q: The world and the waking state emerge and subside together.   
M: When the mind is still, absolutely silent, the waking state is no more.   
Q: Words like God, universe, the total, absolute, supreme are just noises in  
the air, because no action can be taken on them.   
M: You are bringing up questions which you alone can answer.   
Q: Don't brush me off like this! You are so quick to speak for the totality,  
the universe and such imaginary things! They cannot come and forbid you to  
talk on their behalf. I hate those irresponsible generalizations! And you are  
so prone to personalise them. Without causality there will be no order; nor  
purposeful action will be possible.   
M: Do you want to know all the causes of each event? Is it possible?   
Q: I know it is not possible! All I want to know is if there are causes for  
everything and the causes can be influenced, thereby affecting the events?   
M: To influence events, you need not know the causes. What a roundabout way  
of doing things! Are you not the source and the end of every event? Control it  
at the source itself.   
Q: Every morning I pick up the newspaper and read with dismay that the  
world's sorrows -- poverty, hatred and wars -- continue unabated. My questions  
are concerning the fact of sorrow, the cause, the remedy. Don't brush me off  
saying that it is Buddhism! Don't label me. Your insistence on causelessness  
removes all hope of the world ever changing.   
M: You are confused, because you believe that you are in the world, not the  
world in you. Who came first -- you or your parents? You imagine that you were  
born at a certain time and place, that you have a father and a mother, a body  
and a name. This is your sin and your calamity! Surely you can change your  
world if you work at it. By all means, work. Who stops you? I have never  
discouraged you. Causes or no causes, you have made this world and you can  
change it.**

**_Consciousness is the sense of knowingness I am without words,   
and it appeared unknowingly and unsolicited. Only in the realm of   
knowingness I am  the consciousness  can a world be, and so   
also an experience. Hold on to this knowingness I am and the   
fount of knowledge will well up within you, revealing the mystery   
of the Universe; of your body and psyche; of the play of the five   
elements, the three gunas and prakriti-purusha; and of   
everything else. In the process of this revelation, your   
individualistic personality confined to the body shall expand into   
the manifested universe, and it will be realized that you permeate   
and embrace the entire cosmos as your body only. This is known   
as the Pure Super-knowledge  Shuddhavijnana.   
Now coming to a very subtle situation, what is it in you that   
understands this knowledge you are  or from your standpoint I   
am without a name, title or word? Subside in that innermost center   
and witness the knowledge I am and just be; this is the bliss of   
being  the swarupananda.   
Paths and movements cannot transport you into Reality, because   
their function is to enmesh you within the dimensions of   
knowledge, while the Reality prevails prior to it. To apprehend   
this, you must stay put at the source of your creation, at the   
beginning of the knowledge I am. So long as you do not achieve   
this, you will be entangled in the chains forged by your mind and   
get enmeshed in those of others.   
This true knowledge, the knowledge I am, is also rendered the   
status of non-knowledge in the final Absolute state. When one is   
established in this final free state, the knowledge I am becomes   
non-knowledge.   
For all beings it is the same experience. Early morning,   
immediately after waking, just the feeling I am is felt inside or   
the beingness happens, and therefore further witnessing of all else   
happens. The first witnessing is that of I am, this primary   
witnessing is the prerequisite for all further witnessing. But to   
whom is the witnessing occurring? One that ever is, even without   
waking, to that ever-present substratum the witnessing of the   
waking state happens._**

**_You know you are sitting here. Be attentive to that knowledge   
only. Just be in your beingness. That knowingness I am has   
created the entire universe. Hold on to that; nothing has to be done.   
Once you recognize that principle it becomes tranquil. Become one   
with that and all your needs will be satisfied.   
I have been very open, very explicit. Ive been telling you that you   
are not the body, you are that knowledge only and that vital breath   
is your conveyance, a tool by which you carry out your activities,   
and the knowledge I am is very subtle. Because of your   
knowledge, you are and world is.   
You are worrying because of the intellect, but you have only to   
continue in that I am with faith, you have nothing else to do. You   
are likely to miss that incident if you try to use your intellect. Just   
let it happen. Hold on to the feeling I am; dont pollute that state   
by holding on to the body sense.   
Maya is the primary source of illusion. At that point, love for the   
Self begins: I am, the love to be. Its expression is all this   
manifestation.   
After deep sleep, as soon as consciousness dawns on you of I am   
 that is the witness. Before that moment you did not know that   
you are, there was no witness, no knowledge of I am.   
As long as you identify with the body-mind you are conditioned.   
Once you stabilize in the knowledge I am unconditionally you   
are the manifest I amness  no more an individual. In the   
manifested state of I amness there is no question of your doing,   
because you are no more an individual. Whatever happens,   
happens in your consciousness. Whatever happens through this,   
you also know it will happen, but there is no question of doing or   
being anything.   
The first film is when that knowingness appears on you. In that   
knowledge I am all is contained. Only in that film when the film   
started knowing itself, I am; then you came to know all this. Did

**Out of the nothingness, the I am or   
beingness has come, there is no individual, the knowledge I am- not the   
individual  has to go back to its source. Its very difficult to formulate  
any descriptions or   
words for the state prior to the I am or beingness. Some words that have  
been commonly used are: nothingness, emptiness, fullness, void, eternity, totality or even the  
Absolute or Parabrahman.   
Whatever the word, the I am appears to have arisen on it and it is sometimes  
called its source.   
The individual comes much later in the picture and as you go back it is the  
pure I am   
or beingness that remains, so it this knowledge I am that has to   
go back to its source. There is no question of a non-existent individual  
anywhere.   
By meditating on the knowledge I am it gradually settles down at its   
source and disappears, then you are the Absolute. Your entire focus should be  
on the knowledge I   
am. Constantly, without break, keep meditating on it. When an object remains  
in focus for a prolonged   
period there is a good chance it will disappear, that is bound to happen as  
that is its opposite.   
From just being to non-being from I am to I am not, when this happens  
nothing remains   
anymore, then you are the Absolute, silent, still, without any movement or  
experience.

**_M: Keep quiet, undisturbed, and the wisdom and the power will come on their  
own.   
You need not hanker.   
Wait in silence of the heart and mind.   
It is very easy to be quiet, but willingness is rare.   
You people want to become supermen overnight.   
Stay without ambition, without the least desire, exposed, vulnerable,  
unprotected, uncertain and alone, completely open to and welcoming life as it  
happens, without the selfish conviction that all must yield you pleasure or  
profit, material or so- called spiritual.   
Q: I respond to what you say, but I just do not see how it is done.   
M: If you know how to do it, you will not do it.   
Abandon every attempt, just be; don't strive, don't struggle, let go every  
support, hold on to the blind sense of being, brushing off all else.   
This is enough._**

**Q: How do you see things?   
M: One and all are the same to me. The same consciousness   
(chit) appears as being (sat) and as bliss (ananda): Chit in   
movement is Ananda; Chit motionless is being.   
Q: Still you are making a distinction between motion and   
motionlessness.   
M: Non-distinction speaks in silence. Words carry distinctions.   
The unmanifested (nirguna) has no name, all names refer to the   
manifested (saguna). It is useless to struggle with words to express   
what is beyond words. Consciousness (chidananda) is   
spirit (purusha), consciousness is matter (prakriti). Imperfect   
spirit is matter, perfect matter is spirit. In the beginning as in the   
end, all is one.   
 All division is in the mind (chitta); there is none in reality (chit).   
Movement and rest are states of mind and cannot be without   
their opposites. By itself nothing moves, nothing rests. It is a   
grievous mistake to attribute to mental constructs absolute existence.   
Nothing exists by itself.   
Q: You seem to identify rest with the Supreme State?   
M: There is rest as a state of mind (chidaram) and there is rest   
as a state of being (atmaram). The former comes and goes,   
while the true rest is the very heart of action. Unfortunately,   
language is a mental tool and works only in opposites.   
Q: As a witness, you are working or at rest?   
M: Witnessing is an experience and rest is freedom from experience.   
Q: Cant they co-exist, as the tumult of the waves and the quiet   
of the deep co-exist in the ocean.   
M: Beyond the mind there is no such thing as experience. Experience is a dual  
state.   
You cannot talk of reality as an experience. Once this is understood,   
you will no longer look for being and becoming as separate and opposite.   
In reality they are one and inseparable, like roots and branches of the same  
tree.   
Both can exist only in the light of consciousness, which again, arises   
in the wake of the sense I am. This is the primary fact. If you   
miss it, you miss all.   
Q: Is the sense of being a product of experience only? The   
great saying (Mahavakya) tat-sat is it a mere mode of mentation?   
M: Whatever is spoken is speech only. Whatever is thought is   
thought only. The real meaning is unexplainable, though experienceable.   
The Mahavakya is true, but your ideas are false,   
for all ideas (kalpana) are false.   
Q: Is the conviction: I am That false?   
M: Of course. Conviction is a mental state. In That there is no I   
am. With the sense I am emerging, That is obscured, as with   
the sun rising the stars are wiped out. But as with the sun comes   
light, so with the sense of self comes bliss (chidananda). The   
cause of bliss is sought in the not  I and thus the bondage   
begins.   
Q: In your daily life are you always conscious of your real state?   
M: Neither conscious, nor unconscious. I do not need convictions.   
I live on courage. Courage is my essence, which is love of life.   
I am free of memories and anticipations, unconcerned with   
what I am and what I am not.   
I am not addicted to selfdescriptions, soham and brahmasmi (I am He, I am  
the Supreme)   
 are of no use to me, I have the courage to be as nothing   
and to see the world as it is: nothing. It sounds simple, just try it!   
Q: But what gives you courage?   
M: How perverted are your views! Need courage be given?   
Your question implies that anxiety is the normal state and courage is  
abnormal.   
It is the other way round. Anxiety and hope are   
born of imagination  I am free of both. I am simple being and I   
need nothing to rest on.   
Q: Unless you know yourself, of what use is your being to you?   
To be happy with what you are, you must know what you are.   
M: Being shines as knowing, knowing is warm in love. It is all   
one. You imagine separations and trouble yourself with questions.   
Dont concern yourself overmuch with formulations. Pure   
being cannot be described.   
Q: Unless a thing is knowable and enjoyable, it is of no use to   
me. It must become a part of my experience, first of all.   
M: You are dragging down reality to the level of experience.   
How can reality depend on experience, when it is the very   
ground (adhar) of experience. Reality is in the very fact of experience,   
not in its nature. Experience is, after all, a state of   
mind, while being is definitely not a state of mind.   
Q: Again I am confused! Is being separate from knowing?   
M: The separation is an appearance. Just as the dream is not   
apart from the dreamer, so is knowing not apart from being. The   
dream is the dreamer, the knowledge is the knower, the distinction is merely  
verbal.   
Q: I can see now that sat and chit are one. But what about bliss   
(ananda)? Being and consciousness are always present together,   
but bliss flashes only occasionally.   
M: The undisturbed state of being is bliss; the disturbed state is   
what appears as the world. In non-duality there is bliss; in duality   
experience.   
What comes and goes is experience with its   
duality of pain and pleasure. Bliss is not to be known.   
One is always bliss, but never blissful. Bliss is not an attribute.**

**_Can any of your concepts grasp the total, the Ultimate? Have you   
understood that knowledge itself is ignorance? If it were real it   
would have been there eternally  it would not have had a   
beginning and an end. Now the experience I am is felt, earlier   
that experience was not. When it was not, no proof was called for,   
but once it is, lots of proof is required.   
One is the Absolute, two is consciousness, and three is space.   
Where there was no knowledge I am that is number one, later on   
there is the sense I am that is number two, and then there is space   
 number three.   
I have experienced all four kinds of speech and transcended them.   
Rarely will anybody follow this hierarchy to stabilize in the   
consciousness and transcend consciousness. Starting from   
Vaikhari (word), normally we listen to words; from Vaikhari   
we go to Madhyama (mind-thought); in watching the mind we   
are in Pashayanti where the concept formation takes place and   
from there to Para (I am without words), and finally from Para   
to prior to consciousness. This is the line to follow, but only a rare   
one follows it  receding, reversing.   
It is not important where you are, once you are established in the I   
am. It is like space  it neither comes nor goes; just as when you   
demolish the walls of a building only space remains.   
From "Prior to Consciousness"_**

**Maharaj: The seeker is he who is in search of himself. Soon he discovers  
that his own body he   
cannot be. Once the conviction: 'I am not the body' becomes so well grounded  
that he can no   
longer feel, think and act for and on behalf of the body, he will easily  
discover that he is the   
universal being, knowing, acting, that in him and through him the entire  
universe is real, conscious   
and active. This is the heart of the problem. Either you are body-conscious  
and a slave of   
circumstances, or you are the universal consciousness itself -- and in full  
control of every event.   
Yet consciousness, individual or universal, is not my true abode; I am not in  
it, it is not mine, there is   
no 'me' in it. I am beyond, though it is not easy to explain how one can be  
neither conscious, nor   
unconscious, but just beyond. I cannot say that I am in God or I am God; God  
is the universal light   
and love, the universal witness: I am beyond the universal even.   
Questioner: In that case you are without name and shape. What kind of being  
have you?   
M: I am what I am, neither with form nor formless, neither conscious nor  
unconscious. I am outside   
all these categories.   
Q: You are taking the neti-neti (not this, not this) approach.   
M: You cannot find me by mere denial. I am as well everything, as nothing. Nor  
both, nor either.   
These definitions apply to the Lord of the Universe, not to me.   
Q: Do you intend to convey that you are just nothing.   
M: Oh, no! I am complete and perfect. I am the beingness of being, the  
knowingness of knowing,   
the fullness of happiness. You cannot reduce me to emptiness!   
Q: If you are beyond words, what shall we talk about? Metaphysically speaking,  
what you say   
holds together; there is no inner contradiction. But there is no food for me  
in what you say. It is so   
completely beyond my urgent needs. When I ask for bread, you are giving  
jewels. They are   
beautiful, no doubt, but I am hungry.   
M: It is not so. I am offering you exactly what you need -- awakening. You are  
not hungry and you need no bread.   
You need cessation, relinquishing, disentanglement. What you believe you need  
is   
not what you need. Your real need I know, not you. You need to return to the  
state in which I am --   
your natural state. Anything else you may think of is an illusion and an  
obstacle. Believe me, you   
need nothing except to be what you are. You imagine you will increase your  
value by acquisition. It   
is like gold imagining that an addition of copper will improve it. Elimination  
and purification,   
renunciation of all that is foreign to your nature is enough. All else is  
vanity.   
Q: It is easier said than done. A man comes to you with stomach-ache and you  
advise him to   
disgorge his stomach. Of course, without the mind there will be no problems.  
But the mind is there   
\-- most tangibly.   
M: It is the mind that tells you that the mind is there. Don't be deceived.  
All the endless arguments   
about the mind are produced by the mind itself, for its own protection,  
continuation and expansion. It   
is the blank refusal to consider the convolutions and convulsions of the mind  
that can take you   
beyond it.   
Q: Sir, I am an humble seeker, while you are the Supreme Reality itself. Now  
the seeker   
approaches the Supreme in order to be enlightened. What does the Supreme do?   
M: Listen to what I keep on telling you and do not move away from it. Think of  
it all the time and of   
nothing else. Having reached that far, abandon all thoughts, not only of the  
world, but of yourself   
also. Stay beyond all thoughts, in silent being-awareness. It is not progress,  
for what you come to is   
already there in you, waiting for you.   
Q: So you say I should try to stop thinking and stay steady in the idea: 'I  
am'.   
M: Yes, and whatever thoughts come to you in connection with the 'I am', empty  
them of all   
meaning, pay them no attention.**

**_Maharaj: I am talking about the consciousness which works through this body  
at the moment, but which is not visible. This consciousness is not limited to  
the body but is universal consciousness; I can 't speak of anything else now.  
A person who is already dead is not worried about anything. Whether the people  
like it or not doesn't matter. Perhaps you may be getting some blessings, some  
benefits, from listening to my talks, I don't know.   
All my actions are the actions of universal consciousness appearing to work  
through this body. I do not remember something from the past and then act; it  
is all action in the now.   
Questioner: Where does consciousness comefrom?   
M: It never comes or goes, it just appears to have come.   
Q: Why does Maharaj know this and we do not?   
M: It is not difficult for you to know also, but with what identity are you  
asking?   
Q: Is it karmic, can karma be changed?   
M: It is all consciousness working, not this one or that one working; it is  
all consciousness.   
Q: Can Maharaj, out of compassion, give me a push into that state of universal  
consciousness ?   
M: Yes, of course, I can do that, but you must listen to me, you must have  
complete faith in whatever I tell you about yourself, and you must behave  
accordingly.   
By nature I am non-manifest, yet I am manifested, but I am really not  
manifested. Can you live like that, as the non-manifest?   
As long as the attribute is there, the quality of the attribute, the "I Am",  
is there; therefore, I can speak like this. If it goes away, what happens? The  
sense of "I" has come and has gone, that is all, I am not going to die. One  
who has rejected this identity will understand.   
Q: Maharaj said that he is not going to die ?   
M: How can one who is not born, die?   
When people first learned about this illness, those who have affection for me  
came to talk to me, or wrote to me, giving advice and medicine. Whatever is to  
happen will happen, I have no interest. I don't have fear so I don't have to  
do anything. It is quite in order that those who have affection for me write  
and come to discuss things with me; I don't listen to them, and that is also  
quite in order, because I am not afraid of anything.   
You are asking, "Who am I?" and you are not going to get an answer, because  
the one who will get the answer is false. You may have an idea, a concept, and  
you will think you have found yourself, but it is only a concept; you can  
never see your Self.   
Q: What is sat-chit-ananda?   
M: It is words. You can take it that sat-chit-ananda is the limit which your  
mind can describe of that state which cannot be described. Your true state is  
non-manifest; the manifestation comes and the words come. The one who  
experiences sat-chit-ananda is there before the experience._**

**Start with the body. From the body you get the knowledge of "I Am". In this  
process you become more and more subtle. When you are in a position to witness  
the knowledge "I Am", you have reached the highest. In this way you must try  
to understand, and the seeds of knowledge will sprout in you.When you come to  
the end of material world-knowledge, at that stage you transcend the observer  
and the observed.That means that you are in a true state of beingness.  
Thereafter you enter the state of transcending beingness, where the identities  
of the observer and observed disappear.Suppose somebody abuses you and you  
find out who it is. Is it the body? It is not the body.Then what could it be?  
Finally you come to the conclusion that it is spontaneously happening out of  
whatever that body is. You will not attribute it to any individual. When your  
individuality is dissolved, you will not see individuals anywhere, it is just  
a functioning in consciousness. If it clicks in you, it is very easy to  
understand. If it does not, it is most difficult. It is very profound and very  
simple, if understood right. What I am saying is not the general run of common  
spiritual knowledge.When you reach a state when body is transcended, mind is  
transcended and consciousness is also transcended; from then on all is merely  
happening out of consciousness, which is the outcome of the body, and there is  
no authority or doership. When a sound is emanating out of a body, it isnot  
that somebody is talking, it is just words emanating, just happening, not  
doing. If you understand the basis thoroughly, it will lead you very far, deep  
into spirituality.The Absolute alone prevails. There is nothing but the  
Absolute. The unmanifest manifested itself, that manifest state is Guru and it  
is universal.**

**M: When you realise that the distinction between inner and outer is in the  
mind only, you are no   
longer afraid.   
Q: Such realisation comes and goes with me. I have not yet reached the  
immutability of absolute   
completeness.   
M: Well, as long as you believe so, you must go on with your sadhana, to  
disperse the false idea of   
not being complete. Sadhana removes the super-impositions. When you realise  
yourself as less   
than a point in space and time, something too small to be cut and too short-  
lived to be killed, then,   
and then only, all fear goes. When you are smaller than the point of a needle,  
then the needle   
cannot pierce you -- you pierce the needle!   
Q: Yes, that is how I feel sometimes -- indomitable. I am more than fearless  
-- I am fearlessness   
itself.   
M: What made you go to the Ashram?   
Q: I had an unhappy love affair and suffered hell. Neither drink nor drugs  
could help me. I was   
groping and came across some books on Yoga. From book to book, from clue to  
clue -- I came to   
Ramanashram.   
M: Were the same tragedy to happen to you again, would you suffer as much,  
considering your   
present state of mind?Q: Oh no, I would not let myself suffer again. I would  
kill myself.   
M: So you are not afraid to die!   
Q: I am afraid of dying, not of death itself. I imagine the dying process to  
be painful and ugly.   
M: How do you know? It need not be so. It may be beautiful and peaceful. Once  
you know that   
death happens to the body and not to you, you just watch your body falling off  
like a discarded   
garment.   
Q: I am fully aware that my fear of death is due to apprehension and not  
knowledge.   
M: Human beings die every second, the fear and the agony of dying hangs over  
the world like a   
cloud. No wonder you too are afraid. But once you know that the body alone  
dies and not the   
continuity of memory and the sense of I am reflected in it, you are afraid  
no longer.   
Q: Well, let us die and see.   
M: Give attention and you will find that birth and death are one, that life  
pulsates between being   
and non-being, and that each needs the other for completeness. You are born to  
die and you die to   
be reborn.   
Q: Does not detachment stop the process?   
M: With detachment the fear goes, but not the fact.   
Q: Shall I be compelled to be reborn? How dreadful!   
M: There is no compulsion. You get what you want. You make your own plans and  
you carry them   
out.   
Q: Do we condemn ourselves to suffer?   
M: We grow through investigation, and to investigate we need experience. We  
tend to repeat what   
we have not understood. If we are sensitive and intelligent, we need not  
suffer. Pain is a call for   
attention and the penalty of carelessness. Intelligent and compassionate  
action is the only remedy.   
Q: It is because I have grown in intelligence that I would not tolerate my  
suffering again. What is   
wrong with suicide?   
M: Nothing wrong, if it solves the problem. What, if it does not? Suffering  
caused by extraneous   
factors -- some painful and incurable disease, or unbearable calamity -- may  
provide some   
justification, but where wisdom and compassion are lacking, suicide cannot  
help. A foolish death   
means foolishness reborn. Besides there is the question of karma to consider.  
Endurance is usually   
the wisest course.   
Q: Must one endure suffering, however acute and hopeless?   
M: Endurance is one thing and helpless agony is another. Endurance is  
meaningful and fruitful,   
while agony is useless.   
Q: Why worry about karma? It takes care of itself anyhow.   
M: Most of our karma is collective. We suffer for the sins of others, as  
others suffer for ours.   
Humanity is one. Ignorance of this fact does not change it. We could have been  
much happier   
people ourselves, but for our indifference to the sufferings of others.   
Q: I find I have grown much more responsive.   
M: Good. When you say it, what do you have in mind? Yourself, as a responsive  
person within a   
female body?   
Q: There is a body and there is compassion and there is memory and a number of  
things and   
attitudes; collectively they may be called a person.   
M: Including the I am idea?   
Q: The I am is like a basket that holds the many things that make a person.   
M: Or, rather, it is the willow of which the basket is woven. When you think  
of yourself as a women,   
do you mean that you are a women, or that your body is described as female?   
Q: It depends on my mood. Sometimes I feel myself to be a mere centre of  
awareness.   
M: Or, an ocean of awareness. But are there moments when you are neither man  
nor women, not   
the accidental, occasioned by circumstances and conditions?   
Q: Yes, there are, but I feel shy to talk about it.   
M: A hint is all that one can expect. You need not say more.**

**_Q: I admit that now I want to go back and live a very active life, because  
I feel full of energy.   
M: You can do what you like, as long as you do not take yourself to be the  
body and the mind. It is   
not so much a question of actual giving up the body and all that goes with it,  
as a clear   
understanding that you are not the body. A sense of aloofness, of emotional  
non-involvement.   
Q: I know what you mean. Some four years ago I passed through a period of  
rejection of the   
physical; I would not buy myself clothes, would eat the simplest foods, sleep  
on bare planks. It is   
the acceptance of the privations that matters, not the actual discomfort. Now  
I have realised that   
welcoming life as it comes and loving all it offers, is best of it. I shall  
accept with glad heart whatever   
comes and make the best of it. If I can do nothing more than give life and  
true culture to a few   
children -- good enough; though my heart goes out to every child, I cannot  
reach all.   
M: You are married and a mother only when you are man-women conscious. When  
you do not   
take yourself to be the body, then the family life of the body, however  
intense and interesting, is   
seen only as a play on the screen of the mind, with the light of awareness as  
the only reality.   
Q: Why do you insist on awareness as the only real? Is not the object of  
awareness as real, while   
it lasts?   
M: But it does not last! Momentary reality is secondary; it depends on the  
timeless.   
Q: Do you mean continuous, or permanent?   
M: There can be no continuity in existence. Continuity implies identity in  
past, present and future.   
No such identity is possible, for the very means of identification fluctuate  
and change. Continuity,   
permanency, these are illusions created by memory, mere mental projections of  
a pattern where no   
pattern can be; Abandon all ideas of temporary or permanent, body or mind, man  
or women; what   
remains? What is the state of your mind when all separation is given up? I am  
not talking of giving   
up distinctions, for without them there is no manifestation.   
Q: When I do not separate, I am happily at peace. But somehow I lose my  
bearings again and   
again and begin to seek happiness in outer things. Why is my inner peace not  
steady, I cannot   
understand.   
M: Peace, after all, is also a condition of the mind.   
Q: Beyond the mind is silence. There is nothing to be said about it.   
M: Yes, all talk about silence is mere noise.   
Q: Why do we seek worldly happiness, even after having tasted ones own  
natural spontaneous   
happiness?   
M: When the mind is engaged in serving the body, happiness is lost. To regain  
it, it seeks pleasure.   
The urge to be happy is right, but the means of securing it are misleading,  
unreliable and destructive of true happiness.   
Q: Is pleasure always wrong?   
M: The right state and use of the body and the mind are intensely pleasant. It  
is the search for   
pleasure that is wrong. Do not try to make yourself happy, rather question  
your very search for   
happiness. It is because you are not happy that you want to be happy. Find out  
why you are   
unhappy. Because you are not happy you seek happiness in pleasure; pleasure  
brings in pain and   
therefore you call it worldly; you then long for some other pleasure, without  
pain, which you call   
divine. In reality, pleasure is but a respite from pain. Happiness is both  
worldly and unworldly, within   
and beyond all that happens. Make no distinction, dont separate the  
inseparable and do not   
alienate yourself from life.   
Q: How well I understand you now! Before my stay at Ramanashram I was  
tyrannised by   
conscience, always sitting in judgement of myself. Now I am completely  
relaxed, fully accepting   
myself as I am. When I return to the States, I shall take life as it comes, as  
Bhagavans grace, and   
enjoy the bitter along with the sweet. This is one of the things I have learnt  
in the Ashram -- to trust   
Bhagavan. I was not like this before. I could not trust.   
M: Trusting Bhagavan is trusting yourself. Be aware that whatever happens,  
happens to you, by   
you, through you, that you are the creator, enjoyer and destroyer of all you  
perceive and you will not   
be afraid. Unafraid, you will not be unhappy, nor will you seek happiness.   
In the mirror of your mind all kinds of pictures appear and disappear. Knowing  
that they are entirely   
your own creations, watch them silently come and go, be alert, but not  
perturbed. This attitude of   
silent observation is the very foundation of Yoga. You see the picture, but  
you are not the picture.   
Q: I find that the thought of death frightens me because I do not want to be  
reborn. I know that   
none compels, yet the pressure of unsatisfied desires is overwhelming and I  
may not be able to   
resist.   
M: The question of resistance does not arise. What is born and reborn is not  
you. Let it happen,   
watch it happen.   
Q: Why then be at all concerned?   
M: But you are concerned! And you will be concerned as long as the picture  
clashes with your own   
sense of truth, love and beauty. The desire for harmony and peace is in  
eradicable. But once it is   
fulfilled, the concern ceases and physical life becomes effortless and below  
the level of attention.   
Then, even in the body you are not born. To be embodied or bodyless is the  
same to you. You   
reach a point when nothing can happen to you. Without body, you cannot be  
killed; without   
possessions you cannot be robbed; without mind, you cannot be deceived. There  
is no point where   
a desire or fear can hook on. As long as no change can happen to you, what  
else matters?   
Q: Somehow I do not like the idea of dying.   
M: It is because you are so young. The more you know yourself the less you are  
afraid.   
Of course, the agony of dying is never pleasant to look at, but the dying man  
is rarely conscious.   
Q: Does he return to consciousness?   
M: It is very much like sleep. For a time the person is out of focus and then  
it returns.   
Q: The same person?   
M: The person, being a creature of circumstances, necessarily changes along  
with them, like the   
flame that changes with the fuel. Only the process goes on and on, creating  
time and space.   
Q: Well, God will look after me. I can leave everything to Him.   
M: Even faith in God is only a stage on the way. Ultimately you abandon all,  
for you come to   
something so simple that there are no words to express it.   
Q: I am just beginning. At the start I had no faith, no trust; I was afraid to  
let things happen. The   
world seemed to be a very dangerous and inimical place. Now, at least I can  
talk of trusting the   
Guru or God. Let me grow. Dont drive me on. Let me proceed at my own pace.   
M: By all means proceed. But you dont. You are still stuck in the ideas of  
man and women, old and   
young, life and death. Go on, go beyond. A thing recognised is a thing  
transcended.   
Q: Sir, wherever I go people take it to be their duty to find faults with me  
and goad me on. I am fed   
up with this spiritual fortune making. What is wrong with my present that it  
should be sacrificed to a   
future, however glorious? You say reality is in the now. I want it. I do not  
want to be eternally   
anxious about my stature and its future. I do not want to chase the more and  
the better. Let me love   
what I have.   
M: You are quite right; do it. Only be honest -- just love what you love --  
dont strive and strain.   
Q: This is what I call surrender to the Guru.   
M: Why exteriorise? Surrender to your own self, of which everything is an  
expression._**

**_M: That incarnating principle  the Moolmaya  gives knowledge to the  
incarnated. The Sun rises out   
of darkness and is the source of light; it is in light and cannot see  
darkness, they are not acquainted with   
each other, abide in the Self to reside in this knowledge. That dynamic  
principal, Moolmaya, pervades   
everything in the world and is stirring, but growth is not eternal, time  
bound. The dynamic growth of a   
4500 years old tree is arrested; the roots of it drew substances from the  
earth, so I amness drew   
nourishment through its food-body. Whatever knowledge you have is embroiled  
with body. This body   
sense is to be consumed and you should dwell on I am everything. Your love  
is based on the I love   
state, this is Maya. There are a lot of forests and there are huge animals,  
this touch of I amness has   
grown into manifest world. That is the Maya principle. You must do penance  
with a strong   
determination and dwell on touch of I amness; that I am is everything.   
V: A woman along with Paul had no parking space, so there was a problem. She  
said I include it and   
then, there was space available for parking.   
M: The place for parking is because of the determination I am everything.  
The common mans   
devotion is that of wanting A.B.C and so forth, its like bargaining, they pay  
no attention to the eternal.   
The Hatha Yogis in the process of the Hatha Yoga acquire Siddhis (powers), so  
they are an attraction   
for the masses but they stagnate there and there is no eternal realization.  
Whatever your mind revels in,   
therein you fall in a pit. The pythons breath reaches very far, many animals  
are attracted towards it.   
Similarly the Kundalini is aroused and people fall prey to it. A man was going  
to Banaras, on the way   
in a village, there was a rich widow. He got married to her and had family, he  
never reached Banaras.   
Whatever the mind revels in, therein is the pit. You never try to transcend  
the mind and have an attempt   
at eternity. Therefore, you should have sharp discrimination; the aboriginals  
have knowledge about the   
python, they carry a sickle with them and when caught by the python they cut  
him out and escape. So   
have discrimination to escape allurements. Yogis who have Siddhis (powers) do  
not use them for a   
livelihood.   
V: Intellectual attraction too is like that?   
M: The knowledge of the Self is of no use when collected from others. Study,  
understand and realize   
Self-knowledge on your own. When one gets fully imbibed in knowledge I am,  
then knowledge   
sprouts in him. Although I look like you, I am not like you. A person sleeping  
in the world of attributes,   
dreams because of the I amness, and accepts the dream body. Similarly you  
take this body to be real   
in this world. I am in the state of attributes because of the command of my  
Guru. Many so-called sages   
talk about incarnations but I am in The Absolute state, whatever needs are  
there, I command the   
beingness to incarnate and take care; I am not affected by the world. In the  
world that I see, whatever   
happens is not happening to that principle, Parabrahman, only to the body,  
something might happen.   
That principle continues to be and has withstood dissolutions of universes.   
One in a million will listen, understand and abide by the advice of the Guru,  
that you are everything,   
he accepts with conviction and becomes the words of the Guru. In most cases,  
the beingness assumes   
that it is a body that has taken shape, so one believes that he is born and  
will die. When there is no   
death and no birth, one can never be born and die. The identification with the  
body is so strong, like the   
hold of the serpent, that it is not easy to do away with it. But we are the  
eternal principle and not what   
we appear to be, the one who knows the seed of this world, realizes that it is  
an illusion, sits quietly and   
doesnt blow a trumpet about it. In this world, if you start investigating  
everything, it would be mind   
boggling. Once having understood that it is all Maya, one becomes speechless.   
The crow eats the seed and from his dropping grows a banyan tree, even on a  
fortress the roots will   
break out. I tell you about your seed, consider your creation, through what  
emissions it has come to be,   
and thus hold no pride in your individuality.

**_cont..   
Maharaj: What is your understanding of being fully enlightened?   
Visitor: The one who has no ego awareness, or no awareness of the I.   
M: Answer in two words.   
V: I cant answer.   
M: Whatever is the whole or complete is the Jnani and that is the age an  
unborn child. The age of an   
unborn child is complete, whole, and total. The one who is not born, what age  
can he have?   
V: Age is a concept.   
M: What more can you do except using words?   
V: People are words.   
M: Whatever knowledge the sages had and whatever knowledge you have now  
acquired, is due to your   
acquaintance with it. Every time there is a flux, it rises still higher but  
what is that ever changing   
principle?   
V: Whatever I experience.   
M: What experience?   
V: The one that I have right now.   
M: In that experience right now, you are having many experiences, but what is  
the base? Are you in   
that state by speaking words? You have no money to buy rations, and you say I  
am a king.   
V: Everyone does that.   
M: Who is all? If you are only then all could be.   
V: Everyone is in my subjective universe, I observe doing that only.   
M: In the realm of the touch (I am), you are finding sages, arent you  
ashamed? You get initiated   
from those who are in the realm of I am. So when I am Poorna (complete), it  
is like indicating the age   
of an unborn child, the words get dumbfound. Therefore I dont visit Jnanis,  
if I do meet one, I offer   
my salutations. I have told you that I have reached that stage where you can  
judge Jnanis, all the rest   
are just trading other peoples words.   
V: I dont want to do that.   
M: Now meditation; what is the content of meditation and what does it merge  
into?   
V: In Zen meditation, one meditates on what was his face was before he was  
conceived.   
M: Who is meditating?   
V: They work on that too.   
M: For the ignorant one, knowledge is precious, but for the one established in  
The Absolute, this   
knowledge is like month-wash water, but they do have bags filled with siddhis  
(powers).   
V: Those are the obvious ones, but those who teach with books they have  
written are a great danger.   
M: Take the example of Janardana, who was not talking, yet he was itching to  
have a successor, would   
a Jnani care to do such a thing?   
V: If I thought be would, I would reject him. If I have an eye problem why  
should I go to a foot doctor?   
M: What is the reference point? And driving at what?   
V: Maharaj commented that I saw something in Rajneeshs book; I feel I dont  
need it.   
M: I am not interested in that, but what is your true eternal state?   
V: OK   
M: What is your core state? In that true accomplished state, there is no scope  
for even space, let alone   
the words. In the process of understanding my Gurus words as to how I am I  
realized I am not. In   
that state there is no unstruck sound either. In the process of Neti,Neti (Not  
this, not this) it happens, in   
the state of I amness finally everything disappears and you get stabilized.  
If you realize and stabilize,   
then even if you are silent people will fall at your feet.   
V: The falling is not important.   
M: Its a stunning stage, and what is it? But for them Ill advocate  
meditation (for common ones, who   
are not like Paul). This is the stage where I uproot the meditation, whenever  
meditation beings, I uproot   
it in this talk. Now if you have swallowed up many sages and are still trying  
to find a peg, you are not   
stabilized.   
V: I want to hang experiences on a peg.   
M: Are they tangible to be hanged? To hold light which peg will you choose?_**

**Visitor: I have pain in the hip, it is difficult for me to say, I am not the  
body.   
Maharaj: There is no alternative presence; gradually you will have a clear  
feeling that this pain is a   
movement in consciousness. You are different from that which moves in the  
consciousness and   
consciousness itself. For example if you dip cotton in scent and keep it  
closed, fumes of the scent   
would come. But we are clear that we are neither the cottoned scent nor the  
smell of perfume, this   
conviction will gradually come.   
The tree seeds one maybe watered, but in many cases a seed sprouts without  
water because it already   
contains the necessary wetness. What is born is this beingness, along with it  
is born waking and   
sleeping states. Consciousness is the seed of not merely the waking and  
sleeping state, but also of the   
entire universe. Out of nothingness is something that is just happening for  
some time.   
This I amness quality is the Sattva guna (food essence quality). I am The  
Absolute, I am not that   
touch of I amness, so long I am is there witnessing will happen to The  
Absolute spontaneously. The   
dawn and sunlight depend on time, but their observer does not depend on time.   
The I am in a child is dormant, it does not know itself, but it is there, in  
due course it knows itself and   
as a one knows I am. Go to the root, the beginning of the child, when you  
understand that you are not   
consciousness, stabilize there; understand and get out. There is no need for  
The Absolute to go into   
Samadhi; it does not go anywhere its always there, while Samadhi is a  
changing state. I amness   
becomes no I amness in Samadhi, waking and deep sleep are phases of I am,  
not of The Absolute.   
All relationships relate to Maya or illusion, but instead of Maya, it is said  
to be God, Godly or Ishwara.   
The experiencing state is Ishwara, and in experiencing, whatever activities  
that take place, are called   
Maya. The highest is not an experiencing state, it is without words and  
meaning, The Absolute is your   
dwelling place while your vocations are in the ever changing state. Whatever  
you know is unreal and   
wherever you say you know is also unreal.   
V: So I should say I dont know?   
M: But by now, do you know or not?   
V: Mind understands, but the transformation has yet to be.   
M: Whatever is getting transformed will not remain, any transformable state  
will not remain. If you   
have accomplished knowledge correctly, you will never know that you are dying.   
V: I will see the corpse dying, like Frydman was so happy dying.   
M: The very tool by which you observe will itself disappear. After so called  
death where is the tool of   
observation? The very instrument or consciousness will not be there.   
V: Most great sages seem to say that they return to light   
.   
M: In that total light or illumined state, there is no question of rising and  
setting of light.   
V: At a lower level, we choose our incarnation. The present birth is my doing,  
so no need to grumble.   
M: This, others have said, and you accept it, what is your direct experience?   
V: None.   
M: Then why do you accept it?   
V: An ignorant person goes by concepts.   
M: Where is the question of faith when the validity of I amness is  
disproved? When everything is   
over, one says it doesnt matter where I die because when you conclude that  
death is itself false, what   
dies? And does it matter where it happens?   
V: I remember with joy the truth that I have heard.   
M: You are a witness of what you remember.   
V: I have a hut which I call Achal (immovable)   
M: Why did you not name it Parabrahman Sadan (the abode of Parabrahman)?   
V: The Postman would be troubled.   
M: Did you build it of stone?   
V: Stone.   
M: What are the dimensions?   
V: Four hundred and fifty square feet   
M: After you, who?   
V: I dont know   
M: It is vacant.   
V: Has Maharaj spoken about beauty?   
M: That by which you are attracted is beauty.   
V: When I am near Maharaj, I feel attraction.   
M: Yes   
V: I see beauty in his eyes; I have to speak about it.   
M: The quality of sight in each person would be different.   
V: So there no definition of beauty?   
M: Yes, whatever definition given in words is always incomplete. Abide in  
whatever you become after   
listening to my talks, whatever may happen, just be. Finally what is left  
over about you as you are,   
be there. (Note: In the morning Maharaj said that after listening to these  
talks, you will not be in   
position to meditate, because no object is left to meditate on. The no object  
state is meditation, there is   
no something left).   
V: Any time meditation is internal, not a stance. I ask Maharaj about his  
experience?   
M: I started meditation in the night period, but this tapered off because the  
meditative mood stabilized,   
no-mind stabilized (Note: All stages that Maharaj has gone through are  
described in the Bhajans or   
devotional songs). What is caste and community of the waking and sleep states?  
Is it Jew, Christian or   
Muslim? Or is it male-female? All these differences are only because of  
identification with the body.   
V: Yes   
M: Could there be beingness in the absence of waking and deep sleep? With this  
cycle you are,   
otherwise how can you be?   
V: My experience is of waking and sleep state.   
M: I amness is there provided these stages are there, by itself it cannot  
be. Simultaneously, all these   
three stages are a product of food essence. In the absence of body sense, is  
there any community of   
waking and sleep states? Have this affirmation, forget spirituality and dwell  
there (in the I am).**

**_Questioner: Once I had a strange experience. I was not, nor was the world,  
there was only light -- within and without -- and immense peace. This lasted  
for four days and then I returned to the every-day consciousness.   
Now I have a feeling that all I know is merely a scaffolding, covering and  
hiding the building under construction. The architect, the design, the plans,  
the purpose -- nothing I know; some activity is going on, things are  
happening; that is all I can say. I am that scaffolding, some thing very  
flimsy and short-lived; when the building is ready, the scaffolding will be  
dismantled and removed. The 'I am' and the 'What am I' are of no importance,  
because once the building is ready, the 'I' will go as a matter of course,  
leaving no questions about itself to answer.   
Maharaj: Are you not aware of all this? Is not the fact of awareness the  
constant factor?   
Q: My sense of permanency and identity is due to memory, which is so  
evanescent and unreliable. How little I remember, even of the recent past! I  
have lived a life-time, and now what is left with me? A bundle of events, at  
best a short story.   
M: All this takes place within your consciousness.   
Q: Within and without. In daytime -- within; in the night -- without.  
Consciousness is not all. So many things happen beyond its reach. To say that  
what I am not conscious of does not exist, is altogether wrong.   
M: What you say is logical, but actually you know only what is in your  
consciousness. What you claim exists outside conscious experience is inferred.   
Q: It may be inferred and yet it is more real than the sensory.   
M: Be careful. The moment you start talking you create a verbal universe, a  
universe of words, ideas, concepts and abstractions, interwoven and inter-  
dependent, most wonderfully generating, supporting and explaining each other  
and yet all without essence or substance, mere creations of the mind. Words  
create words, reality is silent.   
Q: When you talk, I hear you. Is it not a fact?   
M: That you hear is a fact. What you hear -- is not. The fact can be  
experienced, and in that sense the sound of the word and the mental ripples it  
causes are experienced. There is no other reality behind it. Its meaning is  
purely conventional, to be remembered; a language can be easily forgotten,  
unless practiced.   
Q: If words have no reality in them why talk at all?   
M: They serve their limited purpose of inter-personal communication. Words do  
not convey facts, they signal them. Once you are beyond the person, you need  
no words.   
Q: What can take me beyond the person? How to go beyond consciousness?   
M: Words and questions come from the mind and hold you there. To go beyond  
the mind, you must be silent and quiet. Peace and silence, silence and peace  
-- this is the way beyond. Stop asking questions.   
Q: Once I give up asking questions, what am I to do?   
M: What can you do but wait and watch?   
Q: What am I to wait for?   
M: For the centre of your being to emerge into consciousness. The three  
states -- sleeping, dreaming and waking are all in consciousness, the  
manifested; what you call unconsciousness will also be manifested -- in time;  
beyond consciousness altogether lies the unmanifested. And beyond all, and  
pervading all, is the heart of being which beats steadily -- manifested-  
unmanifested; manifested-unmanifested (saguna-nirguna).   
Q: On the verbal level it sounds all right. I can visualise myself as the  
seed of being, a point in consciousness, with my sense 'I am' pulsating,  
appearing and disappearing alternately. But what am I to do to realise it as a  
fact, to go beyond into the changeless, wordless Reality?   
M: You can do nothing. What time has brought about, time will take away.   
Q: Why then all these exhortations to practice Yoga and seek reality? They  
make me feel empowered and responsible, while in fact it is time that does  
all.   
M: This is the end of Yoga -- to realise independence. All that happens,  
happens in and to the mind, not to the source of the 'I am'. Once you realise  
that all happens by itself, (call it destiny, or the will of God or mere  
accident), you remain as witness only, understanding and enjoying, but not  
perturbed.   
Q: If I cease trusting words altogether, what will be my condition?   
M: There is a season for trusting and for distrusting. Let the seasons do  
their work, why worry?   
Q: Somehow I feel responsible for what happens around me.   
M: You are responsible only for what you can change. All you can change is  
only your attitude. There lies your responsibility.   
Q: You are advising me to remain indifferent to the sorrows of others!   
M: It is not that you are indifferent. All the sufferings of mankind do not  
prevent you from enjoying your next meal. The witness is not indifferent. He  
is the fullness of understanding and compassion. Only as the witness you can  
help another.   
Q: All my life I was fed on words. The number of words I have heard and read  
go into the billions. Did it benefit me? Not at all!   
M: The mind shapes the language and the language shapes the mind. Both are  
tools, use them but don't misuse them. Words can bring you only unto their own  
limit; to go beyond, you must abandon them. Remain as the silent witness only.   
Q: How can I? The world disturbs me greatly.   
M: It is because you think yourself big enough to be affected by the world.  
It is not so. You are so small that nothing can pin you down. It is your mind  
that gets caught, not you. Know yourself as you are -- a mere point in  
consciousness, dimensionless and timeless. You are like the point of the  
pencil -- by mere contact with you the mind draws its picture of the world.  
You are single and simple -- the picture is complex and extensive. Don't be  
misled by the picture -- remain aware of the tiny point -- which is everywhere  
in the picture.   
What is, can cease to be; what is not, can come to be; but what neither is nor  
is not, but on which being and non-being depend, is unassailable; know  
yourself to be the cause of desire and fear, itself free from both.   
Q: How am I the cause of fear?   
M: All depends on you. It is by your consent that the world exists. Withdraw  
your belief in its reality and it will dissolve like a dream. Time can bring  
down mountains; much more you, who are the timeless source of time. For  
without memory and expectation there can be no time.   
Q: Is the 'I am' the Ultimate?   
M: Before you can say: 'I am', you must be there to say it. Being need not be  
self-conscious. You need not know to be, but you must be to know.   
Q: Sir, I am getting drowned in a sea of words! I can see that all depends  
on how the words are out together, but there must be somebody to put them  
together -- meaningfully. By drawing words at random the Ramayana, Mahabharata  
and Bhagavata could never be produced. The theory of accidental emergence is  
not tenable. The origin of the meaningful must be beyond it. What is the power  
that creates order out of chaos? Living is more than being, and consciousness  
is more than living. Who is the conscious living being?   
M: Your question contains the answer: a conscious living being is a conscious  
living being. The words are most appropriate, but you do not grasp their full  
import. Go deep into the meaning of the words: being, living, conscious, and  
you will stop running in circles, asking questions, but missing answers. Do  
understand that you cannot ask a valid question about yourself, because you do  
not know whom you are asking about. In the question 'Who am I?' the 'I' is not  
known and the question can be worded as: 'I do not know what I mean by 'I' '  
What you are, you must find out. I can only tell you what you are not. You are  
not of the world, you are not even in the world. The world is not, you alone  
are. You create the world in your imagination like a dream. As you cannot  
separate the dream from yourself, so you cannot have an outer world  
independent of yourself. You are independent, not the world. Don't be afraid  
of a world you yourself have created. Cease from looking for happiness and  
reality in a dream and you will wake up. You need not know ?why? and ?how?,  
there is no end to questions. Abandon all desires, keep your mind silent and  
you shall discover._**

**_For our life is now, and the love of it is now.   
We love variety, the play of pain and pleasure, we are fascinated by  
contrasts.   
For this we need the opposites and their apparent separation.   
We enjoy them for a time and then get tired

**The ?I AM? Meditation**   
?You are not what you take yourself to be. Find out what you are.   
Watch the sense ?I am?, and find your real Self.   
Go deep into the sense of ?I am? and you will find your true Self.   
How do you find a thing you have mislaid or forgotten?   
You keep it in your mind until you recall it.   
The sense of being, of ?I am? is the first to emerge.   
Ask yourself whence it comes or just watch it quietly.   
When the mind stays in the ?I am?, without moving, you enter a state,   
which cannot be verbalised, but which can be experienced.   
Hold on to the sense ?I am? tenaciously and do not swerve from it even for a  
moment.   
This will bring an end to the mind;   
in the stillness of the mind you will see yourself as ?I am? ? unbound.   
The sense of ?I am? is always with you, only you have attached all kinds of  
things to it ?   
body, feelings, thoughts, ideas, possessions and so on.   
All these self-identifications are misleading,   
because of these you take yourself to be what you are not.   
All you need to do is to try and try again to stabilise within the naked ?I  
am? experience.?

**EARNESTNESS**   
Q: What is the purpose of meditation?   
M: Seeing the false as the false, is meditation. This must go on all the time.   
Q: We are told to meditate regularly.   
M: Deliberate daily exercise in discrimination between the true and the false  
and renunciation of the false is meditation. There are many kinds of  
meditation to begin with, but they all merge finally into one.   
Q: Please tell me which road to self-realization is the shortest.   
M: No way is short or long, but some people are more in earnest and some are  
less. I can tell you about myself. I was a simple man, but I trusted my Guru.  
What he told me to do, I did. He told me to concentrate on 'I am' \-- I did.  
He told me that I am beyond all perceivables and conceivables -- I believed.   
I gave him my heart and soul, my entire attention and the whole of my spare  
time (I had to work to keep my family alive). As a result of faith and earnest  
application, I realized my self (swarupa) within three years.   
You may choose any way that suits you; your earnestness will determine the  
rate of progress.   
Q: No hint for me?   
M: Establish yourself firmly in the awareness of 'I am'. This is the beginning  
and also the end of all endeavor.

**_Questioner: I hear you making statements about yourself like: 'I am  
timeless, immutable beyond   
attributes', etc. How do you know these things? And what makes you say them?   
Maharaj: I am only trying to describe the state before the ?I am? arose, but  
the state itself, being   
beyond the mind and language, is indescribable.   
Q: The 'I am' is the foundation of all experience. What you are trying to  
describe must also be an   
experience, limited and transitory. You speak of yourself as immutable. I hear  
the sound of the   
word, I remember its dictionary meaning, but the experience of being immutable  
I do not have. How   
can I break through the barrier and know personally, intimately, what it means  
to be immutable?   
M: The word itself is the bridge. Remember it, think of it, explore it, go  
round it, look at it from all   
directions, dive into it with earnest perseverance: endure all delays and  
disappointments till   
suddenly the mind turns round, away from the word, towards the reality beyond  
the word. It is like   
trying to find a person knowing his name only. A day comes when your enquiries  
bring you to him   
and the name becomes reality. Words are valuable, for between the word and its  
meaning there is a   
link and if one investigates the word assiduously, one crosses beyond the  
concept into the   
experience at the root of it. As a matter of fact, such repeated attempts to  
go beyond the words is   
called meditation. Sadhana is but a persistent attempt to cross over from the  
verbal to the nonverbal.   
The task seems hopeless until suddenly all becomes clear and simple and so  
wonderfully   
easy. But, as long as you are interested in your present way of living, you  
will shirk from the final   
leap into the unknown.   
Q: Why should the unknown interest me? Of what use is the unknown?   
M: Of no use whatsoever. But it is worthwhile to know what keeps you within  
the narrow confines of   
the known. It is the full and correct knowledge of the known that takes you to  
the unknown. You   
cannot think of it in terms of uses and advantages; to be quite detached,  
beyond the reach of all selfconcern,   
all selfish consideration, is an inescapable condition of liberation. You may  
call it death; to   
me it is living at its most meaningful and intense, for I am one with life in  
its totality and fullness --   
intensity, meaningfulness, harmony; what more do you want?   
Q: Nothing more is needed, of course. But you are talking of the knowable.   
M: Of the unknowable only silence talks. The mind can talk only of what it  
knows. If you diligently   
investigate the knowable, it dissolves and only the unknowable remains. But  
with the first flicker of   
imagination and interest the unknowable is obscured and the known comes to the  
fore-front. The   
known, the changeable, is what you live with -- the unchangeable is of no use  
to you. It is only when   
you are satiated with the changeable and long for the unchangeable, that you  
are ready for the   
turning round and stepping into what can be described, when seen from the  
level of the mind, as   
emptiness and darkness. For the mind craves for content and variety, while  
reality is, to the mind,   
contentless and invariable.   
Q: It looks like death to me.   
M: It is. It is also all-pervading, all-conquering, intense beyond words. No  
ordinary brain can stand   
it without being shattered; hence the absolute need for sadhana. Purity of  
body and clarity of mind,   
non-violence and selflessness in life are essential for survival as an  
intelligent and spiritual entity.   
Q: Are there entities in reality?   
M: Identity is Reality, Reality is identity. Reality is not shapeless mass, a  
wordless chaos. It is   
powerful, aware, blissful; compared to it your life is like a candle to the  
sun.   
Q: By the grace of God and your teacher's you lost all desire and fear and  
reached the immovable   
state. My question is simple -- how do you know that your state is immovable?   
M: Only the changeable can be thought of and talked about. The unchangeable  
can only be   
realised in silence. Once realised, it will deeply affect the changeable,  
itself remaining unaffected.   
Q: How do you know that you are the witness?   
M: I do not know, I am. I am, because to be everything must be witnessed.   
Q: Existence can also be accepted on hearsay.   
M: Still, finally you come to the need of a direct witness. Witnessing, if not  
personal and actual,   
must at least be possible and feasible. Direct experience is the final proof.   
Q: Experience may be faulty and misleading.   
M: Quite, but not the fact of an experience. Whatever may be the experience,  
true or false, the fact   
of an experience taking place cannot be denied. It is its own proof. Watch  
yourself closely and you   
will see that whatever be the content of consciousness, the witnessing of it  
does not depend on the   
content. Awareness is itself and does not change with the event. The event may  
be pleasant or   
unpleasant, minor or important, awareness is the same. Take note of the  
peculiar nature of pure   
awareness, its natural self-identity, without the least trace of self-  
consciousness, and go to the root   
of it and you will soon realise that awareness is your true nature and nothing  
you may be aware of,   
you can call your own.   
Q: Is not consciousness and its content one and the same?   
M: Consciousness is like a cloud in the sky and the water drops are the  
content. The cloud needs   
the sun to become visible, and consciousness needs being focussed in  
awareness.   
Q: Is not awareness a form of consciousness?   
M: When the content is viewed without likes and dislikes, the consciousness of  
it is awareness. But   
still there is a difference between awareness as reflected in consciousness  
and pure awareness   
beyond consciousness. Reflected awareness, the sense 'I am aware' is the  
witness, while pure   
awareness is the essence of reality. Reflection of the sun in a drop of water  
is the reflection of the   
sun, no doubt, but not the sun itself. Between awareness reflected in  
consciousness as the witness   
and pure awareness there is a gap, which the mind cannot cross.   
Q: Does it not depend on the way you look at it? The mind says there is a  
difference. The heart   
says there is none.   
M: Of course there is no difference. The real sees the real in the unreal. It  
is the mind that creates   
the unreal and it is the mind that sees the false as false.   
Q: I understood that the experience of the real follows seeing the false as  
false.   
M: There is no such thing as the experience of the real. The real is beyond  
experience. All   
experience is in the mind. You know the real by being real.   
Q: If the real is beyond words and mind, why do we talk so much about it?   
M: For the joy of it, of course. The real is bliss supreme. Even to talk of it  
is happiness._**

**_Maharaj: There is the body. Inside the body appears to be an observer and  
outside -- a world under observation. The observer and his observation as well  
as the world observed all appear and disappear together. Beyond it all, there  
is void. This void is one for all.   
Questioner: What you say appears simple, but not everyone would say it. It is  
you, and you alone, who talks of the three and the void beyond. I see the  
world only, which includes all.   
M: Even the 'I am'?   
Q: Even the 'I am'. The 'I am' is there because the world is there.   
M: And the world is there because the 'I am' is there.   
Q: Yes, it goes both ways. I cannot separate the two, nor go beyond, I  
cannot say something is, unless I experience it, as I cannot say something is  
not, because I do not experience it. What is it that you experience that makes  
you speak with such assurance?   
M: I know myself as I am -- timeless, spaceless, causeless. You happen not to  
know, being engrossed as you are in other things.   
Q: Why am I so engrossed?   
M: Because you are interested.   
Q: What makes me interested?   
M: Fear of pain, desire for pleasure. Pleasant is the ending of pain and  
painful the end of pleasure. They just rotate in endless succession.  
Investigate the vicious circle till you find yourself beyond it.   
Q: Don't I need your grace to take me beyond?   
M: The grace of your Inner Reality is timelessly with you. Your very asking  
for grace is a sign of it. Do not worry about my grace, but do what you are  
told. The doing is the proof of earnestness, not the expecting of grace.   
Q: What am I to be earnest about?   
M: Assiduously investigate everything that crosses your field of attention.  
With practice the field will broaden and investigation deepen, until they  
become spontaneous and limitless.   
Q: Are you not making realisation the result of practice? Practice operates  
within the limitations of physical existence. How can it give birth to the  
unlimited?   
M: Of course, there can be no causal connection between practice and wisdom.  
But the obstacles to wisdom are deeply affected by practice.   
Q: What are the obstacles?   
M: Wrong ideas and desires leading to wrong actions, causing dissipation and  
weakness of mind and body. The discovery and abandonment of the false remove  
what prevents the real entering the mind.   
Q: I can distinguish two states of mind: 'I am' and 'the world is?; they  
arise and subside together. People say: 'I am, because the world is'. You seem  
to say: 'The world is, because I am'. Which is true?   
M: Neither. The two are one and the same state, in space and time. Beyond,  
there is the timeless.   
Q: What is the connection between time and the timeless?   
M: The timeless knows the time, the time does not know the timeless. All  
consciousness is in time and to it the timeless appears unconscious. Yet, it  
is what makes consciousness possible. Light shines in darkness. In light  
darkness is not visible. Or, you can put it the other way -- in the endless  
ocean of light, clouds of consciousness appear -- dark and limited,  
perceivable by contrast. These are mere attempts to express in words something  
very simple, yet altogether inexpressible.   
Q: Words should serve as a bridge to cross over.   
M: Word refers to a state of mind, not to reality. The river, the two banks,  
the bridge across -- these are all in the mind. Words alone cannot take you  
beyond the mind. There must be the immense longing for truth, or absolute  
faith in the Guru. Believe me, there is no goal, nor a way to reach it. You  
are the way and the goal, there is nothing else to reach except yourself. All  
you need is to understand and understanding is the flowering of the mind. The  
tree is perennial, but the flowering and the fruit bearing come in season. The  
seasons change, but not the tree. You are the tree. You have grown numberless  
branches and leaves in the past and you may grow them also in the future --  
yet you remain. Not what was, or shall be, must you know, but what is. Yours  
is the desire that creates the universe. Know the world as your own creation  
and be free.   
Q: You say the world is the child of love. When I know the horrors the world  
is full of, the wars, the concentration camps, the inhuman exploitations, how  
can I own it as my own creation? However limited I am, I could not have  
created so cruel a world.   
M: Find to whom this cruel world appears and you will know why it appears so  
cruel. Your questions are perfectly legitimate, but just cannot be answered  
unless you know whose is the world. To find out the meaning of a thing you  
must ask its maker. I am telling you: You are the maker of the world in which  
you live -- you alone can change it, or unmake it.   
Q: How can you say I have made the world? I hardly know it.   
M: There is nothing in the world that you cannot know, when you know  
yourself. Thinking yourself to be the body you know the world as a collection  
of material things. When you know yourself as a centre of consciousness, the  
world appears as the ocean of the mind. When you know yourself as you are in  
reality, you know the world as yourself.   
Q: It all sounds very beautiful, but does not answer my question. Why is  
there so much suffering in the world?   
M: If you stand aloof as observer only, you will not suffer. You will see the  
world as a show. a most entertaining show indeed.   
Q: Oh, no! This lila theory I shall not have. The suffering is too acute and  
all-pervading. What a perversion to be entertained by a spectacle of  
suffering! What a cruel God are you offering me!   
M: The cause of suffering is in the identification of the perceiver with the  
perceived. Out of it desire is born and with desire blind action, unmindful of  
results. Look round and you will see -- suffering is a man-made thing.   
Q: Were a man to create his own sorrow only, I would agree with you. But in  
his folly he makes others suffer. A dreamer has his own private nightmare and  
none suffers but himself. But what kind of dream is it that plays havoc in the  
lives of others?   
M: Descriptions are many and contradictory. Reality is simple -- all is one,  
harmony is the eternal law, none compels to suffer. It is only when you try to  
describe and explain, that the words fail you.   
Q: I remember Gandhiji telling me once that the Self is not bound by the law  
of non-violence (ahimsa). The Self has the freedom to impose suffering on its  
expressions in order to set them right.   
M: On the level of duality it may be so, but in reality there is only the  
source, dark in itself, making everything shine. Unperceived, it causes  
perception. Unfelt, it causes feeling. Unthinkable, it causes thought. Non-  
being, it gives birth to being. It is the immovable background of motion. Once  
you are there you are at home everywhere.   
Q: If I am that, then what causes me to be born?   
M: The memory of the past unfulfilled desires traps energy, which manifests  
itself as a person. When its charge gets exhausted, the person dies.  
Unfulfilled desires are carried over into the next birth. Self-identification  
with the body creates ever fresh desires and there is no end to them, unless  
this mechanism of bondage is clearly seen. It is clarity that is liberating,  
for you cannot abandon desire, unless its causes and effects are clearly seen.  
I do not say that the same person is reborn. It dies and dies for good. But  
its memories remain and their desires and fears. They supply the energy for a  
new person. The real takes no part in it, but makes it possible by giving it,  
the light.   
Q: My difficulty is this. As I can see, every experience is its own reality.  
It is there -- experienced. The moment I question it and ask to whom it  
happens, who is the observer and so on, the experience is over and all I can  
investigate is only the memory of it. I just cannot investigate the living  
moment -- the now. My awareness is of the past, not of the present. When I am  
aware, I do not really live in the now, but only in the past. Can there really  
be an awareness of the present?   
M: What you are describing is not awareness at all, but only thinking about  
the experience. True awareness (samvid) is a state of pure witnessing, without  
the least attempt to do anything about the event witnessed. Your thoughts and  
feelings, words and actions may also be a part of the event; you watch all  
unconcerned in the full light of clarity and understanding. You understand  
precisely what is going on, because it does not affect you. It may seem to be  
an attitude of cold aloofness, but it is not really so. Once you are in it,  
you will find that you love what you see, whatever may be its nature. This  
choiceless love is the touchstone of awareness. If it is not there, you are  
merely interested -- for some personal reasons.   
Q: As long as there are pain and pleasure, one is bound to be interested.   
M: And as long as one is conscious, there will be pain and pleasure. You  
cannot fight pain and pleasure on the level of consciousness. To go beyond  
them you must go beyond consciousness, which is possible only when you look at  
consciousness as something that happens to you and not in you, as something  
external, alien, superimposed. Then, suddenly you are free of consciousness,  
really alone, with nothing to intrude. And that is your true state.  
Consciousness is an itching rash that makes you scratch. Of course, you cannot  
step out of consciousness for the very idea of stepping out is in  
consciousness. But if you learn to look at your consciousness as a sort of  
fever, personal and private, in which you are enclosed like a chick in its  
shell, out of this very attitude will come the crisis which will break the  
shell.   
Q: Buddha said that life is suffering.   
M: He must have meant that all consciousness is painful, which is obvious.   
Q: And does death offer delivery?   
M: One who believes himself as having been born is very much afraid of death.  
On the other hand, to him who knows himself truly, death is a happy event.   
Q: The Hindu tradition says that suffering is brought by destiny and destiny  
is merited. Look at the immense calamities, natural or man-made, floods and  
earthquakes, wars and revolutions. Can we dare to think that each suffers for  
his own sins, of which he can have no idea? The billions who suffer, are they  
all criminals justly punished?   
M: Must one suffer only for one's own sins? Are we really separate? In this  
vast ocean of life we suffer for the sins of others, and make others suffer  
for our sins. Of course, the law of balance rules Supreme and accounts are  
squared in the end. But while life lasts, we affect each other deeply.   
Q: Yes, as the poet says: 'No man is an island'.   
M: At the back of every experience is the Self and its interest in the  
experience. Call it desire, call it love -- words do not matter.   
Q: Can I desire suffering? Can I deliberately ask for pain? Am I not like a  
man who made for himself a downy bed hoping for a good night of sleep and then  
he is visited by a nightmare and he tosses and screams in his dream? Surely,  
it is not the love that produces nightmares.   
M: All suffering is caused by selfish isolation, by insularity and greed.  
When the cause of suffering is seen and removed, suffering ceases._**

## Re:[774]Love,always love and only love Quotes of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj  
Author: Jewell              Date: April 04, 2017, 08:12:52 PM

**_Maharaj: As long as there is the body and the sense of identity with the   
body, frustration is inevitable. Only when you know yourself as entirely alien  
to and   
different from the body, will you find respite from the mixture of fear and  
craving   
inseparable from the 'I-am-the-body' idea. Merely assuaging fears and  
satisfying   
desires will not remove this sense of emptiness you are trying to escape from;  
only   
self-knowledge can help you.   
Q: I have so much to do. I just cannot afford to keep my mind quiet.   
M: It is because of your illusion that you are the doer. In reality things are   
done to you, not by you.   
Q: If I just let things happen, how can I be sure that they will happen my   
way? Surely I must bend them to my desire.   
M: Your desire just happens to you along with its fulfilment, or  
nonfulfilment.   
You can change neither. You may believe that you exert yourself, strive   
and struggle. Again, it all merely happens, including the fruits of the work.  
Nothing   
is by you and for you. All is in the picture exposed on the cinema screen,  
nothing in   
the light, including what you take yourself to be, the person. You are the  
light only.   
Q: If I am light only, how did I come to forget it?   
M: You have not forgotten. It is in the picture on the screen that you forget   
and then remember. You never cease to be a man because you dream to be a  
tiger.   
Similarly you are pure light appearing as a picture on the screen and also  
becoming   
one with it.   
Q: Since all happens, why should I worry?   
M: Exactly. Freedom is freedom from worry. Having realised that you   
cannot influence the results, pay no attention to your desires and fears. Let  
them   
come and go. Don't give them the nourishment of interest and attention.   
Q: If life is so wonderful, how could ignorance happen?   
M: You want to treat the disease without having seen the patient! Before   
you ask about ignorance, why don't you enquire first who is the ignorant? When  
you   
say you are ignorant, you do not know that you have imposed the concept of   
ignorance over the actual state of your thoughts and feelings. Examine them as  
they   
occur, give them your full attention and you will find that there is nothing  
like   
ignorance, only inattention. Give attention to what worries you, that is all.  
After all,   
worry is mental pain and pain is invariably a call for attention. The moment  
you give   
attention, the call for it ceases and the question of ignorance dissolves.  
Instead of   
waiting for an answer to your question, find out who is asking the question  
and what   
makes him ask it. You will soon find that it is the mind, goaded by fear of  
pain, that   
asks the question. And in fear there is memory and anticipation, past and  
future.   
Attention brings you back to the present, the now, and the presence in the now  
is a   
state ever at hand, but rarely noticed.   
Q: We love only ourselves.   
M: Were it so, it would be splendid! Love your Self wisely and you will   
reach the summit of perfection. Everybody loves his body, but few love their  
real   
being.   
Q: Does my real being need my love?   
M: Your real being is love itself and your many loves are its reflections   
according to the situation at the moment.   
Q: Yet I do not understand why the various Gurus insist on prescribing   
complicated and difficult sadhanas. Don't they know better?   
M: It is not what you do, but what you stop doing that matters. The people   
who begin their sadhana are so feverish and restless, that they have to be  
very busy   
to keep themselves on the track. An absorbing routine is good for them. After  
some   
time they quieten down and turn away from effort. In peace and silence the  
skin of   
the 'I' dissolves and the inner and the outer become one. The real sadhana is   
effortless.   
Q: I have sometimes the feeling that space itself is my body.   
M: When you are bound by the illusion: 'I am this body', you are merely a   
point in space and a moment in time. When the self-identification with the  
body is   
no more, all space and time are in your mind, which is a mere ripple in   
consciousness, which is awareness reflected in nature. Awareness and matter  
are the   
active and the passive aspects of pure being, which is in both and beyond  
both.   
Space and time are the body and the mind of the universal existence. My  
feeling is   
that all that happens in space and time happens to me, that every experience  
is my   
experience, every form is my form. What I take myself to be becomes my body,  
and   
all that happens to that body becomes my mind. But at the root of the universe  
there   
is pure awareness, beyond space and time, here and now. Know it to be your  
real   
being and act accordingly._**

**I will explain to you a simple technique, which is called Dhyana Yoga  
[realization via meditation]:**   
Sit in the open air every day in the morning? at any convenient time,  
irrespective of any laws and regularities?on a simple asana [seat or posture],  
for 30-60 minutes. Keep your eyes half open and [be aware of] your nose-tip.  
This is only to withdraw your mind from external sense-organs.   
Then try to be aware of the Seer. You have not to think about sense-organs.  
You have only to do nothing?no thoughts. Be only aware of the one who is  
sitting in Dhyana [meditation]. You have to focus on him only. Be aware of the  
One, who is beyond body, without body [videha].   
Practice this slowly, slowly every day and all your problems will be solved.  
Have the feeling of Caitanya Brahman [Divine Reality as Pure Consciousness].  
Be aware of Purnam [wholeness, fullness]. If your eyes close during this, let  
it be. You will aware space. All forms of which you are aware within are  
modifications or shapes of the One who is sitting.   
Call him Krishna, Shiva, or any other divine Name. It is all darshan of the  
one who is sitting. Continue sitting in this sadhana [spiritual practice].  
From within, That will give its message, guidance, and spontaneous insight.  
Remember: ?I am not the body.? Be aware of the Seer. ?I am beyond the body.?

Q: The truth is that I am a mind imprisoned in a body and this is a very  
unhappy truth.   
M: You are neither the body nor in the body -- there is no such thing as body.  
You have grievously misunderstood yourself; to understand rightly --  
investigate.   
Q: But I was born as a body, in a body and shall die with the body, as a body.   
M: This is your misconception. Enquire, investigate, doubt yourself and  
others. To find truth, you must not cling to your convictions; if you are sure  
of the immediate, you will never reach the ultimate. Your idea that you were  
born and that you will die is absurd: both logic and experience contradict it.

Meditation is a deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher states of  
consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of meditation is the art of  
shifting the focus of attention to ever subtler levels, without losing one's  
grip on the levels left behind. In a way it is like having death under  
control. One begins with the lowest levels: social circumstances, customs and  
habits; physical surroundings, the posture and the breathing of the body, the  
senses, their sensations and perceptions; the mind, its thoughts and feelings;  
until the entire mechanism of personality is grasped and firmly held. The  
final stage of meditation is reached when the sense of identity goes beyond  
the 'I-am-so-and-so', beyond 'so-l-am', beyond 'I-am-the-witness-only', beyond  
'there-is', beyond all ideas into the impersonally personal pure being. But  
you must be energetic when you take to meditation. It is definitely not a  
part-time occupation. Limit your interests and activities to what is needed  
for you and your dependents' barest needs. Save all your energies and time for  
breaking the wall your mind had built around you. Believe me, you will not  
regret.

**அ பிராமி அந்தாதியும் ? காமகோட்டமும்   
SOURCE : http://mahaperiyavaa.wordpress.com   
அபிராமி அந்தாதியும் ? காமகோட்டமும் என்ற தலைப்பில் ஒரு சிறு புத்தகம் பிரசுரிக்க  
ஸ்ரீ பெரியவர்கள் விரும்பினார்கள். அதற்குச் சில தினங்கள் முன் ஒரு நாள் என்னை  
வரும்படி உத்தரவு வந்தது.   
நான் தர்சனம் செய்து கொண்டபோது, அவர்கள் ? அபிராமிபட்டர் அநேகமாக முழுக்க,  
காமாக்ஷியைப் பற்றி, அவருடைய அந்தாதியில் பாடியிருக்கிறார் தெரியுமா ??, என்றார்  
. நான் ? இல்லையே ! அபிராமி பற்றித்தான் பாடியிருக்கிறார் ? என்றேன்.   
ஸ்ரீ பெரியவர்கள், ?அபிராமி அவருக்கு அபிமான தேவதை ஆனால் உபாசனா தேவதையான  
காமாக்ஷியைப் பற்றித்தான்   
பெரும்பாலும் பாடியிருக்கிறார் என்று ஊகித்துப் பார்த்தால் சில பாடல்களிலிருந்து  
தெரியும். ?எப்படின்னு தெரியுமா?   
என்று சொல்லியபின், அபிராமி அந்தாதியிலிருந்து ஒரு பாட்டை சொன்னார்கள்.   
துணையும், தொழும் தெய்வமும் பெற்ற தாயும், சுருதிகளின்   
பணையும் கொழுந்தும் பதிகொண்ட வேரும்-பனி மலர்ப்பூங்   
கணையும், கருப்புச் சிலையும், மென் பாசாங்குசமும், கையில்

காமாக்ஷியைத் தவிர வேறு எங்குமில்லை. ?   
பிறகு பெரியவர்கள் ? காமாக்ஷி எந்த ஆசனம் போட்டு உட்கார்ந்திருகிறாள்?? என்று  
கேட்டபோது, நான் ?பத்மாசனம் ? என்றேன்.   
அதற்கு பெரியவர்கள் ? இல்லை ?யோகாசனம்? என்று கூறி தானே யோகாசனம் போட்டு  
காட்டினார்கள். பிறகு ?இந்த யோகாசனத்தில்   
இருபாதங்களும் ஒன்றாக இணையும். சுக்ஷும்னா நாடி தானாக மேலே கிளம்பும். அம்பாள்  
கோவிலில் காமாக்ஷி, ஆச்சார்யாள்,   
துர்வாசர் ஆகிய மூன்று மூர்த்திகளுமே யோகாசனத்தில் தான் இருகின்றன? என்று சொல்லி  
பெரியவர்கள் என்னை அழைத்து   
போய் காட்டினார்கள்.

O consort of the lady with beautiful eyes, with mascera! After You took over  
me and gave me service to You (in Tirup Perundurai   
in building temple), I thought You are not a rare God and You are like a  
golden bowl on my hand. O Lord with Vibhuti on   
Your body, the true devotees have attained the Truth, that is You. However  
this person with falsity, why did you not   
allow me to attain You, but left me in lurch? Is it okay for Your  
compassionate nature?   
Arunachala Siva.

The following verse is again from Tiruch Sadagam (Holy Hundred), Tiruvachakam,  
5.10.5.   
வான நாடரும் அறி ஒணாத நீ   
மறையில் ஈறும் முன் தொடர் ஒணாத நீ   
ஏனை நாடரும் தெரி ஒணாத நீ   
என்னை இன்னிதாய் ஆண்டு கொண்டவா   
ஊனை நாடகம் ஆடு வித்தவா   
உருகி நான் உனைப் பருக வைத்தவா   
ஞான நாடகம் ஆடு வித்தவா   
நைய வையகத்து உடைய விச்சையே.   
Even the devas who reside in Heavens, cannot comprehend You. Even the end of  
Vedas cannot follow You and attain   
You. Even other persons who live in this world or other worlds cannot know  
You. However, You have out of grace   
and compassion took over me and governed me. You made this fleshy body act in  
this world at Your will. You made me   
melt and drink You. You made me perform the drama of Jnana. O It is Your  
will in this world towards me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir,   
Thank you very much for giving Thruvachchakam with meaning. When  
Mannikkavachchakar calls himself a lowly dog, (Nayyen) how we call ourselves.  
His poems bring so sweet as Ramalinga adigalar says, therefore Siva Himself  
came to write it down.   
!. Mahabharatha is written by Ganesha while a human being Vyasa recited.   
In the same way Siva wrote Thruvachchakam as another human dicted.   
 Hope we can see more poems in this thread.

Dear ramanaduli,   
What you say is 100% true. The Saint merely sang the songs as he was going  
from temple to temple. Then he reached   
Chidambaram. He was quite tired of the journey and was taking rest in a  
choultry. Then Siva thought that these gems of   
poems should be written down for the benefit of posterity. In the early night,  
He came as an old brahmin and asked   
the Saint whether he could sing Tiruvachakam songs once again for his benefit.  
The saint though tired, started singing   
them in the same order, Siva puranam to Acho Padigam. The old brahmin took  
them down and then went away thanking   
him. Then Siva kept those palm leaves near Him in Chidambaram Temple. In the  
morning when Dikshitars came and opened   
the Kanaka Sabha,(Hall of Consciousness), they found these palm leaves. They  
sent word for the King and also the saint   
poet. They came and found to their astonishment written at the end of the palm  
leaves: Manikkavachagar solla,   
Azhgiya Tiruchitrambalam Udaiyaan ezhuthiathu !. ... (As Manikka Vachagar  
said, I, who stay in TiruchiRRambalam, the handsome   
TiruchchiRRambalam Udaiyan, the owner of Hall of Consciousness wrote  
down......) They then asked the poet and he said, that he did not know  
anything, but a brahmin came the previous night and took down his poems.   
The King and Dikshitars then asked for the meaning. The saint said: 'What  
meaning can I say? The meaning is only Him.'   
Then he showed while saying these words, to Nararaja and Sivakaama Sundari.  
Then immediately he became a flash of   
light and merged with 'Siva. The King then arranged a metal icon done as  
the poet and installed the same near to the other   
side (right side of Siva. Thus we can see today, the Saint, Nataraja and  
Sivakaama valli in that order. Then the king ordered   
the Dikshitars to make a copy of the palm leaves and then placed the originals  
under the steps on the right side as we enter   
the temple. These steps are even today are called : Tiruk KaLiRRup Padiyar.  
(The holy steps).   
Once someone asked one great scholar Sri Thyaga Raja Mudaliar to write the  
meanings of these poems.Then Mudaliar   
said: You want me to write the meaning? Who can write the meaning? Instead  
I shall jump into the river Kaveri and die.   
Such is the greatness of these poems.Later some persons have written meanings.  
Dr. G.U. Pope made it into English in   
the year 1900. He was a Jesuit father, who learned Tamizh for propagating his  
religion in Southern Tamil Nadu. He was   
in charge of a church there, in Tirunelveli. He was thrilled to read these  
poems and then said: There is nothing more devotional   
than these songs in any of world poetry. He shed tears as he made these  
translations.   
When he was in death bed, in London, he asked his servant to bring  
Tiruvachakam and read a particular verse. (See my next   
post). As he was reading this particular verse in Adaikala Pathu, he breathed  
his last!   
Arunachala Siva.

This is the verse Dr.G.U. Pope read while in death bed and then breathed his

பாவிடையாடு குழல்போற் கரந்து பரந்த உள்ளம்   
ஆகெடுவேன் உடையாய் அடியேன் உன் அடைக்கலமே.8.   
O Consort of the lady with eyes like split baby mangoes! You either call me  
to Your flowery Feet or place me in Hell.   
I do not know what You have in Your mind. My mind is oscillating like wooden  
piece that goes this side and that side,   
in the weaver's shuttle. I am crying, and horripilating. O Lord, I shall be  
lost and I am,this devotee, ever under Your refuge!   
Arunachala Siva.

Questioner: When we are busy with our worldly jobs, what should we keep in  
mind?   
Maharaj: Because the "I Am" principle is there, it is moving all over. To  
recognize it, you put on various uniforms in order to give it an identity, but  
that principle is already there, and because of that principle you are  
engaging in various activities. Unless you wear the uniform (the body) you  
will not be able to conduct any activities.   
This knowledge is meant for the Isvara principle, which is presently caught up  
in the illusion that it is the body-mind. You have accepted the identity of  
the uniform and that identity becomes your ego.   
Isvara is the manifest principle by which all activities are carried on. It  
has no form - the forms are given because of the five elemental play. Now,  
that principle gets completely lost in the uniform and is recognized by the  
uniform only. You have the fear of death because you fear losing your  
identity, the body.   
Since the uniform is available to you, by all means use it, but understand  
that you are not the uniform.   
Q: What does one do when the uniform gets troublesome?   
M: Recede into your own Self, be one with your true Self.   
This "I Amness" enjoys various experiences. It becomes a beggar or a King.   
Is this body eternal? The body has been changing all during your life, which  
identity is you?   
Q: I identify myself with my body, I know that.   
M: Who?   
Q: I do.   
M: Give me a photograph of the meaning of that word "I" You can't. That  
principle has no name or form or shape. My firm conclusion is that whatever is  
done through the uniform is perishable, it is not going to remain. Which  
uniform has any permanency? Once you know that you are not the form or the  
name of that uniform, it is all over. Suppose you have hoarded some thousand-  
rupee notes and suddenly the government order comes that they are all  
invalidated.   
Once you discard this "I Amness" uniform, what remains is the Parabrahman.  
That which is eternally current is the Parabrahman.   
Q: Will Maharaj help me discard my uniform?   
M: What is the need? It is not eternal, it never was.   
Q: We have not discarded ours, that is the problem.   
M: Now, tell me, when the knowingness was not there, what experiences did you  
have? That little touch of "I Amness" and you felt the existence of yourself  
and the world.   
Q: How to give up this knowingness?   
M: Where is the need? If you accept that uniform as yourself, then the  
question of giving it up will be there. Give up your identity with the body,  
try to know yourself. It is merely knowingness, you cannot perceive that  
state. You come here because you are ignorant, not because you are  
knowledgeable. This knowledge I give is only to remove ignorance.

Questioner: If there is no difference between   
what is prior to birth and what is after death   
there is no difference, is there any reason for   
attempting to learn who we are now? Isn't it all the same?   
Maharaj: The light coming from the sun and the sun itself -   
is there any difference?   
Q: The only difference is what happens in the middle?   
M: Whatever happens between birth and death   
is also an expression of the consciousness only.   
Even in the realm of consciousness   
you pass the time entertaining various concepts;   
what else are you doing?   
Q: Is Maharaj playing with various concepts?   
M: No. It is the consciousness, it plays by itself.   
Q: Does Maharaj's consciousness play,   
even though he is detached from it?   
M: Consciousness is not private property,   
it is universal.   
Q: Though we understand this,   
sometimes it seems confined to a body.   
M: You are trying to understand with the intellect; just be.   
When I tell you that you are that dynamic,   
manifest knowledge, you are everything.   
What else do you want?   
Q: I am aware that I came here because   
Maharaj gives me the mirror,   
but this time he is showing me that I am my own mirror.   
M: That is why you should not stay for long.   
Q: After we leave here, what are we to do?   
M: It is up to you.   
If you abide in consciousness   
everything will be happening spontaneously.   
If you are still at body-mind level,   
you will think that you are doing something.   
If you really abide in what I say,   
you become one with your Self.   
Then people will be serving you, they will fall at your feet.   
Whatever is necessary for you will happen.   
Activities are bound to happen.   
Consciousness can never remain inactive,   
it will always be busy - that is its nature.   
When you come here, you have certain expectations,   
certain aspirations,   
but after listening to my talks   
you lose all that.   
Q: Even when I have an intuitive understanding of this,   
what is this reluctance to give up all that I am not?   
M: You have not stabilized firmly in that understanding.   
Your conviction should be such that   
no question at all should arise in future about that.   
For example, a person is dead and has been cremated, it is all over,   
is there any question about that? Like that, it will be all over.

Questioner: This consciousness is like a screen, and I am the screen.   
Maharaj: Understand what I say without concepts;   
you are adding new concepts.   
Now go to zero concepts.   
There are many spiritual seekers whose aim is   
to acquire sufficient merit to reach a certain place,   
such as Heaven or Vaikuntha.   
I have had no aims except to find out.   
I was not aware of my awareness,   
and suddenly I became conscious that I am.   
Where and how did this consciousness arise on me?   
That was my enquiry,   
going back to that state   
when the presence of phenomena was not there.   
That is, original knowledge of the original Self.   
So, I went back, tracing this original Self,   
and I reached a stage where I wanted to know   
what my state was before this consciousness arose.   
That is the destination which I have reached.   
Brahman, Isvara, God, all these are   
names given to the consciousness   
when it is conscious of itself.   
If you have properly understood this knowledge,   
what will be your position at the moment of so-called death?   
It will be watching what is happening.   
This consciousness gradually loses everything,   
and ultimately consciousness is no longer conscious of itself.   
That state cannot be described.   
It is called Parabrahman, the Supreme Absolute,   
but that is only a name for communication purposes.   
This line of enquiry started when I noticed that   
from the moment one wakes up until one falls asleep,   
one is very busy doing something or other.   
What is it that compels us to do these things?   
Because of what does this go on?   
Then I came to the conclusion that it is my beingness,   
the fact that I am conscious of existing,   
which is working throughout the day.   
That was how my enquiry started.   
In the body   
the indwelling principle is the consciousness.   
Abiding in the consciousness,   
it became all manifestation.   
Now transcendence of the consciousness has also occurred.   
With the appearance of consciousness,   
the Absolute knows it is, "I Am". This is the experience.   
There are other experiences now, in this time factor,   
but experiences are gradually dropping off,   
including this primary experience "I Am".   
It is only the consciousness that is going to disappear,   
the Absolute is always there.   
What a fall! The perfect state,   
caught up in these experiences,   
and trying to derive certain benefits out of the experiences.   
Q: Is it spontaneous?   
M: Yes. Whatever experiences were happening   
in this field of knowingness,   
the Ultimate principle got caught up in that.   
It accepted some experience as itself.   
Accepting experiences as the truth,   
it gets more and more involved.

Maharaj: Out of what is the body created?   
Questioner: It is an expression of consciousness.   
M: Is this body not composed of the five elements? You know that you exist;  
does not this knowledge depend on the five elements? The consciousness cannot  
be known without the body. It depends on the form.   
Q: Do you mean that without the body I do not know that I am?   
M: That is correct. From your own experience, not what you have heard or read,  
can you know that you exist without the body?   
Q: I exist without this body.   
M: Forget about what you have read. When you did not have the experience of  
this body, did you have the experience of being?   
Q: My English is not very good, I cannot express it, but I know "I Am. "   
M: Before you were born, could you have felt or sensed or known that you  
exist? A jnani is free because he sees that the body is made up of the five  
elements and it works according to the nature of these elements. I see that  
body, but I am not concerned with whatever that body does. There is nothing in  
it with which I can identify. The essence of the combination of the five  
elements is the sense of being, of existing. It has all come simultaneously, I  
have no part in it. Feeling that I am present depends on having a body; I am  
neither the body nor the conscious presence.   
In this body is the subtle principle "I Am"; that principle witnesses all  
this. You are not the words. Words are the expression of space, they are not  
yours. Still further, you are not that "I Am"   
Q: What am "I" then?   
M: Who is asking?   
Q: There is nothing here, no "I"?   
M: Who is asking this?   
Q: There is a sense of something, I don 't know what it is.   
M: If you feel that sense of something, can it be the truth? When this  
consciousness goes into oblivion, who is to say what that state is?   
Q: I don't know.   
M: Because your "I Amness" is not there, you do not know yourself. When you  
began knowing that you are, you did a lot of mischief, but when the "I Am" is  
not there, there is no question of mischief.   
Q: Is the "I Am" there all the time, as long as my body is there?   
M: The "I Am" is absent only in the state of samadhi, when the self merges  
into the Self. Otherwise, it will be there. In the state of a realized person  
the "I Am" is there; he just doesn't give much importance to it. A jnani is  
not guided by a concept.   
Q: Do we have a relationship, Maharaj, when I think I should be here with you'   
M: The very thought is the relationship.   
Q: The intensity of my longing to be here made me wonder if Maharaj thinks of  
his disciples?   
M: I think of them more than you know.

Questioner: I think there should be beauty in the whole manifestation.   
Maharaj: You should not get involved in what has appeared.   
Take a tree - the bark, the leaves, the blossoms, the fruit,   
all have a different nature.   
If you get involved in the appearance of these,   
you will lose sight of the source, the tree.   
Intellectually, you have understood,   
but you have to be one with it,   
you have to identify with what you have understood.   
Understand that the seed of this body is the sperm of the father   
mixed with the ovum of the mother.   
That is the seed for the manifestation of the phenomen,   
but I am not the seed, I am not the phenomena,   
nor am I the consciousness which is time-bound.   
The names and forms which you see   
are consciousness only.   
Your consciousness is very pure   
and that's why you are able to judge.   
The Atman is colorless, but it is able to judge colors, etc   
When you have knowledge   
you see that the consciousness "I" is all-pervasive,   
as long as the consciousness is there;   
but the witness of the consciousness   
has no "I Am"   
and that is your true, eternal nature.   
"I love" gives rise to great joy,   
and at the same time there is nothing so miserable as "I love"   
Giving up the body is a great festival for me.   
What is the worth of all the activities of human beings?   
It is all entertainment, just to pass time.   
You get pleasure only when you forget yourself;   
in deep sleep you have forgotten yourself,   
that itself is joy.   
It is the Atman,   
not the personality,   
that is drawn to spirituality.   
Maharaj: Beingness has the quality to become   
whatever you think of.   
Whatever concept you feed to the consciousness,   
the consciousness will provide you with that.   
Whatever you hold on to intensely,   
you are bound to be that,   
that is the quality of your consciousness.   
You should never think that you are the body.   
Consciousness is not the body.   
As a result of the body the beingness is felt,   
but beingness is all-pervasive.   
Consciousness alone feels the expanse of consciousness,   
but I, the Absolute, am not that.   
Whatever is known is known by consciousness,   
is in the field of consciousness.   
The consciousness and the knowledge   
will subside when the food body dies.   
The Absolute always remains.   
The seed of knowledge is planted in you by these talks;   
now you have to follow it up.   
You must nurse it, ruminate over it,   
so that the tree of knowledge will grow.

Maharaj: This sickness gave the confirmation that there is no personality, no  
individual. Sickness to whom? Sickness is part of the functioning of the  
entire manifest, dynamic Chaitanya; it is the play of consciousness. My true  
state is prior to this consciousness. That state does not depend on the  
consciousness.   
There is a couplet we sing at Bhajans, to Chakrapani. Chakrapani means that "I  
Amness", the life principle, the manifest principle. It is like this cigarette  
lighter. The gas as such has no light, but its manifestation is the flame; it  
is full of light, life, energy. Even in the atom and sub-atom, that energy is  
there.   
The functioning of consciousness takes place spontaneously, and one doesn't  
know what will happen. For instance, I say something and M. will translate it  
one way, B. will translate it another, in whichever way they have understood  
it. This is the way the process will go on. This Chakrapani is "like a  
flywheel," Lord Krishna said, "rotating allbeings." That energy which moves  
all things in the waking state is latent in deep sleep. How long is one  
unaware of awareness? One doesn't know, but suddenly consciousness arises.  
Does anyone think along these lines? Is it not amazing that consciousness,  
which might remain latent for any length of time, suddenly arises  
spontaneously?   
Questioner: Is universal cansciousness ever uware of itself as universal  
consciousness, or does it become aware only when there is aform.'   
M: Awareness is not aware of its awareness. If you get too much involved in  
what I am saying you will throw away the books you are writing, everything.   
Q: I will finish the books, then I amfinished.   
M: [To Jean Dunn] You have promised me that you will complete the books.  
Universal consciousness will not write the books. How will you write the  
books?   
Q: It will happen spontaneously.   
You are asking, "Who am I?" and you are not going to get an answer, because  
the one who will get the answer is false. You may have an idea, a concept, and  
you will think you have found yourself, but it is only a concept; you can  
never see your Self.   
Q: What is sat-chit-ananda?   
M: It is words. You can take it that sat-chit-ananda is the limit which your  
mind can describe of that state which cannot be described. Your true state is  
non-manifest; the manifestation comes and the words come. The one who  
experiences sat-chit-ananda is there before the experience.   
Maharaj: Consider the status you have reached if you are able to understand  
what I say, and if you have understood, there will be no status at all. Your  
worth cannot be measured. You have done all your homework and now your sadhana  
or spiritual practice is bearing fruit; now you are here. Let it grow in you.  
You don't have to go to anybody else after you leave this place; that part of  
the work has already been done by you. Because you are worthy of that state of  
realization, you are here today.   
Get to know that "I Am" without words which arises in the morning. Knowing the  
Self, abiding in the Self- knowledge, is not a mere intellectual knowing. You  
must be that, and you should not move away from it. Remain firm. Do not  
consult others about the advice I have given to them. Abide in what I have  
told only you. Kill that curiosity to know what others are told; to each  
seeker the appropriate advice is given. Unless you abide in your own true  
nature you will not be able to gauge the depth of another's nature. When you  
try to understand others, the Self-effulgent nature of one's Self should open  
up completely. You will know yourself in the process. The knowledge being  
expounded here you will not find in any books. Now, having given you so much,  
you may see me tomorrow or you may not, that is immaterial, but don't forget  
what I have told you about your Self.

Maharaj: Whatever appears has really no existence. And whatever has not  
appeared also drops away; what remains is That, the Absolute. "That" is like  
Bombay.   
Visitor: Bombay certainly seems to be appearing at the moment. We should sell  
him another city.   
M: But I normally ask you this kind of question, whether Bombay sleeps,  
whether it wakes up in the morning, whether it is worried, whether it has pain  
and pleasure. I do not refer to the people of Bombay, nor to the land, but to  
that which remains.   
Now you know that you are. Prior to this moment, did you have this knowledge  
that you exist? This consciousness, beingness, which you are experiencing now,  
was it there earlier?   
V: It has been, on and off.   
M: This confidence that you are, the knowledge of your existence, was it there  
earlier?   
V: When I do what Maharaj tells me, it is very clear. It is still in an  
infantile stage, but my sense of "me" is completely undone, and there arises  
great happiness, peace and clarity; but it comes and goes, and I forget.   
M: Its inherent nature is time-bound. It has appeared as childhood and it is  
there now; but it wasn't there some years back. So you cannot possibly say  
that it is the Eternal. So don't believe that it is true.1 And so long as you  
are having this "I"-consciousness, you will be trying to acquire things; so  
long as you know that you are, the things that you possess have an emotional  
significance to you. Now there is the fact that your "I"-consciousness itself  
is time-bound. So when this dissolves, what is the value of all those things  
which you possessed?   
V: Nil.   
M: As long as you have not understood this child-consciousness, you'll get  
involved in the world and its activities. Therefore, the real liberation is  
only when you understand that child-consciousness. Do you agree?   
V: I do agree.   
M: During your entire lifetime, you do not have any permanent identity.  
Whatever you consider yourself to be changes from moment to moment. Nothing is  
constant.   
V: And what you think you are going to become changes too, with time, in spite  
of yourself.   
M: That change is also made possible by the child-conciousness. Because of  
that, all these changes take place. That is why you must grasp this principle.   
If you really want to understand this, you must give up your identification  
with the body. By all means, make use of the body, but don't consider yourself  
to be the body while acting in this world. Identify yourself with the  
consciousness, which dwells in the body; with that identity, you should act in  
the world. Will it be possible?   
So long as you identify yourself as the body, your experience of pain and  
sorrow will increase day by day. That is why you must give up this  
identification, and you should take yourself as the consciousness. If you take  
yourself as the body, it means you have forgotten your true Self, which is the  
atman. And sorrow results for the one who forgets himself. When the body  
falls, the principle which always remains is You. If you identify yourself  
with the body, you will feel that you are dying, but in reality there is no  
death because you are not the body. Let the body be there or not be there,  
your existence is always there; it is eternal.   
Now who or what has heard my talk? It is not the ear, not the physical body,  
but that knowledge which is in the body; that has heard me. So identify  
yourself with that knowledge, that consciousness. Whatever happiness we enjoy  
in this world is only imaginary. The real happiness is to know your existence,  
which is apart from the body. You should never forget the real identity that  
you possess. Consider a patient on his deathbed, certain to die. Now when he  
first comes to know of his disease, say cancer, he gets such a shock that it  
is permanently engraved in his memory. Like that, you should never forget your  
true nature â the true identity I have told you about.   
A patient who is suffering from cancer is, as it were, all the time silently  
chanting "I'm dying from cancer"; and that chant proceeds without any efforts.  
Similarly, in your case: Take up that chant "I am consciousness." That chant,  
too, should go on without any effort. One who is constantly awake in his true  
nature â having this knowledge about himself â is liberated.   
A patient suffering from terminal cancer always remembers his state and  
ultimately undergoes that very end; so much is certain. Similarly, one who  
remembers that he is the knowledge, that he is the consciousness, has that  
end, he becomes the Parabrahman.   
So if you are about to photograph this land, I would say, no don't  
photographâ¦ take a photograph of it but without land. Whatever is Bombay,  
take a photograph of that and show me. Can you?   
V: I could not do it.   
M: So that is like photographing yourself without the body. You are that, like  
Bombay. Remembering that you are the consciousness should be without any  
effort. When you say "I," don't refer to this body's "I," but to that "I"  
which represents this consciousness. The consciousness is "I," and make use of  
this knowledge when you act.   
The pleasure or happiness that you have had, is it through the words that you  
have heard or because you have had a glimpse of your atman?   
V: I have been studying a lot all along in doing the sadhana. Since I met  
Maharaj, things are becoming clarified and also I am getting confirmation of  
what I have learned.   
M: What should be your ultimate conclusion after reading a lot, doing sadhana  
and listening to these talks? It is that the hearer, the knower, is not  
concerned with the upadhi â that is, the body, mind and consciousness â  
and that he is separate from this upadhi that has come upon him.   
V: Does that mean sakshivan, witness-consciousness?   
M: You use that word sakshivan, but what do you really mean by it? That there  
is sentience, through which you see what is happening. But other than that, is  
anything needed for witnessing to take place? The sun has arisen, and there is  
daylight. Have you put yourself out to do any witnessing? Or do you see  
effortlessly; therefore, witnessing simply takes place. There is nothing that  
what you call the "witness" has to do; witnessing happens purely by itself.   
This knowledge "I am" has dawned on you. Since then, whatever other knowledge  
you have acquired, whatever experiences you have had, whatever you have seen  
of the world, has all been witnessed. But that one to whom the witnessing  
takes place is entirely separate from that which is witnessed. In this  
witnessing, in these experiences, you have assumed that you are the body, and  
you are involved in it. Therefore, you get the reactions of whatever you have  
seen and witnessed only through this identification with the body. But  
actually, you are not concerned with that which makes your seeing possible and  
that which has been seen. You are apart from either of them.

Jewell,   
"A patient suffering from terminal cancer always remembers his state and  
ultimately undergoes that very end; so much is certain. Similarly, one who  
remembers that he is the knowledge, that he is the consciousness, has that  
end, he becomes the Parabrahman"   
Sri Ramakrishna gives a similiar example: Master:"One can meditate even with eyes open. One can meditate even while  
talking. Take the   
case of a man with toothache.   
TUTOR OF THE TAGORES: "Yes, sir. I know that very well." (All laugh.)   
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, even when his teeth ache he does all his duties,but  
his mind is   
on the pain. Likewise one can meditate with eyes open and while talking to  
others as well."   
Thanks very much.

## Re:[40]Love,always love and only love Quotes of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj  
Author: Jewell              Date: September 26, 2012, 10:48:34 PM

Thank You dear Sri Ravi! Here is one more conversation,which is telling  
exactly that.   
V: So I should not ask any questions?   
M: Correct, no questions. Just be what you are. As I tell you, when you abide  
in your own self, all your questions will be dissolved by the knowledge "you  
are."   
The manifested extends beyond any limits; it is spread all over, ample. If  
that knowledge "you are" is not there, where is the world? And where are the  
gods?   
By reading various books and listening to everything else, you cannot become a  
mahatma, but only through that knowledge "I am." Don't concentrate on the  
body. Because of the body, you call yourself a male or a female. Just hold on  
to that knowledge "I am" only, without body sense â beyond name and form or  
design. But you have to employ name, form and design for the sake of worldly  
activities.   
You are lucky, I am not expounding this in great detail to other people. To  
them, I simply say: You are "you," that knowledge "you are." Accept that only,  
and be on your way.   
Don't meditate on anyone, any God or sage. And that knowledge "you are," don't  
embellish it with the body. I do not tell people more than they need and may  
not go into great detail. Because your parents have come to fruition, you are  
here at this moment. The knowledge that you are has no form and no name; it is  
purely knowledge "you are." A name and form is good only for the purposes of  
the world. Presently you are adjustable by the name; name means "myself." And  
to that name, you have given the disguise of the body. After relinquishing the  
name that is imposed on you, tell me your name. By hearing nobody, what can be  
your name?   
V: No name!   
M: Similarly, you accept the body as your identity. Right here and now, drop  
your identity with the body and sit still. Just drop this body like a  
discarded garment; drop also the identity with the name. And now you tell me  
about yourself. Whatever you are is most appropriate â that greatest  
principle that you are, about which you cannot give any information. But you  
are.   
So long as you show that you are becoming more intimate with yourself, and  
getting to know that self, your comments are all right. The love for that  
knowledge "I am," the most lovable principle, is the knowledge "I am" itself.  
Is it not correct? That self, that knowledge "I am," has immense love for the  
self alone. But when that self or that love of the self becomes mixed up or  
associated with the body, the miseries begin.   
V: One should have that realization of "I-ness," right?   
M: Yes, but how can that happen unless you have full confirmation that "I am"  
is purely "I am"? You must have a firm conviction that "I am" is only that "I  
am," without body-mind form â the knowledge "I am" purely.   
V: I am trying to do it, practice it.   
M: When you say you are practicing that, it means you are developing your  
conviction. You are confirming your conviction about it. That is all. What  
other practice do you need?   
V: What else is needed? Is there a technique for it?   
M: That itself is the technique, because of which the world is. Male or female  
is the title of the body form, not of the atman, not of the Self.   
V: I understand all this. It has been explained beautifully every day, we have  
read it in the books, we understand it, and that is why I have come here.   
M: All these things are said by you, but has the knowledge come within the  
purview of the knowledge "I am"?   
V: No.   
M: You must have that full conviction, whatever you may have said. That is the  
truth and that is "I am." There are no techniques, except the technique that I  
am -- the firm conviction that "I am" means "I am" only, abidance in "I".   
V: I am trying to do that, and I think everyone here present is trying to do  
the same.   
M: When a guru is really a jnani â that is, one who has realized himself â  
you should abide in him. When such a guru guides or directs a disciple, no  
spiritual technique is necessary. There was a time when Arjuna also was not  
doing any spiritual practice. All the amies were in the battle area, and the  
horses were ready to rush at the enemy. What time was available for Arjuna to  
practice? He just listened and accepted whatever Krishna told him, and that  
was all he needed to get realization. Arjuna reached the goal through his  
right attitude and because his guru, Krishna, was realized.   
Don't practice this thing, only develop your conviction.   
How long do you do this type of meditation? Until you stabilize in the  
conviction: I am the knowledge "I am." At that stage your individuality is  
completely extinguished; you no longer have a personality. And "you" denotes  
the manifested. In place of the lost individuality has come the manifest  
totality.

M: How did that original creation take place of the body as infant? And even  
prior to its birth: How did the conception happen? How did the infant come  
into being, without it asking for it? Understand that. Understand thoroughly  
that drop of stuff which eventually has developed into a body, and then you  
will understand the whole mystery that you are not that. This body that is now  
occupying a certain space, how much space did it occupy upon its conception?  
And what was it then? If you understand that, you will understand the mystery  
of the Self.   
You base yourself on the body that you are now, and don't understand its root.  
That is why we think we are this body. And for that, you must do meditation.  
What is meditation? Meditation is not this body-mind meditating as an  
individual, but it is this knowledge "I am," this consciousness, meditating on  
itself. Then the consciousness will unfold its own beginning.   
Identification is with what? With this body that is now. But does it  
understand its origin? If you understand the temporal aspect, then you won't  
take so much pride in the body that is now existing.   
[Maharaj is now talking about himself] The body is thoroughly old, my mission  
is fulfilled. Now you people come, which is all right, but my mission is done.  
My soul is about to leave this body. I am happy. I clap! [clapping his hands]  
I am in a clapping mood that I am about to pass on. I am no longer in love  
with, or held by, anybody, anything, any attachment.   
Forgetfulness â that noble, most elevated forgetfulness âwill not arrive  
until all doubts have been dispelled. Unless the doubts are eradicated, that  
peace will not prevail.   
So long as I remain identified with the body, I want to be occupied with  
actions, because I am not able to sustain that pure "I" without them. I cannot  
endure it, because I identify with the body-mind, with all kinds of  
activities. I call it jiva-atman, which means "conditioned by the body-mind,"  
and is the self that is occupied with all the activities. And the "I" which is  
unconditioned by, and not identified with, the body-mind â that therefore  
has no form, design, or name â is Paramatman. The jiva-atman is being  
witnessed by Paramatman, which is your real Self only.   
V: What is it doing? Is it partaking in the working of the world?   
M: Paramatman need not participate in the activities of the world, but without  
that principle no activities could take place at all. Just as is the case with  
akash (space): without it, no activities are possible.   
Activities are going on naturally, spontaneously, in the same way that there  
is no author or doer of your dream world. Nevertheless, you fully put to use  
your dream world. You will not be able to comprehend this so long as you try  
to understand things as an individual. But once you are the universal manifest  
consciousness and abide in that Paramatman spirit â "I am" without form and  
distinction â then you will realize how things are.

V: Living the worldly life and being a person of the grihastha ashrama,  
drudging, working, sleeping, laughing, mixing with people of all  
nationalities, is it possible just to be, and not identify oneself entirely  
with the body?   
M: Show me a sample of that which you think is identifying itself with the  
body.   
V: Generally, one identifies oneself with the body. One should not do so. You  
are not body, consciousness or buddhi. You are something different. "I" is  
something different. But you do identify living in this world. Is it possible  
not to identify completely?   
Interpreter: That question has been conveyed. But Maharaj is asking: "What is  
this 'I' that cannot keep away from identifying withâ¦?"   
V: The same "I" of which Maharaj talks.   
M: Why is there any relationship between you and what goes on in the world?  
How does the relationship between the body and the world arise?   
V: Because the "I" is encased in the body. And it is the body that keeps  
coming in contact with material beings, other bodies, animate and inanimate.   
M: You think it is the body that is coming in contact. If that consciousness  
had not been there, how could the body have come in contact with the rest of  
the world? What actually is it that comes in contact with the world?   
V: The "I" comes in contact with the world through the body.   
M: Whatever the madhyama is, if that consciousness were not there, where is  
the question of either the mind medium or that with which the medium comes  
into contact? If the consciousness were not there, then does the body exist or  
even the world exist?   
V: That is very correct.   
M: Then consider this beingness or consciousness as the supreme God and let  
go(d). And even then, you as the knower of this are separate from the  
consciousness and the body.   
V: I understand.   
M: That which you have understood can work no more mischief on you, then. Is  
it not so? [laughter]   
V: I have understood with my buddhi.   
M: Which means that you can only use the instrument of the intellect to  
understand. But what is prior to the intellect?   
V: The atman.   
M: You understand the atman. Therefore, that which understands the atman must  
be prior to even the atman.   
V: That means buddhi.   
M: Atman is prior to buddhi, and you understand buddhi and also that atman is  
prior to buddhi.   
V: I understand atman with buddhi; my buddhi tells me that there is atman. I  
want to understand atma-jnana. With buddhi-jnana came atma-jnana. I want the  
atma-jnana, not buddhi-jnana.   
M: There should be no confusion. Understand a simple fact and that is that any  
kind of experience can only come upon the consciousness that is there. And you  
are separate from both that consciousness and the experiences which come on  
that consciousness.   
Unless there is consciousness, call it buddhi, mind or whatever, can anything  
be there? The answer is obviously, no. Thus, in that consciousness I can see  
my body and the world; and it is basically only on that consciousness that any  
movement or experience can take place.   
V: So that consciousness has the power to think or to feel?   
M: On that consciousness, something happens. Whatever movement, thought, or  
experience there is can occur only on this consciousness. And you are prior to  
this consciousness; therefore you are neither the consciousness â that is,  
the instrument â nor any thought or experience, or whatever it is that is  
happening on that instrument. You are apart from it. Now stick to that.

M: Remember that this body is made of the five elements; it is a material body  
â I call it food-body â and in that is this consciousness because of which  
the body possesses its sentience, enabling the senses to function. For the  
senses in the body operate only thanks to the consciousness. And you are  
separate from this body and the consciousness. That is the only the only thing  
to remember.   
All you have is the vital breath, the life force. And part of the prana is the  
atman. Other than that, what have you got? I keep coming back to the same  
thing. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing.   
[Maharaj is commenting on "X," who is having a lot of troubles.] All these  
difficulties that come and go should be merely watched like something in a  
play. When one scene is finished, another scene takes place, going on like an  
act. Then, the entire act and the entire play, does it take place anywhere but  
in yourself? If she did not have this consciousness, would she be aware of  
this play that is going on? So ultimately, whatever the play, whatever scenes  
and acts that take place, they are merely movements in her own consciousness.   
[The lady has been urging Maharai to take care of himself.] Who is to take  
care of what? I know what has come upon my original state, and there is  
nothing to take care of that. It is a happening that has come and will take  
care of itself. And whatever has happened, I have not been affected. So,  
again, who is to take care of what? I am not concerned with taking care of  
anything. The world has been in existence for millions of years. There have  
been thousands of avatars and great men, and important personalities. Has a  
single one of them been able to do anything to change the natural course of  
events in the world?   
Whatever has come upon this original state is time-bound, but the original  
state is timeless and spaceless. And that is one whole, a Wholeness. Not  
really one, because if you say "one," there are immediately two.   
V: Is what Ramakrishna said and what Maharaj is saying the same thing?   
M: I have already told you, the basic essence is only whole. All these  
differences are subsequent; they are to the concepts. So basically, when in  
the Wholeness, how can there be sin or merit, or any kind of duality?   
There is something by which you are able to say that you understand. And you  
are separate from that. What you think you have understood is only a movement  
in your consciousness. And you are separate from that consciousness. So as far  
as you are concerned, there is no question of understanding or not  
understanding,   
V: We always think when we have a mental grasp of someone's teaching that ipso  
facto we have realized that teaching. But we have not at all, we are  
essentially the same person, suffering in the same way.   
M: How did that original creation take place of the body as infant? And even  
prior to its birth: How did the conception happen? How did the infant come  
into being, without it asking for it? Understand that. Understand thoroughly  
that drop of stuff which eventually has developed into a body, and then you  
will understand the whole mystery that you are not that. This body that is now  
occupying a certain space, how much space did it occupy upon its conception?  
And what was it then? If you understand that, you will understand the mystery  
of the Self.   
You base yourself on the body that you are now, and don't understand its root.  
That is why we think we are this body. And for that, you must do meditation.  
What is meditation? Meditation is not this body-mind meditating as an  
individual, but it is this knowledge "I am," this consciousness, meditating on  
itself. Then the consciousness will unfold its own beginning.   
Identification is with what? With this body that is now. But does it  
understand its origin? If you understand the temporal aspect, then you won't  
take so much pride in the body that is now existing.   
[Maharaj is now talking about himself] The body is thoroughly old, my mission  
is fulfilled. Now you people come, which is all right, but my mission is done.  
My soul is about to leave this body. I am happy. I clap! [clapping his hands]  
I am in a clapping mood that I am about to pass on. I am no longer in love  
with, or held by, anybody, anything, any attachment.

Visitor: I have read I Am That and came here on my own.   
Maharaj: Have you read the whole book?   
V: I have read the first part fully and the second partially.   
M: Having read the book, did you come to your self at the witnessing state?   
V: Yes, I understood but I do not feel it. I have no peace of mind.   
M: Do you get an inkling as to how you are connected with your self?   
V: A little bit.   
M: Would you like to ask any questions?   
V: Not many, but I shall be grateful if I am told how to bring peace to my  
mind.   
M: Because of the self, the atman, you are connected to the world through the  
body. The self is nothing else but the knowledge that "you are." Meditate on  
that principle by which you know "you are" and on account of which you  
experience the world. Meditate on this knowledge "you are," which is the  
consciousness, and abide therein.   
V: But the concentration is just not there.   
M: Ignore the mind the way you disregard the crowd you encounter on the  
streets.   
V: I shall try.   
M: As a matter of fact, mind is a universal dynamic principle, but we restrict  
it to the limits of the body and then depend on it â hence all the trouble.  
Consider the water in Lake Tansa. That water belongs to the whole of Bombay.  
Out of that water, can we claim some as yours or mine? In a similar vein,  
understand that the self is universal. But you have conditioned it by  
confining it to the body; therefore, you face problems. This self is also  
termed Ishwara â God â the Universal Principle. If you hold on to that,  
profound knowledge will descend upon you and you will have peace.   
V: I try to meditate on that, but the mind wanders here and there. If I try to  
remain indifferent to mind, it will be a long-drawn-out process.   
M: But are you not the root of any process?   
V: The root of everything is life.   
M: Yes, but the life force is universal and not personalized. Once you realize  
this, you have no more troubles.   
V: That is right, but when the mind goes astray I have trouble. Sometimes I  
feel that life is universal, but at moments it becomes individualized. How to  
get rid of this?   
M: This is the conventional way of talking. The water is universal, use it  
when you possess it. Similarly, use the mind to meet your needs and then let  
it flow by itself without your interference and involvement, like the flow of  
a river from where you take water only when needed.   
M: Although the two of us talk here, in actuality they (the two entities) are  
not there. This is the theme today. At first, "no one" is. Instantly, one is,  
and then two. The subject of the talk is: How did these two reduce to one, and  
finally to nothing? Out of nothingness spontaneously the sense of beingness is  
felt â this is one. Later, when the sense of beingness knows "I am," duality  
begins. Then, after the duality has arisen, the sense of beingness identifies  
with the form, and so on. Actually to refer to the sense of being as "one," is  
not quite correct. Since in this state only the sense of being prevails, where  
is the need to say even "one"? With the appearance of otherness (duality),  
both no. 1 and no. 2 appear simultaneously. To say, "something is," "I" must  
be there first. If "I" am not, I cannot say "something is." So the fundamental  
principle in spirituality is that "I" must be there, before anything else can  
be. This "I" is the beingness which is first.   
V: You said, in the beginning there is "one," and later there is "none."   
M: When one looks into one's self, that is, when one abides in the Self, then  
there is "none."

cotinued..   
But when the discriminative mind comes into being   
and creates distinctions, pleasure and pain arise.   
During sleep the mind is in abeyance   
and so are pain and pleasure.   
The process of creation continues,   
but no notice is taken.   
The mind is a form of consciousness,   
and consciousness is an aspect of life.   
Life creates everything,   
but the Supreme is beyond all.   
"Nothing is me" is the first step.   
"Everything is me" is the next.   
Both hang on the idea "There is a world".   
When this too is given up,   
you remain what you are - the non-dual Self.   
You are it here and now,   
but your vision is obstructed   
by your false ideas about your self.   
[The Absolute] gives birth to consciousness.   
All else is in consciousness.   
The entire universe exists only in consciousness,   
while I have my stand in the Absolute.   
In pure being consciousness arises;   
in consciousness the world appears and disappears.   
All there is, is me, all there is, is mine.   
Before all beginnings, after all endings - I am.   
All has its being in me, in the "I am",   
that shines in every living being.   
Even not-being is unthinkable without me.   
Whatever happens, I must be there to witness it.   
I am beyond time.   
However long a life may be,   
it is but a moment and a dream.   
In the same way, I am beyond all attributes.   
They appear and disappear in my light, but cannot describe me.   
The universe is all names and forms,   
based on qualities and their differences,   
while I am beyond.   
The world is there because I am,   
but I am not the world.   
I know there is a world,   
which includes this body and this mind,   
but I do not consider them to be more "mine"   
than other minds and bodies.   
They are there, in time and space,   
but I am timeless and spaceless.   
You are the Supreme Reality   
beyond the world and its creator,   
beyond consciousness and its witness,   
beyond all assertions and denials.   
You yourself are God, the Supreme Reality.   
You are God, but you do not know it.   
You are always the Supreme,   
which appears at a given point of time and space   
as the witness,   
a bridge between the pure awareness of the Supreme   
and the manifold consciousness of the person.   
Once you realize that whatever appears before you   
cannot be yourself, and cannot say "I am",   
you are free of all your "persons" and their demands.   
The sense "I am" is your own.   
You cannot part with it,   
but you can impart it to anything,   
as in saying: I am young. I am rich, etc.   
But such self-identifications are patently false   
and the cause of bondage.

The Supreme is the universal dissolvent,   
it corrodes every container,   
it burns through every obstacle.   
Without the absolute denial of everything,   
the tyranny of things would be absolute.   
The Supreme is the great harmonizer,   
the guarantee of the ultimate and perfect balance -   
of life in freedom.   
It dissolves you and thus re-asserts your true being.   
As long as you deal in terms: real - unreal,   
awareness is the only reality that can be.   
But the Supreme is beyond all distinctions,   
and to it the term "real" does not apply,   
for in it all is real and, therefore,   
need not be labelled as such.   
It is the very source of reality,   
it imparts reality to whatever it touches.   
It just cannot be understood through words.   
Even a direct experience, however sublime,   
merely bears testimony, nothing more.   
The Universal Mind (chidakash) makes and unmakes everything.   
The Supreme (paramakash) imparts reality   
to whatever comes into being.   
To say that it is the universal love   
may be the nearest we can come to it in words.   
Just like love, it makes everything real, beautiful, desirable.   
In reality only the Ultimate is.   
The rest is a matter of name and form.   
And as long as you cling to the idea   
that only what has a name and shape exists,   
the Supreme will appear to you non-existing.   
When you understand that names and shapes   
are hollow shells without any content whatsoever,   
and what is real is nameless and shapeless,   
pure energy of life and light of consciousness,   
you will be at peace -   
immersed in the deep silence of reality.   
The Supreme State is universal, here and now;   
everybody already shares in it.   
It is the state of being, knowing and liking.   
Who does not like to be,   
or does not know his own existence?   
But we take no advantage of this joy of being conscious,   
we do not go into it and purify it of all that is foreign to it.   
The real is simple, open, clear and kind, beautiful and joyous.   
It is completely free of contradictions.   
It is ever new, ever fresh, endlessly creative.   
Being and non-being, life and death,   
all distinctions merge in it.   
[It is] single, simple, indivisible and unperceivable,   
except in its manifestations.   
Not unkowable, but unperceivable, un-objectival, inseparable.   
Neither material nor mental,   
neither objective nor subjective,   
it is the root of matter and the source of consciousness.   
Beyond mere living and dying,   
it is the all-inclusive, all-exclusive Life,   
in which birth is death and death is birth.   
to be continued...

One thing is quite clear to me: all that is lives and moves has its being in consciousness,   
and I am in and beyond that consciousness.   
I am in it as the witness.   
I am beyond it as Being.   
[You are] the impersonal and unqualified centre of being, love and bliss.   
Just like ice turns to water, and water to vapour,   
and vapour dissolves in air and disappears,   
so does the body dissolve into pure awareness (chidakash),   
then into pure being (paramakash),   
which is beyond all existence and non-existence.   
Even the sense of "I am"   
is composed of the pure light and the sense of being.   
The "I" is there even without the "am".   
So is the pure light there,   
whether you say "I" or not.   
Become aware of the pure light and you will never lose it.   
The beingness in being,   
the awareness in consciousness,   
the interest in every experience -   
that is not describable, yet perfectly accessible,   
for there is nothing else.   
I am what I am,   
neither with form nor formless,   
neither conscious nor unconscious.   
I am outside all these categories.   
You cannot find me by mere denial.   
I am as well everything as nothing.   
Nor both nor either.   
These distinctions apply to the Lord of the universe,   
not to me.   
I am complete and perfect.   
I am the beingness of being,   
the knowingness of knowing,   
the fulness of happiness.

The Big Cycle: The Manifestation of the Absolute   
The alternation of manifested (existence, becoming) and unmanifested (pure  
being).   
The three states,sleeping, dreaming and waking,   
are all in consciousness, the manifested;   
what you call unconsciousness will also be manifested - in time;   
beyond consciousness altogether lies the unmanifested.   
And beyond all, and pervading all,   
is the heart of being which beats steadily: manifested-unmanifested,   
manifested-unmanifested (saguna-nirguna).   
It is the instinct of exploration,   
the love of the unknown,   
that brings me into existence.   
It is in the nature of being   
to seek adventure in becoming,   
as it is in the nature of becoming to seek peace in being.   
This alternation of being and becoming is inevitable;   
but my home is beyond.   
With being arising in consciousness,   
the ideas of what you are arise in your mind   
as well as what you should be.   
This brings forth desire and action   
and the process of becoming begins.   
Becoming has, apparently, no beginning and no end,   
for it restarts every moment.   
With the cessation of imagination and desire,   
becoming ceases   
and the being this or that merges into pure being,   
which is not describable,   
only experienceable.   
All that lives, works for protecting,   
perpetuating and expanding consciousness.   
This is the world's sole meaning and purpose.   
It is the very essence of Yoga -   
ever raising the level of consciousness,   
discovery of new dimensions,   
with their properties, qualities and powers.   
In that sense, the entire universe becomes a school of Yoga.   
Once you realize that the road is the goal   
and that you are always on the road,   
not to reach a goal, but to enjoy its beauty and its wisdom,   
life ceases to be a task and becomes natural and simple,   
in itself an ecstasy.   
After all, what do you really want?   
Not perfection; you are already perfect.   
What you seek is to express in action what you are.   
For this you have a body and a mind.   
Take them in hand and make them serve you.

[The centre of consciousness] cannot be given name and form,   
for it is without quality and beyond consciousness.   
You may say it is a point in consciousness,   
which is beyond consciousness.   
Like a hole in the paper is both in the paper   
and yet not of paper,   
so is the supreme state   
in the very centre of consciousness,   
and yet beyond consciousness.   
It is as an opening in the mind   
through which the mind is flooded with light.   
The opening is not even the light.   
It is just an opening.   
From the mind's point of view,   
it is but an opening for the light of awareness   
to enter the mental space.   
By itself the light can only be compared to a solid, dense, rocklike,   
homogeneous and changeless mass of pure awareness,   
free from the mental patterns of name and shape.   
The supreme gives existence to the mind.   
The mind gives existence to the body.   
There can be no experience of the Absolute   
as it is beyond all experience.   
On the other hand, the Self is the experiencing factor   
in every experience and thus,   
in a way, validates the multiplicity of experiences.   
The world may be full of things of great value,   
but if there is nobody to buy them, they have no price.   
The Absolute contains everything experienceable,   
but without the experiencer they are as nothing.   
That which makes the experience possible is the Absolute.   
That which makes it actual is the Self.   
In the Supreme the witness appears.   
The witness creates the person   
and thinks itself as separate from it.   
The witness sees that the person appears in consciousness,   
which again appears in the witness.   
This realization of the basic unity is the working of the Supreme.   
It is the power behind the witness,   
the source from which all flows.   
It cannot be contacted, unless there is unity and love   
and mutual help between the person and the witness,   
unless doing is in harmony with the being and the knowing.   
The Supreme is both the source and the fruit of such harmony.   
As I talk to you, I am in the state of   
detached but affectionate awareness (turiya).   
When this awareness turns upon itself,   
you may call it the Supreme State (turiyatita).   
But the fundamental reality is beyond awareness,   
beyond the three states of becoming, being and not-being.   
The body appears in your mind,   
your mind is the content of your consciousness;   
you are the motionless witness of the river of consciousness   
which changes eternally without changing you in any way.   
Your own changelessness is so obvious that you do not notice it.   
The universe is in you and cannot be without you.   
The world exists in memory,   
memory comes into consciousness;   
consciousness exists in awareness   
and awareness is the reflection of the light   
on the waters of existence.

Nobody can say "I am the witness".   
The "I am" is always witnessed.   
The state of detached awareness   
is the witness-consciousness, the "mirror-mind".   
It rises and sets with its object and thus it is not the real.   
Whatever its object, it remains the same, hence it is also real.   
It partakes of both the real and the unreal,   
and is therefore a bridge between the two.   
Consciousness arising, the world arises.   
When you consider the wisdom and the beauty of the world,   
you call it God.   
Know the source of it all,   
which is in yourself,   
and you will find all your questions answered.   
The absolute precedes time.   
Awareness comes first.   
A bundle of memories and mental habits attracts attention,   
awareness gets focalized and a person suddenly appears.   
Remove the light of awareness,   
go to sleep o swoon away,   
and the person disappears.   
The person (vyakti) flickers,   
awareness (vyakta) contains all space and time,   
the absolute (avyakta) is.   
Awareness is not of time.   
Time exists in consciousness only.   
Beyond consciousness,   
where are time and space?   
Mahadakash is nature, the ocean of existence,   
the physical space   
with all that can be contacted through the senses.   
Chidakash is the expanse of awareness, the mental space of time,   
perception and cognition.   
Paramakash is the timeless and spaceless reality,   
mindless, undifferentiated, the infinite potentiality,   
the source and origin, the substance and the essence,   
both matter and consciousness, yet beyond both.   
It cannot be perceived,   
but can be experienced as ever witnessing the witness,   
perceiving the perceiver,   
the origin and the end of all manifestation,   
the root of time and space,   
the prime cause in every chain of causation.   
Just like in a cinema all is light,   
so does consciousness become the vast world.   
Look closely and you will see that all names and forms   
are but transitory waves on the ocean of consciousness,   
that only consciousness can be said to be,   
not its transformations.   
In the immensity of consciousness a light appears,   
a tiny point that moves rapidly and traces shapes,   
thoughts and feelings, concepts and ideas,   
like the pen writing on paper.   
And the ink that leaves a trace is memory.   
You are that tiny point,   
and by your movement the world is ever re-created.   
Stop moving and there will be no world.   
Look within and you will find that the point of light   
is the reflection of the immensity of light in the body,   
as the sense "I am".   
There is only light, all else appears.   
To the mind, it [that light] appears as darkness.   
It can be known only through its reflections.   
All is seen in daylight - except daylight.   
To be the point of light tracing the world is turiya.   
To be the light itself is turiyatita.   
But of what use are names when reality is so near?   
Don't say "everybody is conscious".   
Say "there is consciousness",   
in which everything appears and disappears.   
Our minds are just waves on the ocean of consciousness.   
As waves they come and go.   
As ocean they are infinite and eternal.   
Know yourselves as the ocean of being,   
the womb of all existence.   
These are all metaphors of course;   
the reality is beyond description.   
You can know it only by being it.

When the self-identification with the body is no more,   
all space and time are in your mind,   
which is a mere ripple in consciousness,   
which is awareness reflected in nature.   
Awareness and matter are the   
active and passive aspects of being,   
which is in both and beyond both.   
Consciousness is always of movement, of change.   
There can be no such thing a changeless consciousness.   
Changelessness wipes out consciousness immediately.   
A man deprived of outer or inner sensations blanks out,   
or goes into the birthless and deathless state.   
Only when spirit and matter come together,   
consciousness is born.   
In reality you were never born and never shall die.   
But now you imagine that you are, or have, a body   
and you ask what has brought about this state.   
Within the limits of illusion the answer is: desire born from memory attracts you to a body   
and makes you think as one with it.   
But this is true only from the relative point of view.   
In fact, there is no body, nor a world to contain it;   
there is only a mental condition,   
a dream-like state,   
easy to dispel by questioning its reality.   
The Big Cycle   
The Return to the Absolute   
There is the body and there is the Self.   
Between them is the mind,   
in which the Self is reflected as "I am".   
Because of the imperfections of the mind,   
its crudity and restlessness,   
lack of discernment and insight,   
it takes itself to be the body, not the Self.   
All that is needed is to purify the mind   
so that it can realize its identity with the Self.   
When the mind merges in the Self,   
the body presents no problems.   
It remains what it is, an instrument of cognition and action,   
the tool and the expression of the creative fire within.   
The ultimate value of the body   
is that it serves to discover the cosmic body,   
which is the universe in its entirety.   
As you realize yourself in manifestation,   
you keep on discovering that you are ever   
more than what you have imagined.   
Consciousness as such   
is the subtle counterpart of matter.   
Just as inertia (tamas) and energy (rajas) are attributes of matter,   
so does harmony (sattva) manifest itself as consciousness.   
You may consider it in a way   
as a form of very subtle energy.   
Wherever matter organizes itself into a stable organism,   
consciousness appears spontaneously.   
With the destruction of the organism,   
consciousness disappears.   
The mind produces thoughts ceaselessly,   
even when you do not look at them.   
When you know what is going on in your mind,   
you call it consciousness.   
This is your waking state -   
your consciousness shifts from sensation to sensation,   
from perception to perception,   
from idea to idea, in endless succession.   
Then comes awareness,   
the direct insight into the whole of consciousness,   
the totality of the mind.   
The mind is like a river,   
flowing ceaselessly in the bed of the body;   
you identify yourself for a moment with some particular ripple   
and call it "my thought".   
All you are conscious of is your mind;   
awareness is the cognizance of consciousness as a whole.   
Consciousness comes and goes,   
awareness shines immutably.   
When there is a person, there is also consciousness.   
"I am", mind, consciousness denote the same state.   
If you say "I am aware", it only means   
"I am conscious of thinking about being aware".   
There is no "I am" in awareness.   
Witnessing is of the mind.   
The witness goes with the witnessed.   
In the state of non-duality, all separation ceases.

Watch yourself closely and you will see   
that whatever be the content of consciousness,   
the witnessing of it does not depend on the content.   
Awareness is itself   
and does not change with the event.   
The event may be pleasant or unpleasant,   
minor or important,   
awareness is the same.   
Take note of the peculiar nature of pure awareness,   
its natural self-identity,   
without the least trace of self-consciousness,   
and go to the root of it   
and you will soon realize that awareness is your true nature,   
and nothing you may be aware of, you can call your own.   
When the content is viewed without likes and dislikes,   
the consciousness of it is awareness.   
But still there is a difference between awareness   
as reflected in consciousness   
and pure awareness beyond consciousness.   
Reflected awareness,   
the sense "I am aware"   
is the witness,   
while pure awareness   
is the essence of reality.   
Reflection of the sun in a drop of water   
is a reflection of the sun, no doubt,   
but not the sun itself.   
Between awareness reflected in consciousness   
as the witness   
and pure awareness there is a gap,   
which the mind cannot cross.   
Consciousness does not shine by itself.   
It shines by a light beyond it in which it appears,   
which gives it being.   
Don't be all the time immersed in your experience.   
Remember that you are beyond the experiencer,   
ever unborn and deathless.   
In remembering it,   
the quality of pure knowledge will emerge,   
the light of unconditional awareness.   
By its very nature, the mind is outward turned;   
it always tends to seek for the source of things   
among the things themselves;   
to be told to look for the source within, is, in a way,   
the beginning of a new life.

Awareness takes the place of consciousness;   
in consciousness there is the "I", who is conscious,   
while awareness is undivided;   
awareness is aware of itself.   
The "I am" is a thought,   
while awareness is not a thought;   
there is no "I am aware" in awareness.   
Consciousness is an attribute while awareness is not;   
one can be aware of being conscious,   
but not conscious of awareness.   
God is the totality of consciousness,   
but awareness is beyond all - being as well as not-being.   
The totality of conscious experience is nature.   
As a conscious self your are a part of nature.   
As awareness, you are beyond.   
Seeing nature as mere consciousness is awareness.   
There are levels in consciousness, but not in awareness.   
It is of one block, homogeneous.   
Its reflection in the mind is love and understanding.   
There are levels of clarity in understanding and intensity in love,   
but not in their source.   
The source is simple and single,   
but its gifts are infinite.   
Only do not take the gifts for the source.   
Realize yourself as the source and not as the river, that is all.   
Of course, you are [the river too].   
As an "I am" you are the river,   
flowing between the banks of the body.   
But you are also the source   
and the ocean and the clouds in the sky.   
Wherever there is life and consciousness, you are.   
Smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest, you are,   
while all else appears.   
Awareness is primordial; it is the original state,   
beginningless, endless, uncaused,   
unsupported, without parts, without change.   
Consciousness is on contact,   
a reflection against a surface, a state of duality.   
There can be no consciousness without awareness,   
but there can be awareness without consciousness, as in deep sleep.

The goal: Liberation through Self-Realization   
The gospel of self-realization   
The idea of enlightenment is of utmost importance.   
Just to know that there is such possibility   
changes one's entire outlook.   
It acts like a burning match in a heap of saw dust.   
A spark of truth can burn up a mountain of lies.   
The very hearing of it is a promise of enlightenment.   
The possibility becomes a certainty   
when the notion of enlightenment appears in the mind.   
Once a living being has heard and understood   
that deliverance is within his reach,   
he will never forget it, for it is the first message from within.   
It will take roots and grow and in due course   
take the blessed shape of the Guru.   
The gospel of self-realization, once heard,   
will never be forgotten.   
Like a seed left in the ground,   
it will wait for the right season,   
and sprout and grow into a mighty tree.   
Just puzzling over my words   
and trying to grasp their full meaning   
is a sadhana quite efficient for breaking down the wall.   
All your going and coming,   
seeking pleasure, loving and hating -   
all this shows that you struggle against limitations,   
self-imposed or accepted.   
In your ingnorance, you make mistakes   
and cause pain to yourself and others,   
but the urge is there and shall not be denied.   
The same urge that seeks birth, happiness and death,   
shall seek understanding and liberation.   
It is like a spark of fire in a cargo of cotton.   
You may not know about it,   
but sooner or later the ship will burst in flames.   
Liberation is a natural process and, in the long run, inevitable.   
But it is within your power to bring it into the now.   
Without it [self-realization],   
you will be consumed by desires and fears,   
repeating themselves meaninglessly in endless suffering.   
Most of the people do not know that there can be an end to pain.   
But once they have heard the good news,   
obviously going beyond all strife and struggle   
is the most urgent task that can be.   
You know that you can be free and now it is up to you.   
Either you remain forever hungry and thirsty,   
longing, searching, grabbing, holding,   
ever losing and and sorrowing,   
or go out wholeheartedly in search of the state of timeless perfection   
to which nothing can be added, from which nothing taken away.   
In it all desires and fears are absent,   
not because they were given up,   
but because they have lost their meaning.   
To know that the known cannot be me nor mine,   
is liberation. Freedom from self-identification   
with a set of memories and habits,   
the state of wonder at the infinite reaches of the being,   
its inexhaustible creativity and total transcendence,   
the absolute fearlessness   
born from the realization of the illusoriness and transiency   
of every mode of consciousness -   
flow from a deep and inexhaustible source.   
To know the source as source   
and appearance as appearance,   
and oneself as the source only   
is self-realization.

There can be progress   
in the preparation (sadhana).   
Realization is sudden.   
The fruit ripens slowly,   
but falls suddenly and without return.   
The preparation is gradual,   
the change itself is sudden and complete.   
Gradual change does not take you   
to a new level of conscious being.   
You need courage to let go.   
[If you lack courage,] it is because you are not fully convinced.   
Complete conviction generates both desire and courage.   
And meditation is the art of achieving faith through understanding.   
In meditation you consider the teaching received,   
in all its aspects and repeatedly,   
until out of clarity confidence is born and,   
with confidence, action.   
Conviction and action are inseparable.   
There are no steps to self-realization.   
There is nothing gradual about it.   
It happens suddenly and is irrevocably.   
You rotate into a new demension,   
seen from which the previous ones are mere abstractions.   
Just like on sunrise you see things as they are,   
so on self-realization you see everything as it is.   
The world of illusion is left behind.   
With some, realization comes imperceptibly,   
but somehow they need convincing.   
They have changed, but they do not notice it.   
Such non-spectacular cases are often the most reliable.   
The experience [of self-realization] is unique and unmistakable.   
It will dawn on you suddenly,   
when the obstacles are removed to some extent.   
It is like a frayed rope snapping.   
Yours is the work at the strands.   
The break is bound to happen.   
It can be delayed, but not prevented.   
All will come through,   
not a single soul (jiva) shall be lost.   
For some time, the mental habits may linger   
in spite of the new vision,   
the habit of longing for the unknown past   
and fearing the unknown future.   
When you know these are of the mind only,   
you can go beyond them.   
[When the mind goes] emptiness remains,   
awareness remains,   
pure light of the conscious being remains.   
It is like asking what remains of a room   
when all the furniture is removed.   
A most serviceable room remains.   
And when even the walls are pulled down, space remains.   
Beyond space and time   
is the here and now of reality.   
You will recognize that you have returned to your natural state   
by a complete absence of all desire and fear.   
After all, at the root of all desire and fear   
is the feeling of not being what you are.   
Just as a dislocated joint pains only as long as it is out of shape,   
[On realization] That which cannot change, remains.   
The great peace, the deep silence,   
the hidden beauty of reality remain.   
While it cannot be conveyed through words,   
it is waiting for you to experience for yourself.   
and is forgotten as soon as it is set right,   
so is all self-concern a symptom of mental distortion   
which disappears as soon as one is in the normal state.

**There are many persons who have a great attachment to their own  
individuality.   
They want first and foremost to remain as an individual and then search, for  
they are not prepared to lose that individuality.   
While retaining their identity, they want to find out what is the truth.   
But in this process, you must get rid of the identity itself.   
If you really find out what you are, you will see that you are not an  
individual, you are not a person, you are not a body.**

LIFE IS LOVE AND LOVE IS LIFE   
Q: What is the position of the man who was a sincere student of   
Yoga for some time and then got discouraged and abandoned   
all efforts?   
M: What a man appears to do, or not to do, is often deceptive.   
His apparent lethargy may be just a gathering of strength. The   
causes of our behaviour are very subtle. One must not be quick   
to condemn, not even to praise. Remember that Yoga is the   
work of the inner self (vyakta) on the outer self (vyakti). All that   
the outer does is merely in response to the inner.   
Q: Still the outer helps.   
M: How much can it help and in what way? It has some control   
over the body and can improve its posture and breathing. Over   
the mindâs thoughts and feelings it has little mastery, for it is it-   
self the mind. It is the inner that can control the outer. The outer   
will be wise to obey.   
Q: If it is the inner that is ultimately responsible for manâs   
spiritual development, why is the outer so much exhorted and   
encouraged?   
M: The outer can help by keeping quiet and free from desire   
and fear. You would have noticed that all advice to the outer is in   
the form of negations: donât, stop, refrain, forego, give up, sac-   
rifice, surrender, see the false as false. Even the little descrip-   
tion of reality that is given is through denials â ânot this, not thisâ,   
(neti, neti). All positives belong to the inner self, as all absolutes   
â to Reality.   
Q: How are we to distinguish the inner from the outer in actual   
experience?   
M: The inner is the source of inspiration, the outer is moved by   
memory. The source is untraceable, while all memory begins   
somewhere. Thus the outer is always determined, while the   
inner cannot be held in words. The mistake of students consists   
in their imagining the inner to be something to get hold of, and   
forgetting that all perceivables are transient and, therefore, un-   
real. Only that which makes perception possible, call it Life or   
Brahman, or what you like, is real.   
Q: Must Life have a body for its self-expression?   
M: The body seeks to live. It is not life that needs the body; it is   
the body that needs life.   
Q: Does life do it deliberately?   
M: Does love act deliberately? Yes and no. Life is love and love   
is life. What keeps the body together but love? What is desire,   
but love of the self? What is fear but the urge to protect? And   
what is knowledge but the love of truth? The means and forms   
may be wrong, but the motive behind is always love â love of   
the me and the mine. The me and the mine may be small, or   
may explode and embrace the universe, but love remains.   
LIFE IS LOVE AND LOVE IS LIFE.   
Q: The repetition of the name of God is very common in India. Is   
there any virtue in it?   
M: When you know the name of a thing, or a person, you can   
find it easily. By calling God by His name you make Him come to   
you.   
Q: In what shape does He come?   
M: According to your expectations. If you happen to be unlucky   
and some saintly soul gives you a mantra for good luck and you   
repeat it with faith and devotion, your bad luck is bound to turn.   
Steady faith is stronger than destiny. Destiny is the result of   
causes, mostly accidental, and is therefore loosely woven. Con-   
fidence and good hope will overcome it easily.   
Q: When a mantra is chanted, what exactly happens?   
M: The sound of mantra creates the shape which will embody   
the Self. The Self can embody any shape â and operate   
through it. After all, the Self is expressing itself in action â and a   
mantra is primarily energy in action. It acts on you, it acts on   
your surroundings.   
Q: The mantra is traditional. Must it be so?   
M: Since times immemorial a link was created between certain   
words and corresponding energies and reinforced by number-   
less repetitions. It is just like a road to walk on. It is an easy way   
â only faith is needed. You trust the road to take you to your des-   
tination.   
Q: In Europe there is no tradition of a mantra, except in some   
contemplative orders. Of what use is it to a modern young Wes-   
terner?   
M: None, unless he is very much attracted. For him the right   
procedure is to adhere to the thought that he is the ground of all   
knowledge, the immutable and perennial awareness of all that   
happens to the senses and the mind. If he keeps it in mind all   
the time, aware and alert, he is bound to break the bounds of   
non-awareness and emerge into pure life, light and love. The   
idea â âI am the witness onlyâ will purify the body and the mind   
and open the eye of wisdom. Then man goes beyond illusion   
and his heart is free of all desires. Just like ice turns to water,   
and water to vapour, and vapour dissolves in air and disap-   
pears in space, so does the body dissolve into pure awareness   
(chidakash), then into pure being (paramakash), which is   
beyond all existence and non-existence.

Go deep into the sense of 'I am' and you will find.   
How do you find a thing you have mislaid or forgotton? You keep it in your  
mind until you recall it.   
The sense of being, of 'I am' is the first to emerge. Ask yourself whence it  
comes, or just watch it quietly.   
When the mind stays in the 'I am', without moving, you enter a state that  
cannot be verbalized but can be experienced. All you need to do is to try and  
try again.   
How do you go about finding anything? By keeping your mind and heart on it.  
Interest there must be and steady remembrance. To remember what needs to be  
remembered is the secret of success. You come to it through earnestness.   
Take the first step first. All blessings come from within. Turn within. 'I am'  
you know. Be with it all the time you can spare, until you revert to it  
spontaneously. There is no simpler and easier way.   
 Questioner: Since I cannot improve sattva, am I to deal with tamas and rajas  
only? How do I deal with them?   
Nisargadatta: By watching their influence in you and on you. Be aware of them  
in operation, watch their expression in your thoughts, words and deeds, and  
gradually their grip on you will lessen and the clear light of sattva will  
emerge.   
 Questioner: I can see the mechanism of my confusion, but I do not see my way  
out of it.   
Nisargadatta: The very examination of the mechanism shows the way. After all,  
your confusion is only in your mind, which so far has never rebelled against  
confusion and never got to grips with it. It rebelled only against pain.   
Be alert. Question, observe, investigate, learn all you can about confusion,  
how it operates, what it does to you and others. By being clear about  
confusion you become clear of confusion.   
 Use your mind. Remember. Observe.   
You are not different from others. Most of their experiences are valid for you  
too.   
Think clearly and deeply, go into the structure of your desires and their  
ramifications. They are a most important part of your mental and emotional  
make-up and powerfully affect your actions.   
Remember, you cannot abandon what you do not know. To go beyond yourself, you  
must know yourself.   
Just keep in mind the feeling 'I am', merge in it, till your mind and feeling  
become one. By repeated attempts you will stumble on the right balance of  
attention and affection and your mind will be firmly established in the  
thought-feeling 'I am'.   
 Questioner: Then what is needed?   
Nisargadatta: Distrust your mind, and go beyond.   
Questioner: What shall I find beyond the mind?   
Nisargadatta: The direct experience of being, knowing and loving.   
Questioner: How does one go beyond the mind?   
Nisargadatta: There are many starting points - they all lead to the same goal.  
You may begin with selfless work, abandoning the fruits of action; you may  
then give up thinking and in the end give up all desires. Here, giving up  
(tyaga) is the operational factor.   
Or you may not bother about anything you want, or think, or do and just stay  
put in the thought and feeling 'I am, focussing 'I am firmly in your mind.   
All kind of experience may come to you - remain unmoved in the knowledge that  
all perceivable is transient, and only the 'I am' endures.   
 Truth is simple and open to all. Why do you complicate? Truth is loving and  
lovable. It includes all, accepts all, purifies all.   
It is untruth that is difficult and a source of trouble. It always wants,  
expects, demands. Being false, it is empty, always in search of confirmation  
and reassurance. It is afraid of and avoids inquiry. It identifies itself with  
any support, however weak and momentary. Whatever it gets, it loses and asks  
for more.   
 Questioner: Why do you keep on dismissing the person (vyakti) as of no  
importance? Personality is the primary fact of our existence. It occupies the  
entire stage.   
Nisargadatta: As long as you do not see that it is a mere habit, built on  
memory, prompted by desire, you will think yourself to be a person - living,  
feeling, thinking, active, passive, pleased or pained. Question yourself, ask  
yourself: 'Is it so?', 'Who am I?', 'What is behind and beyond all this?' And  
soon you will see your mistake. And it is in the very nature of a mistake to  
cease to be, when seen.   
 Go on pondering, wondering, being anxious to find a way. Be conscious of  
yourself, watch your mind, give it your full attention. Don't look for quick  
results; there may be none within your noticing. Unkown to you, your psyche  
will undergo a change, there will be more clarity in your thinking, charity in  
your feeling, purity in your behaviour.   
You need not aim at these - you will witness the change all the same. For,  
what you are now is the result of inattention and what you become will be the  
fruit of attention.   
 Nisargadatta: The nature of the perfect mirror is such that you cannot see  
it. Whatever you can see is bound to be a stain. Turn away from it, give it  
up, know it as unwanted.   
Questioner: All perceivables, are they stains?   
Nisargadatta: All are stains   
Questioner: The entire world is a stain.   
Nisargadatta: Yes, it is.   
Questioner: How awful! So, the universe is of no value?   
Nisargadatta: It is of tremendous value. By going beyond it you realize  
yourself.   
Questioner: But why did it come into being in the first instance?   
Nisargadatta: You will know when it ends.   
Questioner: Will it ever end?   
Nisargadatta: Yes, for you.   
Questioner: When did it begin?   
Nisargadatta: Now.   
Questioner: When will it end?   
Nisargadatta: Now.   
Questioner: It does not end now?   
Nisargadatta: You don't let it.   
Questioner: I want to let it.   
Nisargadatta: You don't. All your life is connected with it. Your past and  
future, your desires and fears, all have their roots in the world. Without the  
world where are you. who are you?   
Questioner: But that is exactly what I came to find out.   
Nisargadatta: And I am telling you exactly this: find a foothold in the beyond  
and all will be clear and easy.

**May 10, 1980 Maharaj: How did I get to the truth that I prevail  
everlastingly?   
 By meditating on the meditator, by "I Amness" merging into "I Airiness".   
 Only then did I understand what my true nature is.   
 The great Sages meditated in the same way.   
 Nobody had told me how to do it.   
 I did not seek this knowledge externally.   
 It sprouted within me.   
 I meditated like the Sages and saw a vision.   
 Initially, there was space, and in the space I saw the principles embodied.   
 Actually, they have no bodies, but in my vision they had bodies.   
 I called them Prakriti and Purusha, the male and female aspects of cosmic consciousness.   
 Until the union of Prakriti and Purusha, the dynamic, all-pervading consciousness lay in a dormant state.   
 In the union of the male and female aspects, emissions were planted in the female of these figures.   
 When these emissions merged in the womb they started taking form.   
 After nine months of gestation, an infant was delivered.   
 That consciousness which was planted in the womb was the causal body, the "lingadeha".   
 In that "lingadeha", the knowledge "I Am" was in a dormant condition.   
 This is what I saw in meditation.   
Questioner: How did we lose this pure consciousness state?   
M: Every being experiences the Isvara state, either directly or potentially,  
but he is so wrapped up in this objective world that he loses his identity.   
 You must know what this "I Am" principle is.   
 It appears spontaneously and with its appearance begins the riddle of conceptual life.   
Q: How do I start this search for my Self?   
M: Start from the very beginning.   
 In this gross world I began with my parents, because I knew full well that my  
principle was already dwelling there in the collection of their bodily  
elements out of which I emanated.   
 But I came to the conclusion that I could not be that principle which came from the mother's body.   
 There is nobody here who is 100 years old.   
 Does that mean that 100 years ago you did not exist?   
Q: I don't know.   
M: The one who said, "I don't know" must have been there; in short, you were  
not like this, but you must have been something.   
 You must comprehend this correctly.   
 100 years back I was not like this; so, the one pointing this out must have been there.   
 You did, and do, exist unto eternity.   
 What I am expounding does not relate to worldly knowledge.   
 You do not want to give up either worldly knowledge or so-called spiritual knowledge, and yet, through these worldly concepts, you want to understand the riddle of your existence, and that is precisely why you are not able to understand.   
 In truth, your state is one of Absolute bliss, not this phenomenal state.   
 In that non-phenomenal state you are full of bliss but there is no experience of its presence.   
 In that state there is no trace of misery or unhappiness, only unalloyed bliss.   
 What am I talking about?   
Q: Ananda (bliss).   
M: Because you want some satisfaction according to your own concepts, you try  
to qualify unalloyed bliss.   
 The term "ananda" has significance only when it signifies that the bodily beingness is available to experience it.   
 When you are in deep sleep and you start to see forms, you are actually dreaming.   
 Aren't those dream forms coming from your own beingness?   
 Whatever you see, even in the waking state, doesn't it come from your own beingness which is dwelling within the body?   
 In deep sleep, consciousness was in a dormant condition; there were no bodies, no concepts, no encumbrances.   
 Upon the arrival of this apparently wakeful state, with the arrival of the concept "I Am", the love of "I Am" woke up.   
 That itself is Maya, illusion.   
Q: Does Maharaj mean that the experiencer of the three states is the Self?   
M: That is the Saguna Brahman state; because of your beingness the other  
states are.   
 The dream world is very old, it is not new.   
 You see old monuments in your dreams.   
 Your beingness is very powerful.   
 The emergence of this beingness itself constitutes time.   
 Everything is beingness, but I, the Absolute, am not that.   
 In meditation, there was space, when suddenly two forms appeared out of no-form, Prakriti and Purusha, and the quintessence of these forms was the knowledge "I Am".   
 There were no forms, then suddenly forms appeared, just as in the dream world.   
 You as a dreamer are sleeping on the bed, but in your dream world you see a body and you think it is you, and you are doing everything through this dream body.   
 In that same way, bodies are created in the so-called waking state.   
 The Prakriti and Purusha state has no form and is eternal, having neither a beginning nor an end.   
 But from it come the five elements, and with them, simultaneously, the body is formed at the moment that time is first experienced.   
 This process is ever continuing, with the body-form merely indicative of the opportunity to experience time.   
 This explanation will not reach home to everyone.   
 At the moment of so-called death, with what identity would you like to depart?   
Q: As Parabrahman.   
M: The Absolute, which I call Parabrahman, what is it like?   
 What you are doing is multiplying words with more words, concepts with more concepts.   
Q: Maharaj must take me out of this.   
M: Can you define what you are?   
Q: I must have your blessing to understand what I am.   
M: You are very adept at word-games.   
 While I am talking about knowledge that is beyond this phenomenal world, you are trying to understand through worldly concepts and words.   
 Give up all these concepts and inquire into the nature of your beingness.   
 How did you happen to be?   
 Ponder it!   
 The real blessing of the Guru comes when your knowledge itself sprouts inside you.**

**Your own little body too is full of mysteries and dangers, yet you are not  
afraid of it, for you take it as your own.   
What you do not know is that the entire universe is your body, and you need  
not be afraid of it.   
You may say you have two bodies: the personal and the universal. The personal  
comes and goes, the universal is always with you.   
The entire creation is your universal body. You are so blinded by what is  
personal, that you do not see the universal.   
This blindness will not end by itself - it must be undone skilfully and  
deliberately.   
When all illusions are understood and abandoned, you reach the error-free and  
perfect state in which all distinctions between the personal and the universal  
are no more.**

**" This dwelling on the sense 'I am' is the simple, easy and natural Yoga,  
the Nisarga Yoga.   
There is no secrecy in it and no dependence; no preparation or initiation is  
required.   
Whoever is puzzled by his very existence as a conscious being and earnestly  
wants to find his own source,   
can grasp the ever-present sense of 'I am' and dwell on it assiduously and  
patiently,   
till the clouds obscuring the mind dissolve and the heart of being is seen in  
all its glory."   
Maurice Frydman**  
 **" There's nothing from which the world could profit more than from giving  
up profit.   
A man who's no longer thinking in terms of winning and loosing is truly non-  
violent man, since he's above all conflicts."

**Your expectation of something unique and dramatic, of some wonderful  
explosion, is merely hindering and delaying your Self Realization.   
You are not to expect an explosion, for the explosion has already happened -  
at the moment when you were born,   
when you realized yourself as Being-Knowing-Feeling. There is only one mistake  
you are making: you take the inner for the outer and the outer for the inner.   
What is in you, you take to be outside you and what is outside, you take to be  
in you. The mind and feelings are external, but you take them to be intimate.   
You believe the world to be objective, while it is entirely a projection of  
you psyche. That is the basic confusion and no new explosion will set it  
right!   
You have to think yourself out of it. There is no other way.   
Watch your thoughts as you watch the street traffic. People come and go; you  
register without response.   
It may not be easy in the beginning, but with some practice you will find that  
your mind can function on many levels at the same time and you can be aware of  
them all.   
It is only when you have a vested interest in any particular level, that your  
attention gets caught in it and you black out on other levels.   
Even then, the work on the blacked out levels goes on, outside the field of  
consciousness. Do not struggle with your memories and thoughts.   
Try only to include in your field of attention the other, more important  
questions, like "Who am I?", "How did I happen to be born?"   
"Whence this universe around me?" "What is real and what is momentary?" No  
memory will persist if you lose interest in it.   
It is the emotional link that perpetuates the bondage.   
You are always seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, always after happiness and  
peace.Don't you see that it is your very search for happiness that makes you  
feel miserable?   
Try the other way: Indifferent to pain and pleasure, neither asking nor  
refusing, give all your attention to the level on which "I AM" is timelessly  
present.   
Soon you will realise that peace and happiness are in your very nature and it  
is only seeking them through some particular channels that disturbs.   
Avoid the disturbance, that is all.There is no need to seek: You would not  
seek what you are already have. You yourself are God, the Supreme Reality.   
To begin with, trust me, trust the teacher. It enables you to make the first  
step - and then your trust is justified by your own experience.   
In every walk of life, initial trust is essential; without it, little can be  
done. Every undertaking is an act of faith. Even your daily bread you eat on  
trust.   
By remembering what I told you, you will achieve everything. I am telling you  
again: You are the all pervading, all transcending reality.   
Behave accordingly: think, feel and act in harmony with the whole and the  
actual experience of what I say will dawn upon you in no time!   
No effort is needed. Have faith and act on it.   
Please see that I want nothing from you.It is in your own interest that I  
speak, because above all you love yourself, you want yourself secure and  
happy.   
Don't be ashamed of it, don't deny it. It is natural and good to love  
oneself.Only you should know what exactly you love.   
It is not the body that you love, it is Life - perceiving, feeling, thinking,  
doing, loving, striving, creating. It is that Life you love, which is you,  
which is all.   
Realize it in its totality, beyond all divisions and limitations, and all your  
desires will merge in it, for the greater contains the smaller.   
Therefore, find yourself; for in finding that, you find all.   
Everybody is glad to be, but few know the Fullness of it. You come to know by  
dwelling in your mind on "I AM", "I KNOW" "I LOVE"   
\- with the will of reaching the deepest meaning of these words.**

**The 'I am' came first, it's ever present, ever available, refuse all  
thoughts except 'I am', stay there.   
Understanding the 'I am', your sense of 'being' or just 'presence' is  
extremely important as on it rests the entire outcome of the teaching.   
Firstly, are you at all aware of your 'being' or of the fact that 'you are'?   
You have 'to be' before anything else can be, your sense of 'presence' or the  
feeling 'I am' is really fundamental to anything that has to follow.   
Secondly, this sense of 'being' or the feeling 'I am', was it not the very  
first event or happening before any of your living experiences could begin?   
Apply your mind go back in time to the moment when it dawned on you that 'you  
are' or 'I am'.   
This 'I am' is still there with you, ever present, ever available, it was and  
still is the first thought, refuse all other thoughts and come back there and  
stay there.   
So try to understand and grasp this 'beingness' or 'I amness' that is inherent  
in you. The more precisely and clearly you do it the more rapid will be your  
progress.

**Consistently and with perseverance separate the 'I am' from 'this' or  
'that', just keep in mind the feeling 'I am'.   
All this is not as easy as it sounds, it is hard work, your consistency and  
perseverance are keys to your success.   
Separate the 'I am' from 'I am this' or' I am that' or 'I am so and so' all  
these are add-ons and have been loaded onto you by others and society.   
All these appendages on the 'I am' may be of some value in your day to day  
living but if your goal or quest is for eternity, then they are impediments.   
You will have to separate them from the 'I am' and just keep in mind your  
sense of 'presence' or the feeling 'I am'.   
Give all your attention to the 'I am', which is timeless presence, the 'I am'  
applies to all, come back to it repeatedly.   
Use your memory to go back in time to the stage when you just came to know  
that 'you are' without words. Did you have a sense of time then? Did you know  
who you are or who your parents are? Did you know where you were  
geographically located? You knew none of these, it was a timeless presence,  
you did of course know space which came with the 'I am', but not time, and  
this timeless presence applies to all. Come back to this timeless and wordless  
'I am' again and again.   
Hold on to the 'I am' to the exclusion of everything else, the 'I am' in  
movement creates the world, the 'I am' at peace becomes the Absolute.   
Leave everything aside and just grab hold of the 'I am'. Just observe its  
power, its stirrings, and its movements that created the world along with  
which came all this turmoil and misery. Come back to the 'I am' and let the 'I  
am' be in the 'I am'. Then it becomes still and disappears, and then there is  
peace, for there is only the Absolute now.

**The 'I am' has brought you in, the 'I am' will take you out, the 'I am' is  
the door, stay at it! It's open!   
The feeling 'I am' very clearly qualifies as the port of entry or doorway  
through which you came into this world and thus it also qualifies as the way  
out.   
And there is no other way out! Stay at it and you shall see that this door is  
always open, it was never closed.   
Unless you go back and stay in the 'I am' for a sufficiently long time you  
won't come to know this fact.   
You have to be there before you can say 'I am', the 'I am' is the root of all  
appearance.   
There definitely was a substratum on which this knowledge 'I am' arose, it was  
a wordless feeling.   
It was only when you learnt a language that you could say 'I am'. Along with  
the wordless 'I am' also came space and the world,   
so the 'I am' is at the root of whatever you perceive.

**Questioner: Would Maharaj talk about the grace of the guru?   
Maharaj: It is the intensity of the faith you have in the guru's words that is   
most important; once that is there, the grace flows automatically. The faith   
in the guru is based on the consciousness within, faith in one's Self. The   
love for the beingness I am trying to direct to a higher level. What is  
lasting   
is this love for the Self, on which temples have been built. This  
Christconsciousness   
is existing; is it faith in a man? As a man, Christ was crucified,   
but that universal consciousness which was his lives today.   
Q: Is there a means of releasing or elevating this love?   
M: That is a vritti (mental modification), that is part of the process.   
There are various actions, practices, etc. Even in daily life you have certain   
procedures; are they not the puja (worship) for this consciousness?   
Q. Maharaj is talking about the kind of love that transcends consciousness  
itself?   
M: The breeze that comes out of the universal consciousness is what   
keeps other kinds of love alive. Most people limit their love to an  
individual.   
Q How does one expand into universal love?   
M: Understand the false as false, that's all you can do; you cannot turn   
one thing into another.   
Q: Doesn't love lose its vitality when it loses its object?   
M: You are asking from the body level, you are not going back to your   
state before the body came into existence. Before the word "love" came   
into existence, you are. Prior to this identification with the body, you   
must recede into That.   
Since I have found my true permanent state I have no need for any of   
this, so I am just waiting for it to go. In that state of fullness there is no   
need at all. I have had this state of fullness after I met my guru; if I   
hadn't met my guru I would have lived and died as a man.   
My association with my Guru was scarcely for two and a half years. He   
was staying some 200 kilometers away, he would come here once every   
four months, for fifteen days; this is the fruit of that. The words he gave me   
touched me very deeply. I abided in one thing only: the words of my Guru   
are the truth, and he said, "You are the Parabrahman. "No more doubts and   
no more questions on that. Once my Guru conveyed to   
me what he had to say I never bothered about other things - I hung on to   
the words of the Guru.   
Questioner: Is the world as we see it, a thought? It is written in some places  
that   
when one sees the world one does not see the Self, and conversely, when one  
sees the   
Self, one does not see manifestation.   
Maharaj: The world is nothing but the picture of your own "I" consciousness.   
As if you had received a phone call telling you that you are,   
and immediately the world appears. When you are in deep sleep and   
you feel that you are awake, the dream world appears simultaneously.   
With the "I Am," the world appears in the waking and dream states.   
Q. Can one see the world without the presence of the ego?   
M.â¢ When is there an ego? The ego is there when you have certain   
reactions. You take delivery of whatever is observed spontaneously. You   
cling to it, register it, then only is there an ego.   
You see some building material lying on the road - you think that   
you are a carpenter and you start figuring how to use that material; the   
thought process has started, ego starts. If you are nobody, you will not   
bother about the building material - you will just observe it and go your   
way. Once it is out of sight it is out of mind; but when you receive that   
delivery, you cogitate over it, ego has started.   
Q. So when it comes to the utility of what is seen, that's when the ego comes  
into being?   
M. Yes. That is its nature.   
Q To get back to my other question, when the world is seen, the Self is not;  
when   
the Self is seen the world is not, is that so?   
M. It is the other way. When you know that you are - the world is, if   
you are not - your world is not.   
Q: Is "I" the Self? I am talking about the difference between the `I Am" and  
the   
thought "I am a man, "which is the ego. In the "IAm"consciousness, does the  
world   
exist? Can you see it?   
M.â¢ When you wake up you have only the sense of being, without   
words, this is the primary principle, the prerequisite; later on you know   
fully that you are and the world is, but that is an illusion, like the horns  
of   
a hare. The world is like the dream world, finally. Understand this point   
very thoroughly; you are dealing too much with the ego. Have you   
understood what was said about the ego?   
Q: I think I have, if I ask another question maybe I can resolve it. Using the  
analogy   
of the snake and the rope (seeing a rope in a dimly lit place and mistaking it  
for a   
snake), if we use the world in that analogy where is the mistaken identity  
there?   
M.â¢ The Self is the world. You are talking about removing the identity   
between the Self and the world, aren't you? First of all, dispose of the   
Self, understand what the Self is. Get to know the Self first, then get to   
know what the world is. The reason the world appeared is that you came to   
know that you are.   
Q. How can one, in the waking state, lose the sensation of the world  
altogether and   
just be the Self?   
M. You will have to consult the sun. Ask him, "How do you get rid,of   
your light?". . . light is the manifestation of the sun. Can you separate the   
light from the sun or the sun from the light? Because of the sun, the light   
is; because you are your world is.   
Because the witnessing state happens, hence you are; because you are,   
witnessing ispalpably felt; because the sun is, light is. If there is no   
witnessing, where is the witness? Dwell there.   
Q, The being is the witness?   
M. There are two witnessing stages; beingness witnesses all this   
manifestation. Witnessing of this beingness, consciousness, happens to   
that eternal principle, the Absolute.**

**Questioner: Child consciousness implies a retrogression, as compared to the  
man   
consciousness. When in that state there is no consideration of child or man   
consciousness, there is just being -there is no further given direction.   
M. There is no difference in the child consciousness and the man   
consciousness.   
Q. If the space that fills the small pot is the same as the space that fills  
the big pot,   
how to recognize the small pot?   
M. The seed of the universe is dimensionless but, because of the body, the   
consciousness appears and identifies with the body but actually   
everything is manifest, all-pervasive consciousness. That "I love" is   
manifest. For the whole universe there is no question of profit or loss,   
only when the identification with the body is present does the question   
arise.   
When you take food, who is eating? The "I Amness." The food also   
contains the "I Amness," so when you consume it, you retain your "I   
Amness." Though the "I Amness" is in the food, nobody identifies with the   
food - they say, "this is my lunch; I am not this," but when it is consumed   
by them and becomes part of the body they say, "I am the body" \- that   
mistake they make.   
Q: I desire to be in the state of a jnani.   
M.- You have to know that knowledge "I Am."Jnani and knowledge are   
one.   
Q: Just by being you have this knowledge?   
M: You are already that, but you have to try to understand yourself.   
Q You understand that by the very essence of your being, so there is no  
knowledge   
involved.   
M.- At the moment you are identifying with the body, so you do not   
know that secret. You will come to know gradually, when you really   
become that.   
Q. If there is only the sense of being in the "I Am, "where do concepts come  
in?   
M: Because of the vital breath, the mind flow is there. Mind means words,   
so thoughts are there - they are the concepts. Look at your root, the child   
consciousness, and finish it off.   
Q. The di ffrculty lies in the fact that all consciousness is identical, so  
how to get to the   
root?   
M. This consciousness is a tree, but there was a seed - go to the seed.   
The consciousness you have now is the same as the child consciousness;   
hold on to that, that is enough. So long as the consciousness is there   
everything is so important to you, but if that vanishes, then what is the   
worth of this whole world to you? Who is the knower of the seed? Give   
attention to how this "I Amness" has appeared - then you will know. Accept   
this identification only: that you are this manifest pure beingness,   
the very soul of the universe, of this life that you observe, and presently   
you are just wearing this bodily attire. Make a note of it; you have taken   
down so many things in life, just for fun, why don't you take this down   
also and see what happens? See what happens when you look at the   
moon and know that the moon is there provided you are there; because   
you are the moon is. This grand concept, this joy, you directly experience   
and enjoy.   
Q. There must be some power which is responsible for this creation.   
M.â¢ The power is the Self which each one has in his beingness - that   
power is time-bound. From the time that beingness comes it creates   
automatically until that beingness disappears. Earlier there was nothing -   
after there is nothing. It is only during the duration of the beingness that   
the world and creation is. This power is the faith in the primordial concept   
"I Am," and that is the concept which weaves the web of creation.   
The entire manifestation is an appearance in this concept.**

## Re:[107]Love,always love and only love Quotes of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj

**Maharaj: Whatever goes on in the world is based on the life force (pram   
shakti), but the Atman, the witnesser, is totally apart; no action can be   
attributed to the Atman.   
So long as you have not understood pram shakti, the vital breath,   
whose language is the four types of speech which flow through the vital   
breath - so long as you do not recognize it, whatever the mind tells you   
you are bound to take as certain. Those concepts which the mind gives you   
will be final for you,   
Questioner: What are the four types of speech?   
M. They are, Para (source-consciousness), then pashyanti (the emanation   
of thoughts), then madhyama (formulation of thoughts-words), and   
vaikhari (language explodes out). The ordinary ignorant person is not   
aware of Para and pashyanti, which starts the whole process, they are too   
subtle; he starts working on madhyama, which is also identified with the   
mind, and comes out with words (vaikhari).   
The mind throws out words and thoughts, and through these we   
have mistaken our identity as "me" or "mine," whereas whatever takes   
place is independent of the one who witnesses and is based entirely on the   
life force. This consciousness has mistakenly identified itself with the body,   
and with thoughts or words. It considers itself to be guilty of something, or   
that it has acquired merit by some action, whereas everything merely   
takes place through the action of the life force.   
The one who understands this vital breath, the life force, is beyond all   
mental concepts. The one who has not understood it is a slave to his   
thoughts.   
Q; After prolonged use of the mantra, will it get dissolved?   
M.â¢ Both the mantra and the faith in the mantra will get dissolved. There is   
a purpose in the mantra. In India the mantra has great efficacy. By   
concentrating on the mantra the form behind the mantra will appear out of the   
ether, but all this is time bound. Man has evolved all kinds of things for his   
own preservation, the preservation of the consciousness.   
I am not any longer concerned with, and no longer want, the   
continuation of either the body or the vital breath.   
That bundle of three states and three attributes3 has been born, and   
whatever happens, happens to that bundle, and I am not concerned   
with it. That is why I am totally fearless, without any reaction to a   
disease which would be traumatic to others.   
Having known that I am not that which has been born, yet there is   
some little attachment to that with which I have been associated for a   
long time - it is a speck of attachment because of eighty-four years'  
association.   
Say I meet someone from my hometown whom I have known   
for a long time, he comes and he goes away, so I bid him goodbye, and   
there is that little speck of attachment, because I have known him for a   
long time.   
The consciousness which is born thinks that it is the body and works   
through the three gunas, but I have nothing to do with this, the whole   
thing is an illusion.   
Q. Will there be no continuation of memories after death?   
M: Only if there is sugar cane, or sugar, thelre will be swetness. If the   
body is not there, how can there be memories, the beingness itself is   
gone.   
Q. How does one know what remains?   
M. There are twenty people in this room, all twenty people leave, then   
what remains is there, but someone who has left cannot understand   
what it is. So in that Parabrahman which is without attributes, without   
identity, unconditioned, who is there to ask?   
This is to be understood, but not by someone: the experience and the   
experiencer must be one, you must become the experience. What is this   
Parabrahman like? The answer is, what is Bombay? Don't give me the   
geography or the atmosphere of Bombay, give me a handful of Bombay.   
What is Bombay? It is impossible to say, so also with Parabrahman. There is   
no giving or taking of Parabrahman, you can only be That.   
Q: We want the state which Maharaj enjoys.   
M. The eternal Truth is there, but for witnessing it is of no use. You   
give up this study in the name of religion or spirituality, or whatever you   
are trying to study. Do only one thing, that "I Amness" or consciousness is   
the Godliest principle; it is there only so long as the vital breath is there  
- it is   
presently your nature. You worship that only. That "I Amness' is   
something like the sweetness of the sugar cane, abide in the sweetness of   
your beingness, then only you will reach and abide in eternal peace.   
Q. I feel the life force energy polarized and intensified in my body in the  
presence of   
Maharaj.   
M. In practicing meditation the life force gets purified, and when it is   
purified the light of the Self shines forth, but the, working principle is the   
life force. When this purified life force and the light of the Atman (Self)   
merge, then the concept, the mind, the imagination, everything is taken   
away. The life force is the acting principle and that which gives sentience to   
the person is the consciousness.   
Q. This is what the tradition of shiva and shakti signifies?   
M: Shiva means the consciousness and shakti is the life force. People go   
by various names which have been given, and forget the basic principle.   
Merely sit in contemplation and let the consciousness unfold itself.   
What have you understood?   
Q, This consciousness starts to get a greater sense of itself, and the prang  
and the   
body's energy becomes intensified and polarized, it seems to be part of the  
purification.   
M. When this consciousness and the pram shakti (life force) merge, they   
tend to go and become steady in the Brahma-randra, and then all thoughts   
cease. This is the start of samadhi, Then one comes back again and the life   
force starts its normal activities.   
Maharaja Understand that it is not the individual which has   
consciousness, it is the consciousness which assumes innumerable forms.   
That something which is born or which will die is purely imaginary. It is   
the child of a barren woman.   
In the absence of this basic concept "I Am" there is no thought, there is   
no consciousness.   
Questioner: Maharaj has said that ifyou stay in the consciousness, the  
beingness, it   
will automatically happen, that you will transcend the consciousness. Is this  
true, there   
is nothing more to be done?   
M. Suppose I am sitting here and you come, I come to know that you   
are, the witnessing happens automatically. Has anything been done?   
No. It is like that. It is simple. You should understand. Just like a raw   
mango becomes a ripe mango, it happens. Many people get satisfied in the   
consciousness state.   
Q: I am not going to be satisfied until I am in Maharaj s state.   
M. Whateveryou consider yourself to be at the moment, when you get rid   
of that, whatever your true nature, it is spontaneous. Abide in the words   
of the Guru.**

**Q. What is a sankalpa?   
M: You want a medical degree, that is the sankalpa. Sadhana is the study,   
practice, homework. You wanted to meet me today, that is a sankalpa. You   
walked here and climbed the stairs, that is the sadhana. That sankalpa has   
no form, the one who makes the sankalpa also has no form. So long as you   
are identifying with the form the practice will go on. Once you reach the   
objective, which is that you are not the body-mind, then there is no   
practice.   
You have great faith in the Bhagavad Gita: is this correct?   
Q. Yes.   
M.â¢ Gita is a song sung by Lord Krishna. He sang the song just as I am   
singing this talk to you now; this is Rg Gita. You have read the Bhagavad   
Gita, recited it, remembered it; but what is important? You must get to   
know that Krishna who sang that Gita. You must get his knowledge,   
what he is.   
Is it not an incarnation? In short,from nothingness the form is   
taken; the nothingness descends into form, that is Avatar. Normally we say   
from nothingness a person is there, but for these great personalities, great   
sages, you will say Avatar. Are you trying to understand that Krishna?   
No, you are creating certain concepts and trying to understand him.   
That is not correct. From nothingness he was - how did it happen? This   
incarnation you must understand, the descending into Avatar, or form;   
what is this? Prior to incarnation that personality had no knowledge about   
himself, after descending into -this incarnation he started knowing   
himself. What are your comments?   
Q: Before Avatar he had no knowledge of himself?   
M. Before descending into this Avatar this knowledge quality is not   
there.   
Q. But Parabrahman. ..   
M. These are all conceptual titles and names; they are shackles on you. In   
your core Self there is no imposition of any title or name, externally you   
have accepted them.   
Any embodied person with the knowledge "I Am" carries on his activity   
in the world with the name only. That inner core, the "I Am" has no   
shackles. Once it is understood that I am that "I Am" only, and not this   
shackled form, then no liberation is called for; that itself is liberation.   
You know the historical facts about Sri Krishna by heart, but you   
must know what this incarnation is. Names are the handcuffs, the bondage.   
Every person is shackled because of his identification with the body.   
Without that name and form, please proceed to talk and question.   
Q: The only words I have are very much words with name and form. They are   
words of gratitude. Gratitude for what Maharaj has blessed me with since I  
have been   
here. To even see a sage in one's lifetime would be an incomparable grace, and  
to have had   
'so much grace from him in the form of his instructions just overwhelms me,  
and there is   
absolutely no way I can ever thank him.   
M. What do you mean by grace? Grace means that you have come to   
me. I and that you are only one. That you understand that we are one is   
grace.   
Q. At times like these that is the hardest thing to understand.   
M: Grace means totality, wholeness, there is no fragmentation.   
Q. [another] Why I am ostracized? Why can't I see the truth?   
M. You are ostracized because you are identifying with the body-mind   
and the memory that you are a body. Give up that identity, and that   
memory, and then whatever you see will be the truth.   
This is a very rare, a very precious opportunity, wherein you get this   
conflux of three entities: body, vital force and the touch of "I Amness,"   
and with this alone you can reach right up to the Absolute - you can   
abide in the Absolute.   
In the name of spirituality people carry out various types of acting,   
likejapa, penances, etc. Once you accept that actors pose, you undergo the   
disciplines and therefore all the sufferings are related to that. This is not   
going to lead you to the Ultimate, the Absolute.

**Q: Suppose the witnessing stops, is it samadhi?   
M. Suppose you all go away, there is no more witnessing, I am still   
here, but I have nothing to witness. In that beingness the otherliness is   
there and witnessing takes place. If consciousness is not there the   
Absolute cannot know Itself - there is nothing but the Absolute - therefore   
no witnessing.   
Q: Suppose I am just watching that all actions are happening through me and I  
am   
doing nothing, is meditation necessary?   
M. That is a sort of meditation, but the right meditation is when you   
meditate on your Self. You come to that state when you woke up in the   
morning and you watch the consciousness; that is the state when you   
meditate on your Self.   
Presently you think that consciousness is watching consciousness, but   
consciousness is being watched from the Absolute platform only.   
Maharaja All this spirituality is only for understanding your true   
nature. To achieve this what is "being alive" is the whole question. Once   
you know your true nature then being alive is not as an individual but   
being alive is simply being a part of that spontaneous manifestation.   
There is nothing to be sought, the seeker is what is to be seen. Merely see  
the   
picture as it is.   
All of you are seekers: let me know what it is that you are seeking.   
Questioner: Can you reach that, not just by meditation, but by living with  
others in   
the world?   
M. Unless- you are part of the manifestation can you live? Know this!   
When you are not conscious, your world does not exist. You are conscious   
of your presence and the world outside, they are not two things.   
Understand this. The world can exist only if this psychosomatic apparatus   
is there. If you consider this apparatus as yourself, you accept death   
and die. Thejnani knows this to be just an apparatus and is apart from it.   
Having understood this, you do your job happily. What is happening   
is spontaneous and all activity is part of the total manifestation.   
Q. If manifestation is spontaneous, is there any reason, or cause, of all  
actions?   
 M: In dreams you live for 100 years but when you wake up that dream lasted   
for just five minutes. How did that happen?   
Q. Does Maharaj relate the causeless happening to that dream?   
M. The basic reason for all this great cause is that you exist, so find the   
nature of that. All these acts are done by the child of a barren woman. All   
these are problems of the consciousness; find out the root of the  
consciousness.   
Q. How?   
M. Catch that consciousness by the throat. Conceptual consciousness by   
conceptual throat. Pamper and woo this basic consciousness, it alone can   
satisfy your quest, not your intellect. Unless that knowledge is   
pleased, you cannot have knowledge.   
I never knew; if I had the slightest knowledge would I have descended   
into the prison of my mother's womb? Whatever happens, happens by   
itself. Who can have knowledge of that which existed before conception?   
There is nothing to be acquired. You are That.**

**Questioner: Oh, when will I understand what Maharaj is telling us?   
Maharaj: It will come gradually, because of all the concepts. You have to   
get rid of those. and that takes time.   
Some people are in search of knowledge which is acceptable to their   
mind and intellect, but the sphere of the mind and intellect is of no use to   
receive this knowledge. All your experiences and visions depend on your   
knowledge "I Am" and this itself is going to dissolve.   
For this knowledge there are no customers, no devotees, because   
they want something concrete in their hand, but when your knowingness   
itself is going to dissolve, is it possible to hold on to something?   
Your guru tells you that you have a true identity, but it is not this. It   
is formless, Parabrahman. That Parabrahman is without any doubts. It is not   
conditioned by mays, because with reference to Parabrahman, mays does   
not exist.   
When you listen to this you feel satisfaction and with that the matter   
ends for most people; they don't meditate on this again and again and try   
to find out that principle behind everything.   
When will I be pronounced dead? When the Atman has left the body, but   
I am not that Atman, where is my death there? I am not affected by cancer   
because whatever happens, whatever the experience, I surrender all those   
to the Atman. All the actions and fruits of the actions are surrendered to   
the Atman by the Parabrahman, the Absolute.   
You can never have knowledge about your Self because Parabrahman   
cannot be witnessed. You know what you are not - what you are you cannot   
know.   
Maharaj: TheSelf is subtler than the space. There is no birth or death for   
the Self.   
Don't accept what I tell you blindly; ask me questions. Thoroughly   
scrutinize and examine the knowledge which I expound and only then   
accept it.   
You live in the house but the house is not yourself. Similarly, the   
knowledge "I Am" is in the body but it is not the body.   
Questioner: I do not, fully understand it.   
M. With the mind you will never understand. You are not the mind, nor   
the words, nor the meaning of the words. I expound the knowledge of the   
Self to the Self but you accept it as the knowledge of your body.   
I am completely detached from the body and the consciousness   
which is within the body. Nevertheless, because of the disease, the   
unbearable suffering of the body is being experienced through the   
consciousness. It is unbearable but since I am detached both from the body   
and the consciousness, I am able to speak to you. It is something like the   
fan - the breeze is.there and the sound is also there. In the same way the   
vital breath is there and the sound is also emanating, but all this happening   
is unbearable... the suffering has to be endured.   
When the knowledge "I Am" is not there do you perceive or observe   
anything? Knowingness is knowledge and no-knowingness is also   
knowledge, but it has no form. If you equate it with the body, only then   
you say that you are a male or a female.   
In the absence of knowledge, the question of I know or I do not know   
does not arise. When you understand what I have said about knowledge you   
will fully identify with that.   
Spontaneously I have realized that I am written off from the book of   
consciousness. You will not feel happy unless you taste yourself through   
your body. The body has importance only because the "I Amness," the   
consciousness, is dwelling therein. If the "I Amness" or consciousness is   
not there the body will be disposed of as refuse.   
Call that knowledge "I Am" as your Self, don't call the body as   
knowledge.   
Normally the Guruswill not introduce to you the Self so deeply. They will   
only introduce to you all the rituals.   
The knowledge "I Am" is the primary God; meditate on that only.   
Presently, one may ask why man has created a God. The concept of   
a God is, if you pray to such a God, that God will give you whatever you   
want. Such a God is great. We have an idea that if we demand   
something of Him he will give it.   
Questioner: I want to give up this ego, but I don't know how.   
Maharaj: What is the measurement and the color of this 'ego that you   
want to give up? What have you understood about this ego?   
Q. It is a false conviction of the mind.   
M. It is a pinch in my fingers, this "I Amness," but all the scriptures, the   
sixteen sastras, eighteen puranas and four Vedas have been screaming and   
shouting, trying to describe this Brahman. All those praises are only for   
that tiny little pinch "I Am." The moment you start making a design of that   
"I Amness" you are getting into deep waters.   
This incense holder is silver, you have the knowledge that it is silver.   
What is the shape, color, or design of that knowledge? If all knowledge is   
formless, could there be a form, design or color to the knowledge "I   
Am"? Could it be subject to sin or merit?   
In this timeless ether the touch of "I.Amness" is not there.   
Q: Is it not true that out of compassion for the ignorant thejnani expounds  
knowledge?   
M.â¢ You can say whatever you like. There is no such thing as compassion   
in that state. I have elevated you to that state where you should know   
that you are the very illuminant of everything, and the love to be is also   
therein. When I lead you there why do you ask me such questions? How do   
you know anything?   
Q. Through the mind.   
M: No. The knowingness recognizes the mind, the mind cannot recognize   
consciousness.   
You are overpowered by sleep, you wake up - who recognizes this?   
Prior to mind, the knowingness principle is there. Prior to knowingness,   
there is the priormost principle which knows the consciousness.   
In the final analysis out of the absence of knowledge, knowledge was   
born and knowledge delivered the world, all beings and all things.   
The one who enters spirituality is like cold water which is put on the   
f ire. When you put it on the fire the bubbles start rising and in due   
course it starts boiling. That boiling stage is something like the sadhaka   
entering the highest class of spirituality; at the boiling point he likes to   
talk a lot, put a lot of questions. When the fire is applied continuously the   
boiling stops and simmering takes place. That is the stage where one   
acquires knowledge in spirituality. After listening to these talks will you   
be able to go into quietude? I have my doubts about that, because you still   
like to please your pampered mind. If you have really understood what I   
say does it matter if you please your mind or not?   
I have told you that presently you are like that warmth in the body.   
What is the Parabrahman like? The Parabrahman does not experience this   
warmth,of"I Amness" at all. If you understand, this puzzle will be solved   
for you.   
After understanding this, if one becomes a jnani, that consciousness   
principle and body is available, and they will be involved in the   
emotional field also. It will give full vent to crying and it will also   
enjoy whatever situation is there. Such ajnani is not going to suppress any   
expressions of emotions which spontaneously come out of this   
consciousness and body apparatus.   
Normally people suppose that ajnani should suppress all the   
emotional outbursts. That. is not correct. With your standpoint in the   
Absolute, you are not concerned with the feelings and instinctive outbursts   
of the apparatus.   
A jnani does not volitionally participate, it is spontaneously happening;   
while an ignorant person is deeply involved in that, he assumes   
everything is real. For the jnani, the warmth is also unreal, so whatever   
happens in the realm of warmth is unreal.**

**All creation, every creature, is made up of the five elements, and the   
behavior of each creature depends on the combination of the three guns;   
satwa, rajas, tamas. There is no question of being responsible for anything  
that   
happens in the world. It is only by taking delivery of responsibility that   
one suffers.   
The consciousness of being present, the five elements and the three   
gunas, that is the total of the universal manifestation.   
In your original state there is no awareness of awareness, therefore   
no question of knowledge. The knowledge comes only with the appearance   
of the body and consciousness. This knowledge is really ignorance,   
and whatever knowledge is based on that is also ignorance.   
You have been practicing spirituality for many years, what do you   
have in hand?   
Q. I am consciousness, that is my profit.   
M: Is this profit permanent? Is that your true nature?   
Q. I identify myself with the total manifestation.   
M. All that, is it not only after you got your consciousness? Go back to   
your state before this consciousness came upon you.   
First you identify with the body, then you identify with the   
consciousness, after awhile you continue to be the consciousness, but the   
trap is that you will think you have become ajnani. Even being in   
consciousness is time bound. The original state is before the consciousness   
came upon you. In one case the knowledge was given, it was   
understood, and the person became That in one day; another took a   
thousand years, and also reached that state. Is there any difference?   
What was originally something which I loved, now I no longer want it   
because I am aware, of my true nature. I no longer need this   
consciousness, even for five minutes.   
At the end of your life you will be prepared to pay five lakhs of rupees for   
an extension of even five minutes. I am not prepared to give even one rupee.   
I have lost all love for this manifested world.   
M.â¢ You must maintain this knowledge "I Am" in proper order. I quarrel   
with my people if they don't keep these utensils in proper and clean order.   
Suppose this towel is left unwashed - then I will play hell with whoever is   
responsible. All the dirt which is not the towel should be removed.   
Similarly, "I Am" is the tool through which you get all the knowledge. You   
worship that "I Am," remove all the adulterations, the dirt.   
Q: How to worship the "I Amness",   
M. That knowingness alone points out all the dirt which is imposed on   
it. Even the space is not as pure as the knowledge "I Am." Innately the   
world is very pure; it is rendered dirty because you identify with the   
body. Since you do not recognize your "I Amness" in its purity, you refer to   
various books and Sages to get an identity.   
Q. (another) I am afraid of losing my beingness, my existence.   
M. Where is the question of worry? Even the Parabrahman does not   
know Itself. When we come to the conclusion that you are not, I am not,   
what is left is said to be Parabrahman, but what is Parabrahman? You can't   
describe it, so you are silent. I am also silent. Parabrahman cannot be   
compared with anything.   
Q. Is Nama Japa useful?   
M. By all means do it and its worth will be proved in due course. You   
have to abide in that Japa; it is no use conceptualizing what benefits you   
are going to derive from it. Follow it and realize the benefits. Even if the   
one following Nama-Japa is like a donkey or dud, he will become a great   
Sage - that power is there in the recitation of ajapa. When that person   
comes across a Sat-Guru, the Sage tells him, "You need not take care of   
yourself because you are that immanent principle "I Am." You need not   
take care of anything. You just be and everything will be taken care of   
for you."   
It is a pity that you depend so much on hearsay and you don't try to   
investigate for yourself. Your knowledge is confined to your body and   
borrowed knowledge.   
All the activities of the world are going on because of this "I Amness." It   
is the source which creates the world. Understand that "I Amness' first --   
only then can you transcend it. First of all, be that "I Amness."   
Maharaj: This "I Amness" is a function of nature, a product of the five   
elemental food body. It knows itself, it loves to be. With the aid of this   
knowingness, get to know your Self.   
Many eons have come and gone, but no person could retain his identity   
or his memory perpetually - it is gone with the departure of the   
body. The five element essences, plus the three gunas, means a person;   
with that this knowingness comes, the memory "I Am." This personality   
is sustained by the provisions supplied by the five elements. So long as the   
provisions are supplied in proper order the body and "I Amness" will be   
there. Once the supply is stopped the touch of "I Amness" is gone.   
That which has come to see Maharaj, do you recognize that? Is it the   
body, or something outside the body?   
Questioner: Inside or outside, I don't know.   
M: Very good reply. Keep aside the body and describe that.   
Q. I can't describe it.   
M: Since you can't describe that, what is the use of that?   
Q. No use.   
M. Once you understand this, you will get the truth. The one which is   
listening, which you do not know, is you, and the one which you know as   
you, you are not.   
The highest purpose of spirituality is the Paramatman - that   
knowledge that indwells the body, "I Am," and that cannot be   
described. When you firmly agree that this is right, does it not mean that   
you have the spiritual wisdom?**

**Q. I don 't understand the way the word consciousness is used here. I  
thought   
consciousness was pure awareness, the Ultimate reality.   
M. This consciousness, which depends on the food body which is born, is   
time-bound. That which is prior to consciousness is the Absolute, and when   
consciousness is without a form and not aware of itself, it is the Absolute.  
We   
are nothing but this consciousness.   
You come here and I talk to you but I am not concerned whether you   
come or go. I am totally independent. I, as the Absolute, do not need the   
consciousnes. Total independence is merely to apprehend and   
understand. My apparent dependence is on this consciousness which says   
"I Am." It is this sentience which enables me to perceive you. This concept   
I did not have but even then I existed. I was there before this   
consciousness appeared.   
Whatever you want, desire or worship, can only be concepts. Have you   
heard what is conceptual existence and what is existence prior to concepts?   
Many people have come here purely for spiritual purposes and they have   
professed great love for me. Subsequently some good fortune happens to   
them and they prosper and in their prosperity they have no time to come   
here. All the earlier love is where? This is the province of mays. A person   
comes with the sincere intention of spiritual search, then this mays shows   
him a little bit of temptation and off he goes.   
This mays does not operate independently - we are partners. Will he   
dare divorce himself from this maya? No, he will accept that maya. That   
ego (that I am so and so) is very difficult to get rid of, but the ego cannot   
touch one who really understands what I say.   
You will continue coming here as long as the concepts remain; once   
you go beyond concepts there will be no need to come here.   
Since when and because of what, is what you think you are?   
Questioner: When you observe a problem, any problem in the human mind, ifyou   
observe it very strong and pure, the problem dissolves and there is only  
observation.   
What is that observation, who is that observation, what is the essence of that   
observation? How to go further?   
Maharaj: _ This is a traditional way of understanding. It is a traditional   
mood of the world observation, nothing beyond that. Just a mood, that's   
all. When did this process of observing start? It started with the arrival of   
the waking state, deep sleep state, and the knowlege "I Am," all rolled into   
one "I Am." This is known as birth. With the so-called birth this triad   
has come, and with its arrival observation started. Every day it is going   
on. The moment the "I Amness" comes it is being used for   
experiencing, observing, etc.   
Prior to the happening of this birth, where was that "I Amness"? It   
was not there.   
Q. Going on further, one is in observation, one is just observing, is there  
any further   
question then? What should be the question?   
M. When does the observation occur and of what? You have collected a   
profound vocabulary, but the Self-knowledge has not dawned.   
Q You see, that is what I was observing. How to enquire into that?   
M: You know you are. Because you know you are, everything is   
happening. Get to know that knowledge "I Am." When you understand   
what that "I Amness" is, then the shell of the mystery is broken.   
Q: What is the procedure to get at that?   
M.â¢ Xou go to the source out of which this question arose. That source   
will solve this question.   
Q. Is there any enquiry in that?   
M. Oh yes. If anybody, any principle, wants to pose the question he   
should not embrace the body as himself. Pose the question from the   
standpoint that you are only the knowledge "I Am."   
Q. You put the question because you don't know.   
M. Yes, but the primary ignorance is about our "I Amness." We have   
taken it as the Ultimate, that is ignorance. We presume that this  
consciousness   
is the eternal, the Ultimate, that is the mistake. This "I Am"   
principle is there provided the waking state and deep sleep are there. I am   
not the waking state, I am not the deep sleep - therefore I, the Absolute,   
am not that "I Am." Leave aside this triad; what are you?   
Q. It comes again to the question "Who am I?"   
M. Understand clearly. When you keep aside the very instrument of   
questioning, where is the question?   
Q: If you don't question...   
M. Which you? You have removed that "you."Q. I don't know. How can you answer?   
M. What questions can you have without this triad? Let us presume that   
you are fifty years old. You have had the association of that triad for f ifty   
years; go behind now, five years earlier what was your experience? What   
were you like?   
Q. I don't know.   
M. That is correct. It was a no-knowing state. In that no-knowing   
state, suddenly knowingness has appeared. It has created all this   
mischief. Since when are you and how long will you continue to be?   
Q. Well, I would say, since I have been experiencing and for as long as I am   
experiencing.   
M. Right. Now, without the experience of "I Amness," talk something   
about that.   
Q. I can't.   
M. The association with this triad state, this bundle of mischief, due to   
what?   
For example, a building is on fire, it is said because of a short circuit in   
the electricity: The arrival of this triad, due to what short circuiting?  
There   
was some friction.   
When you press here on the cigarette lighter the flame is there;   
because of the friction or short circuiting, all the three states are aflame.   
Q. And the flame is?   
M: "I Am."   
Q. I have been born into this.   
M. Because of that triad you are experiencing life and doing spirituality   
also.   
Q. At the end there is no question at all, no who am I or what am I if I put  
aside this   
triad there can only be silence.   
M. Silence or peace is related to chaos or turbulence.

**Q. It has nothing to do with peace and turbulence. I mean, ifyou just sit  
quiet in   
your Self, leaving aside these three states, knowing that I don't know myself,  
you can   
only be silent.   
M. What you say is impossible. The knowingness will be there provided   
waking state and deep sleep are there. If they were not available you   
would not have been here in this form.   
If you had the capacity to know before birth that you were being   
born, you would not have cared to jump into this pit of birth.   
This universal consciousness is known as God, which is the   
Almighty, the Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent, all the   
attributes. These attributes are given to God in consciousness, not to the   
Absolute. The Absolute is without attributes.   
Maharaja The trouble is, everybody wants to have the knowledge of the Self   
without giving up the identification with the body, they are contradictory.   
Give up this identification and everything becomes simple. I am   
there before anything can happen. If anyone is asked whether he knows   
when the sky came into existence, he will say he does not know. He does not   
know because he considers his presence only as a phenomenon when the   
body was there.   
That the sky was not there I know, and who is this? It is the One who is   
prior to everything. My true nature is not circumscribed by the concept of   
time and space.   
Maharaja Can any Qf your concepts grasp the total, the Ultimate? Have you   
understood that knowledge itself is ignorance? If it were real it would have   
been there eternally - it would not have had a beginning and an end.   
Now the experience "I Am" is felt, earlier that experience was not.   
When it was not, no proof was called for, but once it is, lots of proof is  
required.   
How did you wake up in the morning? Why did you wake up at all? It   
is not the mind which knows - somebody knows because of the mind. Now   
my hand has lifted, who knows? The one who has lifted my hand knows it   
has lifted it. You are before the mind; because you are there the mind is   
working.   
When will you wake up? Provided you are, you wake up.   
Through the concepts of others you have built up so many things   
around you that you are lost. "You" is decorated and embellished by the   
concepts of others. Prior to receiving any hearsays from outside, has   
anyone any information about himself?   
The purpose of Sat-Guru is to tell you what you are like prior to the   
building up of all those concepts of others. Your present spiritual storehouse   
is filled up with'the words of others - demolish those concepts.   
Sat- Guru means the eternal state which will never be changed: what you   
are. You are that immutable, eternal, unchangeable Absolute. Sat- Guru   
tells you to get rid of all these walls built around you by the hearsays and   
concepts of others.   
You have no form, no design. The names and forms you see are your   
consciousness only - the Self is colorless but it is able to judge colors,  
etc.   
Maharaj: Sitting in meditation helps the consciousness to blossom. It   
causes deeper understanding and spontaneous change in behavior.   
These changes are brought about in the consciousness itself, not in the   
pseudo-personality. Forced changes are at the level of the mind. Mental   
and intellectual changes are totally unnatural and different from the   
ones that take place in the birth principle. These take place naturally,   
automatically, by themselves, due to meditation.   
Most of the people see the tree of knowledge and admire it, but what is   
to be understood is its source - the seed, the latent force from which it   
sprouts. Many people talk about it but only intellectually; I talk about it   
from direct knowledge.   
A small speck of consciousness, which is like a seed, has all the   
worlds contained in it. The physical frame is necessary for it to manifest   
itself.**

**Q Guru 's grace is always there.   
M: Guru is not an individual. You are thinking in terms of a form. The   
consciousness is all pervading. You find out what is this "you" that is   
seeking grace. In that body the "I Am" is ticking - that is the Guru. You   
worship that "I Am" principle and surrender to that Guru and that Guru   
will give you all the grace.   
In consciousness there can exist nothing without its interrelated   
counterpart. The moment you say knowledge, knowledge can only be in   
ignorance, so this knowledge one has about Guru is also ignorance.   
When will the knowledge be Guru? When that knowledge and the   
ignorance both disappear into vynana. Jnana is knowledge, ajnana is   
ignorance, both disappear into vynana.   
Q: I am caught in that process of watching the body-mind.   
M: Dream occurs in objective, material, manifestation, in the   
consciousness. It is not you, it is something other-objective, material.   
What you call "I Am" and birth, you are not that, it is material. Suppose   
that there is a Muslim boy that I have adopted; I have not sired that boy, but   
I now claim him as "my" boy. Like that, this "I Amness" is not directly me, it   
is something other, something material, something Muslim, I am not that.   
I, the Absolute, have nothing to do with that.   
People are sometimes confused because they expect an answer which is   
based on their concepts. You ask someone to bring you a spoon, and   
instead he brings you a needle. Both are words, both are knowledge, but   
that is not what you want. What you will receive is the true knowledge,   
even if what you are asking for is not the true knowledge.   
Q: I must reach that level to be able to understand.   
M. There are millions of grains, made into millions of forms, but the   
seed is only one. All these millions of forms are because of some particular   
seed, but I am not that seed.   
The Ultimate knowledge does not have any knowledge. This   
knowledge "I Am" has appeared spontaneously, as a result of the body.   
See it as it is, understand it as it is.   
When the waking state is gone, sleep begins, when sleep is gone, the   
waking state begins. When both are gone, I am at home. Why did they   
leave me? Because it was all foreign, it was not me.   
Take this advice: better not to be trapped in the spiritual knowledge   
business; have a nice time, a good life, be of service to others, and in due   
course, when the time is ripe, you will die.   
Q: Without your advice, millions of people area tready following your advice.   
Maharaj: The knowledge that I am expounding will dissolve your identity   
as a personality and will transform you into manifest knowledge. The   
manifest knowledge, the consciousness, is free and unconditioned.   
It is not possible to either catch hold of or give up that knowledge   
because you are that knowledge, subtler than space.   
This knowledge that you are the manifest must be opened through   
meditation; you do not get it by listening to words.   
Is not this consciousness prior to any other experience and is there   
not something on which this consciousness has come about? That waking   
state, deep sleep and the sense of presence, who has these experiences   
other than That which was prior to these experiences?   
That which is talking to you is that state which is time-bound, which   
has come temporarily upon my original state. Therefore you and I can   
have no sense of fear; it is only this changing state which has identified   
with the body which has fear.   
The fear of death is the fine for accepting the identity of the body as a   
separate entity in the total functioning. It is only birth which fears death.   
Presence and absence are interrelated dualities, this was understood   
only after the sense of presence arose, earlier there was no sense of either   
absence or presence.   
Questioner: What if we understand only intellectually and we have not yet  
realized?   
M: The big advantage of even intellectually understanding is that you   
will not be bound by fear of death. Birth did not give you anything and   
death can take nothing from you.   
According to the world I have this terrible disease; I keep on talking   
exactly as I talked earlier, it has no effect on me. Only that which has   
taken birth will disappear, how am I affected?   
You are fortunate to hear what I say. Listen, but do not make any   
effort to understand it, because only your intellect can try to understand   
and intellect does not reach That. What you have heard will have its   
own results; do not interfere.

**Maharaja There is no duality between the Guru and the Bhakta. In That   
which Is there is no duality, has never been any duality. The word   
Bhakta means devotion, but in actuality it indicates togetherness, one   
only, unity.   
Questioner: The flame of devotion lights my way.   
M. Who speaks about that flame? When we talk we don't talk about a   
person, but about that dynamic, manifest flame "I Am."   
Q. That is not extinguishable.   
M. Who says that?   
Q: I believe that.   
M. Because it is your belief, is it right?   
Q: I have no proof.   
M. You are running. Who talks about the proof? With your faith,   
whatever you are worshipping and devoted to, that you will get.   
The trouble about your spirituality is that you are listening only to   
that knowledge about Iswara which is useful to an entity, you are collecting   
only that knowledge. As a man, an entity, this is a temporary phase   
of your emotions, or sentiments. No person will be able to conserve his   
personality or his identity forever. That guiding principle is not a person.   
Nowadays I don't expound any theme of spirituality. I don't even   
talk, but still, why the attraction which brings you here? With this I   
develop my encumbrances. I have nothing to gain in this bargain except   
these encumbrances.   
Do you'know the ingredients of that personality? Unless you get to know   
that fully, you will not go beyond.   
Q: What about my desires, my needs?   
M. You are in need of your Self.   
Q: Is there any involvement between my desires and the raw material?   
M. Plenty of involvement. Out of the interaction and play of the five   
elements this food body is available, in that the fragrance and taste is the   
knowledge "I Am." Now you find out what is the indication that you are in   
this food body.   
Q. Would fasting help me to find my Self?   
M: Not at all. That "I Artiness" is the very expression of the food. Suppose   
you want to find sweetness, sweetness is the quality of sugar, if you reject   
sugar where is the sweetness?   
Q. Then I always have to go outside myself to food, to get this taste?   
M: Can you get the food from inside? The supply comes from outside.   
Q. I have always been led to believe that this sense of presence did not  
depend on   
body, that is the essence of spirituality, and now you tell me the opposite!   
M. Therefore understand this mystery itself. Where does the world exist?   
It exists in this speck of consciousness, and this consciousness can   
exist only if there is food.   
Whatever life you are living, you are only entertaining a concept.   
Find out is there such a thing as an individual. Think over it.   
If theentertainment of the experience is easy, if it pleases you, you   
call it happiness, if not you call it unhappiness.   
The feeling that you are - the sense of presence - what has caused it to   
come about? Think on it.   
Q: Everything is happening because I am.   
M. Will you be able to retain this understanding always?   
Q: Just for a moment and then the identification comes back.   
M. It's a long way to get the understanding stabilized that everything is   
happening because I Am. Now, for how many days will you be in India?   
Q. I have only a few more days here.   
M: It is not important where you are, once you are established in the "I   
Am." It is like space - it neither comes nor goes; just as when you   
demolish the walls of a building only space remains.

**Maharaj: That which you like most - that itself is "I Am," the conscious   
presence - but that is not going to last forever.   
When this flame is extinguished, what is the profit or loss to the f   
lame? What does the flame represent?   
Questioner: The knowledge, the consciousness.   
M. What is going to happen to that consciousness? Only in order to   
realize it, to understand it, do we have all this spirituality. When the   
f lame is extinguished it needs do nothing about itself. Similarly,  
understand,   
when the body drops off and the consciousness is extinguished.   
you need do nothing. With this understanding, do what you like in the   
world.   
Presently you are tied down to the bondage of the body, and that is   
conceptual. The very thought of any advantage or disadvantage is   
dissolved when one realizes this knowledge.   
For the sake of that principle you are involving yourself in many   
activities. When that very principle is dissolved into nothingness, what are   
you going to do?   
Don't try to pick and choose, and say "this I must do and that I must   
not do." Don't impose such conditions on yourself.   
An ant crawls on your body and stings you; by that bite or sting you   
know the ant is there. Just so, the feeling of this conscious presence "I   
Am" is due to the material body.   
Having understood this, where is the person who should hold on to the   
worldly life or should give it up? The question does not arise.   
If you are fully charged with this knowledge, in spite of the worldly   
difficulties no difficulties will touch you.   
This cryptic blunt talk will not be available elsewhere. At other   
places you will be given certain concepts arising out of consciousness and   
out of those concepts more concepts are developed, and you are mis-   
led. Any type of concept in the realm of consciousness is unreal. Will the   
world listen to such talks?   
What are you? Are you that birth principle, that body, which is born of   
the secretion of the parents?   
The one who gets this knowledge is free from worldly or family  
problems.Maharaj: The material of which the body is constituted is getting  
weary   
and weak, and along with it, this knowledge is also getting weak. The   
sense of presence is still with me because that material of which the body is   
made still has a little strength. When that little strength goes away, then   
the consciousness will also disappear, then there will be no sense of   
presence - but I shall very much be, without the sense of presence.   
Each of you is trying to protect yourself. What is it that you are trying   
to protect? However much you may protect, how long will it last? Go, to the   
root and find out what it is that you are trying to protect and preserve,   
and how long it will remain.   
The only'spiritual way of understanding your true nature is to find out   
the source of this concept "I Am." Before the sense of presence arrived I was   
in that state in which the concept of time was never there. So, what is born?   
It is the concept of time and that event which is birth, living, and death   
together constitute nothing but time, duration.   
Once you understand this, everything will be clear; until you   
understand it, nothing will be clear. Is this not simple and easy?   
Questioner: Words are simple, but apprehending what those words mean will be   
difficult.   
M: What is it in the absence of which you would not be able to   
understand even the words? Go to the root of that source.   
In apprehending what I have told you this morning, the intellect is   
totally impotent. There must be an intuitive apprehension of it.   
Maharaja People don't really understand what I say. They partially   
understand and form their own concepts, but the real Self knowledge is   
not there.   
Suppose there is a seed which is going to produce a great tree. If you cut   
that seed you must be able to see the tree in the seed.   
The tree which I got is that seed which is called the seed of birth,   
when I broke it open I got the Self knowledge. Other than Self knowledge,   
what other capital do I have?   
I have met so many so-called jnanis, but the real one, who has seen the   
tree in the seed, I have not seen so far.   
In the advanced stages what happens to the intellect? To the   
disappearance of the intellect at old age, there is a witness. How can you   
describe that witness?   
Questioner: Thoughts and emotions are always arising and distracting me. What   
shall I do?   
M. You are before any thought can arise. All thoughts, etc., which arise   
are merely movements in consciousness.   
Once consciousness arises, everything arises - the world and all the   
transactions in the world. Merely witness them. It takes place, there is no   
individual to. witness. Witnessing takes place of the total functioning of the   
universal consciousness.   
Because I totally negate the individual, this will appeal only to one in a   
million.   
Q: There are so many people who are thoroughly dissatisfied, always searching  
for   
something and never satisfied. Why is that?   
M. You will never be satisfied until you find out that you are what you   
are seeking. If you want knowledge as an individual, you will not get it   
here. If you are satisfied with this knowledge, you may come and sit still. If   
you cannot accept this negating of yourself, you may leave. I will   
understand, it will not affect me.   
That which has never happened at all, that is the child of a barren   
woman - what fear can you have for that? It is imagined, unreal. Out of   
that hallucination, if somebody wants something, is it not seeking the real   
in the totally unreal?   
Q. If it were real then we could do something about it.   
M.â¢ Correct. You see something, that is true, but what you see is an   
illusion, like a dream. What we see in a dream seems very real, but we   
know that it is unreal.   
In spite of understanding all this, still it is difficult to give up this   
form identity of a male or a female.   
Without the form, the knowledge cannot be given. For the Absolute to   
manifest Itself, the matter must be there. The Absolute unmanifested and   
the manifested are not two - it is merely the expression of It, like the   
shadow and the substance.   
This love of being is not of an individual being, it is the nature of the   
entire universal consciousness.**

**_Questioner: The Indian tradition tells us that the Guru is indispensable.  
What is he indispensable   
for? A mother is indispensable for giving the child a body. But the soul she  
does not give. Her role is   
limited. How is it with the Guru? Is his role also limited, and if so, to  
what? Or is he indispensable   
generally, even absolutely?   
Maharaj: The innermost light, shining peacefully and timelessly in the heart,  
is the real Guru. All   
others merely show the way.   
Q: I am not concerned with the inner Guru. only with the one that shows the  
way. There are   
people who believe that without a Guru Yoga is inaccessible. They are ever in  
search of the right   
Guru, changing one for another. Of what value are such Gurus?   
M: They are temporary, time-bound Gurus. You find them in every walk of life.  
You need them for   
acquiring any knowledge or skill.   
Q: A mother is only for a lifetime, she begins at birth and ends at death. She  
is not for ever.   
M:. Similarly, the time-bound Guru is not for ever. He fulfils his purpose and  
yields his place to the   
next. It is quite natural and there is no blame attached to it.   
Q: For every kind of knowledge, or skill, do I need a separate Guru?   
M: There can be no rule in these matters, except one 'the outer is transient,  
the innermost --   
permanent and changeless', though ever new in appearance and action.   
Q: What is the relation between the inner and the outer Gurus?   
M: The outer represent the inner, the inner accepts the outer -- for a time.   
Q: Whose is the effort?   
M: The disciple's, of course. The outer Guru gives the instructions, the inner  
sends the strength;   
the alert application is the disciple's. Without will, intelligence and energy  
on the part of the disciple   
the outer Guru is helpless. The inner Guru bids his chance. Obtuseness and  
wrong pursuits bring   
about a crisis and the disciple wakes up to his own plight. Wise is he who  
does not wait for a shock,   
which can be quite rude.   
Q: Is it a threat?   
M: Not a threat, a warning. The inner Guru is not committed to non-violence.  
He can be quite   
violent at times, to the point of destroying the obtuse or perverted  
personality. Suffering and death,   
as life and happiness, are his tools of work. It is only in duality that non-  
violence becomes the   
unifying law.   
Q: Has one to be afraid of his own self?   
M: Not afraid, for the self means well.. But it must be taken seriously. It  
calls for attention and   
obedience; when it is not listened to, it turns from persuasion to compulsion,  
for while it can wait, it   
shall not be denied. The difficulty lies not with the Guru, inner or outer.  
The Guru is always   
available. It is the ripe disciple that is lacking. When a person is not  
ready, what can be done?   
Q: Ready or willing?   
M: Both. It comes to the same. In India we call it adhikari. It means both  
capable and entitled.   
Q: Can the outer Guru grant initiation (diksha)?   
M: He can give all kinds of initiations, but the initiation into Reality must  
come from within.   
Q: Who gives the ultimate initiation?   
M: It is self-given.   
Q: I feel we are running in circles. After all, I know one self only, the  
present, empirical self. The   
inner or higher self is but an idea conceived to explain and encourage. We  
talk of it as having   
independent existence. It hasn't.   
M: The outer self and the inner both are imagined. The obsession of being an  
'I' needs another   
obsession with a 'super-l' to get cured, as one needs another thorn to remove  
a thorn, or another   
poison to neutralise a poison. All assertion calls for a denial, but this is  
the first step only. The next   
is to go beyond both.   
Q: I do understand that the outer Guru is needed to call my attention to  
myself and to the urgent need of doing something about myself   
. I also understand how helpless he is when it comes to any   
deep change in me. But here you bring in the sadguru, the inner Guru,  
beginningless, changeless,   
the root of being, the standing promise, the certain goal. Is he a concept or  
a reality?   
M: He is the only reality. All else is shadow, cast by the body mind (deha-  
buddhi) on the face of   
time. Of course, even a shadow is related to reality, but by itself it is not  
real.   
Q: I am the only reality I know. The sadguru is there as long as I think of  
him. What do I gain by   
shifting reality to him?   
M: Your loss is your gain. When the shadow is seen to be a shadow only, you  
stop following it. You   
turn round and discover the sun which was there all the time -- behind your  
back!_**

"My Heart wants you awake. I see you suffer in your dream and I know that you  
must wake up to end your woes. When you see your dream as dream, you wake up.  
But in your dream itself I am not interested. Enough for me to know that you  
must wake up. You need not bring your dream to a definite conclusion, or make  
it noble, or happy, or beautiful; all you need is to realise that you are  
dreaming. Stop imagining, stop believing. See the contradictions, the  
incongruities, the falsehood and the sorrow of the human state, the need to go  
beyond. Within the immensity of space floats a tiny atom of Consciousness,  
and in it the entire Universe is contained.?

**_I 've said before that every craftsman   
searches for what's not there   
to practice his craft.   
A builder looks for the rotten hole   
where the roof caved in. A water-carrier   
picks the empty pot. A carpenter   
stops at the house with no door.   
Workers rush toward some hint   
of emptiness, which they then   
start to fill. Their hope, though,   
is for emptiness, so don't think   
you must avoid it. It contains   
what you need!   
Dear soul, if you were not friends   
with the vast nothing inside,   
why would you always be casting you net   
into it, and waiting so patiently?   
This invisible ocean has given you such abundance,   
but still you call it "death",   
that which provides you sustenance and work.   
God has allowed some magical reversal to occur,   
so that you see the scorpion pit   
as an object of desire,   
and all the beautiful expanse around it,   
as dangerous and swarming with snakes.   
This is how strange your fear of death   
and emptiness is, and how perverse   
the attachment to what you want.   
Now that you've heard me   
on your misapprehensions, dear friend,   
listen to Attar's story on the same subject.   
He strung the pearls of this   
about King Mahmud, how among the spoils   
of his Indian campaign there was a Hindu boy,   
whom he adopted as a son. He educated   
and provided royally for the boy   
and later made him vice-regent, seated   
on a gold throne beside himself.   
One day he found the young man weeping..   
"Why are you crying? You're the companion   
of an emperor! The entire nation is ranged out   
before you like stars that you can command!"   
The young man replied, "I am remembering   
my mother and father, and how they   
scared me as a child with threats of you!   
'Uh-oh, he's headed for King Mahmud's court!   
Nothing could be more hellish!' Where are they now   
when they should see me sitting here?"   
This incident is about your fear of changing.   
You are the Hindu boy. Mahmud, which means   
Praise to the End, is the spirit's   
poverty or emptiness.   
The mother and father are your attachment   
to beliefs and blood ties   
and desires and comforting habits.   
Don't listen to them!   
They seem to protect   
but they imprison.   
They are your worst enemies.   
They make you afraid   
of living in emptiness.   
Some day you'll weep tears of delight in that court,   
remembering your mistaken parents!   
Know that your body nurtures the spirit,   
helps it grow, and gives it wrong advise.   
The body becomes, eventually, like a vest   
of chain mail in peaceful years,   
too hot in summer and too cold in winter.   
But the body's desires, in another way, are like   
an unpredictable associate, whom you must be   
patient with. And that companion is helpful,   
because patience expands your capacity   
to love and feel peace.   
The patience of a rose close to a thorn   
keeps it fragrant. It's patience that gives milk   
to the male camel still nursing in its third year,   
and patience is what the prophets show to us.   
The beauty of careful sewing on a shirt   
is the patience it contains.   
Friendship and loyalty have patience   
as the strength of their connection.   
Feeling lonely and ignoble indicates   
that you haven't been patient.   
Be with those who mix with God   
as honey blends with milk, and say,   
"Anything that comes and goes,   
rises and sets, is not   
what I love." else you'll be like a caravan fire left   
to flare itself out alone beside the road.   
Rumi VI (1369-1420) from 'Rumi : One-Handed Basket Weaving_**

**_O heart, what a wonderful bird you are.   
Seeking divine heights,   
Flapping your wings,   
you smashed the pointed spears of your enemy.   
The flowers flee from Autumn, but not you -   
You are the fearless rose   
that grows amidst the freezing wind.

**_The breeze of Spring has turned the buds into blossoms ;   
The clouds have passed by   
Having sprinkled the earth with raindrops ;   
The roses are caressed by the light of the moon.   
A youthful woman, full of enchanting grace and joy   
Meets me in the solitude   
And approaches smiling, looking at me.   
But the magic of beauty and youth   
Make no impression on the Yogi   
Who has burn up pleasure-desires in one great thought.   
How could she hold a candle to the sun ?   
She withdrew covered with shame.   
I am the life of all youth ;   
I am the beauty of the sun and moon.   
Thousands had come to worship and to serve,   
The King was waving the fan over my head,   
The Ministers lovingly washed my feet?   
Many adorers were there.   
?You are the greatest incarnation,   
? they cried ; I laughed at their adoration ;   
? Not only great but small too am I,   
I am all?do not limit me.?   
They assail me with their pleasantries,   
They hurl veiled invectives,   
They throw stones at me.   
My face bleeds, my head is wounded,   
But still a smile plays on my lips ;   
For I am the life of this play,   
I support this game as well.   
Mid-night in January ; darkness everywhere ;   
The Himalayan snows cover the land.   
A fresh storm breaks?it ceases   
And the strong, cold biting wind blows.   
My body shakes like a willow,   
But there is strength in my heart and laughter in my eyes,   
For I am the life of the cold,   
I am the energy of the elements.   
A lovely forest, full of wonders !   
In search of food I gaze around me, and lo !   
My eyes fall on a wandering lion ;   
I look at him steadily?he turns quietly away.   
Divinity expresses Itself through the eye.   
I am the energy of lions,   
I am the life in all.   
The boat is caught in a storm ;   
The wind races with tremendous speed ;   
Breakers crash to right and left,   
and lightening strikes here and there.   
I stand smiling, holding the mast like a flute,   
courage ruling my heart,   
I am the life of the storm ;   
I am the foundation of the elements.   
Dysentery and fever shake the body,   
But like a rare wine the spiritual experience revives me.   
I sing, defying illness,   
The body is a line on water,   
If it dies I am not affected,   
Because I am the water.   
I am the forms and figures of the world,   
I am Rama, the life of all.   
Swami Rama Tirtha_**

**_Force of Friendship   
Remember the mouse on the riverbank?   
There's a love-string stretching into the water   
hoping for the frog.   
Suddenly a raven grips the mouse and flies off.   
The frog too, from the river bottom,   
with one foot entangled in the invisible string,   
follows, suspended in the air.   
Amazed faces ask,   
"When did a raven ever go underwater and catch a frog?"   
The frog answers, "This is the force of Friendship."   
What draws friends together does not conform to Laws of Nature.   
Form doesn't know about spiritual closeness.   
If a grain of barley approaches a grain of wheat,   
an ant must be carrying it. A black ant on black felt.   
You can't see it, but if grains go toward each other,   
it's there.   
A hand shifts our birdcages around.   
Some are brought closer. Some move apart.   
Do not try to reason it out. Be conscious   
of who draws you and who not.   
Gabriel was always there with Jesus, lifting him   
above the dark-blue vault, the night-fortress world,   
just as the raven of longing carries the flying frog.   
Rumi

**_The Waterwheel   
Stay together, friends.   
Don't scatter and sleep.   
Our friendship is made   
of being awake.   
The waterwheel accepts water   
and turns and gives it away,   
weeping.   
That way it stays in the garden,   
whereas another roundness rolls   
through a dry riverbed looking   
for what it thinks it wants.   
Stay here, quivering with each moment   
like a drop of mercury.

**_If anyone was 'anonymous' in the truest sense of the word, it was Maurice  
Frydman.   
Five foot nothing, Maurice moved with some of the great Indian figures of his  
time   
 including Gandhi, Nehru, and Jai Krishnamurti.   
Sometimes, truly great people, who have shaped and helped to transform the  
lives of countless beings,   
remain unknown and unheralded until long after their passing.   
Maurice Frydman was one of those rare beings in whom the spirit of compassion  
flowed spontaneously   
without any attachment to 'doer-ship' or 'outcome.' Although he was a  
philanthropist in every sense of the word,   
it was of a very different kind from what we usually see. Yet it is because he  
was so unassuming   
and genuinely 'ego-less' that his activities were and continue to be so  
powerful in their effects.   
Great compassion flows spontaneously and reaches far, wide and deep.   
It has no boundaries and is by nature non-sectarian._**  
_He was a remarkable man, humble, devout, compassionate to the core of his  
being   
and generous to a fault.   
Maurice Frydman died in Bombay on March 9th of 1976 with Sri Nisargadatta  
Maharaj by his side.   
A beautiful event ended this incredible life.   
During his last days, Frydman got a visit by a professional nurse he did not  
know.   
The nurse had been visited in a dream by an old man in a loin cloth who told  
her to go and take care of Frydman.   
Frydman refused to accept the nurse's offer. But, as she was leaving the house  
she walked past a picture in the hallway   
and recognised the old man whom she had seen in her dream.   
Upon telling Frydman this, he accepted her offer and allowed her to take care  
of him.   
The picture: was Sri Ramana Maharshi who had left his body over three decades  
prior.

**_My association with my Guru was scarcely for two and a half years. He was  
staying some 200 kilometers [120 miles] away, and he would come here once  
every four months, for fifteen days. This [realization] is the fruit of that.  
The words he gave me touched me very deeply. I abided in one thing only: the  
words of my Guru are the truth, and he said, "You are the Parabrahman  
[Absolute Reality]." No more doubts and no more questions on that. Once my  
Guru conveyed to me what he had to say I never bothered about other things- I  
hung on to the words of the Guru.   
(Prior to Consciousness, pp. 1-2, April 4, 1980)   
My Guru told me: "...Go back to that state of pure being, where the 'I am' is  
still in its purity before it got contaminated with 'I am this' or 'I am  
that.' Your burden is of false self-identifications-abandon them all."   
My guru told me, "Trust me, I tell you: you are Divine. Take it as the  
absolute truth. Your joy is divine, your suffering is divine too. All comes  
from God. Remember it always. You are God, your will alone is done." I did  
believe him and soon realized how wonderfully true and accurate were his  
words. I did not condition my mind by thinking, "I am God, I am wonderful, I  
am beyond." I simply followed his instruction, which was to focus the mind on  
pure being, 'I am,' and stay in it. I used to sit for hours together, with  
nothing but the 'I am' in my mind and soon the peace and joy and deep all-  
embracing love became my normal state. In it all disappeared-myself, my guru,  
the life I lived, the world around me. Only peace remained, and unfathomable  
silence.   
(I Am That, Dialogue 51, April 16, 1971)   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj_**

**_If anyone was 'anonymous' in the truest sense of the word, it was Maurice  
Frydman.   
Five foot nothing, Maurice moved with some of the great Indian figures of his  
time   
 including Gandhi, Nehru, and Jai Krishnamurti.   
Sometimes, truly great people, who have shaped and helped to transform the  
lives of countless beings,   
remain unknown and unheralded until long after their passing.   
Maurice Frydman was one of those rare beings in whom the spirit of compassion  
flowed spontaneously   
without any attachment to 'doer-ship' or 'outcome.' Although he was a  
philanthropist in every sense of the word,   
it was of a very different kind from what we usually see. Yet it is because he  
was so unassuming   
and genuinely 'ego-less' that his activities were and continue to be so  
powerful in their effects.   
Great compassion flows spontaneously and reaches far, wide and deep.   
It has no boundaries and is by nature non-sectarian._**  
_He was a remarkable man, humble, devout, compassionate to the core of his  
being   
and generous to a fault.   
Maurice Frydman died in Bombay on March 9th of 1976 with Sri Nisargadatta  
Maharaj by his side.   
A beautiful event ended this incredible life.   
During his last days, Frydman got a visit by a professional nurse he did not  
know.   
The nurse had been visited in a dream by an old man in a loin cloth who told  
her to go and take care of Frydman.   
Frydman refused to accept the nurse's offer. But, as she was leaving the house  
she walked past a picture in the hallway   
and recognised the old man whom she had seen in her dream.   
Upon telling Frydman this, he accepted her offer and allowed her to take care  
of him.   
The picture: was Sri Ramana Maharshi who had left his body over three decades  
prior.

**_My association with my Guru was scarcely for two and a half years. He was  
staying some 200 kilometers [120 miles] away, and he would come here once  
every four months, for fifteen days. This [realization] is the fruit of that.  
The words he gave me touched me very deeply. I abided in one thing only: the  
words of my Guru are the truth, and he said, "You are the Parabrahman  
[Absolute Reality]." No more doubts and no more questions on that. Once my  
Guru conveyed to me what he had to say I never bothered about other things- I  
hung on to the words of the Guru.   
(Prior to Consciousness, pp. 1-2, April 4, 1980)   
My Guru told me: "...Go back to that state of pure being, where the 'I am' is  
still in its purity before it got contaminated with 'I am this' or 'I am  
that.' Your burden is of false self-identifications-abandon them all."   
My guru told me, "Trust me, I tell you: you are Divine. Take it as the  
absolute truth. Your joy is divine, your suffering is divine too. All comes  
from God. Remember it always. You are God, your will alone is done." I did  
believe him and soon realized how wonderfully true and accurate were his  
words. I did not condition my mind by thinking, "I am God, I am wonderful, I  
am beyond." I simply followed his instruction, which was to focus the mind on  
pure being, 'I am,' and stay in it. I used to sit for hours together, with  
nothing but the 'I am' in my mind and soon the peace and joy and deep all-  
embracing love became my normal state. In it all disappeared-myself, my guru,  
the life I lived, the world around me. Only peace remained, and unfathomable  
silence.   
(I Am That, Dialogue 51, April 16, 1971)   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj_**

**_One has to work in the world; naturally, carry on your worldly affairs,   
but understand that which has come about by itself - that is, this body, mind  
and consciousness   
 \- has appeared in spite of the fact that nobody has asked for it.   
I did not ask for it; it has come upon my original state   
which is timeless, spaceless and without attributes.   
So that whatever has happened is doing this business in the world.   
The life force and the mind are operating, but the mind will tempt you to  
believe that it is 'you'.   
Even if the mind tells you that you are the one who is acting, do not believe  
the mind.

**_O Longing Mind   
O longing mind,   
consecrate your being to pure love.   
Turn every thought to Goddess Tara.   
She will bear you tenderly across the raging sea   
of separation and individuality.   
Be utterly dedicated to her reality.   
Cry aloud Ma Kali, Ma Kali.   
Know that she can clarify   
the inconceivable maze of relativity.   
To hope for assistance and guidance through this world   
from wealth, relatives, and religious rites   
provides no profound solution.   
Have you forgotten that everyone is lost?   
Where are you now? Why are you traveling?   
This cosmos is the strange theater where souls act,   
wearing various costumes and disguises.   
This intricate play of transparent energy   
is initiated, sustained, and dissolved by Kali,   
who is the dream power of Absolute Reality.   
At this very moment, you are resting   
on the vast lap of Mother?s cosmic dream   
that you misperceive   
as the narrow prison of suffering.   
Why abandon the kingdom of awareness   
to obsession with self and disdain for others,   
to hollow passion and abject clinging?   
You are creating a disease without a remedy.   
The brief day of your earthly life is almost over.   
Meditate now on beautiful Black Tara.   
She is seated upon the jewel island of essence   
in the transparent sea of ultimacy.   
This poet sings drunkenly: ?Tara! Tara! Tara!   
Your name is ambrosia.   
May all beings enter the secret sanctuary   
through this name,   
tasting your unique sweetness,   
self-luminous awareness.?

**_Does Suffering Scare Me?   
Does suffering scare me? O Mother,   
Let me suffer in this world. Do I require more?   
Suffering runs ahead of me and runs after me.

In the bazaar to peddle it.

I carry it wherever I go.

**_He whom the sages have been seeking in all these places is in our own  
hearts;   
the voice that you heard was right, but the direction you gave to the voice  
was wrong.   
That ideal of freedom that you perceived was correct, but you projected it  
outside yourself,   
 and that was your mistake.   
Bring it nearer and nearer, until you find that it was all the time within  
you,   
it was the Self of your own self.   
That freedom was your own nature, and this Maya never bound you.   
Nature never has power over you.   
Like a frightened child you were dreaming that it was throttling you, and the  
release from this fear is the goal: not only to see it intellectually, but to perceive it, actualise it, much more  
definitely than we perceive this world.   
Then we shall know that we are free.   
Then, and then alone, will all difficulties vanish, then will all the  
perplexities of heart be smoothed away,   
all crookedness made straight, then will vanish the delusion of manifoldness  
and nature;   
and Maya instead of being a horrible, hopeless dream, as it is now will become  
beautiful,   
and this earth, instead of being a prison-house, will become our playground,   
and even dangers and difficulties, even all sufferings, will become deified  
and show us their real nature,   
will show us that behind everything, as the substance of everything,   
He is standing, and that He is the one real Self.

**_The breeze is making for righteousness.   
The seas are showering blessings on us-   
Our Father in Heaven is blissful,   
The trees in the forest are blissful, so are the cattle.   
The very dust of the earth is luminous with bliss-   
It is all bliss,   
-all bliss-all bliss.

**_THE BELIEVER IN THE IMPERSONAL   
Dr. H., of the small group of Americans, who spent a   
few weeks in the Ashram in February 1936, asked Sri   
Maharshi if there exists such a thing as a Personal God.   
Bhagavan. Yes, Ishvara.   
Dr. H. (with astonishment) What? with eyes, nose, ears, etc.?   
Bh. Yes, if you have them why should not God also have   
them?   
C. When I read in the Kabbala and the Puranas that God has   
these organs, I laugh.   
Bh. Why don?t you laugh at yourself for having them?   
THE PHILOSOPHER   
April, 1943. A young man in his teens, with blushing   
cheeks and a very soft, timorous voice asked:?   
Youth. Swami, can I see God in this life?. .....   
Bhagavan. (gently smiling) First tell me who is the ?I? in   
your question; who, what, and where God is, and what   
do you mean by "life"?   
The youth dropped his eyes and remained silent.   
An elderly man from the back rushed forward, produced   
a pencil, wrote a question on a piece of paper and handed it   
to the Maharshi. Bhagavan read it and smiled broadly. It was   
a question on Time and Space.   
Bhagavan. May I know who is putting this question ? Space,   
yourself, or Time?   
Visitor. Of course I.   
Bh. Do you know that I?   
V. (after a little hesitation) Leave the I-question to the   
philosophers and answer my question.   
Voice. What? Is Time or Space dearer to you than your   
own self?   
Bh. (seeing the visitor nonplussed) All these questions are   
superfluous. One thing you must bear in mind is that   
no question can be solved without Self-knowledge. On   
the realisation of the Self everything becomes clear and   
all problems are solved.   
 THE PEDANT   
On a summer morning a middle-aged Tamilian entered   
and sat for about half an hour. His restlessness and rolling   
eyes suggested that he had something weighty on his mind.   
At last he spoke with an assumed humility, particularly as he   
chose to speak in English.   
Visitor. Swami, we ignorant people read so much, hoping to   
have an inkling of Truth, but, alas, the more we read the   
more Truth recedes from our ken. I have read all the Western   
philosophers from Descartes to Bertrand Russell ? they are   
all useless. But our Rishis differ among themselves. Shankara   
says, "Go on repeating ?I am Brahman? and you become   
Brahman." Madhvacharya says that the Soul is ever separated   
from Brahman. You say "Enquire 'who am I' and you will   
arrive." Many other teachers gave many other solutions. Is   
this not puzzling? Which of you is right?   
V. (Having waited in vain for about five minutes, he   
resumed with a mildly raised tone) Swami, which way   
am I to go?   
Bh. (with a gentle wave of the hand) Go the way you came.

**_A book is being read in which a question occurs whether   
the world was created for happiness or misery. All eyes turn   
to Sri Bhagavan for the answer.   
Bhagavan: Creation is neither good nor bad; it is as it is. It is   
the human mind which puts all sorts of constructions   
on it, as it sees things from its own angle and as it suits   
its own interests. A woman is just a woman, but one   
mind calls her 'mother, another 'sister, and still another   
'aunt' and so on. Men love women, hate snakes, and are   
indifferent to the grass and stones by the roadside. These   
connections are the causes of all the misery in the world.   
Creation is like a peepul tree: birds come to eat its fruit,   
or take shelter under its branches, men cool themselves   
in its shade, but some may hang themselves on it. Yet   
the tree continues to lead its quiet life, unconcerned with,   
and unaware of, all the uses it is put to. It is the human   
mind that creates its own difficulties and then cries for   
help. Is God so partial as to give peace to one person and   
sorrow to another? In creation there is room for   
everything, but man refuses to see the good, the healthy   
and the beautiful, and goes on whining, like the hungry   
man who sits beside a tasty dish and, instead of stretching   
out his hand to satisfy his hunger, he goes on lamenting.   
Whose fault is it, God's or man's? But fortunately for   
man, God, in His infinite mercy, never forsakes him. He   
always gives him new chances by providing Gurus and   
Scriptures to guide him to find the errors of his ways   
and ultimately gain eternal happiness.   
Visitor. We know that the pleasures of this world are useless   
and even painful, yet we long for them. What is the way   
of ending that longing?   
Bhagavan. Think of God and attachments will gradually drop   
from you. If you wait till all desires disappear to start   
your devotion and prayer, you will have to wait a very,   
very long time indeed.   
From Guru Ramana

**_In human beings,   
There is a need   
To create order   
Out of what is   
Perceived to be chaos.   
This ordering mechanism is   
The mind.   
As such, the mind seeks causes   
To explain what it   
Doesn't understand.   
Is the carrot the cause of the chicken soup   
Or is it the chicken   
Or is it the broth   
Or is it the cook?   
With the apperception that   
Everything is perfect as it is, that   
Everything causes everything else,   
The mind, as fixer,   
As judge,   
As organizer,   
Loses its relevance.

_He had no other occupation in life, no other thought except that one, that he  
was a spirit. He was a disembodied, unfettered, unbound spirit. And not only  
so, but he, with his marvellous vision, had found that every man and woman,  
whether Jew or Gentile, whether rich or poor, whether saint or sinner, was the  
embodiment of the same undying spirit as himself. Therefore, the one work his  
whole life showed was to call upon them to realise their own spiritual nature.  
Give up, he says, these superstitious dreams that you are low and that you are  
poor. Think not that you are trampled upon and tyrannised over as if you were  
slaves, for within you is something that can never be tyrannised over, never  
be trampled upon, never be troubled, never be killed. You are all Sons of God,  
immortal spirit. 'Know', he declared, 'the Kingdom of Heaven is within you.'  
'I and my Father are one.' Dare you stand up and say, not only that 'I am the  
Son of God', but I shall also find in my heart of hearts that 'I and my Father  
are one'? That was what Jesus of Nazareth said. He never talks of this world  
and of this life. He has nothing to do with it, except that he wants to get  
hold of the world as it is, give it a push and drive it forward and onward  
until the whole world has reached to the effulgent Light of God, until  
everyone has realised his spiritual nature, until death is vanished and misery  
banished.

**_Leave your self   
When you do things from your soul,   
you feel a river moving in you, a joy.   
When actions come from another section,   
the feeling disappears.   
Don't let others lead you. They may be blind or, worse, vultures.   
Reach for the rope of God. And what is that?   
Putting aside self-will.   
Because of willfulness people sit in jail,   
the trapped bird?s wings are tied,   
fish sizzle in the skillet.   
The anger of police is willfulness. You've seen a magistrate   
inflict visible punishment.   
Now see the invisible. If you could leave your selfishness, you   
would see how you've been torturing your soul.   
We are born and live inside black water in a well.   
How could we know what an open field of sunlight is?   
Don't insist on going where you think you want to go.   
 Ask the way to the spring.   
Your living pieces will form a harmony.   
There is a moving palace that floats in the air   
with balconies and clear water flowing through,   
 infinity everywhere, yet contained under a single tent.

_Therefore, all that we are to practise is to be still (summa iruppadu) with  
the remembrance of the feeling 'I'. It is only when there is a slackness of  
vigilance during Self-attention that thoughts, which are an indication of it,  
will rise. In other words, if thoughts rise it means that our Self-attention  
is lost. It is only as a contrivance to win back Self-attention from thought-  
attention that Sri Bhagavan advised us to ask, 'To whom do these thoughts  
appear?' Since the answer 'To me? is only a dative form of 'I', it will easily  
remind us of the nominative form, the feeling 'I'. However, if we question,  
'Who thinks these thoughts?', since the nominative form, the feeling'I', is  
obtained as an answer, will not Self-attention, which has been lost unnoticed,  
be regained directly? This regaining of Self-attention is actually being Self  
(that is, remaining or abiding as Self)! Such 'being' alone is the correct  
sadhana; sadhana is not doing, but being!!_   
_" What our Lord Ramana firmly advises us to take to, as the greatest and  
most powerful tapas is only this much, 'Be still' (summa iru), and not  
anything as the duty to be performed by the mind."   
Guru Vachaka Kovai, verse 773

**_Mrs. D. said there were breaks in her awareness and desired to know   
how the awareness might be made continuous.   
M.: Breaks are due to thoughts. You cannot be aware of breaks unless   
you think so. It is only a thought. Repeat the old practice, 'To whom   
do thoughts arise?' Keep up the practice until there are no breaks.   
Practice alone will bring about continuity of awareness.

_Question: Ultimately all is experience. Whatever we think, feel, do is  
experience. Behind it is the experiencer. So all we know consists of these  
two, the experiencer and the experience. But the two are really one - the  
experiencer alone is the experience. Still, the experiencer takes the  
experience to be outside. In the same way the Spirit and the body are one;  
they only appear as two.   
Nisargadatta: To the Spirit there is no second.   
Question: To whom then does the second appear? It seems to me that duality is  
an illusion induced by the imperfection of the psyche. When the psyche is  
perfect, duality is no longer seen.   
Nisargadatta: You have said it.   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj_

**_WHAT HURTS THE SOUL?   
We tremble, thinking we're about to dissolve into nonexistence,   
but nonexistence fears even more that it might be given human form!   
Loving God is the only pleasure. Other delights turn bitter.   
What hurts the soul?   
To live without tasting the water of its own essence.   
People focus on death and this material earth.   
They have doubts about soul water.   
Those doubts can be reduced! Use night to wake your clarity.   
Darkness and the living water are lovers.   
Let them stay up together.   
When merchants eat their big meals and sleep their dead sleep,   
we night-thieves go to work.

**_What 's Not Here   
I start out on this road,   
call it love or emptiness.   
I only know what's not here.   
Resentment seeds, backscratching greed,   
worrying about outcome, fear of people.   
When a bird gets free,   
it does not go back for remnants   
left on the bottom of the cage.   
Close by, I'm rain. Far off,   
a cloud of fire. I seem restless,   
but I am deeply at ease.   
Branches tremble. The roots are still.   
I am a universe in a handful of dirt,   
whole when totally demolished.   
Talk about choices does not apply to me.   
While intelligence considers options,   
I am somewhere lost in the wind.

**_How sweet it is to give speech and head, to converse with his lip,   
 especially when he opens the door and says, 'Good sir,come in!'   
To the dry lip he tells the story of the fountain of Khidar;   
according to the stature of the man the tailor of his love cuts the gown.   
The fountains become drunken through the intoxication of his eye;   
the trees are dancing before the gentle breeze of dawn.   
The nightingale says to the rosebush, 'What is in your heart?   
Declare it this instant. No other is near; only you and I.'   
The rosebush answers, 'So long as you are with yourself,entertain not this  
ambition.   
Make a special effort to transport the burden of your selfhood out of this  
earthly abode.   
'The eye of the needle of this passion is narrow;   
 know for a cer-tainty that it will not admit any thread   
when it perceives it to be of double strand.   
Behold how the sun is up to the throat in fire, so that through its face   
the face of the earth may become full of light.   
When Moses proceeded towards the burning bush, the bush said,   
'I am the water of Kauthar; take off your shoes, and come!   
Do not fear my fire, for I am water and sweet at that; you have come to  
prosperity;   
the seat of honour is yours, welcome!   
You are a pearl of pure lustre, a ruby of the mine, the soul of place and  
placelessness;   
you are the nonpareil of the age; where are other creatures beside you?'

**_Have you ever seen any lover who was satiated with this passion?   
Have you ever seen any fish that had become satiated with this sea?   
Have you ever seen any image that was fleeing from the engraver?

**_My heart is burning with love   
All can see this flame   
 My heart is pulsing with passion   
 like waves on an ocean   
My friends have become strangers   
and I?m surrounded by enemies   
But I am free as the wind   
no longer hurt by those who reproach me   
I?m at home wherever I am   
 And in the room of lovers   
 I can see with closed eyes   
 the beauty that dances   
Behind the veils   
intoxicated with love   
I too dance the rhythm   
of this moving world   
I have lost my senses   
in my world of lovers.

The sufi tale of the city of Azal?b?d   
Within the shadow of the city wall, at the place where the cypress trees begin  
a long dark blue march down the mountainside to the ocean, sits the basket  
weaver. Daily, as his ancestors have done for generations before him, he  
squats in the dust, surrounded by strands of coloured straw, weaving not only  
baskets but tales of love, lust and longing; fabricating from the gossip of  
passers-by new mythologies and legends. He tells them of their own lives, yet  
they hear them as the stories of others.   
As they pass in and out of the city on various errands, some people mesmerized  
by his swiftly moving fingers stop for a moment, sitting next to him to  
listen, only later to find that they have lost an entire day in the listening.   
'Maktub,' he says, "It is written". And bending his head, his bony calloused  
fingers twist the bright straws into intricate patterns of increasing  
complexity. Red, white, yellow, and black disappear within his hands, and as  
the baskets grow bigger, the stories also weave themselves into  
correspondingly complex patterns of inference and innuendo.   
'The snares of the Beloved are many' he says, smiling toothlessly at the faces  
around him, 'as are the Attributes of the Beloved'.   
In a country that existed before and after time as you know it, there is a  
city called Azal?b?d. Perhaps some of you have heard of it? Many have called  
it the city of the thousand thousand gates. A strange city of high  
impenetrable walls and narrow dark lanes linked high above one's head by  
delicately carved bridges? but the stories of the bridges are for another day.  
It is the gates of which I will speak now'.   
The gates come in many sizes. Some are large ornate structures capable of  
dwarfing a Gothic cathedral; others are barely two feet across. There are  
gates bejewelled with a King's ransom, baroque gates, gates of rotted,  
decaying wood, gates of glass, gates of precious metals ? there is even a gate  
of fire. Some gates open at the touch of a child?s finger, others can resist  
an elephant! Some are locked; some are not. Some gates are not even visible,  
but it is said that these are the gates used by all flying creatures ? birds,  
bats, insects and the souls of the dead. Some gates you can never forget, and  
others are erased from memory before you are conscious of ever having seen  
them. Each gate has its own name and purpose. In a lifetime one passes to  
many, but rarely through all the gates of the city'.   
?Azal?b?d?s walls, lanes, gates and bridges interweave much as the strands of  
straw in this basket. You may think you can guess the eventual pattern, but  
you cannot, for woven with the hand of intuition and the eye of discernment,  
only the pattern itself knows the secret of its being'.   
'Now in the heart of Azal?b?d a King lay hidden, waiting for a lover to enter  
the Gate of Love, and with heart aflame prostrate before his throne.  
Unfortunately, he's been waiting a long time, for in this city of millions  
there were but a handful of would-be lovers, who, though struggling valiantly,  
were still trapped somewhere between the Gate of Pride and the Gate of  
Humility, or lost in the Lane of the Fault Finders, still eyed the goods in  
the Marketplace of Desire. How could they know that the Lane of Poverty is  
linked to the Gate of Annihilation by the Bridge of Remembrance? After all,  
the few who had made the journey in years long past were unable to speak of  
it'.   
Over time, many of these would-be lovers had become both lazy and inert,  
content to sleep both night and day. True, they dreamed of the King, rehearsed  
words of love, designed their court apparel, wrote poems as to his beauty and  
so on, all the while lying in bed watching others cleaning the steps of the  
gates, prying moss from the walls or tending the many gardens. Quick to find  
fault yet slow to act, they waited for the king to summon them.   
?When he calls me by name, I will go to him immediately!" said one.   
"I am but waiting for a sign of his favour," said another.   
"Rather than ruin the garden. I will be patient till he shows me how it is  
done,' said a would-be gardener, ignoring the weeds that, choking the  
pathways, killed the flowers.   
These lazy ones, smiling with pleasure at their own good intentions watched as  
floors were scrubbed, carpets beaten and meals were prepared, piously mouthing  
prayers and thinking fondly of the day they would at last serve the King.   
The king, disappointed that no one had completed the journey, decided that  
perhaps a small prod might get them moving, hoping that his own poems of love  
might inspire them to try harder. And so, having heard of a marvellous young  
sculptor named Habib, living in a neighbouring country, the King sent him a  
letter requesting that he visit Azal?b?d and carve into the walls of the city  
the King's own love poems for the citizens to read. As an added token of His  
favour he enclosed a locket of pure gold. "I must ask you to show no one this  
magic locket," he wrote, "It must be our secret alone. I only request that you  
carve in beautiful calligraphy my words of love, and if you wish, the words of  
the masters. And if ever you should want to see me, the gate to my quarters is  
in the black wall at the eastern end of the city. You will know it when you  
see it".   
'Overjoyed to be summoned by the King, Habib travelled immediately, arriving  
the next day. News of his arrival permeated even the darkest and most obscure  
lanes of the city; rumours of his beauty flew thick and fast; his face was  
likened to the radiance of the sun, and it was said that his sculptures and  
calligraphy were the most beautiful in the world. Rumour had it that  
Azal?b?d's walls, when completed, would catch the rays of both moon and stars,  
as well as the sun. And so brilliantly faceted were to be the calligraphic  
incisions in the walls that light dancing from every plane and angle would  
cause the King?s words of love to pierce and enter each worthy heart'   
'Habib began his work immediately, choosing for his first site a small but  
very beautiful wall of alabaster. Draping the wall with a cloth, he enclosed  
it from sight, and to the citizens' dismay would allow none to watch him work.  
In deep concentration he carved for forty-eight hours without stopping, each  
stroke of the chisel ringing through the city like the toil of a bell, rousing  
the lethargic people from their beds'.   
'Azal?b?d began to hum with activity, as the citizens bathed and groomed  
themselves in preparation for the unveiling of the first poem. Clothes were  
cleaned, hair pomaded, jewels polished, nails clipped and shoes shined in  
Habib's honour'.   
'Crowds began gathering at the site at midnight, and by dawn the streets,  
lanes, bridges and rooftops of Azal?b?d were filled to capacity. As the sun  
rose, the walls glowed red, and an unexpected hush fell over the waiting  
crowd. Ten thousand pairs of eyes caressed the figure of Habib as he stood by  
the draped wall waiting for his moment. Like an actor at centre-stage he held  
the crowd's attention; aware of his own striking appearance, he had dressed  
simply but elegantly. With a magnificent sweep of his arm he disclosed the  
freshly carved wall'.   
Rays of coloured light shone from the once-plain wall, dancing brilliantly as  
the rising sun increased in intensity. Words, leaping from the alabaster,  
hovered in the crisp morning air. A million birds simultaneously broke into  
song as the world filled with symphonic light, the forms of the calligraphy  
curving endlessly inward on themselves, revealing deeper and still deeper  
patterns and meanings. Silently each person read the King's words: O heart! How conceitedly   
you pride yourself in your knowledge!   
Beware! Only in love lies the true way.   
Only when you give up 'I' and 'We' in tribute   
will the Beloved lay down His head   
in reconciliation.   
Only when your existence is plundered,   
will your knowledge be transformed   
into vision.   
Never will you see the Beloved   
until you expel all but Him   
from the heart.   
In the heart of the sea,   
a chip of wood cannot remain.   
Into the Beloved's abode,   
no self can enter.   
'The mystery of the King's words, transformed into a whirling dance of dawn  
radiance, almost blinded them. And for a moment there was a possibility? but  
then, impatient for applause, Habib bowed, taking credit for the beauty of the  
script?s arabesques and curlicues, and with long slender artist?s fingers  
traced the calligraphy incised in the alabaster, caressing each line and  
indentation possessively ? much as the lover might touch the face of his  
Beloved. Released suddenly from the deep emotion transfixing it, the crowd  
roared approval, chattering with delight at the novelty of the event, losing  
the breathless, timeless moment ? a King's gift'.   
'Habib, chisel in hand, stood next to the poetry on the wall, nodding  
graciously at the crowd's applause'.   
'Later it was agreed that the spectacle was everything and more than had been  
expected. The words had reminded them of lost aspirations; love seemed  
possible, a journey to the Beloved imminent, as hearts drummed, stirred by the  
beauty of Habib's calligraphy'.   
'Week after week Habib carved love poems into the various building stones of  
the city's structure. Agate, quartz, limestone, fine Carrara, serpentine,  
nephrite, granite all polished to a high sheen, revealed daily new words from  
the King. The citizens of Azal?b?d became imbued with purpose. Bodies that had  
not ached in the service of the King now ached from carrying Habib's tools and  
drawing instruments, knees were sore, as the carpets on which he knelt to work  
were cleaned daily. Hands now ached from secret practice at lettering,  
forefingers calloused with effort on the chance that Habib might train someone  
to be his apprentice. Many people dreamed of being the one at his side'.   
'In short ? hearts that had not ached for the King now ached for Habib'.   
'Being both generous and wise, the King was pleased to feel hearts beginning  
to beat and eyes filled with the tears of love; and smiling to himself he  
applauded the backs bent in service of someone other than themselves'.   
'Habib, quite overwhelmed by the people's response, carved even more quickly  
and passionately. His passion awoke Azal?b?d from its dream, energy poured  
into the streets of the city and thousands worked as though their hearts might  
burst with the effort. Hour after hour Habib wrote of love, of roses and  
dewdrops, of the moth and the flame, of wine and drunkenness, and so deep was  
his ecstasy that he forgot that the words he carved into the walls were not  
his own but the words of the King. Swaying to the rhythm of his arm, as the  
mallet pounded the chisel deep into the heart of the stone, the golden locket  
beating heavily over his own heart, Habib became delirious with joy and so  
expanded that he saw himself as the King's equal, and in a daze saw the people  
of Azal?b?d as his own subjects. Within a short time so great was his daring  
that he chose from among the citizens a court of his own, naming a group of  
young men to be his chevaliers, and choosing a personal cook, secretary,  
various house servants, a tea master, etc.   
'The people chosen were reluctant at first to leave the King?s court for that  
of Habib, and resisting his generous offers, insisted that their allegiance  
was to the King. But Habib, crafty from desire, would pull out the magic  
locket with a pretended show of reluctance and place the golden jewel in the  
potential courtier?s hand, saying: 'This locket is a mark of the King?s favour. I've been chosen by the King to  
be as he is. I am no ordinary lover. What would be sin in others is virtue in  
me. To love me is to love the King. We are one'.   
'And as if to prove his state, he began to share his mystical dreams with  
them, relating conversations with Jonayd and Er?q?, H?fez and B?yazed, telling  
of a supernatural sam? with Mo??nodd?n Chesht?, until the King's courtiers  
were so overcome with the beauty of these words that they surrendered their  
will to Habib'.   
'Well, as you might have guessed, the next morning the King was not only  
without his breakfast, but had no clean clothes! This was just the beginning,  
for the courtiers were not to be the only ones corrupted. Shameless Habib  
methodically wooed every person he met away from the King, telling each of  
them a different lie, playing on individual desires for fame and recognition,  
riches or attention; taking them aside one at a time, he showed them the magic  
locket, until they were all mad with devotion and ready to follow him into  
hell if need be! Within a few months the entire city knew the secret of the  
golden locket, each person happy in the knowledge that he or she was the ONLY  
knower of the mystical relationship between Habib and the King'.   
'Now it is very hard to keep a secret secret, and soon the citizens of  
Azal?b?d were dropping hints to each other of the unique nature of their  
friendship with Habib, indicating that they had earned special regard for  
attributes they unfortunately were not at liberty to reveal. People drew  
closer to each other, not out of friendship, but simply to keep surveillance  
on the comings and goings of others. As their love for Habib was the only  
aspect of the friendship that could be openly shared, they vied with each  
other in glowing descriptions of his beauty, many carrying his portrait with  
them, crying that his beauty was overwhelming, unbearable'.   
'Soon Habib was not even called by name, being referred to only as 'he' ? 'he'  
said this, 'he' said that ? everyone taking it for granted that it was of  
Habib they spoke'.   
"Do you mean God?", asked a stranger to the city, hearing 'he' as 'He'.   
"No, you fool, we talk of 'him'."   
"Then you must mean the King?", the stranger queried.   
"No, we speak of Habib".   
'The stranger was aghast. "But what of God? What of the King?", he asked.   
"They are all one", cried an admirer, kissing crafty Habib's picture until the  
likeness became a dark blur.'   
'The King knowing everything that happens in the city of Azal?b?d, waited for  
the frenzy over Habib to die naturally, hoping that there were those who might  
recognize in Habib's work the King's own message. But the madness seemed  
endless, hysteria masquerading as joy, lust as love, until at last the King  
decided to intervene once more. Reaching for his pen, he very carefully drew  
in the palm of his hand an exact copy of the magic locket. Then, cupping his  
hands, blew the image out of the window and into the Lane of Interpretation.  
The following day when Habib awoke the locket was no longer around his neck.  
He searched his rooms frantically, but it was not to be found. Finally, going  
to the site of his current project, the carnelian wall, he saw to his surprise  
that there were no admirers waiting. Running quickly over to the market place,  
Habib commanded the passers-by to follow him to the partly finished wall,  
promising them each a chance to carve one letter of the poem. But staring at  
him vaguely, they continued on their way. Now Habib was no fool, realizing at  
once that the loss of the locket had something to do with the new  
indifference; so, hastening to the kitchen, he fashioned a locket of bread  
dough, baked it and painted it with golden leaf. Then hanging it around his  
neck, he ran back to the carnelian wall. But there was still no one there.  
Back he ran to the street again, where, one by one, each person was again  
shown the locket under his shirt and reminded of Habib's special place in the  
King's heart. Quoting a line from Mo??nodd?n Chesht? as added enticement, he  
soon filled the hall with those who could not tell counterfeit from real gold.  
As Habib began to carve in the wall a poem of his own about following one?s  
heart, clapping and shouting erupted, until finally, jubilantly, he led his  
devotees in a procession through the lanes of the city of Azal?b?d, saying: "I, I, I, 'tis I alone who can lead you through the Gate of Love to the court  
of the King". And the crowd, echoing his words shouted: "I, I, I".

## Re:[4338]Love,always love and only love Divine poetry and thoughts

'Pleased with this ruse and entranced by the power of the fake locket, Habib  
felt it was time to confront the King, depose him from the throne, and show  
the world, that he, Habib, was the King's equal. "Follow me to the Gate of  
Love", he promised, "and I will show you who is King". Singing and dancing in  
Habib's wake, the mob wound its way through the Gates of Despair and  
Confusion, jamming the Lane of Ignorance in their ignorance to follow. At last  
reaching the eastern wall, which gleamed blackly in the noon sun, its onyx  
perfection as dazzling as diamonds, Habib looked for the gate mentioned by the  
King, but to his surprise there were two gates in the wall. Chuckling, he made  
his decision quickly; it was not hard to do, for on his right stood the most  
magnificent gate he had ever seen, its high arch a mosaic of blue tiles, a  
door of sandalwood, handles of amethyst, while at each side of the gate stood  
servants bearing golden axes ? the insignia of the King'.   
'To Habib's left, low in the wall, was a small brown gate of cracked,  
splintered wood, left open for the entry and exit of the city's horde of stray  
dogs, who scratching and whining, lay among the refuse. Among the dogs  
crouched a woman, trying to enter the city through this gate, crawling on  
hands and knees. But the door was too low. Finally, laying flat on her belly  
with her face in the dust she attempted to wriggle through. Habib laughed, and  
the dogs began to howl. "What are you doing, woman", he said, "when you can  
accompany me through the Gate of Love?" Through eyes swollen with crying the  
woman looked up at Habib. "Don?t speak to me of love", she said. "For forty  
years I thought I loved, but it was nothing but self deception. I'm not worthy  
to enter the Gate of Love. Let me be". Habib shrugged, turning back toward the  
great shining gate on his right, the fake locket on his chest gleaming as if  
it were real, his purpose strong in him, the woman at his feet already  
forgotten?'.   
The basket weaver stops speaking, concentrating on a particularly complex part  
of the basket under his fingers. He is silent so long that the listeners  
become nervous, afraid that he has forgotten the end of the story. 'Finish the  
story', they clamour. 'You must finish the story'.   
The basket weaver looks at them. 'You must be patient. After all, you the  
listeners are the ears that determine the course of the tale, the warp wherein  
lies the weft. I merely translate from the language of dreams. You must wait  
until the words of the weft form themselves'. He finishes the basket in his  
hand and starting another, smiles. 'Maktub', he says. ?It is written that the  
Gate of Love and the Gate of Deception are very close together. But let us  
talk about the woman at the Gate of Dogs'.   
'Karima ? for that was her name ? had resided in the Lane of Endurance for  
many years, content with the sight of a small portion of the Gate of Hope,  
visible from her window. Years before, young and beautiful, she had fallen in  
love with a very difficult and unpleasant man. Rich and powerful, used to  
getting his way, he had seen Karima dance at the yearly festival, deciding  
then she must belong to him. The force of his will exuded a fierce charm that  
both attracted and repelled her, yet drew her to him. He was rude, indifferent  
and callous, and Karima, asking herself why she was enduring such behaviour,  
seemed unable to pull away. He rarely spent time with her, and when he did, he  
was insulting and cold, wanting only to own her, not share his life with her.  
She was an acquisition, as were his large house, stables, gardens and  
servants. When she begged him for attention, he suggested rudely that she go  
to his library and entertain herself there, suggesting that a little education  
would not harm her'.   
'Despairing of ever being loved by him, she planned to leave and move to  
another city. Searching for pen and paper to write a farewell letter, she  
found her way to his large, well-stocked library. (He was a man proud of his  
scholarship in a number of subjects). Karima sat at the desk for some time,  
but the words she sought would not form themselves on the page. Finally, she  
began to browse through the books, selecting at random, moving from geography  
to history, physics to geology, religion to poetry'.   
And it was there in the poetry section that the miracle, as she liked t call  
it, began. There in the margins of the books, alongside the poems, were  
pencilled notations of incredible sensitivity and insight. A commentary on  
Love ran through the pages in this unusual fashion. Profound statement  
relating to the heart had been underlined, and the most beautiful of the poems  
were thoroughly commented upon'.   
'Karima knew that she was privy to the tentative and painful outpourings of a  
heart consumed by a love so fierce that it was in danger of annihilation. Her  
own heart felt calm at last, now perceiving in him another hidden being,  
wrapped in a love so sublime that it could not be shared. A man capable of the  
love she craved, but a man that might never show it.   
'When she left the library late that night, she was more deeply in love than  
she had ever thought possible. Within a few weeks they married. She hoped that  
her commitment to him might encourage him to reveal himself, but in this she  
was disappointed. The reverse seemed true. Marriage seemed to exacerbate his  
bad temper and need for cruel games'.   
'You exert no fascination over me now', he said. 'I shouldn't have married  
you'. And with that statement, he became even more withdrawn'.   
Soon Karima?s life was lived in the library. Books were her intimate  
confidants. Whispering to herself, she memorized the faint comments in the  
margins of the pages. Daily she searched eagerly for his loving remarks,  
hearing his voice in her imagination, pretending that his words were only for  
her.   
'You don?t understand him\, she told friends when they expressed surprise at  
her feelings for him. 'There's another side of him that's capable of the most  
subtle love I have ever known. All human love pales before it'.   
'Years passed in this fashion, he, working day and night to accrue money,  
Karima reading her way through the entire library of 70,000 books, searching  
for precious moments of nearness to him. As they grew old together, yet apart,  
her love for him increased daily. At one time she had been afraid of reaching  
the end of the books, of completing her knowledge of his inner self, afraid of  
the time that the library could bring her nothing new to her of her beloved.  
But on the last shelves she had found books unlike any others, books  
containing the teachings of Mo??nodd?n Chesht?, books that were fresh on each  
re-reading, lending themselves to new interpretations each time she pondered  
them'.   
'It was within these pages that Karima discovered the purpose of her  
relationship with him. His comments here were even more cryptic, hinting at a  
mystery within a mystery, a love that was its own Presence and Absence. The  
cries of a heart on fire? She now saw why he treated her so indifferently ? he  
was trying to teach her love beyond the ordinary, pointing to the hypocrisy  
and insincerity in so much of private life and public ritual, guiding her to  
the real instead of the socially correct or psychologically comfortable'.   
Each insolent remark, each cruel act, Karima now welcomed with love and  
gratitude (seeing him as one of the Blameworthy, who teach by negative  
example) and filled with a quiet radiance, her life deepened in contentment.  
At first she tried to speak of these discoveries with him, but silenced by  
cold looks, she suddenly saw the wisdom of silence, the faculty of speaking  
about that which simultaneously has no name and all names. After that insight  
she was never again lonely, for love was now her companion.   
'More years passed and they became old. The man began to sicken, confined to  
his bed, ranting and raging against the injustice of a world that would not  
led him live forever enjoying his accumulated luxuries. Knowing that he was  
close to death, she sat by his bed reading softly from the poems she suspected  
might be his favourites. Opening one of her favourite books, she read several  
lines that had prompted him to write a poem in the margin. This poem had  
become one of the mainstays of her life, causing her to think deeply on the  
nature of the one who had written it. But the man ignored her, turning his  
face to the wall'.   
'Let me read you a poem that you wrote many years ago', she said. 'The pencil  
writing is so faded that you must forgive me if I make a mistake.' Holding the  
book close to the light by his head, Karima began to read these simple lines: You may demolish the mosque or the temple,   
And whatever you wish to demolish.   
But, do no harm to someone's heart,   
As that is where God resides.   
'And leaning over the dying man Karima smiled down at him. 'This poem has  
served as a map in my life. Through it you taught me love'.   
'Keep your sentimental nonsense to yourself?, the man shouted and, summoning a  
final surge of energy, knocked the book from her hand.   
'Karima was undeterred. 'You have given me the most extraordinary love ? and  
life ? more than I could ever have hoped?.   
'I'm dying and you?re jabbering about love?', he shouted, hitting her as hard  
as he could. 'Are you mad?'   
'Mad? Yes I'm mad. Mad with love, master. For you are my master? You've been  
my guide. I've tried to follow the signs you left in the books, tried to read  
the Sufis as you have read them, but I have many questions and there is so  
little time now. Please, allow me to know you in your completeness before you  
go'.   
'An obscenity burst from the man's mouth, but ignoring it, she bent down to  
retrieve the small book fallen on the floor. Holding it up to his eyes, she  
pointed to the faintly pencilled writings. 'This is the real you, this is the  
man I have loved'. He lay silent for a moment for a moment. Karima felt her  
heart jump in wild expectation. Perhaps? now?? But the man scowled at the page  
as if trying to remember something; then with a great burst of laughter, he  
flung the book at the wall?.   
'You fool!', he shouted. ?These are not my words! I've never written a poem in  
my life. This book, and all the others, were in the library when I bought the  
house from some love-crazed poet!'. And within minutes he died ? quite  
literally ? laughing'.   
'Aghast at her folly, Karima ran from his deathbed into the Lane of Despair,  
blind with love. Losing her way in the maze of streets, she ran under the Gate  
of Aspiration into the Lane of the Moment, past the Bridge of Overflowing and  
through the Gate of Exile, searching for some small dark place in which to  
hide her shame'.   
'She came at last to the black eastern wall of the city, and there among the  
dogs threw herself down in the dust. Warm tongues attempted to lick away her  
tears, as mangy curs leaped around her, whining and howling, sharing her  
distress. But to her dismay she was not alone in her misery, a great crowd  
seemed to have gathered nearby, voices ecstatic with joy, songs of love. As  
the words of love penetrated, her shame increased. Throwing herself down on  
her belly, she tried to crawl into the Gate of Dogs'.   
?Feeling a hand on her shoulder, she looked up. A beautiful young man crouched  
next to her, talking of a King and offering to take her with him through the  
Gate of Love. None of it made sense to her, and she pushed him away, saying: 'I'm not worthy to enter the Gate of Love. I deserve only the Gate of  
Deception'.   
'And giving one last look of longing at the glowing gate and the procession of  
people pouring under its indigo archway. Karima gave up any idea of escape  
from the awful reality stripping her of her illusions. Sobbing as the love  
boiling in her heart seemed to great to bear, the dogs led her into the  
mysterious darkness of their gate. Unaware at last of the singing of the crowd  
sweeping past her, Karima's ears were deaf to the seductive voice of the young  
man as he shouted: 'I, I. It is I, only I'.   
'Maktub. It is written that the snares of the Beloved are many and varied, for  
on that day ten thousand people passed through the Gate of Deception and only  
one through the Gate of Love. But, as it is said, when the love of the lover  
is Love, then like Majnun, the lover can be among the dogs and follow them  
directly to the hand of the King?.   
Note: Every similarity with the real occurrences is with purpose.   
Vanity is the worst of all.   
_Only God knows what Love is!_**

**_God says: "Whomsoever you love more than me,   
I will take away from you."   
And adds: "Do not say; " I cannot live without him/her."   
-I will make you live without him/her."   
And the season passes.   
The branches of tree providing shade become dry.   
Patience runs out.   
The person whom you think as a part of you   
turns out to be a stranger.   
Your mind startles.   
Even your friend turns out to be your enemy,   
Your enemy turns out to be your friend.   
The person whom you love more than life   
Betrays you.   
Such a strange world!   
Whenever you think:"It never occurs."-   
It occurs.   
You say:"I am not falling",   
Yet you fall.   
You say:"I don't get amazed."-   
Yet, you get amazed.   
The most weird thing is this;   
You keep on saying:"I died."   
Yet you live..   
Rumi

**_D.: How can the rebellious mind be brought under control?   
M.: Either seek its source so that it may disappear or surrender that it may  
be struck down.   
D.: But the mind slips away from our control.   
M.: Be it so. Do not think of it. When you recollect yourself bring it back  
and turn it inward. That is enough.   
No one succeeds without effort. Mind control is not one?s birthright. The  
successful few owe their success to their perseverance.   
A passenger in a train keeps his load on the head by his own folly. Let him  
put it down: he will find the load reaches the destination all the same.  
Similarly, let us not pose as the doers, but resign ourselves to the guiding  
Power.   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi _**

**_Mountain-high though the difficulties appear,   
terrible and gloomy though all things seem,   
they are but Maya.   
Fear not - it is banished. Crush it, and it vanishes. Stamp upon it, and it  
dies.   
Be not afraid. Think not how many times you fail. Never mind.   
Time is infinite. Go forward: assert yourself again and again, and light must come.
