MASTER: " **They should try to perform their duties in a detached way**.  
Before you break the jack-fruit open, rub your hands with oil, so that the  
sticky milk will not smear them.T **he maidservant in a rich man 's house  
performs all her duties, but her mind dwells on her home in the country. This  
is an example of doing duty in a detached way. **You should renounce the world  
only in mind. But a sannyasi should renounce the world both inwardly and  
outwardly."   
BRAHMO: "What is the meaning of the 'end of enjoyments'?"   
MASTER: " **I mean the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'.**It is risky to put a  
typhoid patient in a room where pitchers of water and jugs of pickled tamarind  
are kept.Most people don't feel any longing for God unless they have once  
passed through the experience of wealth, name, fame, creature comforts, and  
the like, that is to say, unless they have seen through these enjoyments."   
BRAHMO: "Who is really bad, man or woman?"   
MASTER: "As there are women endowed with vidyasakti, so also there are women  
with avidyasakti. **A woman endowed with spiritual attributes leads a man to  
God, but a woman who is the embodiment of delusion makes him forget God and  
drowns him in the ocean of worldliness.**   
"This universe is created by the Mahamaya of God. Mahamaya contains both  
vidyamaya, the illusion of knowledge, and avidyamaya, the illusion of  
ignorance.   
Through the help of vidyamaya one cultivates such virtues as the taste for  
holy company, knowledge, devotion, love, and renunciation. **Avidyamaya  
consists of the five elements and the objects of the five sensesform,  
flavour, smell, touch, and sound. These make one forget God. "**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says How can one recognize a holy man?

Devotee: "How can one recognize a holy man?"   
 **Rama Krishna: "He who has surrendered his body, mind, and innermost self to  
God is surely a holy man. He who has renounced 'woman and gold' is surely a  
holy man.** He is a holy man who does not regard woman with the eyes of a  
worldly person. He never forgets to look upon a woman as his mother, and to  
offer her his worship if he happens to be near her.   
The holy man constantly thinks of God and does not indulge in any talk except  
about spiritual things. Furthermore, he serves all beings, knowing that God  
resides in everybody's heart. These, in general, are the signs of a holy man."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says monastic life will not help a man if he has attachments  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 26, 2010, 01:26:38 PM

Saturday, June 2, 1883   
Sri Ramakrishna had been invited to visit the homes of his devotees  
Balaram,Adhar, and Ram in Calcutta. Devotional music had been arranged by  
Adhar and Ram.The Master was accompanied in the carriage by Rakhal, M., and  
others.   
As they drove along, Sri Ramakrishna said to the devotees: "You see, sin flies  
away when love of God grows in a man's heart, even as the water of the  
reservoir dug in a meadow dries up under the heat of the sun. But one cannot  
love God if one feels attracted to worldly things, to **' woman and gold'.  
Merely taking the vow of monastic life will not help a man if he is attached  
to the world. It is like swallowing your own spittle after spitting it out on  
the ground."**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna tells us the essence of the Gita

"The Divine Mother has revealed to me the essence of the Vedanta. It is that  
Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. The essence of the Gita is what  
you get by repeating the word ten times. The word becomes reversed. It is then  
'tagi',which refers to renunciation. **The essence of the Gita is: 'O man,  
renounce everything and practise spiritual discipline for the realization of  
God.' "**   
NAVADVIP: "But how can we persuade our minds to renounce?"   
MASTER: " **You are a goswami. It is your duty to officiate as priest in the  
temple.** You cannot renounce the world; otherwise, who would look after the  
temple and its services? **You have to renounce mentally.**   
"It is God Himself who has kept you in the world to set an example to men.  
**You may resolve in your mind a thousand times to renounce the world, but you  
will not succeed. God has given you such a nature that you must perform your  
worldly duties.**   
" **Krishna said to Arjuna: 'What do you mean, you will not fight? By your  
mere will you cannot desist from fighting.Your very nature will make you  
fight.' "**

This post reveals exactly the position of Ramana's central teaching.   
Renounce the ego and that is the true renunciation. Bhagavan   
Ramana never advocated foregoing the work or worldly pursuits.   
Arunachala Siva.
