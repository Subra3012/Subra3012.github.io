Namaste/Greetings to All Devotees of Bhagavan Ramana, Forum Members and  
Guests,   
"Place your burden at the feet of the Lord of the Universe who accomplishes  
everything.   
Remain all the time steadfast in the heart, in the Transcendental Absolute.   
God Knows the past, present and future.   
He will determine the future for you and accomplish the work.   
What is to be done will be done at the proper time.   
Don't worry.   
Abide in the heart and surrender your acts to the divine."   
\--Ramana Maharshi   
Blessed by the Grace of Bhagavan Ramana, the Mahadeepam of Jnanashakti, since  
darshan of His samadhi at Ramanashramam in 1989.

As long as there is fear, one wants to learn. Once the vasanas are exhausted,  
one feels there is no sense in learning any more and unlearning becomes a  
natural process.

I just wanted to acjknowledge the quote from Ramana and give thanks to Purnama  
for providing the blessing of posting it.   
Indeed, abide in the heart and surrenderr all acts to the divine. It is so  
simple. But even more profound what is to be done will be done in the proper  
time. What I saw in this quote quite unexpectedly while surfing the forum was  
what I have been missing in my study. Faith! The faith that all will be done.  
I can give up the search for the almost uncconscious constant desire to  
answear the how to's first. It is not needed. You know what I mean? I have  
been missing the faith! It was simply a matter of trust. My humble  
gratitude.

Well Ive read lots of Ramanas teaching, and what he said was FORGET all youve  
learned not UNLEARN.   
I take that to mean, that at the moment of death one forgets what one has  
learned. How can you UNLEARN, youd have to FORMAT your Soul !!!   
 It seems that everything that we have experienced is indelibally etched into  
the subtle mind, all the previous lives and even I believe, what is to come.   
 What Ramana taught was to seek the knower of thoughts, to try to find the Ego  
.which he said disapears because it isnt real.   
 All this unlearning stuff sounds like some sort of Western deconditioining  
psychology to me!!   
He said to ask "To whom is this happening?" with everything, no matter what it  
is that is happening.   
Hed probably tell you to ask "Who is it that is trying to unlearn!!!!!!"   
Theres also the type of meditation where you WATCH the mind. And even LABEL  
the things that happen in it. Like for instance. "Here is a nice feeling, now  
the mind is making a bad feeling, Now there is a feeling of atraction, now the  
perception of uglyness. Here is fear, here is anger " Observation of the  
constant stream of thoughts etc This isnt unlearning anything its just seeing  
things for what they really are!! Knowing the mind for what it IS!!!   
The mind goes on and on, iI am happy, I am sad, I want this or that.   
Read Ramanas book "Who am I" he gets the whole mind, the whole of psychology  
and all of the functions of the mind on a couple of pages.   
Something that the whole of "psychiatry and psychology" cant get into millions  
of books.   
In fact the best thing you could do is just get as many books aout Ramana as  
you can and read what he says and IGNORE EVERYONE ELSE.   
Exept for Buddha, Sankara, Krishna etc of course. But with Ramana Maharishi  
you really have got the answers to everything and no other Guru is  
nescessary!!!!!   
Peace

The "unlearning" about which Bhagavan speaks, is on the absolute level, why  
learning on the relative level always is needed - it belongs to life. It does  
not contradict. A famous philosopher said: "I know that I don't know anything"  
(freely quoted). In this sense we become aware that we know really nothing in  
an absolute sense. But we learn many things in life nevertheless. It is  
wonderful to learn! So learning and unlearning can go hand in hand   
Kind regards   
Gabriele

Dear Gabrielle,   
I am afraid you mix things a bit up   
Unlearning is related to dismantling one's conceptual world, that product of  
our fear. Without fear even all the knowledge we have accumulated in life, and  
new information becomes purified. It is another aspect of unlearning. So both  
levels.   
Have a good day

lets put aside what Sri Ramana said and see things as they are. ..   
I show my friend a flower let us say and ask him: "do you know what this is ?"  
, perchance he does not... so he tells me that he does not know. So I tell  
him, "This is called a Rose"   
The next day someone else comes to him and shows him the same flower and asks  
him if he knows. .. he says yes.   
This is knowledge. We pick up the image of an object in our mind, name it,  
associate properties with it and when we have all this information stored in  
our minds about a particular object, we say that we know it.   
This knowledge is absolutely necessary for us to live in this world and play  
our respective roles in our day to day lives. without this it is absolutely  
impossible to function.   
But we should also note that the object itself can never be captured in the  
mind. What is the object sans its name and properties ? any answer we give  
will be only another name or property.   
Now, when it comes to "I" also we hold a name and some properties in the mind.  
This information is very important for our functioning in this world. for  
example if someone asks me, "who are you?" and i reply "brahman", I will not  
be able to function normally in this world. so, the information is important  
for the roles i play in this world. for example, to be a good software  
engineer i need the knowledge of computer science. To be a good son, i need  
the knowledge of my relationships. At the same time, it is very important to  
understand that the properties are "something about me", not me.   
So I have a body... the body is a possession. .. I am not the body.   
I have a dress. .. i am not the dress. ..   
for someone who has mistakenly taken himself to be the body, unlearning is  
important. he should understand that he has a body and he is not the body.   
this is unlearning. ..   
the wrong notions need to be unlearnt by replacing them with right knowledge.   
Love!   
Silence_Speaks.

Learning, I think, is necessary to understand the futility   
of learning. Once you understand that futility, you will   
start and complete the process of unlearning. In fact,   
I am reading Who am I?, everyday, for several days, and I   
find it is adquate for all the civilizations of the entire universe,   
and all religio-philsophic treatises of Hindu and other faiths   
are mere details.

I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?

Nonduel,   
Indeed. words get in the way sometimes for me. We speak the same thought.   
Intention can get lost in the words we choose to use. I just wanted to be  
clear cause I tried resisting for many years what I was thinking and feeling  
and it is just more mind games.   
 I find it very difficult to write about nonduality, but it is vigilance for  
me to do so. And I love it.   
That is wonderful you are aware of self when involved in activites.   
As of yet I still fall back into mind when engaged in worldly activites   
 But I am becoming aware of the answear when asking the question "Who am I" or

Nobody but me.

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.

Hi nonduel,   
The conclusion you have got to is absolutly correct.   
I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great  
fealing which cant be expressed.   
 **I like to take this oppurunity to ask every member of this forum**,   
1) How much time do you spend for meditation?   
2) When you are writing a comment for a members query, do you have any  
personal experience or do you write this reading books?   
Please be clear....

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?   
Only me.

office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.

Hi nonduel,   
The conclusion you have got to is absolutly correct.   
I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great  
fealing which cant be expressed.   
 **I like to take this oppurunity to ask every member of this forum**,   
1) How much time do you spend for meditation?   
2) When you are writing a comment for a members query, do you have any  
personal experience or do you write this reading books?   
Please be clear....   
Cheers

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?   
Only me.   
Mark

Nonduel,   
Indeed. words get in the way sometimes for me. We speak the same thought.   
Intention can get lost in the words we choose to use. I just wanted to be  
clear cause I tried resisting for many years what I was thinking and feeling  
and it is just more mind games.   
 I find it very difficult to write about nonduality, but it is vigilance for  
me to do so. And I love it.   
That is wonderful you are aware of self when involved in activites.   
As of yet I still fall back into mind when engaged in worldly activites   
 But I am becoming aware of the answear when asking the question "Who am I" or  
especially "who is having this thought"repeatedly.   
Nobody but me.   
I like that   
Mark

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and
