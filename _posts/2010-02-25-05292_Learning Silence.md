## Learning Silence

Silence can be learned from gods as well as dogs (god spelled reversely).   
Everyone knows how silence is learned from gods.   
This is how silence is learned from dogs.   
When dogs bark at you in the streets, they expect you to become afraid and run  
for life; then they can chase you in herds and bark more and more; you run  
faster for life and they bark louder to death.   
If you are not afraid, the dogs feel insulted. If you throw stones at them,  
you may hurt them and also make them angry. If you please them and run, they  
will chase you to the point of biting. So you are locked in both ways.   
So the best course is to be silent.   
You can learn silence from gods at holy places.   
Perchance you will also learn silence from dogs there itself.

Long back I also had a dog. The relationship was, I was the master and the dog  
was the servant. The situation was wagging and "flagging". The dog wagged and  
rolled on the ground with half-down ears and it rained bliss.   
To a visitor (unknown) the relationship was, the dog was the master and the  
visitor was the servant. The situation was fly or die. At least cry, for dog's  
sake.

Very true. Also the dogs do not seem to possess any inner enmity towards any  
stranger even when they bark and pose threatening, for after a couple of days  
when the stranger is seen as friend the dog behaves as if they are known for  
ages. It is more of guarding and also sometimes showing their prowess. Human  
beings build stages to display their skills. For street dogs, street is the  
stage and strangers are welcome to play the opposite role.

Just a small pointer I felt to share - The more we try to learn about silence,  
the more we are going away from it! Who is the 'I' that has come about to  
learn Silence. Who am I to whom these thoughts are arising to?   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Bhagavan Ramana has used the dog-simile in one or two places. He says   
"Just as dogs know their Masters, the ego knows its Master, the Self, by   
keeping silent and simply smelling the bliss of the Self in total silence.   
With Bhagavan Ramana, dogs have behaved more strangely than humans.   
One dog accompanied the devotee, who was afraid of the loneliness during   
circumambulation, a dog appeared suddenly and led him through the pradakshina,  
for some distance. After some time, when the devotee came   
back to the Old Hall, the dog was waiting already to ensure that the devotee   
had completed the pradakshina safe and returned to the Asramam.   
The stories of Jackie I and II etc., should be known to the members.   
Arunachala Siva.

Our all Hindu God has animals and birds for their vehicle. Why? Human beings  
are not worth to be their vahanas.Or to learn some good things from them?   
In villages when the dog barks, people say loudly Bairava. They believe the  
barking dogs will become silent.   
Dogs are Bairavas vahanas. Saint Manikkavachakar always compares himself with  
dog. Can Subramaniyan ji give the detail. Manikkavachakar says NAYEN.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the olden days, dogs were considered very lowly. There were   
no pet dogs, travelling in cars and perambulators. So, Saint Manikkavachagar  
used the dog simile to equate him. He even   
says that he is "a dog lowlier than dog" meaning a sick dog or so.   
He considered himself as a blind cow. As the blind cow goes behind   
another cow (with good eyes), merely by listening to the sound   
of the latter, Ammaa.... he would reach Siva by going behind   
other mature devotees! For Siva all living beings are the same   
fit for liberation. So Siva likes even a dog that is doing its   
'karma as per its birth. Further dog is considered a faithful animal. Faith  
to the Master. Such total faith in god is needed by devotees!   
Arunachala Siva.
