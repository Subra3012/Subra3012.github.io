Someone asked Annamalai Swami: "Are there differences in the degree of realization of the Self?   
For example, Ramana was widely acclaimed as a Sadguru.   
Is you understanding the same as Ramana's?"   
Annamalai Swami replied: "You see a big lamp before you. Your own lamp is unlit. So   
you bring your lamp to the lamp which is already burning.   
And when you go away from that lamp, you have your own lamp,   
your own light. Wherever you go, from that point on, the light   
is with you. The state of Jnana is the same for all. Anyone   
who realizes the Self is in the same state of peace, which is   
beyond the mind.   
Though the experience of the Self is the same in all cases,   
it is true that some Jnanis end up helping a lot of people, whereas   
others who are equally enlightened, may help fewer people. Some   
Jnanis do not teach at all. They live ordinary lives and are rarely,   
if ever, recognized for what they really are.   
(Then he gives the example of water bodies...)   
Bhagavan was one of those big, blazing lights, that could light   
up a huge area. He guided and brought light to many people."

Dear srkudai,   
Annamalai Swami was in the Asram, doing various minor and major   
consruction work. After 12 such years, Bhagavan told him to stop   
working and to do meditation. He stayed in Asram for some more time   
and then moved to Palakottu about 500 metres from Asram.   
He is said to have realized the Self later. In 1980s, many Indian   
and Western devotees came to Annamalai Swami for listening to him about  
Bhagavan and also his own sadhana. After his leaving the body, he was interred  
in Palakottu and there is a samadhi for him. I visited his Samadhi when I  
went to Tiruvannamalai in Sep 2008. He is different   
from Sri Sadhu Om.   
There are references about Annamalai Swami in various books   
like Talks etc., There are three books exclusively on him.   
One is his reminscences in Tamil. The other two are written/   
edited by David Godman. These are -   
1\. Living with the Words of Bhagavan.   
2\. Annamalai Swami - Final Talks.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Those who are enlightened but are unable to help others for getting enlightened are called Arhats.   
Those who are enlightened and capable of helping others are called Bodhi  
Sattwas.Here Bodha means not teaching but communicating energy   
to others in silence.

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Buddhism and Jainism have also got these principles.
