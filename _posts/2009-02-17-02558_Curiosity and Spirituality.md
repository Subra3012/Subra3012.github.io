## Arunachala, the greatest trickster  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: February 18, 2009, 10:26:24 AM

There are thousands of stray verses in Tamil, which were sung   
extempore by various great poets during the past 18 centuries.   
There are a few compilations by Tamil scholars from 19th century   
giving as many of them as possible, with possible mentions about the   
poets. One Kalamegam is a great poet, who lived in Srirangam, in   
Tamil Nadu. He was a Saivite but had no disrespect for Vishnu and he treated  
them as one. He was eking his livelihood as a cook in   
Srirangam temple. One day, when he went to Arunachala, he sang a song in the  
shrine of Arunachaleswara, calling Him a great trickster.   
He asks in the poem: O Arunachala! A portion of cooked human flesh is in the pot.   
Another portion is on your leaf. A few bits are still there in the spadle.  
How come the boy, came in fully and alive, when you   
called him? What a great trickster are you!   
The allusion is to the story of Siruthondar, one of the 63 Siva Saints. Siva  
went to him as an old brahmin ascetic and asked for cooked human flesh. He  
styled himself as Kabaliga and wanted human meat. Siruthondar cut his son and  
his faithful wife cooked it and served Siva. When Siva called for his son, O  
Seerala! (it is his name), the boy came running from the backyard!   
There are hundreds of such verses. But only some of them are translatable,  
because in many verses, there are pun on the same word in Tamil. I shall try  
to post some.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Curiosity and Spirituality

Curiosity has been a major driving force in human life.   
If necessity has been the mother of inventions, curiosity has been the source  
of many ventures and explorations of mankind.   
Man has explored the outer space, the moon and the depths of the sea.   
Curiosity to know the unknown makes the explorer trod the unknown path.   
So is it not natural that some persons should be curious to know the inner  
world?   
As the outer world has always been open to man for exploration, the gates of  
the inner world also stands open to him.   
The explorations of the outer world endows man with a sense of connectedness  
with the world.   
The discoveries of the inner world endows man with a more fundamental  
knowledge, the knowledge of his being; which is the source of peace and a more  
fundamental sense of connectedness.   
Therefore, if the energy of curiosity is channelled towards the inner search,  
with great patience, and with great faith, the inner core is bound to be  
revealed more and more. .. for is it not common sense that when a person  
sincerely pursues a goal, he is bound to make some progress.   
In spiritual life, even a little progress can give satisfaction which can  
outweigh major worldly achievements.   
Bhagavan has given a concise technique for self-exploration and his life  
stands proof of what possibilities lie within man.   
Om Namah Shiva

Dear silentgreen, munagala,   
I feel that curiosity, thirst, desire -- all mean the same urge to   
know the inner Being. The only difference could be that the Inner   
Being is always known and not unknown as the outer world, like   
moon's surface, ocean's depths and galaxy's distances and size.   
What is to be done is to remove the unknown viz., vagaries of   
ego's play and mischief.   
Arunachala Siva.

Very true,   
I would like to add further that its not even to know the inner being, but to  
become one with that - what IS. It is something to dispelled which is not  
there. Like the Darkness cannot be destroyed for its not there, when the Sun  
rises the darkness dispelled.   
There is one Suktam in Rig Veda - Nasadiya Suktam whicl elaborates on the  
creation of the world. It goes like this: At first there was neither being or Non being, there was not air, sky, water  
or fire, no death or deathlessness, neither day nor night, the one breathed  
without breath by its own impulse. There was darkness all wrapped around by  
darkness, all was water.   
Then that - what Was - IS, out of its own impulse, Love arouse which was the  
primal germ cell of the mind discovered the connection of being in Non Being.  
Even the Gods came after its emergence, who can tell from whence is its  
emergence?   
Its out of Its own love it have emerged. That being emerged out of its own Non  
Being again to merge back to the same. This process of that being merging back  
to itself is all we are.   
Its very profound with deep meanings, even grasping this suktam is quite  
difficult.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Yes. Many Hindu scriptures have the same idea, expressed in   
different ways. In Abhirami Andati, Abhirami Bhattar says: "She is One. She bloomed as many. She is all over the world.   
She is there, even after the worlds have gone..But she is ever   
in my Heart always shining, without break. She is known only   
to Vishnu who sleeps on leaf of the peepul tree and my Master,   
(Siva)..." In Keno Upanishad, Uma tells devas, "Even a bit of   
dust cannot move with out me."   
Arunachala Siva.
