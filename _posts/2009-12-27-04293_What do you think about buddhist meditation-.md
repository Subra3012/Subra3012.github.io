## The Truth

In the West religion becomes fuzzy, a grey-area, a cloudy mystery. Like "oh  
ok, religion looks nice for you - I can see it makes you feel good - but it is  
not for me", or "Oh yes, well he was talking about Truth - it's a metaphor for  
... ".   
No. It is no metaphor. The Truth is the Truth. It is the Truth of your  
existence, it is the Truth of all existence, and when you see it you will see  
it within you not somewhere else. It is not that you look over Buddha's  
shoulder and say "oh I see what you are playing with". No. You will see it  
within you and know that it is the Truth.   
It is literally the Truth. Literally. There is nothing further, and you will  
know it to be so whe you see it within you.

Only the Atma is the Truth. The world, individual souls, personal   
gods are all imaginations. Truth has to be investigated by the   
seeker only. No books will help. No Guru will help. They will   
at best show the Way. You have to reach the Goal through that   
way, the way that you love most, and reach the Goal. Again,   
reaching the Goal does not bring about a halo around your face.   
You are what you are, but in Peace, the Peace that passeth understanding.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear rideforever,   
I have said today in another post, desiring the Self is the only   
vasana that one can have. Bhagavan has said this. For desiring   
the Self, if one goes to a Guru or read His teachings, then it   
becomes auxillary to that desiring of the Self. These are all   
done by Suddha Manas, or Pure Mind, which do not cultivate   
prarabdha effect.   
Arunachala Siva.
