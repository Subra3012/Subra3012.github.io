**If u lose your mobile in India, you can get it back.**   
 Got an interesting fact to share..   
 Nowadays each one of us   
 carries very high end or latest   
 Mobile devices which always   
 Fears that it may be stolen.   
 **Each mobile carries a unique   
 IMEI no. i.e. International Mobile Equipment Identity** No which   
 can be used to track your   
 mobile anywhere in the world.   
 This is how it works!!**   
 1\. Dial *#06# from your mobile.   
 2\. Your mobile shows a unique   
 15 digit.   
 3\. Note down this no anywhere   
 But except in your mobile as   
 this is the Number which will   
 help trace your mobile in   
 Case of a theft.   
 4\. Once stolen you just have to   
 E-mail this 15 digit IMEI No.   
 to cop@vsnl.net with detail   
 Mentioned below.   
 Your name:____________________   
 Address:______________________   
 Phone model:_________________   
 Make:_________________________   
 Last used No.:_________________   
 E-mail for communication:_____   
 Missed date:___________________   
 IMEI No :_______________________   
 5\. No need to go to the   
 police.   
 6\. Your Mobile will be traced   
 within next 24 hrs via a   
 complex system of GPRS   
 and internet, You will find   
 where your hand set is   
 being operated even in   
 case your No. is being   
 changed.

Obsessive thinking and desiring heaps suffering upon suffering.   
Sri Ramana Maharshi advises, " _Who am I_?"   
At this thinking and desiring subside.   
And what always is, remains.

"me!", what is that?   
body never claims it   
the mouth moves,   
but only at the behest of thoughts   
and the "me" thought comes and goes   
can what comes and goes be "me"?   
Sri Ramana Maharshi advises,   
 _" Reality is simply the loss of the ego. Destroy the ego **by seeking its  
identity** "._   
......"me!", what is that?

We read, we write, we debate   
So much effort, so much striving, so much struggle   
The Great Ramana Maharshi says just **_Be Still_**   
.....that is all!

~ R.Adams   
 _Know the pure state, your own real nature, by keenly observing the interval  
between two thoughts.   
All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind  
quiescent; therefore their   
conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent.....   
_~ Ramana Maharshi

The imagined ego is pained by betrayal   
The Great Ramana Maharshi reminds us   
That paying attention to the faults of others   
Serves to further defile the mind   
Instead, He encourages us to find the Source   
Of the "I" that perceives betrayal   
And Abide there   
 _(verse 788, pg.342 GVK, Godman 's compilation)_

Nisargadatta: The Self is near and the way to it is easy. _All you need do is  
do nothing_.   
Q: Yet I found my sadhana very difficult.   
Nisargadatta: Your sadhana is _to be_. The doing happens. Just be watchful.  
Where is the difficulty in remembering that you are? You are all the time.   
beautiful isnt it

**_Visitor: Maharaj had worshipped Ishwara.   
M: What is Ishwara? My Guru told me that the one who is listening is Ishwara  
itself.   
The 'I am' is Ishwara, there are various names given to that 'I am'   
but that 'I am' is not your body.   
Your knowledge 'I am' contains the whole universe,   
presently it is difficult for you to believe, so for the moment worship it.   
Beingness contains everything, worship that and all your requirements will be  
met.   
Ultimately the knowledge is yours.

yes, "i am".......or maybe just _amness_   
.....and likely not even that

_For those who haven 't encountered Tinnai Swami._   
......he one day approached Sri Bhagavan and asked permission to leave for  
Pondicherry to apply for a job, to which Sri Bhagavan replied, 'Iru'. Iru is a  
Tamil word that literally means 'Be', but in such a context it would normally  
be taken to mean 'Stay' or 'Wait'. Though it was unusual for Sri Bhagavan to  
tell someone to stay when they asked permission to leave, most devotees who  
were present at that time probably took little notice of it. However, one of  
those present was Sri Muruganar, and he was able to understand the great power  
of that single word uttered by Sri Bhagavan and the profound impact it had  
upon Sri Tinnai Swami.   
Sri Tinnai Swami obeyed both the colloquial and the literal meaning of the  
word 'iru' uttered by Sri Bhagavan. From that moment, he never left  
Tiruvannamalai, and he also remained fixed firmly in the eternal state of  
Self-abidance.   
Sri Tinnai Swami's inward transformation was reflected in a complete  
transformation in his outward life. From that day on his outward behaviour was  
changed radically. He seldom spoke, and when he did his words were usually  
enigmatic, often allegorical, and at times even appeared quite meaningless. He  
neglected his appearance, allowing his hair to grow long and matted, and he  
lived by begging his food, usually just one meal a day, and sometimes not even  
that. He was known sometimes to remain so absorbed in his inward state that  
for several days he did not stir outwardly even to eat or fulfill any other  
bodily function.

_When one scrutinizes the form of the mind without forgetfulness [it will be  
found that] there is no such thing as mind;   
this is the direct path for all._
