karunanidhi.htm   
Loyalty to the leader of a political party knows no bounds, going by what a  
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam activist has done -- he is building a temple in  
honour of party president and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi, a self-  
proclaimed atheist.   
"The temple is almost in the finishing stages in 5 cents of land I own at  
Samireddipalli near Gudiyatham (Vellore district) at a cost of about Rs 2  
lakh", District panchayat Councellor G R Krishnamoorthy, the man behind it,  
said.   
He said the temple, with a two-and-a-half foot idol of 'Kalaignar' would be  
opened to the public soon after laying of tiles was completed.   
Krishnamoorthy said he was inspired to build the temple after seeing how  
welfare schemes brought out by his leader, especially 'Kalaingar Kappitu  
Thitam (free insurance scheme for poor) had helped many downtrodden families  
in his area.   
"All those who benefited from this scheme suggested I construct a temple for  
Kalaignar (Karunanidhi), prompting me to undertake the task," he said.   
"Though our leader is an atheist, we accept him as our 'God' as he has saved  
the lives of thousands of poor, not only from my region but also throughout  
the state through the free insurance scheme," he said.   
"It (temple) has been constructed for us to worship him. I don't think our  
thaliavar (leader) will oppose to it", he replied when asked if the chief  
minister would oppose his move.   
He said the temple has huge pillars with photographs of Deputy Chief Minister  
M K Stalin and state Law Minister Durai Murugan.   
"Apart from this, a small park is also being set up near the temple for  
children", he said, adding, he also plans to set up a library to showcase  
Karunanidhi's literary work in Tamil.   
He said the temple, with the symbol of the rising sun (DMK party symbol), has  
an inscription saying "Kettal kudupathu Kadavul, ketkamale kudukkum Kadavul  
Thamizhina Thalaivar Kalaignar (God will give only if you ask, but Kalaignar  
will give you without being asked)".

Dear prasanth,   
Tamizh Nadu is famous for all counter cultures. There have   
been already stone images for Karunanidhi, Annadurai, MGR   
Periyar Ramasamy, and even Kamaraj. No wonder they are now   
constructing a Temple for Karunanidhi.   
Earlier before DMK/AIADMK came to power, there was only   
some stone images for great people like Mahatma Gandhi,   
U.V. Swaminatha Iyer [in the compound of Madras Presidency   
College] and Dr. Rangachari [in the compound of Madras General Hospital].  
Then came about 10 or 12 statues for Kannagi, [who   
knows how she looked? She had lived in 4th Century AD!],   
Avvaiyar [ no one knows her date], Tiruvalluvar [3rd Century AD],   
and a few others. Then came plethora of statues. When you   
travel by car from Bangalore to Chennai en route Tamizh Nadu,   
[i.e Krishnagiri, Vellore, Kanchipuram] you can count easily 200   
statues! For the cinema actress Kushboo, I am told there is a   
private temple. Long live Tamizh Culture. Pujas are performed   
in the cemetry of MGR and Annadurai, in Marina Beach, and camphors are burnt.  
Some knowledgeable Tamizhians give a tonsure to their children, near these  
cemetries!   
One Tamizh new wave poet wrote a haiku: "In Marina beach,   
[where there are 10 or 12 statues], we have built latrines for   
the crows!"   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
As guru ramana says The attempts of so-called social reformers, to do away  
with such classes or divisions as varnasrama has created, have not succeeded.   
 **The only solution is for each man to realise his true nature.**   
Irrespective of how many number of people like Periyar Ramasamy.. come and go  
our scriptures stand rock solid.   
Even i heard some people built temple for film actress Kushboo and again  
destroyed it?   
Anyhow when i heard this news i thought people involved in this great venture  
are mad people

In every big temples, they have installed Periyar's statue in front of Sri  
Rangam, and many other temples, obvious of its intention of spreading hatred   
I heard something about what happened in Tirupati temple by a leading recent  
politician of AP which I don't want to write here. Its shocking...

Dear Nagraj Garu,   
Andhra Pradesh is famous for its dowry business in marraiges and the  
politician you are speaking might be Adi kesava naidu.   
He is into liquor business and wonder how he was appointed in major post in  
tirumala.   
There are many controversies in tirumala now and better not to talk about them  
sir.   
I think we(A.P people) need to learn a lot from Tamil people and kannadigas in  
many ways.

Dear prasanth,   
If you dig into the 'personality' of many famous people in India today, you  
will find that there are "skeletons in the cupboard." When I was in  
Hyderabad during the famous high strung Telengana agitation, in December 2009,  
one gentleman said something shocking about the man (I forgot his name) who  
was fasting and was near death. He said that he would address people in the  
meetings with foul language (all expletives...) and without consuming one  
bottle of liquor, he would not even start the speech. Now along with  
politicians, cinema artists, some 'gurus' have also joined the list.   
Arunachala Siva.

HaHaHa   
Subramanian garu, the politician's name is k.C.R.   
When i was studying my Msc in chennai during 2001-2003 i used to stay in  
outskirts of chennai called kelambakkam and people used to tell me many  
stories regarding karunanidhi son Stalin which were shocking.   
What to do sir as guru ramana says better we not involve in correcting few  
persons which is not worth.   
When gandhiji has died and few disturbances were happening in arunachalam it  
seems bhagavan was busy correcting proof of some devotional book.   
So this tells the story that there is no use trying to reform few persons in  
our society but rather complete our business in this world i.e purpose why we  
came here.

Dear prasanth,   
Mr. Karunanidhi's another son is Mr. Azhagiri. He is staying Madurai.   
He is known for his not palatable activities. Ms. Jayalalitha says   
Mr. Azhagiri has murdered at least a dozen people. This gentleman   
was given a ticket in the recent parliamentary elections and has the   
won the seat. Mr. Karunanidhi made him a Minister in the Union   
Government. There are only a few MPs in the history of post Independent India  
who have been made a Minister. This gentleman   
is yet to speak one sentence in the parliament! Just because Mr.   
Azhagiri has been made a Union Minister, the other son, Mr. Stalin   
became angry. So Mr. Karunanidhi has made him the Deputy   
Chief Minister of Tamizh Nadu. Another daughter of Mr. Karunanidhi has been a  
Member of Rajya Sabha, she is Ms. Kanimozhi.   
Arunachala Siva.
