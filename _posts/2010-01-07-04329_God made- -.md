Sri Ramakrishna once asked M: What do you think of me?   
M said: Sir, God has made you with His own hands. God has made others with  
machines.   
Sri Ramakrishna laughed.   
(M. is the author of the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)

Bhagavan Ramana was as usual sitting on His sofa. The office   
people had brought a table fan, since it was very hot in that summer. The  
table fan was making a lot of noise and it often   
also got stuck. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Why this fan should be   
here? I have no work. I have got a hand fan and that is adequate   
for me. The table fan is making "more speeches ' than me. Please take it to  
the office. In fact, they need the table fan because they   
work hard!"   
Arunachala Siva.
