**An aid to self-enquiry**   
Practice of self-enquiry becomes more and more natural with regular practice.   
However if there be a day when the mind is a bit restless,   
or otherwise we want to try: Look at the eyes of Bhagavan and enquire within (by self-attention) : Where do Bhagavan's eyes point to?

Dear silentgreen,   
Welcome to Forum.   
Bhagavan's ardent devotees have said many things to focus the   
attention for quelling the mind from other thoughts. I would   
suggest the following: 1. Bhagavan Ramana's photograph, particularly the one taken in   
Virupaksha Cave at the age of 21. Look at His eyes. Whereever   
you stand in front of Him, His eyes will look at you! This is the   
wonder.   
2\. Any holy names prescribed by Bhagavan with full contemplation   
on Him. Siva, Siva or Arunachala Siva...   
3\. Reading WHO AM I? a few times, contemplating on Him. Reading   
every sentence slowly.   
4\. Thinking of Arunachala Hill.   
5\. Thinking of Arunachaleswara, the Siva Linga, short and majestic. My wife  
used to call him The Little Father!   
Arunachala Siva.

Very true.   
The rays of the Self are reflected through the eyes of the sages.
