## Vijnana

What is vijnana? It is knowing God in a special way. The awareness and  
conviction that fire exists in wood is jnana (knowledge). But to cook rice on  
that fire, eat the rice and get nourishment from it is vijnana. To know by  
one's inner experience that God alone exist is jnana. But to talk to Him, to  
enjoy Him as child, as friend, as master, as beloved is vijnana. The  
realization that God alone has become the universe and all living beings is  
vijnana.   
\- Sri Ramakrishna   
... the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness. They take the waking  
state to be real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a  
dream. They say that the universe is a manifestation of God's power and glory.  
God has created all these - sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, oceans, men,  
animals. They constitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts. Again, He  
is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He himself has become all this  
...   
\- Sri Ramakrishna

To see everything as Brahman or God or Aruanachalam is what   
Bhagavan Ramana speaks about in Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam   
Verse 5. The world is unreal, from this point if one attains the   
godhead or self realization, then the world is as real as Brahma   
Swarupa.   
Brahman is Real   
The World is Mithya (seemingly unreal or seemingly real)   
Brahman is the world.   
 \- Gaudapada and Sankara.   
Arunachala Siva.

The standard example in scriptures says   
All this is born of Brahman   
and   
Brahman Alone IS!   
Its like saying The ghost is born of the post   
and the post alone IS.   
what it means is the post Alone Is, Ghost is an imagination.   
the moving jagat, is unreal and is imagination of mind!   
No one can find liberation without understanding that the world is unreal...  
Coz Even Yoga Vasishta mentions this. Only, he Bhakta sees it as illusion  
created by God. A Jnani does not bother. .. coz he does not care how its  
created, its illusion means, its not created. .. so a jnani rejects the  
creator as well as mithya... in the ultimate essence.   
But as long as dehabhimana is, God is to be surrendered to. when the surrender  
is complete, it hardly matters.   
Love!   
Silence

The jnani gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating,  
Not this, not this. Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching  
the roof of a house by leaving the steps, one by one. But the vijnani, who is  
more intimately acquainted with Brahman, realizes something more. The vijnani  
realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof: bricks,  
lime and brick-dust. That which is intuitively realized as Brahman, through  
the eliminating process of Not this, not this, is then found to have become  
the universe and all its living beings. The vijnani sees that the Reality  
Which is nirguna, without attributes, is also saguna, with attributes.   
\-- Sri Ramakrishna   
But vijnana means knowledge with a greater fullness. Some have heard of milk,  
some have seen milk, and some have drunk milk. He who has merely heard of it  
is ignorant. One who has seen it is a Jnani. But he who has drunk it has  
vijnana, that is to say, a full knowledge of it. After having the vision of  
God one talks to him as if He were an intimate relative. That is vijnana.   
\-- Sri Ramakrishna

Narayana-seva, relief works and other social services are ideally based on the  
concept of vijnana. One rejoices "feeling" the divine inside and does seva  
"feeling" the same divine in all. One even handles the inanimate objects with  
care.

Dear silentgreen,   
Narayana Seva or Maheswara Puja (as Saivites call it) mean   
only giving food, clothing and shelter to the needy and if possible, the  
medicines for the sick. These come under dharmas. Kamakshi   
in Kanchipuram is said to have done 32 types of dharmas to get   
the appreciation of Siva for obtaining half-his-body and remain   
as concorpoate in Arunachala.   
But I think "social reforms" are different. Like removing casteism,   
untouchabilty, widow-remarriage in India, etc., etc., Bhagavan   
Ramana and Kanchi Chandrasekara to my knowledge, never   
went for any social reforms as such.   
Arunachala Siva.

By Narayana Seva or social service I did not mean ordinary charity.   
I meant to serve others in the spirit of serving Narayana Himself as told by  
Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda.   
The spirit of work is the factor that is important.   
This can make a children's service to parents a Narayana Seva or a worker's  
work in office Narayana Seva.   
Similarly by social work I did not mean social reforms but to perform one's  
duties as Narayana Seva.
