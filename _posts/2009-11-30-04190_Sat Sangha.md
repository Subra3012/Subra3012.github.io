## Sivananda Lahari - Verse 23  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 28, 2009, 07:04:06 AM  
---  
Sivananada Lahari Verse 23 describes the glory of Arunachala.   
This is one of the ten verses selected by Bhagavan Ramana for   
praying to Siva. Sri Sankara says: "O the all pervading one! I do pooja to you everyday. One day   
you shall appear before me and give me the bliss. What can   
I ask? If I ask for Brahma's post or Vishnu's post, I have to   
take birth as a swan and a boar to do puja to your face and   
feet. I cannot bear with us torturous efforts. You appear   
before me and give me the eternal bliss of resting at your feet   
ever. O the God taking care of the welfare of every devotee,   
please grace me."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kumara Guruparar  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 28, 2009, 06:58:41 AM  
---  
Kumara Guruparar was an ardent Siva devotee. He was born   
as dumb. In his fifth year, his parents took him to Tiruchendur   
Murugan Temple. There with the grace of Muruga, he started   
speaking. He composed the famous Skandar Kali Venba, a long   
poem euologizing Muruga's grace. When later when he went to   
Madurai Meenakshi Temple, the goddess, came as a young girl and gave him a  
pearl necklace, She asked him to sing her glory. He   
wrote the Meenakshi Amman Pillai Tamizh. Pillai in Tamil means   
a young one. It is a song, usually of 10 decads, describing the   
child's growth till it stands on its leg. That is from 3 months to   
2 years. Kumaraguruparar sang such a song on Madurai Meenakshi. In this poem,  
he says that Meenakshi's tresses are like a large   
creeper flower plant. All poets who are bees hum around the   
long tresses of Meenkashi, humming its glory.   
The famous Skandar Kali Venba is even today sung by many   
mothers whose children do not learn speaking early.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sri Arunachaleswarar Kartikai Festival  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 29, 2009, 09:59:00 AM  
---  
Sri Arunachaleswara Temple's Kartikai festival started during last   
week. On the 5th day, that is on 26th instant, there was procession in  
Rishabha Vahana. Mother Unnamulai and Father Arunachaleswara   
mounted on a big silver bull, comes out of the temple for procession.   
There is a video clipping for about 4 mintues in the official website   
of the Asramam. The picture is fantastic. The bull is really big   
and the cute little Mother and cute little Father are seated majestically.  
The vahanam should be really heavy and I see from   
the video, scores of people lifting it and bring it outside the temple,   
by climbing a few steps with hard work and extreme care.   
Nandanar in Periya Puranam says "Ayya, malai pol paduthirukku   
our madu." "O Lord, there is a mountain like bull sitting before   
your form." It is really a big bull. In Bangalore, Mysore and   
Thanjavur there are huge bills. And Thanjavur Bull, I am told   
is carved out of a single stone.   
On the 6th Day, that is on 27th instant, there was a procession   
of Arunachaleswara, Apeetkuchambal and sixty three saints,   
on silver car, smaller ones. This 63rd Saints Festival is quite   
famous in Mylapore, Chennai. There is no video on this from   
the offical website of Sri Ramanasramam.   
On the 7th Day, that is on 28th instant, there were Panchamurti Mara Rathams.  
That is Arunachleswara, Apeetakuchambal, Vinayaka, Skanda, and Chandikeswara,  
were coming huge   
wooden cars, the Father's car being the largest. It was moving   
slowly with hundreds of people pulling it with a pair of ropes,   
crying Annamalaikku Arohara, Annamalaikku Arohara.... Victory   
to Annamalai, Victory to Annamalai. Vinayaka first came, then Siva and then  
the Mother, followed by Skanda, and Chandikeswra, the   
guardian angel of Siva's temples. There is a four minute Asramam video  
clipping on this.   
Once on the Wedding day of Arunachala and Unnamulai, devotees of Bhagavan from  
the Asramam, went out to see the functions and returned telling the  
descriptions to Bhagavan. They also brought with them vibhuti and kumkum.  
Bhagavan Ramana applied them on His forehead and said with great joy: Today  
is the wedding of My Mother with My Father! This is in month of Phalgun,  
Uttara star day.   
(March-April).   
Today is Arunachaleswra's royal visit to the streets, called Veedhi   
Ula, in Tamil.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sat Sangha  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 30, 2009, 10:16:43 AM  
---  
Sat Sangha: Once a person (who later joined RK Mission) went to Ramana Ashrama for having  
darshan of the Maharshi and also asking some questions on advaita. Bhagavan  
was reclining on the couch and devotees were meditating in that profound  
silence. He also started meditating with the others. During the course of  
meditation, the questions rose from within one by one and the answers were  
received. When he opened his eyes, he saw that Bhagavan was looking at him and  
smiling.   
This has resemblance to the following story of Dakshinamurthy: The four sons, of Brahma, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanat Kumara did  
austere tapas and analysis, but they were unclear of the Supreme Truth. They  
finally decided to come to Lord Shiva to get the knowledge of the Truth. The  
Lord sat under the banyan tree, and the four sages also sat down around Him.  
Lord stayed in the yoga posture without saying a single word. The four sages  
got all their doubts cleared just by that posture. The form in which God  
appeared as a Supreme Guide is the form of wisdom, Dakshinamurti.   
Such can be the effect of Sat Sangha.   
No book can replace the experiences of the magnetic field of the sages.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. No books can give us self knowledge as a Jnana Guru's   
silent gazing does.   
This incidentally gives some answers to srkudai's post on Sakshu   
Diksha.   
Many saint poets used to address Siva as Eye. It is nothing but   
seeking Siva's gaze. Muruganar has sung a decad titled Tiru KaN   
Nokkam, in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai, describing Bhagavan's   
powerful eyes. The eyes of the Guru looks at your eyes and then   
enters the mind to cleanse it up. The gaze is a long cleaning duster, like we  
use in our homes, but more powerful and potent.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is another incident: ...   
Later that evening in the Old Hall I sat at the feet of the Maharshi. He was  
reclining on the couch gazing westward and I sat on the floor facing him. Our  
eyes fixed, one upon the other, were pinned together for quite a long time. I  
then saw the form of the Maharshi take the shape of Ardhanareswara.   
Ardhanareswara is one aspect of Shiva  one half is the Mother and the other  
half is the Father; one half of the form had a breast and the other had a  
trident. Around us the pundits were reciting Sanskrit verses.   
As it went on, I began to witness certain changes in my body taking place. I  
saw a pair of serpents rising from the base of my spine in a crisscross,  
spiralling manner. They rose to the crown of my head and spread their hoods.  
One was red; the other blue. The whole cranium became suffused with a bright  
light. My attention was fixed upon the point between my eyebrows where the  
serpents heads were pointed.   
All of a sudden there was a splitting of the skull from the top front to the  
back. This was followed by an upward gush of a reddish flame shooting out from  
the top of my head. While this was flowing out, a stream of nectar issued from  
the single breast of the Ardhanareswara form of the Maharshi and a second  
stream of nectar flowed out from the top of Arunachala. Both streams landed on  
my head and sealed the break in my skull.   
When the skull was sealed I experienced a brilliant light, like that of an arc  
lamp, and an indescribable joy and coolness filled my being. This light and  
joy continued for several hours. During this time I didnt move about and I  
was unconscious of what was going on around me. You may have seen a light  
focused on to a concave mirror. Its light is reflected with a single beam onto  
a point. Well, sometime about midnight all the light, like a concave mirror,  
was focussed onto the Heart. Then all the light drained into the Heart. The  
Kundalini was completely sucked into the Heart and the Heart was opened  that  
is the seat of Arunachala Ramana.   
The Heart is normally closed, but when it was opened  I never knew any of  
these things and never read any theory. These are all practical experiences   
a flood of nectar gushed forth and drenched every pore of my skin, drenched my  
whole physical system. It poured out, went on coming out in a great flood. The  
whole Universe was filled with that Nectar.   
The wonder of it was that my awareness was not in the body  my awareness was  
over the whole of the space filled with that Nectar. The whole Universe was  
Nectar. I call it Nectar; you could call it Ether, something very subtle,  
attached with awareness at every point. And everything living and non-living  
was like snow flakes floating in that ocean of Nectar.   
If you ask me what my body was, my body was the whole universe of Nectar,  
attached to awareness at every point. No particular association from the one  
body from where it started  this body was like every other body.   
By morning everything subsided, though the underlying experience remained. I  
was totally unconscious of my body. I was moving around like an automaton,  
unaware of my body. In that state I returned to Madurai where I was a physics  
professor.

Self Knowledge is not a particular experience of Bliss.   
Self Knowledge is Experience of Bliss in and through all Experiences!!   
Coz Self Knowledge is essentially to know I AM BLISS!   
unfortunately when a person experiences such bliss. .. he is left longing for  
more such experiences   
which means he has not yet "Got" it that He IS THE BLISS!   
its like Truely Seeing God is seeing Him in and through all Experiences. not

Dear nonduel,   
Bhagavan Himself has said: Where can I go? I am here.   
His body was there upto the completion of "avatara karyam"   
-work allotted for the reincarnation. Once that is over, He   
doest the job through the power of the Presence.

Dear nonduel,   
Bhagavan Himself has said: Where can I go? I am here.   
His body was there upto the completion of "avatara karyam"   
-work allotted for the reincarnation. Once that is over, He   
doest the job through the power of the Presence.   
Arunachala Siva.
