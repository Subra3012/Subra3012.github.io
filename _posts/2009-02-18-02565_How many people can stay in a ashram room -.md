## Self Enquiry  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 18, 2009, 02:29:52 PM

Sometimes I feel I should sit and spend long time in Self-Enquiry and for me  
my mind is most quiet only at the night time. I have a desire to spend the  
entire night in Self Enquiry.   
I have some questions: Should I continue the enquiry in spite of restlessness,  
sleep? I know it is going to be a solid effort for beginners in deep and long  
meditation. One had I feel I should try and conquer all obstacles and continue  
and at the same time there is another thought to not strain oneself and  
continue.   
Has Bhagwan told some thing in such context?   
SatGuru Paahi Paahi

Dear Sambu,   
Bhagwans teaching will some how answer any question. Basically what I  
understand through Bhagwans answer is to go ahead with meditation and let what  
ever happen, happen, if I fall asleep, my mind would continue with Self  
Enquiry as soon as I wake up. It should also mean that as long as I am aware  
about my state, i.e. when I am sleepy, I need to put a check there and just  
turn my attention back to Self Enquiry.   
At the moment when we try to turn the attention back to Self Enquiry, we will  
certainly face a lot of hurdles, the body will be demanding to go flat and  
sleep. Probably I need to try once and see what happens.   
Food regulation and minimal work is something I need to work out.   
Prostrations to Bhagwan

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Bhagavan Ramana has also said that for beginners, a specific allotted   
time for meditation/self enquiry, would be ideal. In due course, one   
can increase this time, depending upon his other duties. In due course, it  
will be continuing meditation, like the montone of thambur in Karnatic music.  
It will be there, amongst all the din and sound.   
As regards sleep, as Munagala mentioned, you can do meditation/   
self enquiry, till you actually fall asleep. And start again, when you wake  
up. Reducing the sleeping hours is also recommended, if you can go with  
lesser hours of sleep, subject to your age, health and daily work.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian,   
By the grace of Bhagwan, I will initially start meditating for fixed period of  
time and also work out on my food and sleep. I can only writ about it further  
after few days of actually doing meditation.

Tamas guna is dominant at night.   
Tamasic dullness is easily mistaken as Sattvic quietness.   
So we have to check our mental mood carefully,   
whether it is quietness or dullness.   
Generally speaking, it is good to meditate in the morning and the evening   
when Sattva is dominant, in my opinion.

Dear Ganesh b01,   
What happened to you? Why did you not write anything after February 2009?   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the information, Subramanian.R   
Palakottu \- Just behind Mother's Temple. There is a small   
gate to enter the bushy forest area. After about 100 metres,   
you can see some cottages. This is where Annamalai Swami,   
Chadwick and other great men stayed. There is a Samadhi   
for Annamalai Swami.   
Guru Murtham - This is in Vetta Valam Road, about 3kms   
from Asramam inside the town. There is a Samadhi for   
Guru Jnana Desikar, with a Siva Lingam. Here Bhagavan   
and a few others stayed for 6 months, when there was   
no water in Virupakshi Cave area. There is a small temple,   
which is often closed. You have to check up with nearby   
houses. In one of the houses, there is a key, they will   
come and open the shrine. You can take some camphor   
and light it there. You may pay some amount for the house   
people since they invariably buy oil for the lamp.   
Isanya Math - This is on Giri Valam, main road. Towards   
the end, you have to take a deviation for about 200 mts.   
and you can see Isanya Desikar Math, which is managed   
by Kovilur Math. The trust member stays in the adjacent   
house, where there is a Veda Patasala. Here is where   
Isanya Jnana Desikar attained Samadhi. Bhagavan Ramana   
went for lunch one day, on the compulsion of the then Kovilur   
Math Head, who took him in a bullock cart, literally lifting   
Bhagavan up! Bhagavan Ramana went there, had a lunch   
and gave a small extempore discourse to students on Bhagavad Gita. He was  
hardly 25 at that time.   
Arunachala Siva.

I though putting this information in this thread will more useful for people  
seeking for a stay in the Ashram and thereby to visit these places where  
Bhagavan Ramana once visited and stayed.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
There are about 10 places all in Tiruvannamalai where   
Bhagavan Ramana stayed between a few hours to many   
days. These are apart from Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam. There is a  
small old Tamil book, with   
back ground stories about each place and the rough   
period during which Bhagavan Ramana stayed. Bhagavan   
never left Tiruvannamalai for 54 years! So all these places   
are either in town or in the Hill. I shall soon write about   
each one of them, Bhagavan willing.   
Arunachala Siva.

One more thing i forgot to mention of my journey to ashram,   
As the time was very short and not leave(office) i had to rush here and there  
and honestly, honestly speaking 'the food in the ashram' was all i could get.  
Next time I'm planing a three day visit exclusive to T.Malai and Ashram only.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
A three or four day visit makes you feel relaxed. You may   
visit the Big Temple [ 2 to 3 hours], sit in the Old Hall,   
[1/2 hour two or three times], attend to Parayana in the   
Samadhi Hall [ 1 hour, two days], visit Matrubhuteswara   
Temple [see Sri Dakshinamoorthy and Nataraja there relaxedly],   
visit Palakottu etc., [ 2 hours], Giri Pradakshina [ 4 to 5 hours],   
and Virupaksha Cave and Skandasramam [ 3 hours between   
themselves], browse in the book shop [ 1hour]. You can   
plan these things with proper spacing.   
Arunachala Siva.
