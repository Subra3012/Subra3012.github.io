**THE RAMAYANA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California,  
January 31, 1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses**   
Rama and Sita are the ideals of the Indian nation. All children, especially  
girls, worship Sita. **The height of a woman 's ambition is to be like Sita**,  
the pure, the devoted, the all-suffering! When you study these characters, you  
can at once find out how different is the ideal in India from that of the  
West. For the race, Sita stands as the ideal of suffering.   
**The West says, "Do! Show your power by doing." India says, "Show your power  
by suffering." The West has solved the problem of how much a man can have: India has solved the problem of how little a man can have. The two extremes,  
you see. **Sita is typical of India  the idealised India. The question is not  
whether she ever lived, whether the story is history or not, we know that the  
ideal is there. There is no other Paurânika story that has so permeated the  
whole nation, so entered into its very life, and has so tingled in every drop  
of blood of the race, as this ideal of Sita.   
Sita is the name in India for everything that is good, pure and holy   
everything that in woman we call womanly. If a priest has to bless a woman he  
says, "Be Sita!" If he blesses a child, he says "Be Sita!" They are all  
children of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the patient, the all-  
suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through all this suffering  
she experiences, there is not one harsh word against Rama. She takes it as her  
own duty, and performs her own part in it. Think of the terrible injustice of  
her being exiled to the forest! But Sita knows no bitterness. That is, again,  
the Indian ideal. Says the ancient Buddha, "When a man hurts you, and you turn  
back to hurt him, that would not cure the first injury; it would only create  
in the world one more wickedness." Sita was a true Indian by nature; she never  
returned injury.   
Who knows which is the truer ideal? The apparent power and strength, as held  
in the West, or the fortitude in suffering, of the East?   
 **The West says, "We minimise evil by conquering it." India says, "We destroy  
evil by suffering, until evil is nothing to us, it becomes positive  
enjoyment."** Well, both are great ideals. Who knows which will survive in the  
long run? Who knows which attitude will really most benefit humanity? Who  
knows which will disarm and conquer animality? Will it be suffering, or doing?

Suffering is the catalyst to speed up merger with God.   
Arunachala Siva.
