The Swamigal replied, 'The condition of this body is not good; all will be  
well soon and travel can be   
considered.' On hearing this Muthukrishna Naidu stepped outside wondering  
what could be the meaning   
of Swamigal's cryptic words. Sometime after, in Karthikai month, on the  
twelfth day, a Thursday, under   
the auspicious date of Swathi star, at ten a.m., Achuthanandar, sitting in the  
padmasana posture, asked   
all his disciples to keep looking at him. He then left the mortal coil and  
attained Videha Kaivalya, the state   
of total freedom.   
On seeing this all his disciples were shocked and stunned, but they soon  
recovered and thought about   
further action. They could not see any change in the condition of Swamigal's  
body and were unable to   
decide whether Adigalar was still alive in Nirvikalpa Samadhi or had attained  
Videha Kaivalyam, (had left   
the physical body).   
In the meantime, on hearing of Achutanandar's Videha Kaivalyam many people  
started arriving to pay   
homage to this Mahatma. Messages were sent to Kasthambadi and to all his  
disciples. The same evening,   
Swamigal's wife, many disciples from nearby places, and the relatives of  
Swamigal gathered in huge numbers   
to pay homage with a heavy heart. A few experienced disciples assured them  
that Swamigal had indeed   
entered Videha Kaivalyam.
