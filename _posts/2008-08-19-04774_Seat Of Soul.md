The Chapter VI continues....   
Verse 46:- Just as the conscious Jiva is created by illusion   
based on Kutastha, even so, on it the inanimate objects   
are created by Avidya or Maya.   
Verse 53:- The concealing of the real nature of the Self and   
the identity superimposition, are caused by nescience or   
Avidya or Maya, and they are destroyed when nescience,   
or Avidya or Maya is negated. But as long as the fructifying   
karma continues, the mind and body, the effects of illusory   
projection of nescience, continue.   
Verse 55:- According to the logicians, the cloth keeps its   
form for the next second -- the threads(its material cause)   
that last for a few days are destroyed. On the same reasoning,   
the body may persist for a proportionately long time, when the   
ignorance of countless ages is destroyed.   
(The lingering moment should be proportionate to the cause.   
There is also another illustration, the revolutions of the potter's   
wheel, which continue even after the cause, the rotating force   
is removed)   
Verse 57:- There is no use entering into a controversy with   
unreasonable logicians. The fact is that the difference between   
Jiva and Kutastha is caused by illusion.   
Verse 68:- The Sruti says that the mind is the cause of the bondage   
and the release of man and it speaks of the mind-sheath. Therefore,   
these people conclude that the mind is the Atman.   
Verse 71:- Since without the sense of egoity, it is not possible   
to cognize the outer world, it is clear that the idea of egoity is   
the cause of the mind and without it the cognizance of the   
external world is impossible.   
Verse 72:- As the "I-consciousness" appears and disappears   
every moment, the intellect sheath is transitory and it needs no   
further principle to illumine it.   
to be contd....   
Arunachala Siva.

When sun is rflected in pot containing water the relected sun appears to move  
when water within the pot is moved.   
Likewise when the light of the ultimate consciousness falls on the tendencies  
of Jiva,the reflected consciousness(chidabhasa) appears   
to move with the movement of tendencies..

Dear I,   
Bhagawan has said that the Self is th seat of the Ego/I/Thought/Mind. He has  
said that it is the centre of the Universe. It is neither here nor not here.  
Neither left nor right. Neither up nor down. It is everywhere and nowhere.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear soham3,   
For practisers, the Self is on the right side of the chest, two digits   
to the right of the midpoint. Many have asked whether it is Anahata.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "No. However, this could be as per   
kundalini yoga." Bhagavan Ramana also accepts the principle of   
dwadasantam, the space, twelve digits above the crown as the seat   
of final experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Far eastern thoughts place it at the intersection between the line from back-  
head to forehead & another line connecting tops of the 2 ears.   
I am from Far East, but have never heard of this.

Brahmandra is the concept of Raja yoga marga. Once when a devotee was  
sleeping   
in the Hall, and his head hung up, Bhagavan Ramana pointed out this to Nayana  
and   
said: See if Brahman is on the skull, how can it fall, when the body sleeps?   
Arunachala Siva.
