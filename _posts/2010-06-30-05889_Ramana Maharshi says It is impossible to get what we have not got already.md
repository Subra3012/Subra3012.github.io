16-9-45 Afternoon   
V: Visitor   
B: Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi   
V: All books say that the guidance of a Guru is necessary.   
B: The Guru will say only what I am saying now. He will not give you anything  
you have not already. **It is impossible for anyone to get what he has not got  
already. Even if he gets any such thing, it will go as it came.** What comes  
will also go. What always is will alone remain. The Guru cannot give you  
anything new, which you have not already. **Removal of the notion that we have  
not realised the Self is all that is required.** We are always the Self. Only,  
we dont realise it.

Dear prasanth,   
This is quite an interesting revelation from Bhagavan Ramana.   
We are born in the Self and what we acquire in this world, by   
way of objective experiences would never remain with us for   
ever. This is not only in Vedanta but also in the normal day to   
day life. We have seen cases of cine actors amassing huge wealth   
and losing them in their own lifetimes. Even in reading and learning   
it is true. Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: All that one has   
learnt, anew, has to be forgotten. Students read Computer Engineering and end  
up as IAS officers. In course of time, they   
forget all their computer knowledge unless they are in touch with   
the machines. I had a colleague, who joined my company but he   
was an Medical degree holder! For want of a suitable job, he joined our  
company which has nothing to do with medicine. After 10 years, he forgot most  
of what he had learnt. Only the Self within us remains for ever, since it is  
eternal and not acquired.   
Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman used to give a new example. The medical experts  
have now found out that only those ailments for   
which seeds are already in our body (genetic) while taking birth cannot be  
cured. All other ailments, acquired can be nullified!   
Arunachala Siva.
