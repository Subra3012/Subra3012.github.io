## Devotees in London  
Author: Paintbrush          Date: May 06, 2010, 03:00:08 PM

Hi,   
I have rarely visited group meditations, but had a powerful but grounded  
experience with family who attend a weekly session with a teacher in Mauritius  
(Yogi Tambe).   
Are there any groups in London that devotees of Bhagwan attend?   
Thanks   
PB
