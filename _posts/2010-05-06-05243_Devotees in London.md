the american zen master bernie glassman, started to conduct meditaiton retreat  
in ausschwitz, in the symbol here in europe that stand for systematic killing  
of hte own brother and sister...the film follows 5 participants inot this  
retreat experience....   
they are from different faiths, one woman is the daughter of a nazi, a  
catholic priest, a rabbi, a buddhist. its wonderfull to watch, maybe for me  
(Iam austrian, the birhtplace of hitler is 1 and a half h away from were Iam  
tiping this) it is much deeper to see, but anyway if oyu have time look at it  
it is for free...   
http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/2717/

good

## Devotees in London  
Author: Paintbrush          Date: May 06, 2010, 03:00:08 PM

Hi,   
I have rarely visited group meditations, but had a powerful but grounded  
experience with family who attend a weekly session with a teacher in Mauritius  
(Yogi Tambe).   
Are there any groups in London that devotees of Bhagwan attend?   
Thanks
