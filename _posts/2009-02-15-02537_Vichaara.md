## Vichaara  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 15, 2009, 06:38:14 PM

Hello,   
I have been Self-Enquiring mySelf for some time now. I feel I come to see many  
truths so far. I dont know in what state I am in now. I dont know if I want  
anything at all or I want something at all. I find myself in a position where  
I am not at all interested in any materialistic life. I quit a decent job a  
year back. I feel I am very confused and at the same time I feel I am not.  
Some sort of irritation exists constantly in me. I am not able to find the  
reason for that irritation. I tried to do find out the source of the  
irritation "Who am I" i.e. who is irritated etc... I am not able to proceed...  
That irritation becomes a barrier from here. I dont know if I have a question  
at all and at the same time I feel there is some question existing in me.  
Please I pray Bhagwan to show me a way out. Om Name Bhagawate Sri Ramanaaya.   
Thank you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Welcome to the Forum.   
1\. I do not know what made you to quit the job. Is it due to difficulties in  
the job or in the way of life that you had do, bluffing   
to seniors, calling those idiots as men of Solomonic wisdom, or   
bluffing to juniors to get work done, calling those cowards as men   
of Alexandrian bravery. I did all these. But I quit because of some   
other reasons. Bhagavan Ramana did not say any one to quit the job or family,  
unless their prarabdha worked that way.   
2\. Do not have any irritations. These come about from mostly outside. Try  
to bear them with grin. Put faith in Bhagavan Ramana. You can surrender to  
Him, at least partially, for removing the irritations and identity crisis and  
the sense of alienation. Try to attend satsanghs, if they are conducted  
nearby. Do not go for   
drugging for removing irritations or lack of sleep. Read Bhagavan   
Ramana's books.   
If you tell me, I can think of some other suggestions, Bhagavan willing.  
Wish you good luck.   
Arunachala Siva.

Pranam,   
Dear Ganesh_b01,   
If there is irritation, it means there is some subconscious desire or fear  
which is being suppressed and not allowed to come up. In such a case it is  
very necessary to be very true to yourself and confront the desire rather than  
suppress it. Once the desire is known, one can proceed from there. It is not  
wise to live in denial just because you have set a lofty goal for yourself.   
The enquiry "who am I" sometimes throws up a lot of things which have been  
suppressed or ignored for a long period of time. When such things come up it  
is best to deal with them firstly, by asking the question "for whom is this  
desire?" etc. If that approach does not work and the desire comes repeatedly  
it means that the desire is very strong and one has to consciously and with  
full attention just look at the desire. Do not be judgemental about yourself  
about having the desire and so on. Just be concious of that desire or fear. Do  
not go along with it or try to suppress it. Just be aware of it.   
The power of awareness is such that it will give the answer to the problem,  
where all other intellectual acrobatics have failed. But remember not to be  
judgemental or have preconceived notions about things in life. Sometimes the  
thing to be done could be totally the opposite of what you might have thought  
to be the right course of action. Just be patient and let go of all notions  
you hold on to, and let the answer reveal itself to you in full awareness.   
Om shri Ramana

Dear Subramanian,   
Thanks for your reply. Really I did not enjoy my job and I found it worthless,  
earning money became least important to me. I had good opportunities. As I did  
not enjoy the job, I truly felt that continuing the job would be doing  
injustice to the employer and mySelf. I would say that my that action as a  
Prarabdha. It just happenned that way. all of a sudden. However I am  
contemplating to start a small business to just make a living and to keep my  
family secured of me.   
Like you say, I try my best to bear with those irritations. I have faith in  
Bhagawan, I keep myself occupied by reading Bhagawans teachings through his  
books and his documentaries. It gives peace of mind. Its the only things that  
gives peace of mind. I just pray to him. I dont have any negative habits. My  
this state also gets my family also worried about me. They fear where I may go  
away as Sanyasi etc... Allthough I know in my deepest heart that I have a long  
way to still go. I believe one really doesnt need to take up sanyas to become  
a sanyasi. I would rather be here in midst of Life and lead a quiet life like  
Bhagwan says.   
I was fortunate enough to visit 3 times in January and did Girivalam. But now  
I think it will be difficult to visit Tiruvannamalai as my mother feels going  
there would be taking me away from her...   
I just pray Bhagwan to guide me. Thanks for your interest and response.   
Dear Disciple   
I agree with you, there is some subconscious desire or fear being suppressed  
and not allowed to come up. I just pray Bhagwan to give me strenght and guide  
me so as to over come it. I just have to be patient I guess bearing the  
irritations. The problem is that the Girn-ness is visible in my face and other  
feel insecured about that in my face. What more can I do than just remember  
Bhagwan. I dont know complete surrendering or have enough wisdom to overcome  
the obstacles within me. I just see nothing beyond the irritation, may be its  
void as I dont know to think beyond that. and hence that irritation stays in  
me...   
I just pray...   
Thanks for your interest and your response   
Thank you

Dear Disciple,   
I have a correction to make. - I always have some sadness or I am always quite  
in my face, I typed it as Grin-ness in my face by mistake.

dear Ganesh_b01,   
Yes, starting your own business in a small way, will ensure your occupation  
and also earn some money. You will be the King of all   
that you survey. Do not put all your savings on that business. Measure the  
depth, before you plunge. Keep family happy. Mother   
is the most important person in one's life. Surrender to Bhagavan   
Ramana and He will take care, as He is taking care of me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Upheavals in life are common and most people have to face it during one time  
or the other.   
During this time, the persons who are in a comparatively better state can give  
counsel; who may in turn require such counseling during their turn.   
When the mind no longer pursues material gains and flows towards the divine,  
the binding effect of the karma starts reducing and its freeing effect is  
felt. At this time work undertaken in a disciplined manner for the maintenance  
of the body and dependents, keeping the practice of self-enquiry alive may  
actually benefit oneself.   
The mind feels irritations, depressions etc, when it gets trapped, as it were,  
in the small, and loses its touch with the deeper self.   
This condition heals itself if this "knot" of the mind can melt itself in the  
expanse of the "vrihat".   
At this time, the vichara "To whom is this sorrow?" still remains one of the  
best way if through regular self-enquiry (previously) one has got access to  
one's deeper self, and one does self-enquiry correctly.   
For immediate relief, one may try to spend time in nature.   
One may also try singing one's favorite bhajans by clapping one's hands.   
Sri Ramakrishna said:  _As, at the clap of the hands, the birds in the tree fly away, so do our sins  
disappear at the chanting of God 's name and glories._   
And remember Bhagavan feeding birds and monkeys?   
Similarly one may try feeding animals (birds, stray dogs etc).

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
I am glad you are starting a small business and I wish you all the luck. The  
best course as you say is definitely praying to Bhagwan and asking for his  
grace.   
While doing business you will be interacting with many people and it is  
essential at that time to be happy and confident rather than sadness to show  
on your face.   
Whenever you feel sad just think of the calm and serene face of Bhagavan  
smiling back at you. This will definitely lift your mood and make you feel  
happy, carefree and confident.   
Om shri Ramana

Dear Disciple,   
Thanks so much for your wishes. Actually I got a b/w pocket size picture of  
Sri Ramana Maharshi today, one of my relative gave it to me. I was just beyond  
words. Its quite common to receive pictures of other Gods and other Gurus but  
to have got Sri Ramana Maharshi, I feel very much blessed. I feel happy to  
share this bit here in this forum.   
Sat Guru Paahi Paahi
