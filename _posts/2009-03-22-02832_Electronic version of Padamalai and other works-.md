I own Padamalai and many other books. However, it is my goal to eventually to  
be able to carry all of my books on my palmpilot or maybe a netbook. Does  
anyone know if there was ever an electronic version of Padamalai made  
available?

Dear Matthew,   
e-versions of Sri Ramanasramam books are not available. And so   
are David Godman's books. However, a small excerpt of some of   
these books can be seen in David Godman's blog.   
Arunachala Siva.
