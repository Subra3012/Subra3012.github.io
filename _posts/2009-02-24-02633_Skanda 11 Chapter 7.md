## Nayanmars  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 06:35:18 PM

There is no par to the devotion to the devotion shown by Nayanmars. Bhagawan  
Ramana used to have tears instantly when he used to read the glorious stories  
of the Nayanmars.   
 **PERUMIZHALAI KURUMBA NAYANAR**   
Guru is God. The same Lord Who is never separate from us, Who is our sustainer  
and   
support appears to us as the visible form of the Guru. He who adores the Guru  
with faith and   
devotion will attain all Siddhis (psychic powers) and eternal bliss.  
Perumizhalai Kurumba Nayanar   
excelled in Guru Bhakti. He was an ardent devotee of Lord Siva and Siva  
Bhaktas, too. He heard of   
Sundaramurthi Nayanars greatness and mentally accepted him as his Guru. To  
him, Sundarar was   
the sole refuge. He adored the Guru in thought, word and deed. By the Gurus  
grace, he attained all   
the Siddhis. He was immersed in Siva Bhakti and Guru Bhakti.   
In the meantime, Sundarar came to Tiruvanchaikalam from where he was taken to  
the   
Lords Abode. Kurumba Nayanar, through his Yogic powers, came to know that  
this would happen.   
He did not like to remain in this world after the Guru: and, therefore,  
through the method of Siva   
Yoga, Nayanar cast off his mortal coil and reached the Abode of Siva, a day  
before Sundarars   
departure.   
Salutations to the 63 Nayanmars

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
The stories of all the 63 Siva Saints are heart-melting. They belonged   
to different classes of social order at that time. A few were brahmins, a few  
were kings, a few were traders, and the rest   
were other classes. What bound them together was their love and   
devotion to Siva. Saint Manikkavachagar particularly refers to Kannappar, the  
hunter and Chandikeswara, the brahmin boy. Kannappar got liberation in six  
days. Bhagavan Ramana has wept while narrating the story of Kannappar.  
Chandikeswara, is the one   
who cut his father's legs because the father kicked the milk pot and the Siva  
linga. Siva came to Chandikeswara and says: "We are proud of your devotion.  
You come to our abode, and be the guard for my temple. The food that is  
submitted to me, the flowers that are adorned on me and the dress I am given  
to wear, will be shared with you! Chandikeswara was born on Seynjalur on the  
banks of Kaveri river. This place is famous on many counts. I shall write  
separately about this place.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
One cannot avoid but reading the stories of Nayanmars really touch the heart.  
No matter how many hardships one faces whole day if one reads these stories,  
they pacify the heart and calm down entire system. Breathing becomes very  
normal, a divine feeling arouses, the room vibrates with divine presence, you  
can feel the air touching your skin and communicating with you. We can  
hear/feel silence within us, all objects appear to be the residing place of  
Parameshwara.   
 **IDANGAZHI NAYANAR**   
This saint was the king of Velas in Kodumbalur. He was a staunch devotee of  
Lord Siva. He   
had made arrangements with all the Siva temples to perform worship according  
to the Siva Agamas.   
There was another Siva Bhakta in the same locality doing Maaheshwara Puja. He  
became very poor   
and so he could not continue his Puja and feeding of Bhaktas. So, one day he  
entered Idangazhi   
Nayanars granary at night and began to steal paddy. The watchman caught him  
red-handed and   
took him to the king. The king learnt on enquiry that the Siva Bhaktas motive  
for stealing was to   
feed the devotees of the Lord. The king let him go.   
This incident opened the eyes of the king. He realised that nothing belonged  
to him and that   
the real owners of his property were Lord Siva and His Bhaktas. So, he gave  
permission to all Siva   
Bhaktas to enter his palace and granary and take whatever they wanted. Thus he  
displayed his zeal   
for the spread of Saivism. Thus he earned Lord Sivas grace, too.   
Prostrations to the 63 Nayanmars and our Beloved Bhagawan.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
I read your story of Idangazhi Nayanar. With intense devotion and   
total surrender to Siva, any crime is pardonable. This is one of the   
underlying themes of Periya Puranam. Someone asked a discourser: How come, Chandikeswara's crime and sin of cutting his father's   
legs, get pardoned. The discourser then said what I mentioned above.  
Parasurama killed his mother, for the sake of his father.   
Narasimha killed Prahlada's father for the sake of Prahlada's devotion. Some  
of the Nayanmars have done such heroic deeds, though they may appear as  
crimes, for the sake of intense devotion to Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Today, It is Gods will that the story of Chadikeshwarar is posted. you have  
been writing about this great Nayanmar and also today in Shankara TV, a  
discourser gave a discourse on Chandikeshwarar. I began to read this great  
story, its very powerful - Ughram - devotion to Shiva.   
 **CHANDESVARA NAYANAR**   
Vichara Sarman (who was later known as Chandesvara Nayanar) was born in   
Tiruchaijnanallur, which was famous for Vedic recitations, Tapas, and Siva  
Bhakti. He was a   
prodigy. At the age of five he had learnt the Vedas, and all the Agamas, by  
himself, on account of   
previous Samskaras. After his Upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony), he learnt  
the Vedas, under a   
Guru: but the Gurus were wonder-struck at the intelligence of the disciple. He  
wanted to attain Final   
Emancipation in that birth.   
One day Vichara Sarman, with his friends, was walking along a road. He noticed  
a cowherd   
severely beating a cow because it had slightly pushed him with its horn.  
Vichara Sarman could not   
endure this. He was greatly moved and spoke to the cowherd: âOh ignorant  
man? Do you not know   
that the cow is worshipful and divine. All the Devas dwell in her. She is  
indispensable for all   
religious activities. It is our sacred duty to tend and protect the cows.  
Whoever harms the cow is   
hurled into the Naraka. Whoever worships the cow wins a place in heaven or in  
Sivaâs Abode. You   
have committed a great sin today. Hereafter, you need not tend to the cows: I  
will do that myself.â   
Vichara Sarman took the work upon himself from that day.   
The cows grew healthier. They liked Vichara Sarman very much. The Brahmins who  
got   
more milk thereafter were able to fulfil their religious duties very well, and  
they were pleased with   
Vichara Sarman. There was so much of surplus milk now, that Vichara Sarman,  
who loved Lord   
Siva and His worship, decided to perform Abhishekam for Lord Siva. He used to  
sit under an Atti   
tree on the bank of the river, construct a temple from the mud, and also make  
a mud-image of Siva   
Lingam and offer the milk, to bathe the Lingam. Then he would perform Archana  
with the Atti   
flowers. The cows were giving plenty of milk both to Vichara Sarman and to the  
Brahmins.   
One day, when Vichara Sarman was doing this Puja, a villager happened to pass  
by, and he   
watched all this. He reported the matter to the owners of the cows, and  
complained that Vichara   
Sarman was pouring precious milk on mud and river sand. These Brahmins  
summoned Vichara   
Sarmanâs father, Echhadattan, and passed the complaint on to him in rather  
strong terms. The father   
was naturally shocked. He came home, but did not speak to Vichara Sarman. He  
wanted to find out   
for himself. So, the next day, he followed Vichara Sarman at a distance  
without his knowledge.   
When Vichara Sarman began pouring milk on the improvised Siva Lingam, the  
father, without   
understanding the sonâs wonderful devotion, hit him with a stick. The boy  
was so much absorbed in   
his Puja that he did not even feel pain. Then, the father, getting still more  
angry, knocked the   
milk-pot down. It was then that Vichara Sarman realised that his father was  
interfering with his   
worship and had committed an unpardonable offence against Lord Siva (Siva  
Aparadham). He at   
once took a stick and hit his fatherâs leg: by the will of the Lord, the  
stick was transformed into an   
axe. Again, by His will, it killed the father. It was to test the depth of  
Vichara Sarmanâs devotion. He   
was so engrossed in the worship, that he did not mind what had happened and  
continued the   
worship.   
Lord Siva was immensely pleased with the intensity of Vichara Sarmanâs  
devotion and   
appeared before him, with Parvathi. Vichara Sarman prostrated before the Lord.  
The Lord   
embraced Vichara Sarman and fondled him. That very instant, Vichara Sarman  
attained the divine   
Form of Lord Siva. The Lord removed a garland from His own neck and put it  
around Vichara   
Sarmanâs. He had attained Saroopya Mukthi (liberation, with the attainment  
of the form of the   
Lord). The Lord said: âMy child, you cut your own fatherâs leg for My  
sake. Now, I am Your Father.   
You will soon attain Chandikesvararâs Abode. You worshipped Me with food,  
clothes and flower   
garlands. In the same manner, you will also be worshipped.â The Lord  
disappeared. Vichara   
Sarman also went to the Abode of Chandesvarar. No sin attached to him, for  
having killed his own   
father, because of his supreme devotion to the Lord. His father, too, because  
he was killed by such a   
great devotee of the Lord, was purged of the sin of interfering with His  
worship, and reached the   
Abode of Lord Siva.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Chandikeswara was made as a guardian angel of Siva's temple.   
This is a post. Chandeswara Nayanar will be in that post till   
the end of Kali Yuga. His shrine will be near the Tirmanjanam   
outlet, (from where the abulations of water, panchamirtam,   
coconut water, milk, turmeric water, honey etc., pour out.)   
The devotees visiting the temple are expected to take this water,   
a little bit from the outlet and then take leave of Chandikeswara.   
We have to tell him to mark our presence, by tapping with three   
middle fingers of the right hand on the left palm. The tapping   
should be done, in a low noise. People clap heavily as if Chandikeswara is  
deaf. It should not be done. The practice   
of pulling out two thread from our clothes and giving them to him,   
is again a practice which is not there in scriptures. We should only tell him  
that we are not taking anything from the Siva temple, excepting prasadams like  
vibhuti, kumkum, cut coconut, fruits, flowers etc., given by the priests.   
Chandikeswaras are there for Ganapati and Muruga too. For Uma,   
she has got female guardian angels like Tara and Matangi and   
Kurukulla Devi.   
In Arunachala temple, there is a Periya Puranam verse, on a small   
board, which states: O Son, I have given you a post, in which you   
are eligible for my food, flowers and clothes....   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Even for one to love Satsangh and go for Satsangh prayers and Satsangh group  
singing, one needs the grace of God. Many are   
not attracted by such things in life. Sri Ramakrishana used to tell   
one story: There were two friends. One wanted to go to Satsangh   
and another to a harlot's place. The man who went to Satsangh   
was thinking, O what a fool I am sitting here, my friend would be   
enjoying that girl. The other was thinking, O what a great sinner I am, my  
friend is having merits and sitting with Satsangh and I am   
sinning here with this harlot's body!   
So, it is not merely going, but going with a conviction, without   
distracting thoughts.   
My niece used to make fun of my wife, her aunt: O auntie! You are always in  
Bhajana koottam, i..e group of bhajans. I told her: O my dear niece, you are always in slumdog millionaire's koottam!

## Re:[110]As you think, so you reap  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 11, 2009, 05:44:03 PM

**As you think, so you reap**   
A sannyasin dwelt by the side of a temple. There was the house of a harlot in  
front. Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute's house, the  
sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: "You are a great  
sinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot hereafter."   
The poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her misdeeds, and with genuine  
inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching forgiveness. But as  
prostitution was her profession, she could not easily adopt any other means of  
earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh sinned, she always  
reproached herself with greater contrition of heart and prayed to God more and  
more for forgiveness.   
The sannyasin saw that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon her,  
and thought, "Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the course  
of her life." And from that day forward, whenever any person entered the house  
of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble aside, and in  
course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.   
One day the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: "Woman,  
don't you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission of the  
deadly sin you have been indulging in since I advised you last to desist from  
the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil deeds!"   
The poor wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation of her sins,  
and she prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness, inwardly  
repeating, "Lord, wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life that I am  
leading?" The prayer was heard, and on that very day the angel of death passed  
by her house, and she ceased to exist in this world. By the strange will of  
God, the sannyasin also died on the same day.   
The messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body of  
the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers of Yama  
bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether world.   
The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud: "Is this  
the subtle justice of God? I passed all my life in asceticism and poverty, and  
I am carried to hell, while that prostitute, whose life was a whole record of  
sin, is going to Heaven!"   
Hearing this, the messengers of Vishnu said: "The decrees of God are always  
just; as you think, so you reap. You passed your life in external show and  
vanity, trying to get honor and fame; and God has given you this. _Your  
prostitute earnestly prayed to God day and night_, though her body sinned all  
the while. Look at the treatment which your body and her body are receiving  
from those below. As you never sinned with your body, they have decorated it  
with flowers and garlands, and are carrying it with music in a procession to  
consign it to the sacred river. But this prostitute's body, which had sinned,  
is being torn to pieces at this moment by vultures and jackals. Nevertheless,  
she was pure in heart, and is therefore going to the regions of the pure. Your  
heart was always absorbed in contemplating her sins and thus became impure.  
You were the real prostitute, and not she."

**Work**   
Disciple: The pressure of work stands in the way of giving one's mind to God,  
does it not?   
Master: O yes, no doubt that is so;   
but a Jnani may work unattached, and then work will not harm him.

will gradually fall away.

Dear silentgreen.   
Sri Ramakrishna said that "God will help you." i.e God's grace will   
assist. Bhagavan Ramana said: "If you throw away the ego, then   
the Self will alone be there," which takes care of the work. Both   
the Self and the Grace are inseparable.

**Lamp of Rememberance**   
Should you think of God only at the time of meditation   
and remain forgetful of Him at all other times?   
Have you not noticed how during Durga Puja a lamp is kept constantly   
burning near the image?   
It should never be allowed to go out.   
If ever it is extinguished, the householder meets with some mishap.   
Similarly after installing the Deity on the lotus of your heart,   
you must keep the lamp of remembering Him ever burning.   
While engaged in the affairs of the world, you should constantly turn your  
gaze   
inwards and see whether the lamp is burning or not.

a little long but I guess worth reading (dudjom rinpoche past away 1987, the  
greatest dzogchen masters of our time)   
A GARLAND OF ESSENTIAL POINTS   
FOR STUDENTS   
HEART-ESSENCE OF THE GREAT MASTERS   
By His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche   
Root guru, precious and most kind,   
Lord of the mandala, sole unfailing lasting refuge,   
With your compassion, take hold of me!   
I work only for this life, not keeping death in mind,   
Wasting this free, well-favored human birth.   
Human life, lasting an instant, like a dream -   
It might be happy, it might be sad.   
Not wishing for joy, not avoiding sadness,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This human life,   
like a butterlamp set out in the wind -   
It might last a long time or it might not.   
Not letting ego's hold tighten further,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
A life of luxury, like a bewitching apparition -   
It might come to pass or it might not.   
With the ways of the eight worldly dharmas   
cast away like chaff,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All these underlings, like a bunch of birds in a tree -   
They might surround me, they might not.   
Not letting others lead me around by the nose,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This illusory body,   
like a rotting 100-year-old house -   
It might last, it might fall into dust.   
Not caught up in efforts   
to get food, clothes, or medicines,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This dharma behavior, like a child's game -   
It might go on, it might stop.   
Undeceived by things that don't really matter,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All these gods and spirits, like a mirror's reflections -   
They might give help, they might do harm.   
Not seeing my own deluded visions to be enemies,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All this confused chatter, traceless as an echo -   
It might be interesting, it might not.   
With the Three Jewels and my own mind   
bearing witness,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Things that may prove useless in time of real need,   
like a deer's antlers, -   
I might know them, I might not.   
Not placing my confidence   
merely in the arts and sciences,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
These gifts and money given by the faithful,   
like deadly poison -   
I might receive them, I might not.   
Not spending my life   
trying to accumulate evil earnings,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This lofty station, like dogshit wrapped in satin -   
I might have it, I might not.   
Knowing my own rottenness at first hand,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Friends and family,   
like travelers who come together for a fair -   
They might be vicious, they might be loving.   
Cutting attachment's tough cord from the heart,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All these possessions,   
like the wealth found in a dream -   
I might own them, I might not.   
Not using tact and flattery to turn others' heads,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This rank in the hierarchy,   
Like a tiny bird perched on a branch -   
It might be high, it might be low.   
Without making myself miserable   
wishing for a better position,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Practicing the spells of black magic,   
like deadly weapons -   
I might be able to cast them, I might not.   
Not buying the knife that cuts my own throat,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Doing prayers,   
like a parrot saying 'om mani padme hum' -   
I might do them, I might not.   
Without boasting about whatever I do,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The way one teaches the dharma,   
like flowing water -   
I might be expert, I might not.   
Without thinking that mere eloquence is dharma,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Intellect that makes quick discriminations,   
like a rooting pig -   
It might be sharp, it might be dull.   
Not allowing the barbs of   
pointless anger and attachment to arise,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Meditation experiences,   
like well-water in summer -   
They may increase, they may lessen.   
Without chasing after rainbows as children do,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This pure perception,   
like rain on a mountaintop -   
It might arise, it might not.   
Without taking deluded experience to be real,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
These freedoms and favourable conditions,   
like a wish-fullfilling gem -   
If they are lacking, there is no way   
to accomplish the holy dharma.   
Not throwing away what is already in my own hand,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The glorious guru,   
like a lamp that lights the way to liberation -   
If I cannot meet him, there is no way   
to realize the true nature.   
Not jumping off a cliff when I know the path to go on,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The holy dharma,   
like a medicine to cure disease -   
If I don't hear it, there is no way   
to know what should be done and not done.   
Not swallowing poison   
when I can tell benefit from harm,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The changing cycle of joy and sorrow,   
like the changing seasons -   
If this isn't seen, there is no way to achieve renunciation.   
Not acting without restraint, like a lunatic,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Ego, like a shadow one is born with -   
Until it's abandoned, there is no way   
to reach a place of real joy.   
When the enemy is in my clutches,   
why treat him as friend?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachin   
As a time of suffering will surely come around to me,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Samsara, like a stone fallen deep into water -   
If I don't get out now, I won't get out later.   
Pulling myself out by the rope of the   
compassionate Three Jewels,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Liberation's good qualities,   
like an island of jewels -   
If they aren't known, there is no way   
to begin to make efforts.   
Having seen the advantage of permanent victory,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The life stories of the great masters,   
like the essence of amrita -   
If they aren't known, there is no way   
for confidence to arise.   
Not choosing self-destruction   
when I can tell victory from defeat,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Bodhicitta, like a fertile field -   
Unless it is cultivated, there is no way   
to achieve enlightenment.   
Not staying idle   
when there is a great aim to be accomplished,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
My own mind, like a monkey's nonsense -   
Without keeping guard, there is no way   
to avoid conflicting emotions.   
The five poisons, like hot embers among ashes -   
Until they're destroyed,   
one can't remain at rest in the natural state.   
Not raising baby vipers in my pockets,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This mindstream,   
like the tough hide of a butter-bag -   
If it's not tamed and softened,   
one can't mix mind with dharma.   
Without spoiling the child that is born of itself,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
These ingrained bad habits, karmic patterns,   
like the strong currents of a river -   
If they aren't cut,   
one can't avoid acting contrary to the dharma.   
Without selling weapons to my enemies,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
These distractions, like never-ending waves -   
If they aren't given up, there is no way   
to become stable.   
When I can do as I like, why practice samsara?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The lama's blessings,   
like spring warming up soil and water -   
If they don't enter into me, there is no way   
to be introduced to the nature of mind.   
When there is a short-cut,   
why take the long way around?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This retreat in the wilderness,   
like summer in a lush place where herbs grow -   
If I don't remain here, there is no way   
for good qualities to be born.   
When high up in the mountains,   
don't wander back into black towns.   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Desire for pleasure,   
like a bad-luck spirit entering the house -   
If I'm not free of it,   
I'll never stop working toward suffering.   
Not making offerings to voracious ghosts   
as my personal gods,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Mindfulness, like the lock on a castle gate -   
If it is lacking, one can't   
stop the movements of illusion.   
When the thief is surely coming,   
why forget to bar the door?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The true nature, unchanging, like the sky -   
Until it's realized, one can't   
completely resolve doubts as to the view.   
Not letting myself be chained by theories,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Awareness, like a flawless piece of crystal -   
Until it's seen, intentional meditation cannot dissolve.   
When there's an inseparable companion,   
why go off looking for another?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The face of ordinary mind, like an old friend -   
If it's not seen, all that one does is misleading.   
Without groping in the darkness   
of my own closed eyes,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
In short, without giving up   
This life's preoccupations, there's no way   
to accomplish the sacred teachings after death.   
Having decided to show myself great kindness,   
May all that I do be toward the dharma.   
May I not have wrong views toward the guru   
who has given instruction in accord with the dharma.   
May I not lose faith in the yidam when misfortunes occur.   
May I not put off practice when circumstances are hard.   
May there be no obstacles to attaining siddhi.   
All these activities are pointless,   
like making a grand tour of a wasteland.   
All this trying just makes my mindstream more rigid.   
All this thinking only adds confusion onto confusion.   
All that passes for dharma to ordinary people   
only makes for further binding.   
So much activity - nothing comes of it.   
So much thinking - no point to it.   
So much wanting - no time for it.   
Having given this up,   
May I be able to practice according to instructions.   
If I must do something,   
may Buddha's teaching bear it witness.   
If I must do something, mix mindstream and dharma.   
If I must accomplish something,   
read the life stories of past masters.   
What's the use of other things? Spoiled brat!   
Take a low seat and become rich with contentment.   
Try hard to get free of the eight worldly concerns.   
May the guru's blessings enter into me,   
May my realization become equal to the sky.   
Grant your blessings so that I may reach Kuntuzangpo's throne.   
Written by Jigdral Yeshe Dorje for his own prayers,   
Condensing the essential meaning from the vajra words of advice from previous  
great master

**Renunciation**   
" _Master, you are wonderful!_ "   
A student, taking his leave, gazed ardently at the patriarchal sage (Nagendra  
Bhaduri).   
" _You have renounced riches and comforts to seek God and teach us wisdom!_ "   
It was well-known that Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in  
his early childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.   
" _You are reversing the case!_ "   
The saint's face held a mild rebuke.   
" _I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic empire  
of endless bliss.   
How then have I denied myself anything?   
I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice?   
The shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates!   
They relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of  
earthly toys!_"

## Spiritual Practice : some guidelines  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 24, 2009, 05:02:23 PM  
---  
Saints and sages have given several guidelines to guide a seeker during  
sadhana through direct instructions, metaphors, anecdotes etc.Thought of  
starting a thread to bring out their valuable guidelines.   
Even though some of the instructions may be specific to certain types of  
persons (their temperaments, needs etc) and their spiritual practices, they  
should still be useful if interpreted in a broader perspective.   
 **Kinds of Sadhana:**   
The course of Sadhana is of three kinds, viz,   
(1) of the nature of birds,   
(2) of the nature of monkeys and   
(3) of the nature of ants.   
(1) The bird comes and pecks a fruit which perhaps falls down at the jerk, and  
the bird cannot get it for eating.   
So there are devotees who try to rush on with devotional practices with such  
violence that they often frustrate their attempts.   
(2) It is the nature of the monkey to jump from branch to branch, holding a  
fruit in its mouth, and while jumping, the fruit often falls down from its  
mouth. Thus at times, distracted by the changing events in life the aspirants  
lose sight of the devotional path, if the grasp is not firm.   
(3) The ant creeps gently and steadily towards a grain of food, and carries it  
back to its hole where it enjoys it comfortably.   
The course of Sadhana like that of an ant is considered the best -- there is  
sureness of attaining and enjoying the fruit.

**Self-Realization of Nisargadatta Maharaj**   
When Maruti was 34, a friend of his, Yashwantrao Baagkar, introduced him to  
his guru, Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, the head of the Inchegeri branch of the  
Navanath Sampradaya. The guru gave a mantra and some instructions to Maruti  
and died soon after. Sri Nisargadatta later recalled:  _My Guru ordered me to attend to the sense 'I am' and to give attention to nothing else. I just obeyed. I did not follow any particular course of breathing, or meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever happened, I would turn away my attention from it and remain with the sense 'I am'. It may look too simple, even crude. My only reason for doing it was that my Guru told me so. Yet it worked!_   
Within three years, Maruti realized himself and took the new name  
Nisargadatta. He became a saddhu and walked barefoot to the Himalayas, but  
eventually returned to Mumbai where he lived for the rest of his life, working  
as a cigarette vendor and giving religious instruction in his home.

Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj frequently recommended the practice that had led to  
his own realization in less than three years:  _Just keep in mind the feeling "I am," merge in it, till your mind and feeling become one. By repeated attempts you will stumble on the right balance of attention and affection and your mind will be firmly established in the thought-feeling "I am._

Dear Silentgreen,   
Very valuable posts indeed, I have also read about Nisargadatta Maharaj.  
Simple and constant meditation on the words of Guru made him a realised soul.  
We also need to stick with those valuable words of our Guru and not deviate  
into more and more teachings also...   
Constantly thinking and meditating about simple teaching of Guru leads us to  
Jnana, it is clearly evident in the life of Nisargadatta Maharaj. After we  
attend to every thought and actions required by us to the world (karma) we  
should ponder each time about 'Who am I' or 'I am' I believe we can also  
attain realisation if we are able to sincerely really follow the teachings of  
our Guru.

Dear silentgreen, Ganesh_b01,   
Guru's words are of immense importance. The follower of his words and who  
maintain his Satsangh with him, get all his sins washed off   
and in due course, he realizes the Self. Bhagavan Ramana said: Visiting holy temples, Bathing in Ganga, will remove only the Sanchaya karma  
sins, whereas Guru's words and being with him,   
removes prarabdha karma sins also.

**Meditation**   
\- _J. Krishnamurthy_   
Meditation is one of the most important things in life; not how to meditate;  
not meditation according to a system; not the practice of meditation; but  
rather that which meditation is. If one can find out, very deeply, the  
significance, the necessity and the importance of it for oneself, then one  
puts aside all systems, methods, gurus, together with all the peculiar things  
that are involved in the Eastern type of meditation.   
It is very important to uncover for oneself what one actually is; not  
according to the theories and the assertions and experiences of psychologists,  
philosophers and the gurus, but rather by investigating the whole nature and  
movement of oneself; by seeing what one actually is.   
...   
To see what one actually is, it is vital that there be freedom, freedom from  
the whole content of one's consciousness; the content of consciousness being  
all the things put together by thought. Freedom from the content of one's  
consciousness, from one's angers and brutalities, from one's vanities and  
arrogance, from all the things that one is caught up in, is meditation. The  
very seeing of what one is, is the beginning of the transformation. Meditation  
implies the ending of all strife, of all conflict, inwardly and therefore  
outwardly. Actually, there is no inward or outward, it is like the sea, there  
is the ebb and flow.   
...   
To find out what meditation is, all previous knowledge of what meditation is  
thought to be, blocks the exploration. Freedom from psychological authority is  
absolutely necessary. What is necessary in the investigation? Is it  
concentration; is it attention or is it awareness? When one concentrates,  
one's whole energy is focused on something particular, one resists and puts  
aside all interfering thoughts. In concentration one is resisting. But to be  
aware of one's thought there is no concentration; one does not choose in  
awareness which thought one would like; one is just aware. From that awareness  
comes attention. In attention there is no centre from which one is attending.  
This is really important to understand, it is the essence of meditation. In  
concentration there is a centre from which one is concentrating, on a picture  
or on an idea or on some image, etc; one is exercising energy in  
concentration, in resisting building a wall, so that no other thought comes in  
and there must be conflict. To totally eliminate that conflict become  
choicelessly aware of thought; then there is no contradiction, no resistance  
about any thought. From that arises awareness; awareness of all the movement  
of one's thought. Out of that awareness comes attention. When one is attending  
to something, really deeply, there is no centre; there is no me.   
Om. ..

**From Chidakasha Gita of Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri**   
#. Jnanis are mindless. To Jnanis, all are the same. They have no slumber, no  
dreams, nor sleep. They are always in sleep. The sun and the moon are the same  
to them. To them, it is always sunrise. The glass of a chimney lamp, when  
covered with carbon, is not transparent. Similarly, the carbon of the mind  
should be removed.   
#. There are three nerves in the body: the sun or the Sushumna; the moon or  
the Ida; the star or the Pingala. The first is red in color, the second, blue,  
and the third, green.   
\- Where these three nerves meet is the heart space. As we go on practicing  
yoga, the Bindu-sound is heard in the head. This sound is one, indivisible.   
#. Just as camphor is consumed by the flames of fire, so also, mind must be  
consumed by soul-fire.   
#. Manas is Jiva; but their positions are different. Jivatman is Paramatman.   
\- A man or woman should be educated. What is education? Jiva should know the  
secret that He is the Paramatman.   
\- Paramatman is in Jivatman. The real Mukti is to know the subtle in the  
gross.   
#. Just as we see the sky reflected in the water in an earthen pot, so also,  
to the internal vision, the sky of consciousness becomes visible.   
#. A Guru (spiritual teacher) will lead any sort of man from a thorny path to  
the royal road. Such preceptors are of two kinds. One is the primary preceptor  
and the other, the secondary preceptor. Mind is the primary preceptor and the  
other, the secondary preceptor. One is not the preceptor of the other. He is  
only the secondary preceptor. The secondary preceptor is one who shows the  
water in the well. The guru who exists in the heart of all beings is the  
Jagad-Guru (universal preceptor).   
#. One who has thoroughly wiped off the idea "I am the body" is fit to be  
called a guru. There is none higher than such a one. There is no god above  
such a guru. Such a guru is God, and God is such a guru.   
#. It is not Bhakti to give a man some money or to give him a meal as charity.  
Bhakti is universal love. Seeing God, in all beings, without the least idea of  
duality, is Bhakti.   
#. When SAT unites with CHIT, Ananda (bliss) is the result. This Ananda is  
Paramananda, Sri Satchitananda. Paramananda is experienced in the head. In the  
head is in the Brahma-nadi. Brahmananda is Paramananda. Jiva enjoys this bliss  
when he is one with Paramatman. This bliss is also called Shivananda.  
Paramananda is experienced in the head. This state is eternal joy. This state  
is Jivanmukti.   
#. He is a Jnani who has given up worldly pleasures and, by practicing yoga,  
seen God. Ananda (bliss) is not in what you hear. Bliss is a matter of  
experience. Such a man is called a Mahatma. Those who have seen earthen and  
stone images do not become Mahatmas. He is a Mahatma who knows himself.   
#. If you perform tapas for thousands of years with the desire for results, it  
is of no avail. But if you perform tapas for one ghatika (twenty-four minutes)  
without any desire for "fruits," you will see ALL in God and God in ALL.   
Om. .

Dear silentgreen,   
Your descriptions of various paths are quite good. But Bhagavan   
Ramana has not advocated the breath-control, as prescribed by   
the Yoga sastras. He only advised watching the breath. He said   
mano laya, which is obtained through yoga marga. He however,   
recommended bhakti, devotion -- which should culminate as total   
surrender. He stressed mano nasa, and not mano laya.

**Self Enquiry**   
\- Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi   
 _How is one to enquire :Who am I?_   
Actions such as 'going' and 'coming' belong only to the body. And so. when one  
says, 'I' went, 'I' came, it amounts to saying that the body is 'I'. But, can  
the body be said to be the consciousness 'I'. It cannot be, since it was not  
there before it was born, is made up of the five elements, is non-existent in  
the state of deep sleep, and becomes a corpse when dead? Can this body which  
is inert like a log of wood be said to shine as 'I-I'? Therefore, the  
'I-consciousness' which at first arises in respect of the body is referred to  
variously as egoity, nescience, impurity, and individual soul. Can we remain  
without enquiring into this? Is it not for our redemption through enquiry that  
all the scriptures declare that the destruction of ego is release? Therefore,  
making the corpse-body remain as a corpse, and not even uttering the word 'I',  
one should enquire keenly thus: "Now, what is it that rises as "I"? Then,  
there would shine in the Heart a kind of wordless illumination of the form of  
'I-I'. It is there and would shine of its own accord, as the pure  
consciousness which is unlimited and one, the limited and the many thoughts  
having disappeared. If one remains quiescent without abandoning that  
experience, the individual sense of the form 'I am the body' will be totally  
destroyed, and at the end the final thought, the 'I-form' also will be  
quenched like the fire that burns camphor. The great sages and scriptures  
declare that this alone is release.   
Om. .

God is to man what a magnet is to iron.   
Why does he not then attract the man?   
As iron thickly imbedded in mud is not moved by the attraction of the magnet,   
so the soul thickly imbedded in Maya does not feel the attraction of the Lord.   
But when the mud is washed away with water, the iron is free to move.   
Even so, when by the constant tears of prayer and repentance, the soul washes  
away the mud of Maya   
that compels it to stick to the earth, it is soon attracted by the Lord to  
Himself.

Dear silentgreen, matthias,   
Yes. Just as the muddy iron is washed away by water, we have to   
wash our dirty ego, with tears. Saint Manikkavachagar says in   
Tiruvachakam: "Can I not get you if I weep?" Saint Arunagiri   
Nathar says Seer Pada Vaguppu: "O You shall come with a war   
cry, "I am coming", when I weep and pray and melt..." It is   
indeed better to weep for our dirty ego, than to weep for the lack   
of worldly comforts and pleasures!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen et.al   
Many thanks for this illuminating thread!   
As a novice, I have a query I'd like to direct to Subramanian.R, who wrote:  _... Bhagavan Ramana has not advocated the breath-control, as prescribed by   
the Yoga sastras. He only advised watching the breath._   
My understanding (in scanning "pranayama" in the indexes to _Talks_ and   
_Day by Day_ ) is that the following passage would _seem_ (at least)   
to be representative of Bhagavan's teaching: In the absence of enquiry and devotion, the natural sedative _pranayama_   
(breath regulation) may be tried. This is known as _Yoga Marga_. If life is   
imperilled the whole interest centres round the one point, the saving of life.  
If   
the breath is held the mind cannot afford to (and does not) jump at its pets -   
external objects. Thus there is rest for the mind so long as the breath is  
held.   
All attention being turned on breath or its regulation, other interests are  
lost.   
Again, passions are attended with irregular breathing, whereas calm and   
happiness are attended with slow and regular breathing. ..   
\- Talk 27   
_____________________   
As I say, I feel myself to be a novice. .. Embarking on a not dissimilar  
practice. ..   
So would greatly appreciate some clarification on this point.   
With many thanks to all who make this such a wonderful board,   
Paul

Dear Paul,   
I feel Bhagawan's teachings, his advice to each devotees were different based  
on their level platforms. We should carefully analyze for which type of  
devotee Bhagawan advised something. We should also look into ourselves whether  
we are similar to the devotee in the reading.   
I just glanced Day by Day with Bhagawan, I also happened to read the following  
words by Bhagawan -   
_The aim is to make the mind one-pointed. For that pranayama is a help, a  
means. Not only for dhyana but in every case where we have to make the mind  
one-pointed, it may be even for a purely secular or material purpose, it is  
good to make pranayama and then start the other work. The mind and prana are  
the same, having the same source. If one is controlled, the other is also  
controlled at the same time. If one is able to make the mind one-pointed  
without the help of pranayama, he need not bother about pranayama. But one who  
cannot at once control the mind, may control the breath and that will lead to  
control of the mind. It is something like pulling a horse by the reins and  
making it go in one direction.   
for controlling breath, the regular pranayama is not better in which 1:4:2  
proportion for breathing in, retaining, and breathing out is prescribed.  
Bhagavan replied, All those proportions, sometimes regulated not by counting  
but by uttering mantras, etc., are aids for controlling the mind. That is all.   
The thing is to kill the mind somehow. Those who cannot follow the enquiry  
method are advised pranayama as a help to control the mind. And pranayama is  
of two kinds, one of controlling and regulating the breath and the other of  
simply watching the breath.   
Though the yogi may have his methods of breath-control, pranayama, mudras,  
etc., for this object, the jnanis method is only that of enquiry. When by  
this method the mind is merged in the Self, the Self, its sakti or kundalini,  
rises automatically.   
_   
I have also learnt Pranayama from a qualified teacher and also practiced  
pranayama regularly. But now, I only do it as a part of my daily rituals. What  
I have come to understand is that Mind and Breath are interrelated. your state  
of mind is dependent of your breath. If your breath is regular, i.e. in and  
out is fine relaxed, then you also become clam. Look into this - they advocate  
everybody to exercise for a fit body, actually what happens - at the end of  
the exercise, you sweat, take long breath in and out, its so normal, you are  
very relaxed. More oxygen is fed into your body, hence you become fit.   
Another fact is that about 90% of your breath directly is consumed by your  
brain, hence if there is not enough intake of air i.e. oxygen, the brain is  
irritable, you become irritable, next time you may just try this out, when you  
have headaches, when you are irritable, you would observe that your breath  
pattern is not ok. By Pranayama or by looking in to your breath, the breath in  
and out is normalized.

went away giggling for his heroism.

**Ending of work**   
As long as the mind is not absorbed in Sachchidananda, man has to do both --   
call upon the Lord and attend to work in the world.   
But when the mind is absorbed in Him, there is no more need of any work.   
For example, let us take the illustration of the Kirtan.   
A man sings: "Nitai amar mata hati"   
(My Nityananda is an elephant in rut)   
When this is sung first, the singer pays attention to all details --   
the tune, time, melody, etc.   
But when his mind is a little absorbed in the song, he says simply,   
"Mata hati, mata hati."   
At a further stage of absorption he says only, "Hati, hati."   
At a still further stage, he says simply "Ha ha," and no further.

The essence of Bhakti consists in unceasing prayer of light and love, and  
self-surrender to Her.   
First, come to my Divine Mother through these.   
Take my word for it that, if your prayer is really heartfelt,   
my Mother will respond to it, if you will only wait.   
Pray to Her again if you want to realise Her Impersonal Self.   
Should She deign to grant your prayer -- for She is omnipotent --   
you will be in a position to realise Her Impersonal Self in Samadhi.   
This is precisely the same as Brahma-jnana.

some verses of vajra awaereness by mipham jampel gyepai dorje   
fist some radical verses...   
discursice thought merely increases the neurosis;   
aggressive goal-orientation just causes fatigue;   
and referential meditation locks us tighlty in a cage: let all plaguing fixations crumble from within   
any point of reference turns the view into poison;   
to pursue a goal in meditation makes meditation a sin,   
to discipline behaviour makes action a constant defile: free of all such grief let us recognise the nature of reality.   
and now some poetry: Through the devotion that beholds the glorious teacher, the primordial guide,   
as identical to the sameness of the dharmakaya (=wisdome body)   
let the grace of intuition of ultimate meaning move in the heart,   
bestowing the magnificent empowerment of creative gnosis.   
It always abides within us, dependant upon neither exertion   
nor any special faculty or quality -   
through the magic of the teachers precepts   
let us recognise the incredible simple secret of the mind   
We name the familiar starting point, the journey,   
and the destination, as different expereinces,   
but int he natural state thea are just structures of sky: let us come to spontaneous perfection in nonaction   
Luminous gnosis unconfined by a cage of fictive assumptions,   
recognised through actual direct perception,   
sky knots -- tightened by the noose of reason -- untied,   
let us be wise in authentic natural relaxation   
etc..   
a very enlightening text as well

Emptying the Depths of Hell --a 13th century dzogchen text   
HUNG! How futile to project notions of being and nonbeing   
Upon an unformed and inconceivable reality-continuum!   
What misery to cling to delusions of a substantial reality!   
Atone in the spaciousness of formless, concept-free pleasure.   
How pointless to project notions of purity and impurity   
Upon Kuntu Zangpo, who transcends all moral qualities!   
How guilt-ridden are those who cling to moral dualities!   
Atone in the spaciousness of Kunzang's pure pleasure.   
How exhausting to cling to notions of self and others   
In the sameness where superiority and inferiority cannot be!   
What anxiety to cling to the duality of success and failure!   
Atone in the spaciousness of the pure pleasure of sameness.   
How futile to cling to concepts of this life and the next   
When the Bodhisattva's mind is free of birth and dying!   
What anxiety lies in obsession with birth and death!   
Atone in the spaciousness of the deathless swastika.   
How foolish to project concepts of concrete form and substance   
Upon the cosmic seed that has no corners or edges!   
What boredom lies in the limitations of squares and rectangles!   
Atone in the spaciousness of the all-embracing spherical nucleus.   
How stupid it is to project notions of beginning and end   
In the timeless, unchangeable dimension of past, present and future!   
What misery lies in the duality of transformation and gradual change!   
Atone in the spaciousness of unchanging past, present and future.   
How pointless to project causal relationships   
Upon Awareness, naturally arising without strain or accomplishment!   
What grief lies in distinguishing effort from attainment!   
Atone in the spaciousness of effortless spontaneity.   
How exhausting to cling to concepts of subject and object   
In Knowledge-Awareness neither eternal nor temporal!   
What misery to separate time from eternity!   
Atone in the spaciousness of Knowledge-Awareness

it echoes the "neti, neti" approach...   
it draws such a fine distinction between the real and the unreal

the notion of "unreal" alone makes it "unreal" isnt it so?   
the world is "like" an illusion....   
everything that arises (including the distinction between real and unreal) is  
utterly pure and self liberated...we just constantly fail to recognize the

want....we think that this moment is actually not brahman even if all  
scriptures tell it to be what we desire....but we want listen.....

Author: silentgreen         Date: April 08, 2009, 04:59:46 PM

**God 's Will**   
There was a weaver in a village. He was very religious.   
Everybody trusted him and loved him. The weaver would go to the market to sell  
dhotis.   
When the customer asked the price, he would say,   
By Ramas will, cotton thread costs one rupee;   
by Ramas will labour charges is four annas;   
by Ramas will, profit two annas.   
So, the price of the dhoti by Ramas will is one rupee six annas.   
People had so much faith in him that they would immediately pay and buy the  
cloth.   
This fellow was a great devotee. After his dinner he would sit in the Chandi-  
mandap till late in the night,   
meditate on God and sing His glories.   
One night it was very late but this fellow did not feel sleepy.   
He was smoking in between. Just then a group of dacoits was passing that way  
to commit dacoity.   
They needed a porter. So, they came to the weaver and said, Come along with  
us.   
Saying so, they pulled him by the hand and took him along. Then they committed  
dacoity in a house.   
They placed so many articles on the weavers head to carry. Just then the  
police arrived.   
The dacoits ran away but the weaver was caught with all those articles on his  
head.   
He was kept in the police lockup that night. The next day he was tried by a  
magistrate.   
When the villagers came to know of it, they all came there.   
They all said, Sir, this fellow can never commit a dacoity.   
The magistrate then asked the weaver, I say, tell me how it all happened with  
you?   
The weaver replied, Sir, by Ramas will, I took rice at night.   
By Ramas will, then I sat in the Chandi-mandap.   
By Ramas will, it was very late at night.   
By Ramas will I was meditating on Him and was singing His glories when   
by Ramas will a group of dacoits was going that very way.   
By Ramas will, they pulled me and took me along with them.   
By Ramas will, they committed dacoity in a house.   
By Ramas will, they placed a load on my head. Then by His will I was caught.   
By Ramas will, the police put me in the lockup.   
And now this morning by Ramas will I have been brought before you.   
Seeing that the fellow was so religious, the magistrate discharged him.   
On the way the weaver said to his friends, By Ramas will, I have been  
discharged.   
Whether one is living in the household or one has taken sannyasa, all is  
Ramas will.   
So, resign yourself to His will and do your duties living in the world.

## Re:[18]Freedom  
Author: silentgreen         Date: March 05, 2009, 03:03:53 PM

**Freedom**   
\- _Swami Vivekananda_   
#. Everything in time, space, and causation is bound. The soul is beyond all  
time, all space, all causation. That which is bound is nature, not the soul.   
#. All that we see in the universe has for its basis this one struggle towards  
freedom; it is under the impulse of this tendency that the saint prays and the  
robber robs. When the line of action is not a proper one we call it evil, and  
when the manifestation of it is proper and high we call it good. But the  
impulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom.   
#. Freedom is the one goal of nature, sentient or insentient; and consciously  
or unconsciously everything is struggling towards that goal.The freedom which  
the saint seeks is very different from that which the robber seeks; the  
freedom loved by the saint leads him to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable  
bliss, while that on which the robber has set his heart only forges other  
bonds for his soul.   
#. Man has freedom already, but he will have to discover it. He has it but  
every moment he forgets it. That discovering, consciously or unconsciously, is  
the whole life of every one. But the difference between the sage and the  
ignorant man is that one does it consciously and the other consciously.   
#. The Vedanta teaches that Nirvana can be attained here and now, that we do  
not have to wait for death and reach it. Nirvana is the realisation of the  
Self; and after having once known that, if only for an instant, never again  
can one be deluded by the mirage of the personality. Having eyes, we must see  
the apparent, but all the time we know what it is; we have found out its true  
nature. It is the screen that hides the Self, which is unchanging. The screen  
opens and we find the Self behind it. All change is in the screen. In the  
saint, the screen is thin, and the reality can almost shine through. In the  
sinner the screen is thick, and we are liable to lose sight of the truth that  
the Atman is there, as well as behind the saint's screen. When the screen is  
wholly removed, we find it really never existed that we were the Atman and  
nothing else, even the screen is forgotten.   
#. And what becomes of a man when he attains perfection? He lives a life of  
bliss infinite. He enjoys infinite and perfect bliss having obtained the only  
thing in which man ought to have pleasure, namely God, and enjoys the bliss  
with God.   
Om. .

**Compassion**   
\- _Lord Buddha_   
\- Let him cultivate goodwill without measure towards the whole world, above,  
below, around, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of making distinctions or  
of showing preferences.   
\- Hard it is to understand: By giving away our food, we get more strength; by  
bestowing clothing on others, we gain more beauty; by founding abodes of  
purity and truth, we acquire great treasures.   
\- The charitable man has found the path of salvation. He is like the man who  
plants a sapling securing thereby the shade, the flowers and the fruit in  
future years. Even so is the result of charity, even so is the joy of him who  
helps those that are in need of assistance; even so is the great Nirvana.   
\- The immortal can be reached only by continuous acts of kindliness; and  
perfection is accomplished by compassion and charity.

Dear Nagaraj, silentgreen and murunagala   
Many thanks for your replies. They've each been wonderful.   
I've been reading, and re-reading, Sri Bhagavan on pranayama. .. And this, for  
me (for whom _atma vichara_ is, in some ways, kind of "nebulous") would seem  
to be the way to go. ..   
Sri Bhagavan strikes me as being one of the very few teachers in world history  
in whom one can detect no ego whatsoever, no agendas. (And we all know how  
insidious, and tenacious, the ego can be. ..)   
So I'm sensing also that this affects the way his devotees relate to each  
other.   
I.e. very few seem to have been severely "infected" with those taints of  
egotism, and inflation, one can detect (however subtly) in many other  
teachers.   
With gratitude   
Paul

**Seeing the Self**   
To be the Self is the same as seeing the Self.   
There are no two selves for the one to see the other.

**Go the way you came**   
\- _Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi_   
Questioner: Bhagavan, having great desire for Moksha and anxious to know the  
way thereto, I have read all kinds of books on Vedanta. They all describe it  
in different ways. I have also visited a number of learned people and when I  
asked them, each recommended a different path. I got puzzled and have come to  
you; please tell me which path to take.   
Bhagavan (with a smile): _All right, then go the way you came_.   
The young man did not know what to say.   
He waited until Bhagavan left the hall and then with a depressed look said to  
others: Gentlemen, I have come a long way with great hope and with no regard for the  
expense or discomfort, out of my ardent desire to know the way to Moksha. Is  
it fair to tell me to go the way I came? Is this such a huge joke?   
Thereupon one of them replied: No, Sir, it is no joke, it is the most appropriate answer: Who am I? is the  
easiest path to Moksha.   
You asked him which way "I" should go, and his saying "Go the way you came"  
meant that if you investigate and pursue the path from which that "I" came,  
you will attain Moksha.

Dear silentgreen,   
Bhagavan Ramana uses two excellent examples in His works.   
Sri Arunachala Ashtakam: Verse 8: "In whatever way a bird flies, over the ocean, there is not place   
for it to rest, excepting the land, where it can rest." The individual   
soul, which is nothing but except bundle of thoughts and vasanas,   
cannot rest anywhere other than in the Self.   
"The waters which are falling on the ocean and sprout as rivers,   
have no other rest, despite them passing through all lands, to come   
back to the ocean to merge." The individual soul after passing through all  
lands, should come back to the Self for final merger.   
Both ocean and land are imaged as the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

**On Fanaticism**   
Be not a bigot like Ghantakarna.   
There was a man who worshipped Siva but hated all the other deities.   
One day Siva appeared to him and said: I shall never be pleased with you so long as you hate other Gods.   
But the man was inexorable.   
After a few days Siva again appeared to him.   
This time He appeared as Hari-Hara -- a form of which one half was Siva and  
the other Vishnu.   
At this the man was half-pleased and half-displeased.   
He laid the offerings on the side representing Siva, but laid nothing on that  
representing Vishnu.   
When he offered the burning incense to Siva, he was audacious enough to press  
the nostrils of Vishnu lest he should inhale the fragrance.   
Then Siva said: Your bigotry is ineradicable. By assuming this dual aspect I tried to convince  
you that all Gods and Goddesses are but the various aspects of the One Being.  
You have not taken the lesson in good part, and you will have to suffer for  
your bigotry.   
The man went away and retired to a village. He soon developed into a great  
hater of Vishnu.   
On coming to know this peculiarity of his, the children of the village began  
to tease him by uttering the name of Vishnu within his hearing.   
Vexed at this, the man hung two bells on his ears, and when the boys cried  
out, "Vishnu, Vishnu", he would ring the bells and make those names inaudible  
to his ears.   
And thus he came to be known by the name of Ghantakarna or the Bell-eared.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. Your story is in Bhakta Vijayam. This gentleman had great   
devotion for Siva but what was wrong was his hatred for Vishnu.   
One can have his Ishta Devata, and prayed to him. In fact, in   
some families, there are family detities, to which they pray everyday and go  
to that temple, every year. This is okay. What is bigotry is   
hatred for other gods and religions. Hinduism has prescribed several   
gods, only to make everyone to pray a god of his choice. Nevertheless, it  
advises also formless god, beyond all gods, Brahman or the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Even for one to love Satsangh and go for Satsangh prayers and Satsangh group  
singing, one needs the grace of God. Many are   
not attracted by such things in life. Sri Ramakrishana used to tell   
one story: There were two friends. One wanted to go to Satsangh   
and another to a harlot's place. The man who went to Satsangh   
was thinking, O what a fool I am sitting here, my friend would be   
enjoying that girl. The other was thinking, O what a great sinner I am, my  
friend is having merits and sitting with Satsangh and I am   
sinning here with this harlot's body!   
So, it is not merely going, but going with a conviction, without   
distracting thoughts.   
My niece used to make fun of my wife, her aunt: O auntie! You are always in  
Bhajana koottam, i..e group of bhajans. I told her: O my dear niece, you are always in slumdog millionaire's koottam!

## Re:[110]As you think, so you reap  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 11, 2009, 05:44:03 PM  
---  
**As you think, so you reap**   
A sannyasin dwelt by the side of a temple. There was the house of a harlot in  
front. Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute's house, the  
sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: "You are a great  
sinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot hereafter."   
The poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her misdeeds, and with genuine  
inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching forgiveness. But as  
prostitution was her profession, she could not easily adopt any other means of  
earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh sinned, she always  
reproached herself with greater contrition of heart and prayed to God more and  
more for forgiveness.   
The sannyasin saw that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon her,  
and thought, "Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the course  
of her life." And from that day forward, whenever any person entered the house  
of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble aside, and in  
course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.   
One day the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: "Woman,  
don't you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission of the  
deadly sin you have been indulging in since I advised you last to desist from  
the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil deeds!"   
The poor wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation of her sins,  
and she prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness, inwardly  
repeating, "Lord, wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life that I am  
leading?" The prayer was heard, and on that very day the angel of death passed  
by her house, and she ceased to exist in this world. By the strange will of  
God, the sannyasin also died on the same day.   
The messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body of  
the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers of Yama  
bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether world.   
The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud: "Is this  
the subtle justice of God? I passed all my life in asceticism and poverty, and  
I am carried to hell, while that prostitute, whose life was a whole record of  
sin, is going to Heaven!"   
Hearing this, the messengers of Vishnu said: "The decrees of God are always  
just; as you think, so you reap. You passed your life in external show and  
vanity, trying to get honor and fame; and God has given you this. _Your  
prostitute earnestly prayed to God day and night_, though her body sinned all  
the while. Look at the treatment which your body and her body are receiving  
from those below. As you never sinned with your body, they have decorated it  
with flowers and garlands, and are carrying it with music in a procession to  
consign it to the sacred river. But this prostitute's body, which had sinned,  
is being torn to pieces at this moment by vultures and jackals. Nevertheless,  
she was pure in heart, and is therefore going to the regions of the pure. Your  
heart was always absorbed in contemplating her sins and thus became impure.  
You were the real prostitute, and not she."

Should you think of God only at the time of meditation   
and remain forgetful of Him at all other times?   
Have you not noticed how during Durga Puja a lamp is kept constantly   
burning near the image?   
It should never be allowed to go out.   
If ever it is extinguished, the householder meets with some mishap.   
Similarly after installing the Deity on the lotus of your heart,   
you must keep the lamp of remembering Him ever burning.   
While engaged in the affairs of the world, you should constantly turn your  
gaze   
inwards and see whether the lamp is burning or not.

May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This dharma behavior, like a child's game -   
It might go on, it might stop.   
Undeceived by things that don't really matter,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All these gods and spirits, like a mirror's reflections -   
They might give help, they might do harm.   
Not seeing my own deluded visions to be enemies,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
All this confused chatter, traceless as an echo -   
It might be interesting, it might not.   
With the Three Jewels and my own mind

when I can tell benefit from harm,

If this isn't seen, there is no way to achieve renunciation.

If I don't get out now, I won't get out later.   
Pulling myself out by the rope of the   
compassionate Three Jewels,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Liberation's good qualities,   
like an island of jewels -   
If they aren't known, there is no way   
to begin to make efforts.   
Having seen the advantage of permanent victory,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The life stories of the great masters,   
like the essence of amrita -   
If they aren't known, there is no way   
for confidence to arise.   
Not choosing self-destruction   
when I can tell victory from defeat,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Bodhicitta, like a fertile field -   
Unless it is cultivated, there is no way   
to achieve enlightenment.   
Not staying idle   
when there is a great aim to be accomplished,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
My own mind, like a monkey's nonsense -   
Without keeping guard, there is no way   
to avoid conflicting emotions.   
The five poisons, like hot embers among ashes -   
Until they're destroyed,   
one can't remain at rest in the natural state.   
Not raising baby vipers in my pockets,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This mindstream,   
like the tough hide of a butter-bag -

one can't mix mind with dharma.   
Without spoiling the child that is born of itself,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.

If they aren't cut,   
one can't avoid acting contrary to the dharma.   
Without selling weapons to my enemies,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
These distractions, like never-ending waves -   
If they aren't given up, there is no way   
to become stable.   
When I can do as I like, why practice samsara?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The lama's blessings,   
like spring warming up soil and water -   
If they don't enter into me, there is no way   
to be introduced to the nature of mind.   
When there is a short-cut,   
why take the long way around?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
This retreat in the wilderness,   
like summer in a lush place where herbs grow -   
If I don't remain here, there is no way   
for good qualities to be born.   
When high up in the mountains,   
don't wander back into black towns.   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Desire for pleasure,   
like a bad-luck spirit entering the house -   
If I'm not free of it,   
I'll never stop working toward suffering.   
Not making offerings to voracious ghosts   
as my personal gods,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Mindfulness, like the lock on a castle gate -   
If it is lacking, one can't   
stop the movements of illusion.   
When the thief is surely coming,   
why forget to bar the door?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The true nature, unchanging, like the sky -   
Until it's realized, one can't   
completely resolve doubts as to the view.   
Not letting myself be chained by theories,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
Awareness, like a flawless piece of crystal -   
Until it's seen, intentional meditation cannot dissolve.   
When there's an inseparable companion,   
why go off looking for another?   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
The face of ordinary mind, like an old friend -   
If it's not seen, all that one does is misleading.   
Without groping in the darkness   
of my own closed eyes,   
May I truly practice the sublime teachings.   
In short, without giving up   
This life's preoccupations, there's no way   
to accomplish the sacred teachings after death.   
Having decided to show myself great kindness,   
May all that I do be toward the dharma.   
May I not have wrong views toward the guru   
who has given instruction in accord with the dharma.   
May I not lose faith in the yidam when misfortunes occur.   
May I not put off practice when circumstances are hard.   
May there be no obstacles to attaining siddhi.   
All these activities are pointless,   
like making a grand tour of a wasteland.   
All this trying just makes my mindstream more rigid.   
All this thinking only adds confusion onto confusion.   
All that passes for dharma to ordinary people   
only makes for further binding.   
So much activity - nothing comes of it.   
So much thinking - no point to it.   
So much wanting - no time for it.   
Having given this up,   
May I be able to practice according to instructions.   
If I must do something,   
may Buddha's teaching bear it witness.   
If I must do something, mix mindstream and dharma.   
If I must accomplish something,   
read the life stories of past masters.   
What's the use of other things? Spoiled brat!   
Take a low seat and become rich with contentment.   
Try hard to get free of the eight worldly concerns.   
May the guru's blessings enter into me,   
May my realization become equal to the sky.   
Grant your blessings so that I may reach Kuntuzangpo's throne.   
Written by Jigdral Yeshe Dorje for his own prayers,   
Condensing the essential meaning from the vajra words of advice from previous  
great master

**Renunciation**   
" _Master, you are wonderful!_ "   
A student, taking his leave, gazed ardently at the patriarchal sage (Nagendra  
Bhaduri).   
" _You have renounced riches and comforts to seek God and teach us wisdom!_ "   
It was well-known that Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in  
his early childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.   
" _You are reversing the case!_ "   
The saint's face held a mild rebuke.   
" _I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic empire  
of endless bliss.   
How then have I denied myself anything?   
I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice?   
The shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates!   
They relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of  
earthly toys!_"

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 18, 2009, 11:20:23 AM

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when

2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**

his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring

This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM

King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.   
Arunachala Siva.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Skanda 11 Chapter 7  
Author: Ganesh_b01          Date: February 24, 2009, 07:56:33 PM  
---  
King Yadu, a knower of Dharma once met this Avadhuta wandering everywhere  
fearlessly as he chose. He was young and bore the signs of the highest  
enlightenment and asked him thus: O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy,  
though you are without any objects of sense enjoyment and are companionless  
and alone.   
The Avadhuta said to him as follows: I have severak Gurus whom I have mentally accepted as such. Learning many  
lessons from them, I have become free from desires and bondages and I am  
roaming on th earth at large. Hear about those Gurus. There are 24 Gurus whom  
I have resorted to. From their ways and characteristics, I have learnt the  
lessons I need. These 24 Gurus are: Earth, Air, Sky, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Kapoota (Dove), Phython, Ocean,  
River, Moth, Honey-Bee, Elephant, Honey Gatherer, Deer, Fish, Pingala - the  
courtesan, Kurara (Osprey), Maiden, Arrow-Smith, Snake, Spider and Wasp.   
1\. **Earth**   
A man of Self control should not move away from his chosen path even when  
attacked from his chosen path even when attacked by beings under the sway of  
their primordial tendencies, knowing it to be due to their own destiny  
(Prarabdha). This lesson I learnt from Earth. Further a spiritual aspirant  
should learn from the mountains of the earth and trees if them to strive  
unselfishly for the good of others and find the meaning of his existence in  
such striving. Becoming a disciple of trees, he should live for others.   
2. **Air**   
A yogi who is established in Atman consciousness, even if he is embodied in  
material body and performs the various functions appropriate to the body, is  
never affected by the sense objects, as air is not by the smell it carries.   
3\. **Sky**   
Identifying himself with Brahman, the Sage should realise that, like the Sky,  
the Self (Atman) is uncircumscribed and unaffected by the body, because the  
Self indwells all beings moving and unmoving and because he is an invariable  
presence everywhere in all beings. Just as the clouds wafted by the wind do  
not affect the Sky, so the Atman is not tainted by abidence in the body which  
is a combination of various elements into which the Gunas of Prakriti evolve  
when stirred in to activity by Time.   
4\. **Water**   
Pure, Holy, and naturally loving and sweet, the Sage exercises a sanctifying  
influence on men which respect he resembles the Holy waters of the Ganga which  
purify men by sight, contact and praise.   
5\. **Fire**   
Impressive and replenished by the fire of Tapas, inviolable in his greatness,  
having no possessions - not even a bowl but only his stomach as a receptacle  
for food - eating anything and everything, the sage, who is ever in communion  
with Brahman, remains unpolluted lie the all consuming fire. Sometimes hiding  
his identity, sometimes revealing it as worthy of worship by those desiring  
their own welfare, the sage consumes the food offered by donors in order to  
burn up their past and future sins, as fire does with all matters put into it.   
This world, which is of nature of cause and effect, has been created by the  
all powerful Lord by His own power of Maya.. He has entered into it and is  
manifesting Himself in different forms through the adjunct of the body-mind,  
just as Fire does, residing in the fuel.   
Rest in next post.

**Moon**   
The changes that Time, the inscrutable, brings on an individual from the time  
of conception to the events at the cremation ground, affect only the body and  
not Atman, just as the waxing and the waning of the moon are only of its  
digits and not of the Moon itself.   
 **Fire**   
The torrential speed of time is, every moment, effecting the birth and death  
of the bodies that the Atman assumes, but the changes involved are not noticed  
at the time, just like the emergence and subsidence of tongues of flames in a  
raging fire.   
 **Sun**   
Just as the Sun absorbs water with its rays and releases it in proper time as  
rain, so the Yogi accepts objects of the senses with the senses, not for his  
own enjoyment, but to release them to needy people at the proper time.   
When the Atman abides in Himself no difference is experienced; when He abides  
in adjuncts, gross-minded people think of Him as many. It is just like the one  
Sun reflected in different adjuncts like pans of water, being looked upon as  
many and diverse.

**Kapota Bird (Dove)**   
One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or  
anything; otherwise one will have to experience great suffering, just like the  
foolish pigeon.   
There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had  
built a nest within a tree and lived there for several years in her company.  
The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts  
being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the  
others glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely  
bound each other in affection. Naively trusting in the future, they carried  
out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing, playing,  
eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest. Whenever  
she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her  
husband, and he in turn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she  
wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he could not control his  
senses in her association. Then the female pigeon experienced her first  
pregnancy. When the time arrived, she delivered a number of eggs within the  
nest in the presence of her husband. When the time was ripe, baby pigeons,  
with tender limbs and feathers created by the maya of the Lord were born from  
those eggs. The two pigeons became most affectionate to their children and  
took great pleasure in listening to their awkward chirping, which sounded very  
sweet to the parents. Thus with love they began to raise the little birds who  
were born of them. The parent birds became very joyful by observing the soft  
wings of their children, their chirping, their lovely innocent movements  
around the nest and their attempts to jump up and fly. Seeing their children  
happy, the parents were also happy. Their hearts bound to each other by  
affection, the foolish birds, completely bewildered by the maya of Lord Visnu  
continued to take care of the young offspring who had been born to them.   
One day the two heads of the family went out to find food for the children.  
Being very anxious to feed their offspring properly, they wandered all over  
the forest for a long time. At that time a certain hunter who happened to be  
wandering through the forest saw the young pigeons moving about near their  
nest. Spreading out his net he captured them all. When the lady pigeon caught  
sight of her own children trapped within the hunters net, she was overwhelmed  
with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her  
in return. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes  
of intense affection, and thus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in  
the grip of the maya of the Lord, she completely forgot herself, and rushing  
forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the hunters  
net. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself,  
fatally bound in the hunters net along with his dearmost wife, whom he  
considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon began to lament  
wretchedly.   
The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a  
great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not  
satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family which  
was the basis of my dharma, artha and kama is now hopelessly ruined. My wife  
and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact  
accepted me as her worshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and  
her home empty, she has left me behind and gone to heaven with our children.  
Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my  
children are dead. Why should I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained  
by separation from my family that life itself has become simply suffering.   
As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net  
and on the verge of death, pathetically struggling to free themselves, his  
mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunters net. The cruel  
hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and  
all of their children, set off for his own home.   
In this way, one who is too attached to family life becomes disturbed at  
heart. Like the pigeon, he tries to find pleasure in mundane sexual  
attraction. Busily engaged in maintaining his own family, the miserly person  
is fated to suffer greatly, along with all his family members.. The doors of  
liberation are opened wide to one who has achieved human life. But if a human  
being simply devotes himself to family life like the foolish bird in this  
story, then he is to be considered as one who has climbed to a high place only  
to trip and fall down.

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Very nice description. The dove simile comes on many passages   
of Upanishads. Two doves, sitting on a tree, one eating a fruit   
and the other watching it, comes in Katopanishad. Taittirya   
Upanishad takes its name, from the doves, which took the vomited   
food of a disciple (Vedic knowledge), that his guru wanted him   
to give out, since the disciple wronged the guru on some account.

I think this post is left incomplete about the 24 Gurus of Dhathathreya. Here  
is an abridged version of all the 24 Gurus: 1\. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the earth, for it  
endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it does him good  
by producing crops, trees, etc.   
2\. From water I have learnt the quality of purity. Just as the pure water  
cleanses other, so also the sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust,  
egoism, anger, greed, etc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.   
3\. The air is always moving through various objects, but it never gets  
attached to anyone of them; so I have learnt from the air to be without  
attachment, though I move with many people in this world.   
4\. Just as five burns bright, so also the sage should be glowing with the  
splendor of his knowledge and Tapas.   
5\. The air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but  
the sky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky  
that the Atma is all pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.   
6\. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or  
increase, on an account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I  
have learnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that  
it is only the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.   
7\. Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many  
different reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the  
Upadhis (bodies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson  
I have learnt   
8\. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young birds. A fowler spread a net  
and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was very much attached to her  
children. She did not care to live, so she fell into the net and was caught.  
The male Pigeon was attached to the female pigeon, so he also fell into the  
net and was caught. From this I learnt that attachment was the cause of  
bondage.   
9\. The python does not move about for its food. It remains contented with  
whatever it gets and lies in one place. From this I have learnt to be  
unmindful of food and to be contented with whatever I get to eat (Ajahara  
Vritti).   
10\. Just as the ocean remains unmoved even though hundreds of rivers fall  
into it, so also, the wise man should remain unmoved among all sorts of  
temptations, difficulties and troubles. This is the lesson I have learnt from  
the ocean.   
11\. Just as the moth, being enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls  
into it and is burnt up, so also, a passionate man who falls in love with a  
beautiful girl comes to grief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the  
mind on the Self is the lesson I have learnt from the moth.   
12\. Just as black bee sucks the honey from different flowers and does not  
suck it from only one flower, so also I take only a little food from one house  
and a little from another house and thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha  
or Madhukari Vritti). I am not a burden on the householder.   
13\. Bees collect honey with great trouble, but a hunter comes and takes the  
honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealth and other things with great  
difficulty, but they have to leave them all at once and depart when the Lord  
of Death takes hold of them. From this I have learnt the lesson that it is  
useless to hoard things.   
14\. The male elephant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with  
grass, even at the sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught,  
enchained and tortured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps  
of women and come to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the elephant.   
15\. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunter through its love of music.  
Even so, a man is attracted by the music of women of loose character and  
brought to destruction. One should never listen to lewd songs. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the deer.   
16\. Just as a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait,  
so also, the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to  
overpower him, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for  
food must therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the  
fish.   
17\. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was  
tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then she  
decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep. I  
have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of hope  
leads to contentment.   
18\. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pursued and beaten by other  
birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained peace and rest. From this I  
have learnt the lesson that a man in the world undergoes all sorts of troubles  
and miseries when he runs after sensual pleasures and that he becomes as happy  
as the bird when he abandons the sensual pleasures.   
19\. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries and anxieties,  
and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfulness from the  
child.   
20\. The parents of a young girl had gone in search of a proper bridegroom for  
her. The girl was alone in the house. During the absence of the parents, a  
party of people came to the house to see her on a similar mission. She  
received the party herself. She went inside to husk the paddy. While she was  
husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tremendous jingling noise. The  
wise girl reflected thus: The party will detect, by the noise of the bangles,  
that I an husking the paddy myself and that my family is too poor to engage  
others to get the work done. Let me break all my bangles except two on each  
hand. Accordingly, she broke all the bangles except two on each hand. Even  
those two bangles created much noise. She broke one more bangle in each hand.  
There was no further noise though she continued husking. I have learnt from  
the girls experience the following: Living among many would create discord,  
disturbance, dispute and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be  
unnecessary words or strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone  
in solitude.   
21\. A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by  
others. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for  
himself. He should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the  
lesson that I have learnt from the snake.   
22\. The mind of an arrow-maker was once wholly engrossed in sharpening and  
straightening an arrow. While he was thus engaged, a king passed before his  
shop with his whole retinue. After some time, a man came to the artisan and  
asked him whether the king had passed by his shop. The artisan replied that he  
had not noticed anything. The fact was that the artisans mind had been so  
solely absorbed in his work that he had not known the kings passing before  
his shop. I have learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration  
of mind.   
23\. The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into  
cobwebs. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man  
makes a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should  
therefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the  
lesson I have learnt from the spider.   
24\. The Bhringi or the beetle catches hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and  
gives it a sting. The poor worm, always fearing the return of the beetle and  
the sting, and thinking constantly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself.  
Whatever form a main constantly thinks of, he attains in course of time. As a  
man thinks, so he becomes. I have learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn  
myself into Atma by contemplating constantly on It and thus to give up all  
attachment to the body and attain Moksha or liberation.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent abridgement of the story of 24 gurus. Guru comes in many forms and  
each gives one aspect of teaching. The Gurus' ways cannot deciphered at all.  
Once there was a guru who taught his disciple for seven years. At the end of  
the 7th year, the disciple asked the guru whether he could leave. The guru  
said Wait. Then in a few minutes, the guru complained of stomach pain and  
vomitted all that he had eaten. The disciple immediately cupped his hands and  
held the vomitted food. The guru then told him: Please drop this on a place  
where there are no footsteps of any living being, come back and tell me. The  
disciple came back after sometime. The guru asked: Where did you drop the  
vomitted food? The disciple said: "There is no place on the earth, where the  
footsteps of living beings had not fallen. If not humans, every place could  
have been stepped on by animals, birds and ants and such creatures. So I  
thought for a while. The only place on the earth where such footsteps had not  
been there, is my stomach! So I gulped it!"   
The Guru then smiled and said: "You are realized. You can go!"   
Arunachala Siva.
