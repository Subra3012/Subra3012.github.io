Dear everyone,   
I read the caution post on copyright laws from the,   
Mr. Graham Boyd. When I asked for his clarification, he explained   
in a post that writing the full details in a book of Sri Ramansramam,   
is infringing the copy rights. I told him, "Sorry!" Hence, I shall not   
be able to continue, Guru Ramana Vachana Mala or from any other   
book of Asram, in full or in a large part.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
I request you to please continue your dedicated service. Actually, there are  
many people who do not know how many books are there written by Bhagavan,  
written by others in english and tamil. Very few people only know english,  
tamil and sanskrit. As you know languages and understand how to explain, we  
are fortunate to read and learn these poems and meanings. There are so many  
sites which has few books only. Some of them can be down loaded not others.  
Even if I down load, I cannot get the full meaning. It is just like a study  
circle where I am learning lot. Bhagavan has to shower His grace to  
continue.this work Srk udai wrote Astavakra Geetha. There is no body claim  
anything..... What to say...   
As he says we just have to observe. .   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mr. Graham Boyd, is the of this Forum. There are   
copyright laws and there are his instructions. I have to abide by   
them, once I know my mistakes. I am not in a position to continue   
any full text or a large of part of any of Sri Ramansramam publications.   
Please read the book if available or get it from Sri Ramansramam.   
Arunachala Siva.
