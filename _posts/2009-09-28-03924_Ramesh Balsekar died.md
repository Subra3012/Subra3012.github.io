I first heard about it here : http://my-yoga-blog.blogspot.com/   
and got it confirmed by other sources.   
strange to see how "unknown" advaitic teachers are, there is still no news  
about it on the net or in any newspaper.

Ramesh Balsekar had Nisargadatta Maharaj as his Guru. However,   
he also treated Bhagavan Ramana as his prime Guru and kept   
Bhagavan Ramana's photograph in his study. There are a few   
books (mostly lectures and questions & answers recorded) by him,   
the most popular in India being Buddha, Advaita and Nondual Whole. Zen  
Publications, Mumbai publish his books.   
He was working in Central Bank of India and I think he got   
promotions upto General Manager's cadre. He took to advaita   
in his middle age   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, Ramesh Balsekar died Sunday September 27 in his home.   
Ramesh was a wonderful person and a truly great realised advaita teacher.   
I feel very blessed to have met him.   
He left the world an amazing heritage with many many books he wrote.
