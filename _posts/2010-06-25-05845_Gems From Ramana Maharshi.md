## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Gems From Ramana Maharshi

Meditation is not so much thinking of the Self as giving up thinking of the  
notSelf.When you give up thinking of outward objects and prevent your mind  
from going outwards by turning it inwards and fixing it in the Self, the Self  
alone remains.   
The proper way to get rid of a desire is to find out "Who gets the desire?  
What is its source?" When this is found, the desire is rooted out and it will  
never again emerge or grow.   
 **The mind turned inwards is the Self; turned outwards, it becomes the ego  
and all the world.**   
You, being the Self, want to know how to attain the Self. It is something like  
a man being at Ramanasramam asking how many ways there are to reach  
Ramanasramam and which is the best way for him.   
 **There is no alternative for you but to accept the world as unreal if you  
are seeking the truth and the truth alone.**   
<span style="font-style:italic;">The idea of time is only in your mind. It is  
not in the Self. There is no time for the Self. Time arises as an idea after  
the ego arises.   
[/b]   
The mind is merely thoughts. Of all thoughts the thought "I" is the  
root.Therefore, the mind is only the thought "I."   
When King Janaka exclaimed, "Now I have discovered the thief who has been  
ruining me all along. He shall be dealt with summarily," the king was really  
referring to the ego or the mind.   
The mind will subside only by means of the inquiry, "Who am I?" The thought  
"Who am I," destroying all other thoughts, will itself finally be destroyed  
like the stick used for stirring the funeral pyre.   
Just as a pearldiver tying a stone to his waist dives into the sea and takes  
the pearl lying at the bottom, so everyone, diving deep within himself with  
nonattachment,can attain the pearl of the Self.   
He who thinks he is the doer is also the sufferer.   
 **There is no standard by which to judge something to be right and another to  
be wrong. Opinions differ according to the nature of the individual and  
according to the surroundings. They are ideas, and nothing more.   
Whatever this body is to do and whatever experiences it is to pass through was  
already decided when it came into existence.   
 **Surrender can never be regarded as complete so long as the devotee wants  
this or that from the Lord.**   
The sense of doership is bondage, and not the actions themselves. "Be still  
and know that I am God." Stillness will prevail and there will be no agitation  
of the mind. Agitation of the mind is the cause of desire, the sense of  
doership, and of personality, or the personal sense of "I." If that is  
stopped,there is quiet.   
 **Renunciation does not imply apparent divesting of costumes, family  
ties,home, etc., but renunciation of desires and attachment.   
There are only two ways to conquer destiny or be independent of it. One is to  
enquire for whom is this destiny, and discover that only the ego is bound by  
destiny and not the Self, and that the ego is non-existent.   
The other way is to kill the ego by completely surrendering to the Lord, by  
realizing one's helplessness and saying all the time, `Not I, but Thou Oh  
Lord' and giving up all sense of `I' and `mine', and leaving it to the Lord to  
do what he likes with you.   
Complete effacement of the ego is necessary to conquer destiny, whether you  
achieve this effacement through Self- enquiry or bhakti marga (path of  
devotion).   
 **From silence came thought, from thought the ego, and from ego speech. So,  
if speech is effective, how much more so must be its source?**

What will it be like when one achieves Self-realization? a devotee asked.  
The question is wrong, one does not realize anything new, said Bhagavan. I  
do not get you, Swami, persisted the devotee. It is very simple. Now you  
feel you are in the world. There you feel that the world is in you, explained  
Bhagavan.   
One day when the doctor was dressing Bhagavans arm,they chatted about taking  
photos. Bhagavan said, In a pinhole camera, when the hole is small, you see  
shapes and colours.When the hole is made big, the images disappear and one  
sees only clear light. Similarly when the mind is small and narrow, it is full  
of shapes and words. When it broadens,it sees pure light. When the box is  
destroyed altogether, only   
the light remains.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Meditation is more about giving up the non-Self.   
Once Tiruvalluvar was have some need for money and so he   
went to a landlord's house for seeking some loan. The landlord's   
wife said that her husband is meditating and it will take some one   
more hour. Tiruvalluvar said: Alright, I shall wait.   
After an hour, the landlord came out and talked to the saint poet.   
He asked: When did you come?   
Tiruvalluvar said: When you were thinking about the 100 gold   
coins that you had lent to someone but not yet repaid!   
Arunachala Siva.

I read in a book about Thruvalluvar. I forgot the name of the book. It says  
Thruvalluvar is a brahma jnani and more over he is a shiva bhakta. Once Shiva  
was dancing i.e. Ananda Thandavam. The sabha was full with lots of devotees  
like Nandi, Pulipanni and Pathanjali. That time shiva's ear ring (kundalam)  
fell off. but He did not stop the dance and He picked up with the leg from the  
ground and put it back on His ear. After the dance He asked "Have any body  
seen any new thing today. Everyone shook their head. Shiva told them. "go and  
ask Thruvalluvar"   
When they came asked Thruvalluvar." he said... EZHI NAKKUM EEZHI (POOR MAN)  
ARRIVENO   
KUZHI ( SHIVA'S HEIR) NAKKUM KOOTHU. means..... weavers before begining their  
work they have to put the thread into the weaving machine (thari) they have to  
wet the thread tip of the thread. So from this point we come to know that He  
was weaving. So He says I am a poor weaver how could I know Shiva's Leela.   
It shows Thruvalluvar was living in a society, carried His day to day life  
with full of brahma jnanam
