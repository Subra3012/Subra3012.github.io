## Now let us see Panchangam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 27, 2009, 12:51:36 PM

Panchangam is a Indian almanac, which is formally read out in   
temples on the New Year day, (Tamil/Malayalam or Telugu/Kannada   
new year day, Vishu or Ugadi. One day during Naicker king's rule   
in Madurai, a poet who was also a great astrololger came to Naicker's   
court to read out a poem on the New Year day to get some new year gifts. The  
others in the court made fun of him (since he was also an   
astrologer) saying: Now that he has come, let us read Panchangam!   
Panchangam is where one knows the tithi, nakshatra, karana, yoga   
and muhurta of a day. Since five things are mainly seen, it is called   
Panchangam. The poet immediately read a extempore verse: O Siva, Nataraja, I see today your Panchangas.   
The fire on your left hand burns up the karmas,   
The drum on your right hand teaches the Pranava,   
On knowing Pranava, I look at your right hand, abhaya kara,   
That leads me to your left hand vara kara,   
When I contemplate on that, it leads to me   
To your kunchita pata*   
Which makes me merge in your Sivam** (Consciousness).   
(* kunchita pata is the raised curved right foot.   
Sivam is Siva Consciousness, Self Realization.)   
Here the Panchanga are left hand, right hand, abhaya kara,   
vara kara, kunchita pata.   
The king and the other poets were dumbstruck.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Bhakti Marga and Jnana Marga - 3

There could be no better proof that the path of devotion is compatible with  
Knowledge than Bhagavan Ramana's Marital Garland of Letters   
to Sri Arunachala.   
Take for instance, verse 45 of the poem: "Weak though my effort was, by Thy  
Grace I gained the Self, Oh Arunachala!" It is said   
that tears of ecstatic ardour streamed down His face as He composed it!  
Certainly, it is one of the supreme symbolical love poems of all   
ages and all religions. It has always remained the emotional treasure of His  
devotees, as the Forty Verses in Reality is their doctrinal foundation.   
Verse 20 of Forty Verses on Reality says: "Seeing God without seeing the Self who sees is only a mental image.   
Only he who has seen himself has seen God,   
since he has lost his individuality and   
nothing remain but God."

Arunachala Siva.

Friends,   
I desire to write a complete commentary on Yoga Vasistham. The illustrous way  
in which Yoga Vasishta shows the Truth has impressed me a lot. This is my  
first attempt at the Scripture.   
I have lot of hurdles to cross before presenting the complete sanskrit text  
with translation and study. The first of these is, i need to improve my  
sanskrit. Then i need to make a through first time study of the total text.  
Understanding that this might take a long time. .. i decided to take a plunge  
into it here, with only some important verses explained in detailed and rest  
of the events explained as stories.   
I also wish to take advantage of the audiance here. .. Their Experience and  
expertise will give me important clues and correct any mistakes.   
So please keep this thread alive with your wonderful suggestions.   
This is one of the threads i would love to keep alive for a long time. Let us  
see how things go.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Udai,   
Excellent, I pray for your success! Yoga Vasishtam is an excellent scripture  
to dive deep and get the pearls of knowledge.

## Re:[2]TAT TVAM ASI  Yoga Vasishtam

Yoga Vasistha or Vasishtamaharamayana was told by Valmiki to Baradwaja.   
Having written the Ramayana maha kavya, Valmiki gave it to Baradwaja.  
Baradwaja recited the story of Rama to Brahma. Brahma was highly impressed by  
the scripture. Then Baradwaja requested Brahma to teach him the approach to go  
beyond incompleteness. Brahma then instructs him to return to Valmiki and  
request him to complete the task; after this, Brahma himself accompanied  
Baradwaja to Valmiki ashramam.   
Valmiki first wrote the story of Rama in Poorva Ramayana or the original  
Ramayana mahakavya. Upon request from Brahma and Baradwaja. .. Valmiki tells  
them the conversation that took place between Sri Rama and Vasistha which  
forms what is called as Uttara Ramayana or Vasistha maha Ramayana.   
Yoga Vasistha explains in a step by step fashion how this Truth can be lived.  
The truth is explained with stories of how many great people lived it up. The  
stories some times explain the philosophic point and at most other places,  
they actually "show" how one can live this Truth.The scripture also explains  
the truth very clearly and elaborately: explaining all the intricacies.   
Sankaracharya says in Brahmajnanavalimala: Brahma Satyam jagat mithya jivo brahmaiva na parah [Brahman is SAT (That which  
is changeless Truth), The world (jagat) is Mithya (appears to be, but in  
reality not there at all). Jivatma is none other than Brahman (Paramatma)].   
That is the ultimate teaching of all scriptures. Now, to a very advanced  
person with a simple and pure mind this teaching is sufficient. The one who is  
not ready for it, however, needs to be taught this truth.   
This scripture is essentially for a person who wants to go beyond suffering  
and actually knows that the worldly objects cannot fulfill him. Knowing that  
the materialistic accomplishments can never make him Complete... when a  
disciple approaches this scripture, it acts as a Guru to show the way.  
Therefore the qualification required is undoubtedly vairagya. But the  
scripture also increases vairagya. So a qualified person is he who with the  
help of the scripture can become detached. That is he is not so attached that  
even after all this teachings he does not see the world as a dream.   
There is another question that is asked: "Sir, tell me does one attain  
liberation through actions(karma) or Jnana (Knowledge)". And It starts by  
saying that just as a bird needs two wings to fly, one needs both these. At  
the same time Vasishta also makes it clear that going on pilgrimages, doing  
various rituals etc cannot help! So what kind of karma helps ? to this he  
gives 4 simple ways to find liberation: 1) Vairagya   
2) Contentment   
3) Satsanga   
4) Vichara   
These are the four kinds of mental actions that can help. Vairagya means to  
detach oneself mentally from the idea that the materialistic objects are real.  
Contentment means being satisfied with what IS. Sat-Sangam means the company  
of holy or more precisely, Being with the Self. And Vichara means inquiry to  
find out who i am.   
Vasistha does not say remain effortless... that is not a practical solution.  
Ramana was once asked:"how to remain effortless" and he replied: "now u cannot  
remain effortless and after realization you cannot put effort".   
The truth has to be understood. There is really nothing like mental / physical  
effortlessness. And as the Self, there is no possibility of effort. We shall  
study this more clearly as we proceed.   
So, Vasistha says effort is required. .. but the effort which leads to  
liberation has to be in one of these directions. These are ways to get  
established in the Self; that is, knowing the Truth from a Teacher one has to  
practice these to remain firmly established as the Self.   
With this understanding if we see. ..   
should i do a yagna or sacrifice? Yes if it helps you get one of the above (4  
qualities) and not otherwise.   
Same with any other practice. a sadhana which does not help us achieve these  
is useless.   
Let us see how to live spirituality through this text.   
Love!
