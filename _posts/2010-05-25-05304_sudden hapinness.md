When some happy thing happens in life without any struggle how we should  
react. Is it Bhagavan's grace to enjoy or is He testing us how we will react.  
Or just keep watching without enjoying the situation.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
When something happy happens, be happy about it. But do not   
drown in that happiness for ever. Thank Bhagavan Ramana and   
proceed further in life. Similarly when something miserable happens,   
drown in that flame of sorrow for sometime. Seek Bhagavan Ramana's grace and  
proceed further.   
When exam results come, and you find that you have passed   
in first class with good marks. Fine. Be happy. But that is not   
the end in itself. There are further steps, higher education or   
a suitable job etc., Thank Bhagavan and proceed further.   
Similarly when you fail, suffer the agony for sometime and here   
again, it is no an end itself. Proceed to write a further attempt   
with more vigor.   
Arunachala Siva.
