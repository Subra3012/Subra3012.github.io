## Rules?  
Author: RobertAdam          Date: April 07, 2010, 02:32:51 PM

Is there anything i should know whilst posting here?   
I just read that we can not mention gurus that have not been dead for 50  
years, is that serious!?   
There are many teachers nowadays teaching self inquiry, it seems strange to  
say they can't be talked about in a Ramana Maharshi forum   
Ramana has spawned a huge upsurge in this timeless teaching of self  
invesitgation, i feel we should embrace it in all its forms?   
Im not challenging the forum, if thats the rules, then so be it...

Dear RobertAdam,   
Some stray references can be made in posts. Commentaries   
of others can be quoted with due reference to the source, and   
even here, it should be limited.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Robert,   
I have refrained from responding to your query because it only creates  
controversy. But I made the rule for some very good reasons.   
As the title of this forum states, it is dedicated to Arunachala and Bhagavan  
Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
Arunachala is reputed to be Lord Siva incarnate in the form of a mountain and  
just being here is a blessing itself. Bhagavan was without doubt a real Jnani  
of the highest order. His words are available to everyone, in a clear and  
precise manner that go straight to the heart. The puranas are also there to be  
read and absorbed.   
It is my view and that of thousands of others, that no further elucidation is  
required, but there are always exceptions.   
So now we come to my responsibility.   
In my fourteen years of coming to Arunachala, 11 of which were spent inside  
the ashram, I witnessed the antics of many of these modern gurus, heard the  
stories of lust, greed and power and saw many things that deeply disturbed me,  
but it is not my job to stand in judgement of others, there is power far  
higher than me that will and does do that, as we have often witnessed here.   
This website in both its incarnations as ramana-maharshi.org and arunachala-  
ramana.org is considered to be something of a reference site and therefore has  
a responsibility to its visitors to neither knowingly or inadvertently lead  
them in the wrong direction.   
Finally and perhaps most important: It is said that to help someone to overcome the cycle of birth and death is  
the greatest service that you can render to God. It is also said that to  
disturb someone's faith in God is the one crime that is **never** forgiven. So  
I selfishly took the decision to limit the site and forum to the subjects  
listed above, all of which are safe.   
Graham

Dear Sri Graham,   
Namaste. I also thank you for your lucid clarification, which sets   
at rest, many many doubts and questions in the matter. Thank you.   
Arunachala Siva.
