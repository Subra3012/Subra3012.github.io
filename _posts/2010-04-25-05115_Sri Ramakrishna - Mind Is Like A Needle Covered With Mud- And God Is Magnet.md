## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna Taught His disciples process of renunciation

**To destroy the pride and egotism of His disciples, Sri Ramakrishna told them  
to wear the [p. 417] seamless ochre robe of the Sannyasin and to take up the  
begging-bowl. Being Himself a perfect Sannyasin, He loved to see His disciples  
following Him in the path of renunciation. On different occasions He sent them  
out, as Buddha and Sankara had done with their disciples, to beg food from  
door to door.**   
One morning He called certain among His beloved ones,-Narendra, Sarat, Jogen,  
Niranjan, Kali,--and asked them whether they could go forth with the  
Sannyasin's begging-bowl and beg uncooked food for Him. It was indeed a great  
blow to the caste pride as well as to the sense of self-respect of these young  
disciples.   
**Obeying the Master 's wish, however, they took the beggingbowl in their  
hands, walked from door to door in the neighborhood, collected various  
articles of food, brought them before their Master and offered them at His  
holy feet. Bhagavan Ramakrishna, blessed them and rejoiced at their sincere  
and earnest devotion. This was the manner in which the Bhagavan initiated His  
disciples in the life of absolute renunciation. [p. 418]

NEIGHTBOUR: "Sir, is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of  
a householder?"   
MASTER: "Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company and  
pray unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the mind are  
thus washed away, one realizes God.   
**The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet.The  
needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears wash  
away the mud, which is nothing but lust, anger, greed, and other evil  
tendencies, and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well.**   
As soon as the mud is washed away, the magnet attracts the needle, that is to  
say, man realizes God. Only the pure in heart see God. A fever patient has an  
excess of the watery element in his system. What can quinine do for him unless  
that is removed?   
"Why shouldn't one realize God while living in the world? But, as I said,  
**one must live in holy company, pray to God, weeping for His grace, and now  
and then go into solitude. Unless the plants on a foot-path are protected at  
first by fences, they are destroyed by cattle. "**

The needle - magnet simile has also been given by Bhagavan   
Ramana in Verse 16 of Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: Like magnet attracting iron, you magnetize me and be with me,   
O Arunachala!   
Sri Sankara says in Sri Sivananada Lahari: Like the seeds   
of Erezhinjal and the tree. Erezhinjal is a tree, I do not   
know the botanical or English name. When its seeds fall down,   
the tree attracts them as magnet and take them back and these   
seeds grow into a tree nearby in due course.   
Arunachala Siva.
