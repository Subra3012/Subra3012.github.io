**Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora   
ADDRESS AT THE RAMESWARAM TEMPLE ON REAL WORSHIP**   
 **It is in love that religion exists and not in ceremony, in the pure and  
sincere love in the heart.Unless a man is pure in body and mind, his coming  
into a temple and worshipping Shiva is useless.** The prayers of those that  
are pure in mind and body will be answered by Shiva, and those that are impure  
and yet try to teach religion to others will fail in the end. External worship  
is only a symbol of internal worship; but internal worship and purity are the  
real things. Without them, external worship would be of no avail. Therefore  
you must all try to remember this.   
 **People have become so degraded in this Kali Yuga that they think they can  
do anything, and then they can go to a holy place, and their sins will be  
forgiven. If a man goes with an impure mind into a temple, he adds to the sins  
that he had already, and goes home a worse man than when he left it. He who  
sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really worships  
Shiva; and if he sees Shiva only in the image, his worship is but  
preliminary.** He who has served and helped one poor man seeing Shiva in him,  
without thinking of his caste, or creed, or race, or anything, with him Shiva  
is more pleased than with the man who sees Him only in temples.   
Let me tell you again that you must be pure and help any one who comes to you,  
as much as lies in your power. And this is good Karma. By the power of this,  
the heart becomes pure (Chitta-shuddhi), and then Shiva who is residing in  
every one will become manifest. He is always in the heart of every one. If  
there is dirt and dust on a mirror, we cannot see our image. So ignorance and  
wickedness are the dirt and dust that are on the mirror of our hearts.  
Selfishness is the chief sin, thinking of ourselves first. He who thinks, "I  
will eat first, I will have more money than others, and I will possess  
everything", he who thinks, "I will get to heaven before others I will get  
Mukti before others" is the selfish man. **The unselfish man says, "I will be  
last, I do not care to go to heaven, I will even go to hell if by doing so I  
can help my brothers." **This unselfishness is the test of religion. He who  
has more of this unselfishness is more spiritual and nearer to Shiva. Whether  
he is learned or ignorant, he is nearer to Shiva than anybody else, whether he  
knows it or not. And if a man is selfish, even though he has visited all the  
temples, seen all the places of pilgrimage, and painted himself like a  
leopard, he is still further off from Shiva.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana has also said God is Love. Anbe Sivam.   
Love is Siva or Consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.
