## Ryokan Poem  
Author: rideforever         Date: December 27, 2009, 09:22:05 PM

My hut lies in the middle of the dense forest.   
Every year the ivy grows longer,   
no news of the affairs of men,   
only the occasional song of a woodcutter.   
The sun shines, I mend my robe.   
When the moon is out I read poems.   
I have nothing to report.

Dear rideover,   
Excellent. Once some thieves came to Zen Master Bosho's cottage   
and stole away most of his meagre belongings. "The police came   
next day and asked the Zen Master to identity the thieves, whom   
they had brought with them. Bosho said: I am not able to identify   
anyone. If anyone had come yesterday and asked for things from   
me, I might have given. There was no need to steal. I wish I had   
given the moon him. You can go now. I have nothing to report."   
Bhagavan Ramana also said, when the thieves had been caught   
by T'malai police and brought to Him next morning: " I do not know any of  
them!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Here is another great story about Ryokan.   
 _Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the  
foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there  
was nothing in it to steal.   
Ryokan returned and caught him. "You may have come a long way to visit me," he  
told the prowler, "and you shoud not return emptyhanded. Please take my  
clothes as a gift."   
The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.   
Ryokan sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow, " he mused, "I wish I could  
give him this beautiful moon."_   
And another zen story that I love.   
 _" The Zen master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living a pure  
life.   
A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near him.  
Suddenly, without any warning, her parents discovered she was with child.   
This made her parents very angry. She would not confess who the man was, but  
after much harassment at last named Hakuin.   
In great anger the parents went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he would  
say.   
After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost  
his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the  
child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the little one  
needed.   
A year later the girl-mother could stand it no longer. She told her parents  
the truth - that the real father of the child was a young man who worked in  
the fishmarket.   
The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his  
forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back again.   
Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child, all he said was: "Is that so?"_

from Subramaniam's post: Quote  
Bhagavan Ramana also said, when the thieves had been caught..." I do not know  
any of them!"  
supposing I was the thief and comprehended what was also being said here, I  
would have been mortified -- Ramana saying that he knew them would mean that  
they would only be carted away to a physical jail....

Because Bhagavan Ramana did not want even the bugs in His   
sofa to be killed, He said that He did not know the thief. But   
if that thief could 'feel' Bhagavan's mercy and have his attitude   
to undergo change thenceforth, that is a great spiritual improvement,   
is it not? This was precisely what He wanted to do about the coolie   
who was misbehaving with a lady-labourer. But Asramam authorities 'punished'  
him and he went away in anger and shame.   
Arunachala Siva.
