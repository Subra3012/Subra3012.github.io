**God-consciousness does not come so long as there are three things in the  
heart,--shame, hatred and fear.** These three and caste pride are the fetters  
of the soul. When these fetters are broken, freedom is attained. Bound by  
fetters is Jiva (the ego), free from fetters is Shiva (God).   
Every man has certain debts to pay,--a debt to the Divine Spirit, a debt to  
the sages, debt to mother, to father, to the wife. No man can renounce  
everything without paying off these debts. **But if his soul be intoxicated  
with Divine Love and become mad after God, then he is free from all duties and  
debts. Then who is his father, who is his mother and who is his wife?**

Bhagavan Ramana says about shame: Manam kondu urupavar maanathai azhithu   
Abhimanam illathu oLir Arunachala - Verse 77 of Sri AAMM.   
Accepting those who approach you with attachment (with the   
sense of self respect), you destroy their individuality and then   
shine free from wrong attachment and identity with individuals,   
O Arunachala!   
He says about fear, adhyryam.   
Dhyriamodum un mei aham naada yan   
Thattashinden aruL Arunachala \- Verse 50 of Sri AAMM.   
Boldly seeking your true Self, I am ship-wrecked, ruined.   
Have mercy on me, O Arunachala!   
Bhagavan then speaks about hatred, (anger): Kobam il gunathoy kuRiyai enaik koLa   
Kurai en seythen Arunachala! - Verse 25 of Sri AAMM.   
O Arunachala, unruffled by anger, what fault have I committed   
that you do not make me, that is, my ego, your target?   
(English Translation - Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
