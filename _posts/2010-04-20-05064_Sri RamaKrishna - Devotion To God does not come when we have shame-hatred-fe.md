IN a forest there lived a holy man who had many disciples. One day he taught  
them to see God in all beings and knowing this, to bow low before them all.   
A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for the sacrificial fire.  
Suddenly he heard an outcry,"Get out of the way! A mad elephant is coming!"   
All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels. He reasoned that the  
elephant was also God in another form.   
Then why should he run away from it? He stood still, bowed before the animal,  
and began to sing its praises. The mahut of the elephant was shouting: "Run  
away! Runaway!"   
But the disciple didn't move. The. animal seized him with its trunk, cast him  
to one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay  
unconscious on the ground.   
Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother disciples came to him  
and carried him, to the hermitage.   
With the help of some medicine he soon regained consciousness.   
Someone asked him, "You knew the elephant was comingwhy didn't you leave the  
place?" "But," he said, "Our teacher has told us that God Himself has taken  
all these forms, of animals as well as men. Therefore, thinking it was only  
the elephant God that was coming, I didn't run away."   
**At this the teacher said: "Yes, my child,it is true that the elephant God  
was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to stay there. Since all are  
manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the mahut's words? You should have  
heeded the words of the mahut God."   
God dwells in all beings. But you may be intimate only with good people; you  
must keep away from the evil-minded. God is even in the tiger; but you cannot  
embrace the tiger on that account!  
You may say, "Why run away from a tiger, which is also a manifestation of  
God?"   
The answer to that is: Those who tell you to run away arc also manifestations  
of Godand why shouldn't you listen to them?   
God undoubtedly dwells in the hearts of allholy and unholy, righteous and  
unrighteous; but a man should not have dealings with the unholy, the wicked,  
the impure. He must not be intimate with them. With some of them he may  
exchange words,but with others one shouldn't go even that far.   
One should keep aloof from such people.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna : Those who quarrel about the nature of God  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 19, 2010, 09:06:45 AM

FOUR blind men went out to see an elephant. One touched the leg of the  
elephant and said, "The elephant is like a pillar." The second touched the  
trunk and said, "The elephant is like a thick club." The third touched the  
belly and said, "The elephant is like a big jar." The fourth touched the ears  
and said, "The elephant is like a big winnowing basket." Thus they began to  
dispute hotly amongst themselves as to the shape of the elephant.   
A passer-by, seeing them thus quarrelling, said,"What is it you are disputing  
about?" They told him everything and asked him to arbitrate. The man said: "None of you has seen the elephant. The elephant is not like a pillar, its  
legs are like pillars. It is not like a winnowing basket, its ears are like  
winnowing baskets. It is not like a stout club, its trunk is like a club. The  
elephant is the combination of all theselegs, ears, belly, trunk and so on."   
 **In the same manner, those who quarrel (about the nature of God) have each  
seen only some one aspect of the Deity.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says our heart must be pure

A SANNYASIN dwelt by the side of a temple.There was the house of a harlot in  
front. Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute's house, the  
sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: "You are a great  
sinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot hereafter."   
The poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her misdeeds, and with genuine  
inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching forgiveness. But as  
prostitution was her profession,she could not easily adopt any other means of  
earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh sinned, she always  
reproached herself with greater contrition of heart and prayed to God more  
and, more for forgiveness.   
The sannyasin saw that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon her,  
and thought, "Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the course  
of her life." And from that day forward, whenever any person entered the house  
of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble aside,and in  
course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.   
One day the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: "Woman,  
don't you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission of the  
deadly sin you have been indulging in since. I advised you last to desist from  
the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil deeds!" The poor  
wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation of her sins, and she  
prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness, inwardly repeating, "Lord,  
wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life that I am leading?" The prayer  
was heard, and on that very day the angel of death passed by her house, and  
she ceased to exist in this world. By the strange will of God, the sannyasin  
also died on the same day.   
The messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body of  
the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers of Yama  
bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether world.  
The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud: "Is this  
the subtle justice of   
God? I passed all my life in asceticism and poverty,and I am carried to hell,  
while that prostitute,whose life was a whole record of sin, is going to  
Heaven!"   
Hearing this, the messengers of Vishnu said: "The decrees of God are always  
just; as you think, so you reap. You passed your life in external show and  
vanity, trying to get honour and fame;and God has given you this. Your heart  
never sincerely yearned after Him.   
**This prostitute earnestly prayed to God day and night, though her body  
sinned all the while. Look at the treatment which your body and her body are  
receiving from those below. As you never sinned with your body,they have  
decorated it with flowers and garlands,and are carrying it with music in a  
procession to consign it to the sacred river. But this prostitute 's body,  
which had sinned is being torn to pieces at this moment by vultures and  
jackals.   
Nevertheless, she was pure in heart and is therefore going to the regions of  
the pure. Your heart was always absorbed in contemplating her sins and thus  
became impure. You are therefore going to the regions of the impure. You were  
the real prostitute, and not she."**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna : one needs images of God so long he not realized in true form  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 19, 2010, 09:18:00 AM  
---  
The disciple asked: "Bhagavan, one may believe that God is with form, but  
surely He is not in the earthen images that are worshipped?" Sri Ramakrishna  
replied: "My dear sir, why do you say earthen images? The image of the Divine  
Being is made of the spirit."   
The disciple could not understand the meaning of this, but answered: "Yet  
should it not be one's duty to make clear to those who worship images that God  
is not the same as the images and that at the time of worship they should  
think of God Himself and not of the image made of clay?"   
The Bhagavan said: "The Lord of the universe teaches mankind. He who has made  
the sun and moon, men and brutes; He who has created things for them to live  
upon, parents to tend and rear them; He who has done so many things will  
surely do something to bring them to the light. [p. 63]   
 **The Lord dwells in the temple of the human body. He knows our innermost  
thoughts. If there is anything wrong in image worship, does He not know that  
all worship is meant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing that it  
is for Him. Why should you worry yourself about things which are beyond your  
reach? Try to realize God and love Him. This is your first duty. "You speak of  
images made of clay.  
Well, there often comes a necessity for worshipping such images and symbols.  
In Vedanta it is said, the absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss pervades the  
universe and manifests itself through all forms. What harm is done by  
worshipping the Absolute through images and symbols? We see little girls with  
their dolls.   
How long do they play with them? So long as they are not married. After  
marriage they put away those dolls. **Similarly, one needs images and symbols  
so long as God is not realized in His true form.** It is God Himself who has  
provided these various forms of worship. [p. 64]   
 **The Master of the universe has done all this to suit different men in  
different stages of spiritual growth and knowledge. The mother so arranges the  
food for her children that each one gets what is best for him. Suppose a  
mother has five children with one fish to cook for all. She will make  
different dishes of it that she may give to each just what suits him,-- the  
rich pulao for one, soup for another, fried fish for a third, fish with sour  
tamarind for a fourth and so on, exactly according to the power of digestion  
of each.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna says Sense of "I" vanishes at the approach of Divine wisdom  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 19, 2010, 09:20:31 AM

Each attribute limits the soul and modifies its nature. He who dresses smartly  
will naturally sing love songs, play cards and carry a cane, and such things  
will appeal to him. **If you have a pencil in your hand, you will  
unconsciously scribble on anything; such is the power of the pencil. Money has  
great power. When a man becomes wealthy his nature is entirely changed.** He  
is a different being. A poor Brahmin, for instance, used to come here. He was  
very humble. He lived on the other side of the Ganges. One day as I was  
landing from a boat, I saw him sitting at the riverside. Seeing me, he shouted  
in a disrespectful tone, "Hello! is it you, my good fellow?" Immediately I  
understood by his manner that he had got hold of some money, otherwise he  
would not dare to address me thus.   
A toad had a Rupee in its hole. An elephant was coming that way and passed  
over the hole. The toad was very angry; it came out and was about to kick the  
elephant, saying: "How darest thou pass over me?" Such is the power of wealth!  
It makes one so egotistic. **This sense of "I," however, vanishes at the  
approach of Divine wisdom, which leads to super-consciousness (Samadhi) and  
eventually to God-consciousness.** But it is very difficult to acquire this  
Divine wisdom. **[p. 53]**   
You may cut the branches of a fig-tree to-day, but to-morrow you will see that  
new twigs are sprouting. If this sense of "I" will not leave, then let it stay  
as the servant of God. "O God! Thou art my Lord, I am Thy servant!" Think in  
this way: "I am His servant, I am His Bhakta, devotee." There is no harm in  
this kind of "I." Sweet things cause dyspepsia and acidity, but crystallized  
sugar-candy is harmless. The path of wisdom is very difficult. It cannot be  
followed so long as the sense of "I" is connected with the body. In this age  
the consciousness of the body and the sense of "I" cannot be overcome easily.  
[p. 56]   
 **But in the path of devotion, through prayer and the repetition of His Holy  
Name with extreme longing, God can be reached without fail.** Devotee: Bhagavan, dost Thou teach us to renounce the worldly "I" and not the sense of  
the servant "I"? Ramakrishna: Yes, the servant "I" or "I am the servant of  
God," "I am His devotee," this egoism is not bad but on the contrary it helps  
us to realize God. Devotee: Bhagavan, does he who has the sense of the servant  
"I" possess passion and anger? Ramakrishna: If this attitude of a servant be  
genuine and perfect, then passion and anger will drop off leaving only a scar  
in the mind. This "I" of a Bhakta or devotee does no harm to any living  
creature. It is like a sword which, after touching the Philosopher's Stone, is  
turned to gold. The sword retains the same form but it cannot cut or injure  
anyone. The dry leaves of the cocoanut-tree drop off in the wind, leaving a  
mark on the trunk; that mark proves that there was a leaf there at one time.  
Similarly, the scar of the sense of "I" remains in the mind of one who has  
realized God, but his whole nature is transformed into that of an innocent  
child. **[p. 57]**   
 **The mind may be compared to a needle. If a needle be covered with thick  
mud, it is not attracted by the magnet; but when the mud is washed off, the  
magnet attracts it. [Power of repentance] Similarly, when the mind is covered  
with the mud of worldliness, it does not feel the attraction of the Lord;**  
but whosoever repents, saying: "O Lord, I shall never again commit such an  
act," and sheds tears of true repentance, washes off all impurities and the  
magnet of the Lord then attracts the needle of the mind. Instantly super-  
consciousness comes and is followed by God-vision. **[p. 60]**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna about attachment to worldly objects  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 20, 2010, 08:49:27 AM  
---  
Turning to Bijoy, who had come in, the Bhagavan continued: Shivanath, the  
leader of the Brahmo Samaj, has great cares, he has to edit a newspaper and do  
various other works In attending to worldly affairs, one naturally loses peace  
of mind and is overwhelmed with worries and anxieties. **It is said in the  
Bhagavat that Avadhuta made twenty-four Gurus.**   
The kite was one of them. In a certain place some fishermen were catching  
fish, a kite swooped down and snatched a fish. Seeing the kite with the fish  
in its claw, hundreds of crows flew after him and began to caw, making a great  
noise.   
In whatever direction the kite flew, the crows followed. When he flew to the  
south, they pursued him; when he flew to the north, they were after him, and  
he found no peace in any direction. At last the kite dropped the fish. Then  
the crows flew after the fish and the kite rested calmly on the branch of a  
high tree.   
**He thought within himself: "That fish was the cause of all this trouble. Now  
that I no longer have it, I am happy and in perfect peace." The Avadhuta  
learned from this kite that as long as a man is attached to worldly objects,  
so long he has toil, cares, anxiety, unrest and unhappiness. When attachment  
is gone, all works end, and then comes peace. But work without attachment is  
good; it does not bring unrest. [p. 67]**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna says wealth, their fame and social position are transitory  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 20, 2010, 08:55:56 AM  
---  
**Some people are proud of their wealth, their fame and social position, but  
these things are transitory.** None can take them away after death. It is not  
good to be proud of wealth. You may say, "I am wealthy," but then there are  
millionaires, multimillionaires, and so on. _In the evening fireflies think  
that they are lighting the world; but when the stars begin to shine, their  
pride is subdued._   
_The stars in turn think that they are lighting the world, but when the moon  
shines, the stars are put to shame. The moon, too, believes that her light  
illumines everything; but lo! the dawn appears and the rising sun effaces the  
light of the moon. If wealthy people thought of these things, they would no  
longer be proud of their wealth._   
A householder! Revered Sir, we are householders; please give us some further

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna Says about True Knowledge And Devotion

If you want butter, you must curdle the milk and set it in a place where no  
one can disturb it; otherwise the curd will not stand. Then churn it and the  
butter will rise. Similarly the neophyte should sit in solitude and not be  
disturbed by worldly-minded people; then through the churning of the settled  
mind by the practice of meditation the butter of Divine Love will be acquired.   
**If you give your mind to God in solitude, you will obtain the spirit of true  
renunciation and absolute devotion. If you give the same mind to the world, it  
will grow worldly and think of woman and gold.** _The world may be likened to  
water, and the mind to milk. Pure milk once mixed with water cannot be  
separated from it; but if it is first turned into butter and then placed in  
water, it can remain separate._   
 **Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means  
of religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with  
the water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the  
world. Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart  
from the world.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna : Devotion To God does not come when we have shame,hatred,fear

**God-consciousness does not come so long as there are three things in the  
heart,--shame, hatred and fear.** These three and caste pride are the fetters  
of the soul. When these fetters are broken, freedom is attained. Bound by  
fetters is Jiva (the ego), free from fetters is Shiva (God).   
Every man has certain debts to pay,--a debt to the Divine Spirit, a debt to  
the sages, debt to mother, to father, to the wife. No man can renounce  
everything without paying off these debts. **But if his soul be intoxicated  
with Divine Love and become mad after God, then he is free from all duties and  
debts. Then who is his father, who is his mother and who is his wife?**

Bhagavan Ramana says about shame: Manam kondu urupavar maanathai azhithu   
Abhimanam illathu oLir Arunachala - Verse 77 of Sri AAMM.   
Accepting those who approach you with attachment (with the   
sense of self respect), you destroy their individuality and then   
shine free from wrong attachment and identity with individuals,   
O Arunachala!   
He says about fear, adhyryam.   
Dhyriamodum un mei aham naada yan   
Thattashinden aruL Arunachala \- Verse 50 of Sri AAMM.   
Boldly seeking your true Self, I am ship-wrecked, ruined.   
Have mercy on me, O Arunachala!   
Bhagavan then speaks about hatred, (anger): Kobam il gunathoy kuRiyai enaik koLa   
Kurai en seythen Arunachala! - Verse 25 of Sri AAMM.   
O Arunachala, unruffled by anger, what fault have I committed   
that you do not make me, that is, my ego, your target?   
(English Translation - Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
