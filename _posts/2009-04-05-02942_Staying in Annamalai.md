A young man came to a novice guru and asked: How do I know the Self?   
The guru answered: Find out what remains alive after you die.   
The young man was frightened and promptly left the place.   
When the senior guru came to know about this, he asked the novice guru,   
Why did you tell him so?   
The novice guru replied: Sir, I have seen seekers coming to you again and again but never getting their  
doubts cleared.   
So I tried to give such instruction which will end their seeking once for all.

Humor : Chasing rabbits   
There is a zen saying: A hunter who chases two rabbits catches none.   
But what if two hunters chase different rabbits and catches the same.   
A boy who was highly spiritually-minded had to marry due to family pressure   
but was given complete freedom to choose the girl.   
The boy decided to marry only a highly spiritually-minded girl.   
He found a Meerabai-like girl who was also being forced to marry by her  
parents and relatives.   
They agreed to marry each other.   
After marriage, the girl who was a great devotee of Sri Krishna went in search  
of Lord Krishna.   
The boy who was a great devotee of Shiva went in search of Lord Shiva.   
They ended up catching the same "rabbit".

Dear silentgreen,   
A good anecdote. Even in daily life, like spiritual pursuit, to serve   
both God and mammon are not possible. No one can serve two   
masters. Some one was asking a guru: "Why in Hinduism alone,   
there are several gods?" The guru replied: "All are one and the   
same god. It is like having sugar candies of many colours. Each   
child would like a particular colour of candy. But all candies are   
sweet, only colours are different." When someone asked Bhagavan   
Ramana whether he, who was doing Rama Japa could switch over   
to Ramana Japa. Bhagavan Ramana replied: "Why do you think   
Rama and Ramana are different? Continue what you have already   
been doing."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
I am not a software professional. But I know a friend of mine,   
who is running some computer peripherals sales & service centre,   
and is making a profit of Rs 25000 per month. He is expanding.   
He does not run any internet browsing outfit. He merely helps people to copy  
Word documents, burn CDs, sells CDs, small value printers   
and UPS systems. He also runs a xerox machine for xeroxing work.   
He has recently added a courier centre, where he receives couriers   
intended for various places and put them across to Professional couriers and  
the like, and gets a commission. He helps through   
advisory capacity to buy new computers, laptops, I-Pods, printers,   
high value cell phones etc., A good combination. He has got just one   
assistant under him. For a five lac investment you can make a similar outfit  
and earn Rs 25000/- per month, which comes to Rs 3 lacs   
and this is 60% return!   
Arunachala Siva.

There are many small business forums on the internet. I suggest you find one  
of those; likely many people there will have more knowledge/experience that  
will help with what you want to do.   
Here, we will say, of what use to you is anything?   
Don't get me wrong. I'm in the same boat as you -- I'm trying to start a  
small biz so I can get out of the rat race. But here, you will get very bad  
business advice. The advice will good for your Self, but bad for business.

Dear Munagala,   
I guess its the same issue with everyone. I was working in an MNC and found  
myself in exact situation, though I am not yet married. I realised I am not  
getting any happiness or peace anyway. Neither through Hard work in the office  
nor was I able to spend quality time at home. the official work kept chasing  
me even at home. Then there is Rat race at work. It turned out to be crazy. A  
question raised within me - How much is enough? so what if I become a CEO  
tomorrow? how different will it be then?   
I decided this is not what I want out of my life. Working become more a social  
compulsion rather work for simple living. Then, if promotion did not come at  
right time, people wonder how long one is in the same position. This rat race  
is really maddening.   
Hence I decided one day and, I quit my job, I have an elder brother well  
placed in a company. The work became more an obligation for me. What for was  
I working? to earn nice money, get a decent designation and get a good girl to  
settle down in life? I realised I did not want ant of these? so why was I  
working? I realised I was working on social compulsion and pressure, because  
as per the societal culture this is how one has to live ones life. It was  
ridiculous to me.   
Thereafter I kept getting a lot of job opportunities and even now I keep  
getting them But I don't pay heed to them. Just to make a decent living and  
have some earning I decided to start a small business. By God's grace, my  
brother has agreed to help me set up my business. I am in the process of  
setting up! I have totally let whatever happen to me! Initially I found it  
very difficult. But now I am able to manage myself with some activities.  
Atleast in my business I can be as I am, no rat race just answerable to my own  
conscience!   
On the other hand there are certain unavoidable circumstances I have had to  
face after quit my job. But I just pray to Sri Ramana to help me! Show me the  
way. It took me a mammoth effort to convince my parents especially my mother.  
indeed they are worried as I am unlike my other counterparts. Even now I am  
setting up a business only for the sake of my parents. Also They are worried  
about my being very much inclined spiritually, the worry what if I run away  
and become a sanyasi, But I am unable to convince them that I am no where near  
to even Sanyasam. I have a very long way to go. But they are more worldly  
people. I am finding it difficult to strike a balance between my spirituality  
and managing my family. What they expect out of me is totally different from  
my inclinations!   
Like you mentioned in your other post Worldly desire -   
 _We acquire worldly possessions inorder to be happy. does happiness increase  
with increase of of our possessions?   
No. Actually the happiness decreases with increase in wordly possesisons._

Both of you have explained the situation quite correctly. This is the   
case with most of us. We are ruled by Blackberry Monster!

Dear munagala,   
I was also not knowing about it, till my son brought his own Blackberry from  
abroad during his visit. It is an all-in-one cellphone.   
You can take photographs. You can listen to music. You can even   
see a movie. You can received and send e mails. In India, I think   
no cellphone gives facility of e mailing. This is a great menace.   
My son comes to India once in 4 to 6 months only to eat his mummy's food and  
sleep. But this Black berry had to be kept open at all times,   
as per his office order. Every third minute he gets a call. Every six   
minutes his local IIT/IIM friends telephone to him. Every tenth   
minute there is an email from office or someone else. It gives a   
continuous beep during all these occasions! Once when we were out   
in Bangalore, calls came every minute, that he could not even buy a   
shirt he wanted. This is the monster which rules him for his salary,   
which may look quite attractive. But with 12 to 14 hours of job everyday, and  
no proper food to eat, constant blabbering of   
Blackberry, it is better to work in a tea shop in Tiruvannamalai.   
But he needs money and we also need money. And this is the price one has to  
pay! Everyone cannot become an Annamalai Swami or   
Subramanya Sastrigal who worked for the Asramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Blackberry is available here as well. My brother uses it and he receives call  
even when he is in deep sleep from abroad! My sister in law keeps telling that  
it has become a menace. He usually has conf calls which sometimes even lasts  
for an hour also!!! Its like you know blackberry has become his best friend  
and companion He may forget anything else but not his blackberry!!

Many of the problems of life starts getting resolved when spiritual practice  
starts giving joy.   
Then work done with attention and underlying joy turns it into karma yoga.   
Joy and devotion is more easily felt when spiritual practice is done in a holy  
place like temple, ashram etc.   
\-- Om Shanti

Spiritual practices done within Sri Ramanasramam or any other Ashram or  
temples, first reduces the speed of the mind, the   
swiftness with which thoughts gush forth. This is possible because   
of the power generated in such holy places. This helps better   
meditation or self enquiry.

Being the smart people we are, and seeing how we have enough grace acting on  
us to all bring us here, you think we would have been able to and created some  
kind of community solution to help out people in situations such as our own.   
The current work situation is horrible. It's unacceptable. It's loveless.  
It could be such a beautiful thing, but instead it's an ugly thing.   
And what are any of you doing about it?   
I don't mean to put social work on a pedestal, because self-understanding is  
what is important, not social work, though work for the benefit of others has  
its place, of course.   
I've started a project to help people such as ourselves -- who don't want to  
sacrifice their lives to the rat race. Maybe I will post about it here if it  
gets more successful.

Dear Matthew,   
I am happy that you have started a thread that can be shared with   
everyone. I have decided to help people who are financially poor   
and even if such people cheats me for some small extra money,   
I have decided to ignore it. I am adopting this practice, with flower   
vendors, fruit vendors, washermen, auto rickshaw drivers, temple   
priests and many such people. If a rich person, like a grains store merchant  
or a drug store merchant charge me more, I argue with   
him but not fight with him. These are the people, who have enough   
earnings and profits and they need not cheat the purchasers. I also   
help those organizations, whose records are excellent like CRY and   
others.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R,   
It is nice to hear of your attitude. It will benefit those you encounter, and  
yourself. I'm glad you're in a situation where you are able to act like you.  
Most of us in that situation keep what we have for ourselves.

Sri Ramakrishna says: Always consider that your family concerns are not yours;   
they are God's and you are His servant who came here to obey His commands.   
When this idea becomes firm, there remains nothing indeed that a man may call  
his own.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. Chandogya Upanishad says: Self is dearer than family,   
kith and kin, lands and gold. To love the Self is to love the family   
as God's servant and do your duty, to the extent that is possible   
for you. When one considers the Self as everything, then the   
preferential love for family cannot happen,because there is nothing   
other than the Self. Preference comes only when there are two or   
more.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is one choultry run by Telugu people who are devotees of
