In this topic I would like to exchange inner happenings of the seekers at the  
moment, what is there in their sadhana//life, how does it feel...I would like  
to start this discussion because I think if we will come across similarities  
in experience,Intuition and expression of who we really are, we could benefit  
on our way...I think it could be helpfull to get rid of ignorance and get  
closer to the truth...   
I start with my condition: usually the meditation and enquiery is part of my day, it does not stop, I do  
not have a fixed time...   
since some days I feel that Iam expressed...it is hard to explain in words, I  
just feel an energy that comes from nowhere and expresses itself, it is a  
ongoing feeling and the best word to discribe it is expression.....I cannot  
say stop or come, I cannot meditate about it nor can I avoid when it is  
there....it is a very sweet and loving feeling...   
it seems to be very subtile in nature, it feels alittle like seeing with the  
eyes of an atom (again my skin is vibrating, my body feels very weightless and  
good, warm and embraced)....jet if I want to see the center of this expression  
the center is gone...or when I want to see the where it comes from it is gone,  
or not there...   
when I am still (no movement, no talking, no work, no sitting down to  
meditation...then the feeling is very clear, very near, when I talk, and do  
something it vanishes, or I get swallowed by what I do)   
when this "feeling" is obvious or percieved by me then Iam this energy, and  
there is no need to ask who am I, or to meditate...but at the same time it is  
not stainless or pure awereness, it is a cleared self awereness but not  
supreme...jet when I rest as this energy Iam happy and ok, it feels like this  
is not coming or going it is always there and at the same time I loose it  
again and again...   
I also cannot sleep very good since one day......when i lay down to sleep then  
this feeling is there, and for me I cannot sleep out of this energy, till now,  
we will see how it workes today....this periods of no sleeping is a usual  
thing for me, some times I sleep very very well, just one interruption (thirst  
or toilet) or I do not sleep at all....this not sleeping always comes when  
something chnaged in my awereness, or mostly...   
maybe some advice and also some insights in your present condition   
much love   
peace peace peace

Dear Matthias,   
Awareness is unchanged. Only some mental state is created a mental  
excitement, a mental energy. A mental feeling of "High". .. Nothing special  
abt these sort of things, my friend. Awareness, the Witness is unchanged,  
untroubled.   
Just Relax and be the Awareness you are. There is nothing you can do abt it.  
No new experience is required.   
All experiences that begin. .. end. .. and hence they cannot be truth. Dont  
bother abt them.   
You are Awareness !   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Matthias,   
Your various 'bhavas', or feelings like "inexpressible feeling",   
"weightlessness and warmth", "seeing with every pore of the skin",   
horripilation, causeless shedding of tears are all good. There are   
times when I feel choked or weep whenever I hear or tell   
Arunachala. I should only say that these are like someone   
giving you a bottle of lemonade in a long distance running! Do   
accept it and proceed further.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Matthias,   
I am fine, by Bhagavan Ramana's Grace. All these external 'bhavas'   
still continue. Sometimes fear, sometimes bad feelings, sometimes   
extraordinarily good feelings. I do not know.   
One simple example. When I knew from the Forum that the   
 has pruned 783 of my posts, because they are   
infringing the copyright laws and for other reasons, this came as   
a Diwali gift, you know, I felt bad for a full day. Several thoughts   
came up. Why all this? It is like a child building sand houses on   
the beach and suddenly a wave coming and removing everything.   
But I remembered Chadwick's life. He had done the entire complete   
works of Sri Ramana and wanted to show them to Bhagavan Ramana   
and publish them. Meantime, the news came that Arthur Osborne's   
English translation is going to come out. Then Chadwick quietly   
placed the entire manuscripts in front of Bhagavan Ramana and left.   
Nothing will be done or undone, without the knowledge of Bhagavan   
Ramana, because He is everywhere, all pervading, in and out, vertical   
and horizonal, at all times.   
Arunachala Siva.

yes superb indeed, what will happen will happen or   
why all this?   
why not..   
we are in fact totally helpless people, helpless jivas, the day that bhagavan  
came in my life was the day my soul started to be swallowed by this ocean of  
stillness...now Iam helpless, and this is the nature of my ego, beeing  
helpless in front of bhagavan, naked and helpless   
how gracefull he is......he humbles me to the bone, and jet he was so much  
smaller....   
I expect that this "bhavas" are there to ultimately step beyond them.....the  
last step, you have to expereince the up and down of smsara, the rising of the  
"I-thought" the drowning of the "I-thought" in the vast bliss ocean etc...all  
just to get the final AHA....the bhavas will continue, maybe even  
increase..and jet nothing happens anymore...   
how blissfull to be THAT....how much pain to always be it without surrender to  
it....   
peace peace peace   
may his grace eliminate my ignorance and the ignorance in the world at large

Dear Subramanian,   
When you felt bad abt the removal. .. That is a perfect chance to see how your  
thoughts are mere suggestions and cannot touch you. That is the moment to see  
how, you the Awareness, cannot be touched by the thoughts.   
those are small but wonderful chances to test our understanding.   
Love!

As the ego tries to know itself it begins to partake less and less of the body  
and more and more of the consciousness. This must be the reason for the less  
awareness of the weight of the body. Thoughts dissipate energy. When the  
mind is subdued, the energy transforms into a potential energy field.  
Weightlessness and feeling of energy must be sure signs of progress in self-  
enquiry.

Dear sirs,   
Previously, when my work or idea were denied by the other people, I was so  
feeling low, I could not take the denial. I used feel more unstable. But after  
the self enquiry, my mind accepts its result. My inner most voice tells, so  
what, nothing would happen to ME. This feeling gives more energy to go  
further. As it does not affect me I feel fullness. No lements no cries no  
weeping. Whether we see God or not self enquiry helps lot in day to day life  
and gives more space to understand others.Because nO BODY able to insul or  
damag. WE ARE SELF, SELF AND SELF ONLY.EVER BORN AND DIED.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Whenever your idea or work is denied by others, we have to take   
it in such a way that it is the wish of Bhagavan Ramana and He   
knows the best. Bhagavan has often used to say: Nin Ishtam, En   
Ishtam, that is Your Wish is My wish. This is the way in which we   
have to proceed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Actually the mind only makes the ideas and planning. When the mind is not  
active, the heart will act by which   
all works would take place. The ego wants to survive and not leting the heart  
to be awakened. That is the   
problem. As Bhagavan say, when ideas does not take place, we have to accept as  
it is divine will.   
It is the age old of habits.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mind sunk in the Heart acts thorugh the Heart, the Self. Here   
there is no doership.   
Mind in company of brain acts through brain, with a lot of doership   
and egoity.   
Arunachala Siva.
