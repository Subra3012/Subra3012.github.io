I am looking for a teacher of (coming down from) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi  
in the United States, near Boston if possible. Can anyone help? Thank you.

Hi jaizaon,   
Try to read the Upadesa Saram, written by Bhagavan. Keep reading that and if  
you the meaning along with that, it is better.   
my sincere suggestion to you, is that Bhagavan as a "Pure Aatman" is always  
there in every one of us.   
If you search for a guru external to you, is ignorance.   
No one in present days have the capability to teach and guide you on Aatma  
Vichara (Self-Investigation). i mean there may be guru's but as disciple we  
have to prepare our self in order to digest what a guru is telling.   
Remember the words of bhagavan, " **God, Guru and Self are one and the SAME**  
".   
First start with Upadesa Saram and once you have question arising we can  
discuss online.   
Cheers....

Dear jaizon, as we are used for generations, with a guru   
in physical form, we search for him outside. If It wants, It will come   
to you in a physical form. But do not search for It. Meantime,   
as Mr Ashwin said, you may read Upadesa Saram and then you   
may take up, Who am I?, and Arunachala Padigam. You may   
put into practice to the extent possible.

Hi nonduel,   
The conclusion you have got to is absolutly correct.   
I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great  
fealing which cant be expressed.   
 **I like to take this oppurunity to ask every member of this forum**,   
1) How much time do you spend for meditation?   
2) When you are writing a comment for a members query, do you have any  
personal experience or do you write this reading books?   
Please be clear....   
Cheers

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?   
Only me.   
Mark

Nonduel,   
Indeed. words get in the way sometimes for me. We speak the same thought.   
Intention can get lost in the words we choose to use. I just wanted to be  
clear cause I tried resisting for many years what I was thinking and feeling  
and it is just more mind games.   
 I find it very difficult to write about nonduality, but it is vigilance for  
me to do so. And I love it.   
That is wonderful you are aware of self when involved in activites.   
As of yet I still fall back into mind when engaged in worldly activites   
 But I am becoming aware of the answear when asking the question "Who am I" or  
especially "who is having this thought"repeatedly.   
Nobody but me.   
I like that   
Mark

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.
