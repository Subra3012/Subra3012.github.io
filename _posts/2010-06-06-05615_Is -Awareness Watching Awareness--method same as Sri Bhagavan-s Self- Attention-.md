## Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

There is already a topic about the author Michael Langford, who coined this  
term 'awareness watching awareness', but I would like to hear your opinion on  
his interpretation of Self-Attention.   
Michael Langford describes the way he came to this conclusion like this.   
 "... (I wondered) If I AM is this present awareness, just the awareness  
that is now looking at this room, then paying attention to the I AM is just: **My awareness watching my awareness**.   
Atleast in my opinion this sounds true and is logical. And this is how he  
describes the practice itself: "Turn your attention away from thought and  
watch the watcher, see the seer."   
When he first found this out, he asked Sri V. Ganesan (grand nephew of Sri  
Ramana) about this practice and he approved it saying that he calls it  
'attention attending to attention'. Michael Langford also backs this  
interpretation by giving quotes from "The garland of Guru's sayings", by Sri  
Muruganar: The only true and full awareness **is awareness of awareness.   
Till awareness is awareness of itself**, it knows no peace at all.   
Is it not because you are yourself Awareness, that you now perceive This  
universe?   
 **If you observe awareness steadily, this awareness itself as Guru will  
reveal the Truth**.   
" **If with mind turned towards Awareness and concentrating on Awareness, one  
seeks the Self**, the world made up of ether and other elements is real, as  
all things are Awareness, the one sole substance of true Being."   
" **If instead of looking outward at objects, you observe that looking**, all  
things now shine as I, the seer. Perception of objects is mere illusion."   
" **The ego image moves reflected in the mind 's waves. How to stop this  
movement, how to regain the state of stillness? Don't observe these movements,  
seek the Self, instead**. It is wisdom to gain and abide in silence."   
Also Michael James says that Michael Langford's intepretation is correct.

Quote  
Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self-  
Attention?  
Yes, that is what Sri Bhagavan clearly says.   
"What is essential in any sadhana [practice] is to try to bring back the  
running mind and fix it on one thing only. **Why then should it not be brought  
back and fixed in Self-attention? That alone is Self-enquiry (atma-vicara).  
That is all that is to be done! "**   
Now what is the Self that we are to fix our attention to? Bhagavan answers: "You ( the Self ) are Awareness. Awareness is another name for you." So this  
practice could as well be called 'Awareness-Attention'.   
In Nan Yar Bhagavan also calls this practice by the name 'ahamukham' which  
means I-facing (and therefore could also be called 'Awareness-facing').   
I don't know if anyone cares, but one of my favourite teachers Shinzen Young  
says that he practiced mindfulness of breathing in the beginning of his path.  
And after some months of practice he asked for more advanced method from his  
(zen) teacher. His teacher replied: "A more advanced method? Some people have  
practiced mindfulness of breathing for twenty years and are still learning new  
things every day. But you asked for a more advanced method, so here you have  
it: "Find out who you really are".   
Shinzen then asked 'how?', to which his teacher replied: "Just do it." And  
when Shinzen asked for some tip, his teacher said: "Turn the light (of  
consciousness) on itself."

That which can be objectified can be watched - awareness watches the object.   
How can Awareness/Self be watched? Who is watching? It just IS.   
These explanations are at the root of all errors. ... 'are there two, one to  
watch the other'.   
Self-enquiry is NOT this method. Self-enquiry is holding onto and remaining as  
Self/Awareness of Being. A subtle but profound difference.   
Whatever can be objectified is not Self, it is just another thought, another  
figment of the imagination.

Indeed, but you can always try to turn attention away from experienced to the  
experiencer and look if there is any **thing** there

So do you disagree with these quotes? Aren't they from Sri Ramana himself?

Self enquiry is simply the attention to the Self. For ever, permanently.  
Awareness is the state of Being. I do not understand   
how Awareness can be watched, objectified. Michael Longford is   
not correct in his saying.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramana clearly has even talked about stages in Self Enquiry: "First the Self Sees itself as Object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally, the Self sees itself as Self, only in the last, there is no seeing,  
as seeing is being"   
Its all stages, each person moves ahead in his/her own way.   
When Faith is sincere, there is only one way ahead, going upwards the mountain  
peak, any direction upwards takes you to only the peak of the mountain and no  
other destination. It may only appear that each person is taking a different  
route to different destination, but a person with complete faith in his Guru  
can only Go Upwards to the Source - peak - Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Michael Langford is saying also.

Dear snow,   
"Being aware" is not "watching awareness". How can it be?   
I am aware I am tall or short. Am I watching my shortness   
or tall height, every moment?   
I am aware I am having high fever. Am I watching my feverishness?   
I can at best watch into the thermometer after placing it under my   
tongue once in two hours. Otherwise I am not watching my   
feverishness. My wife may watch it, by placing her hand on my   
forehead. That is all. Watching needs a thermometer or a second person.   
Arunachala Siva.

It something like, even Bhagavan has said in some context (just a vague  
reflection), do we ever need to see that we are man/woman, etc...   
does anyone ever have to watch himself to affirm that he/she is man or woman,   
we know intrinsically that we are man/woman, we do not need to watch ourselves  
to know that I am man,   
I know I am man... I know I am a woman. similarly, can awareness ever watch  
itself? it is impossible   
to watch something implies subject and object. awareness being itself the  
subject and object, there is a great difference here, awareness cannot watch  
itself for it itself is awareness. if at all there is any watching, then be  
assured that those are your own making, ideas, notions, imaginations, etc...  
about awareness.   
awareness still needs to take birth.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

A quote by Michael Langford (the creator of this method).   
"Examples of plastic flowers that are no longer a direct means to Truth are: Buddhism (Tibetan, Theravada and Zen), Christianity, Christian Mysticism,  
Islam, Sufism, Judaism, Jewish Mysticism, Hinduism, The Gurdjieff lineage,  
Krishnamurti, Scientology, the Poonjaji (Lucknow lineage), the Ramesh Balsekar  
lineage.   
These are all plastic flowers pretending to be living flowers. These are all  
indirect paths with an almost endless number of delays in them. They are all  
distortions of the original intentions. Because the Lucknow lineage is modern,  
it provides an excellent opportunity to see how a Sages teaching is distorted.  
The Sage being Sri Ramana Maharshi and the ones distorting the teaching being  
the Lucknow lineage. The same is true for the Ramesh Balsekar lineage. The  
Sage being Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and the ones doing the distorting being  
the Ramesh Balsekar lineage."
