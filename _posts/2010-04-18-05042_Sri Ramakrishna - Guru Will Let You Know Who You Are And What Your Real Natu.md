IN a forest there lived a holy man who had many disciples. One day he taught  
them to see God in all beings and knowing this, to bow low before them all.   
A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for the sacrificial fire.  
Suddenly he heard an outcry,"Get out of the way! A mad elephant is coming!"   
All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels. He reasoned that the  
elephant was also God in another form.   
Then why should he run away from it? He stood still, bowed before the animal,  
and began to sing its praises. The mahut of the elephant was shouting: "Run  
away! Runaway!"   
But the disciple didn't move. The. animal seized him with its trunk, cast him  
to one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay  
unconscious on the ground.   
Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother disciples came to him  
and carried him, to the hermitage.   
With the help of some medicine he soon regained consciousness.   
Someone asked him, "You knew the elephant was comingwhy didn't you leave the  
place?" "But," he said, "Our teacher has told us that God Himself has taken  
all these forms, of animals as well as men. Therefore, thinking it was only  
the elephant God that was coming, I didn't run away."   
**At this the teacher said: "Yes, my child,it is true that the elephant God  
was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to stay there. Since all are  
manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the mahut's words? You should have  
heeded the words of the mahut God."   
God dwells in all beings. But you may be intimate only with good people; you  
must keep away from the evil-minded. God is even in the tiger; but you cannot  
embrace the tiger on that account!  
You may say, "Why run away from a tiger, which is also a manifestation of  
God?"   
The answer to that is: Those who tell you to run away arc also manifestations  
of Godand why shouldn't you listen to them?   
God undoubtedly dwells in the hearts of allholy and unholy, righteous and  
unrighteous; but a man should not have dealings with the unholy, the wicked,  
the impure. He must not be intimate with them. With some of them he may  
exchange words,but with others one shouldn't go even that far.   
One should keep aloof from such people.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna : Guru Will Let You Know Who You Are And What Your Real Nature

ONCE, a tigress attacked a flock of goats. As she sprang on her prey, she gave  
birth to a cub and died. The cub grew up in the company of the goats. The  
goats ate grass and the cub followed their example. They bleated: the cub  
bleated too.   
Gradually it grew to be a big tiger. One day another tiger attacked the same  
flock. It was amazed to see the grass-eating tiger. Running after it, the wild  
tiger at last seized it, whereupon the grass-eating tiger began to bleat.   
The wild tiger dragged it to the water and said: "Look at your face in the  
water. It   
is just like mine. Here is a little meat. Eat it." Saying this, it thrust some  
meat into its mouth.   
But the grass-eating tiger would not swallow it and began to bleat again.  
Gradually, however, it got the taste for blood and came to relish the meat.   
Then the wild tiger said: "Now you see, there is no difference between you and  
me. Come along and follow me into the forest."   
 **So there can be no fear if the guru 's grace descends on one. He will let  
you know who you are and what your real nature is.**

Yes. The disciple says in Vivekachudamani: "O Guro! I was suffering all these days in samsara agni. You told   
me Tattvam Asi. "Now I know who I am." This is how Guru's   
Grace operates. Guru removes the dirt. That is all. He does not   
do any magic. But faith and conviction are essential. Bhagavan   
Ramana says: Do not show your advaitam to Guru. You should   
live in duality with Guru till you know He and you are one and the same.   
Arunachala Siva.
