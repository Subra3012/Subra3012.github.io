## Thoughts on Christmas 2009  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 25, 2009, 06:58:53 AM

Jesus and Nicodemus   
(John 3.1-8)   
There was a man named Nicodemus who was a Pharisee and a   
Jewish leader. One night he went to Jesus and said: "Sir, we   
know that God has sent you to teach us. You could not work   
these miracles, unless God were with you."   
Jesus replied: "I tell you for certin that you must be born from   
above, before you see God's kingdom!"   
Nicodemus asked: "How can a grown man ever be born a second   
time?"   
Jesus answered: "I tell you for certain that before you can get into God's kingdom,   
you must be born not only by water, but by the Spirit. Humans   
give life to their children. Yet only God's Spirit can change you   
into a child of God. Don't be surprised when I say that you must   
be born from above. Only God's Spirit gives new life. The Spirit   
is like the wind that blows wherever it wants to. You can hear the   
wind, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going."   
1 CORINTHIANS 9. 19-23   
"I am not any one's salve. But I have become a slave to everyone, so that I  
can win as many people as possible. When I am with   
Jews, I live like a Jew to win Jews. They are ruled by Law of Moses, and I am  
not. But I live by the Law to win them. And when I am with people who are  
not ruled by the Law, I forget the Law to win them. Of course, I never really  
forget about the Law of God.   
In fact, I am ruled by the Law of Christ. When I am with people, whose faith  
is weak, I live as they do to win them. I do everything I can to win everyone  
I possibly can. I do all this good news because I want to share its  
blessings.   
*   
God chooses ordinary people to do extraordinary things. God   
fills the weak and meek vessels with his will, to fullfil his purpose on  
earth. In fact, the meek shall inherit the earth.   
Arunachala Siva.

and Balarama to wake up.   
"O the Attire, the Water and the Food! Our Lord, the dharmic   
Nandagopa, please wake up. O the Leader of all gopas and the   
light and the lamp of the clan Yasoda our Lordess, please wake   
up. O our Lord who measured the Space and the Worlds (with   
your feet, as Trivikrama), the god of the gods, please wake up.   
O the anklet wearing brave Balarama, please wake up. O the   
brothers wake up without further sleep."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 15  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 27, 2009, 07:29:04 AM  
---  
The 15th song of Tiruppavai by AndaL is sung on 15th day of   
Margazhi, Dhanur month, this year, it is falling on 30th December   
2009.   
The 15th song is by way of conversation between the girl who is   
at the doorstep to wake up the sleeping girl and the sleeping girl   
who has just now woken up. There is a reference about Krishna   
Avatara.   
"O, the young-parrot!* Are you still sleeping?"   
"O girls, do not cause a rumpus. I am coming!"   
"O, we know your valour of empty words!"   
"O, okay, you are only the girls of wondrous speeches. You   
are telling about me, let it be so."   
"O, we know your wondrous actions. First come out!"   
"Is it enough if I only come? What about other girls?   
Have they all come?"   
"Yes. Please come out and count the heads."   
" Come fast, let us sing the glory of Krishna who killed and dug   
out the tusks of Kuvayalapeetam, the great mad elephant!"   
Even Krishna's digging out of the tusk of the elephant was an   
easier task, than these girls waking the dull girl up!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 16  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 27, 2009, 07:41:18 AM

The 16th song of Tiruppavai is sung on the 16th day of Margazhi,   
Dhanur month, this year it is falling on 31st December 2009.   
The scene now shifts to Krishna's palace. The girls have 'at last'   
reached the palace of Krishna and they want to wake him up.*   
O the Gate-keeper of Krishna's palace! (Krishna who is the son   
of Nandagopa, the chief among the gopas (cowherds) sleeps in   
his father's home along with Balarama, the elder brother.) Please   
open the pearl-studded gates of the house. We are the gopikas,   
for whom Krishna, son of Nandagopa had promised a boon, yesterday. We have  
come with pure hearts to receive that boon.   
We have come to wake Him up. Please do not hesitate and open   
the door immediately.   
* In the ancient and medieval Hindustan, the women went to   
bed later than male members and woke up earlier than menfolk.   
This continued say, upto mid-20th century, when women were   
not going for work. In today's IT India, women wake up later   
than menfolk and ask for hot cup of coffee/tea!   
So, Krishna is still in bed, though the girls, including the Late Latif girl,  
had woken up and have arrived at Krishna's palace. The girls refer to a boon  
here. What is that boon? Let us see in further songs.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 18  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 02, 2010, 09:48:50 AM  
---  
Today is the 18th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month and it is the   
practice in many Tamil houses and with Tamil knowing Sri Vaishnavas of  
Karnataka, to sing the 18th song of Tiruppavai   
of AndaL.   
This particular song reveals some hitherto unknown information.   
Krishna or Kannan is already married to one lady by name Nappinnai. Krishna  
is said to have 108 wives, (Vallabhacharya   
says the number is 16108!) and one among them is the Tamil   
girl Nappinnai. Nappinnai means a girl with lustrous jet black hairs!  
Beginners in Sri Vaishnava philosophy think that AndaL is one of   
Krishna's wives. Yes. But that is only in Sri Rangam - Srivilliputtur  
stories. There is no reference to AndaL in Srimad Bhagavatam   
or Sri Narayaneeyam. Some authors say that AndaL is   
Goda Devi. But there is no name of Godadevi either in these   
two books. But there is reference to Nappinnai. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says that Krishna married one Dravidian (!) (Blackie!)   
girl by name Nappinnai. So, Nappinnai, the brunette, is Goda Devi   
or AndaL, we should conlcude.   
He is of the strength of an elephant, and valorous shoulders   
that shall never retreat against his enemies. He is Nandagopa,   
the foster-father of Krishna. O Nappinnai, one with long jet black   
fragrant hairs, the DAUGHTER IN LAW OF Nandagopa, please open   
the door. All of Krishna's girl friends have come for bathing. The   
cuckoos perching on the Madhavi creepers are cuckooing, again and   
again. We are repeatedly singing the holy names of Krishna, your   
hubby. Please open the door with your bangle-tingling lotus like   
hands!   
The cuckoos are cooing. So this is already morning, after dawn.   
In the dawn, as per Manikkavachagar's Tiruvembavai, the cocks   
make sounds first. Then the red legged snarks give forth sounds.   
Then the conch shells from priests make sounds. Then only   
the late rising cuckoos make cooing. Here AndaL refers to cooing   
of cuckoos. Hence it is no more dawn but early morning.   
Nappinnai, the brunette, has only long jet black hairs. But her   
limbs are pinkish red like those of a doll. This is evident from the last  
sentence of the poem. Hence she is a Dravidian but fair complexioned!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Truth  
Author: rideforever         Date: December 27, 2009, 09:20:24 PM  
---  
In the West religion becomes fuzzy, a grey-area, a cloudy mystery. Like "oh  
ok, religion looks nice for you - I can see it makes you feel good - but it is  
not for me", or "Oh yes, well he was talking about Truth - it's a metaphor for  
... ".   
No. It is no metaphor. The Truth is the Truth. It is the Truth of your  
existence, it is the Truth of all existence, and when you see it you will see  
it within you not somewhere else. It is not that you look over Buddha's  
shoulder and say "oh I see what you are playing with". No. You will see it  
within you and know that it is the Truth.   
It is literally the Truth. Literally. There is nothing further, and you will  
know it to be so whe you see it within you.

Only the Atma is the Truth. The world, individual souls, personal   
gods are all imaginations. Truth has to be investigated by the   
seeker only. No books will help. No Guru will help. They will   
at best show the Way. You have to reach the Goal through that   
way, the way that you love most, and reach the Goal. Again,   
reaching the Goal does not bring about a halo around your face.   
You are what you are, but in Peace, the Peace that passeth understanding.   
Arunachala Siva.
