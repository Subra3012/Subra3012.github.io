Verse 1 of Manisha Panchakam: Annamayadhannamayam athava,   
Chaitanyamena Chaitanyath,   
Dwijavara dhurikathum vaanchasi,   
Kim bruhi gaccha gacchati.   
O the best among Brahmins. This body is formed from food   
that is making up another body. So also Chaitanyam (Consciousness) comes from  
Chaitanyam. Now you are   
asking 'Go away, go away to a far off place!' Tell me   
which one should away to a far off place, from which?   
The Chandala asks Sri Sankara, whether the body made up   
of food should go farther away from another body made up   
of food, or whether the Chaitanyam, which is all pervading,   
should go away farther from another Chaitanyam?   
Consciousness or Chitanyam, is one without a second. It is all   
pervading, occupying everything in this universe. There is nothing   
other than Consciousness. There is no Space where there is   
no prevalence of Consciousness. Srimad Bhagavatam says   
that Narayana is there even in a straw as well as in big pillar.   
Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram says that only Sivam is there in   
all eight forms of five elements, sun, moon, and the jivas.   
Where can It go at all? Where is the space for It go away?   
This is the lightning like question of Chandala which struck   
Sri Sanakara.   
In the Old Hall, many devotees would ask Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether the Heart is within the body?" This is because   
Bhagavan Ramana had said that for meditators the Heart should   
be meditated upon, and this is in right side of the chest. But   
this limited description is only for the seekers and meditators.   
Once the Self is realized, the Heart contains all. The body   
is also in Heart. The Self, the Heart, is everywhere in all   
things and in all beings. When Bhagavan Ramana replied: "No, the body is in Heart" the seekers should further probe   
into the truth of His statement. Since Chaitanyam is everywhere,   
the bodies which are temporary cannot be a point of reference   
either to come near or go far. The bodies are made up of   
five elemeents. Since the five elements are also in the Consciousess, all  
bodies are in Consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Crutches for Life  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 30, 2009, 07:01:46 AM

This morning I was watching a brief discourse by Sri Sri   
Ravisankar, of Art of Living Couses. He said that the problem   
of modern man is that we are having too many crutches to   
support. A lame cannot walk with more than two crutches.   
Or at best one crutch. But if I give him ten crutches, how can   
he walk? We are today having many crutches, fame, name,   
money, family, doctors, medicines. But we forget the one real   
crutch that is Guru or God. Keep all the crutches away and   
keep only God or Guru as your crutch. That is sufficient for   
you to walk on the path.   
There were Kashmiri brahmins called Pandits in Kashmir.   
They were owning large apple gardens, wealth, palatial   
houses, a lot of Sanskrit knowledge and all that. At some   
point of time, they forgot the God that is the real crutch.   
They were mercilessly driven away from Kashmir. Today   
they are on the streets of Delhi, seeking alms and selling   
fruits!   
In Yuganda, there were a few super rich Indians who were   
runing huge factories and owning a lot of wealth like cars,   
dollar balances in US etc., Idi Amin suddenly gave them 8   
hours notice to leave the country. They were allowed to   
carry one one suitcase for each family. One such wealthy   
Indian had to come to England. His dollar balances had   
been blocked by Uganda. He had nothing. He started   
selling hotdogs in London streets to make a living!   
In both the cases, the persons forgot the one real crutch   
that is God or Guru. Kavyakanta Ganapati once said to   
Bhagavan: "Bhagavan! We can conveniently do our Sadhana, if we get Rs 3.00  
per month (it was 1920s). Bhagavan Ramana smiled and said: "Nayana, why even  
that? It is enough if one has got a human body!" For Bhagavan Ramana, even  
body was not a crutch!   
Arunachala Siva.

It is an unkind remark to state that the Kashmir Pandits and Ugandan Asians  
forgot the real crutch-God. It is an accusation as if all sufferers are non-  
believers of God. God is love and expect the devotees to stand on their own  
leg.

Dear arcsekar,   
I only said that "they forgot their real crutch" It is like saying   
that the Self is always within us, but we forget the Self and   
try to operate only with the mind. The Self is the real crutch,   
but the mind is the pseudo-crutch. This availability of real crutch   
is realized, only when the other crutches fail us.   
Arunachala Siva.
