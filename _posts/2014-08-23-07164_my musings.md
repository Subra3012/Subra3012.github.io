Why differentiate.....? anything, at all?   
Even the wisdom that differentiates

Differentiation is the biggest barricade

Stray thoughts...   
How many worlds are we all living at this very moment?   
There is one world with family   
There is one world with spouse, mother father, parents, children each child,  
friends, each friends, etc., and each close one separately   
There is one world at work and each world with colleagues   
There is one world in between while we travel from one place to another   
There are many worlds we fantasise and enjoy and seek pleasures   
There is another world where we derive peace   
There is another world of spirituality   
There is another world of our Guru and his life world   
There is this forum world   
There is our own world of various worlds of sadhanas - self enquiry, Bhakti,  
yoga, bhajana etc...   
List can go on... Endlessly   
Which one can be regarded as real? And this also emanates in one such world  
only!

Tis, but I cannot name it, 'tis the sense   
Of majesty, and beauty, and repose,   
A blended holiness of earth and sky,   
Something that makes this individual spot,   
This small abiding-place of many men,   
A termination, and a last retreat,   
A centre, come from whereso'er you will,   
A whole without dependence or defect,   
Made for itself, and happy in itself,   
Perfect contentment, Unity entire.

Stray thoughts...   
Dear friends, the purpose of the practice of Self Enquiry is to realise that  
one is not the gross body. nothing more and nothing less! Sri Bhagavan's quote  
from Talks 454 _The object of enquiry is to find the true nature of the Self  
as Awareness. Let one practise enquiry so long as separateness is perceived._   
Generally, in my understanding, i feel, many, even after having realised the  
simple fact that one is not the gross body(मनोबुद्ध्यहङ्कार चित्तानि नाहं  
etc..) continue to blindly pursue the exercise. Sri Bhagavan expressed in  
Talks 454 _There is confusion between the means and the end (i.e., sadhana and  
sadhya). Who is the enquirer? The aspirant and not the siddha. Enquiry  
signifies that the enquirer considers himself separate from enquiry. So long  
as this duality lasts the enquiry must be continued, i.e., until the  
individuality disappears and the Self is realised to be only the eternal Be-  
ing (including enquiry and enquirer). The Truth is that Self is constant and  
unintermittent Awareness. The object of enquiry is to find the true nature of  
the Self as Awareness. Let one practise enquiry so long as separateness is  
perceived. If once realisation arises there is no further need for enquiry.  
The question will also not arise. Can awareness ever think of questioning who  
is aware? Awareness remains pure and simple. The enquirer is aware of his own  
individuality. Enquiry does not stand in the way of his individual awareness;  
nor does external work interfere with such awareness. If work, seemingly  
external, does not obstruct the individual awareness, will the work, realised  
to be not separate from the Self, obstruct the uninterrupted Awareness of the  
Self, which is One without a second and which is not an individual separate  
from work_   
Thereafter realising this fact, that one is not the body, mind, intellect,  
ego, the elements, prana, and so on, one has to further delve into the nature  
of the Self, only then would the absolute clarity result. Who am I enquiry as  
taught by Bhagavan itself takes us to this level, however, one has to be open  
minded here to acquire knowledge beyond the very method of Self Enquiry.   
Having said this, the very fact of realising that one is NOT THE GROSS BODY is  
the ultimate realisation, there is nothing more to dig deeper. But since the  
mind would not rest, at the Truth being just so simple, wants to search  
further, seek something, experience some bliss and experience some sense of  
attainment that is all purely imaginative. This would result in endless cycle  
of sadhana, be it what ever Sadhana one pursues, even Self Enquiry.   
One has to 'know' the knowledge, Sri Bhagavan Himself, expressed _When I later  
in Tiruvannamalai listened, how the "Ribhu Gita" and such sacred texts were  
read, I caught these things and discovered that these books named and  
analysed, what I before involuntarily felt, without being able to appoint or  
analyse. In the language of these books I could denote the state in which I  
found myself after my awakening as "cleaned understanding" (shuddham manas) or  
"Insight" (Vijnāna): as 'the intuition of the Enlightened_   
Therefore, if anyone pursues the Sadhana of Self Enquiry very sincerely, would  
easily realise the Truth in just some time, may be even lesser than the time  
taken by Sri Bhagavan Himself, for a sharp intellect with sraddha and  
devotion, it also may take much longer for some, each depending on ones own  
pakva - a result of ones past.   
Thereafter, IF THE HUNGER STILL CONTINUES, Self Enquiry may alone may not of  
real Help, one has to acquaint with oneself, one has to know oneself, what is  
ones own nature, what am I, and so on, and these reflections are to be  
acquired through the direct words of ones own Guru and Guru guides one towards  
scriptures, the Vedas, Upanishads, the words of Guru, the works such as  
Vaasishta, Ribhu Gita, Ashtaavakra Gita. Sri Bhagavan recommended several  
works, in tamil as well like Kaivalya Navaeetam, Thayumanavar and so on.  
Therefore, it is clear, Sri Bhagavan guided all apirants to acquire knowledge  
from all corners. He encouraged aspirants to read Srimad Bhagavatam, Gita,  
Ribhu Gita, Yoga Vasishta. There was a regular discussion about the essence of  
various Upanishadic revelation. It is for this acquaintance for which Sri  
Bhagavan recommended all aspirants to pursue Self Enquiry.   
Sri Muruganar, who has written such mammoth tamil verses, on the exposition of  
Sri Bhagavan and the revelations of the same as reflected from various other  
tamil scriptures, especially of those of Manickavachakar. He fell dead the  
very day he read about Bhagavan's Atma Vichara, a small book given to him by  
his father in law, Dandapani swami. His Self Enquiry was finished. He only  
spent the rest of his life only is Tatva Samyoga, in grasping the Nature of  
Self as his reflection, which are his expositions, the result of His  
reflections. He encouraged aspirants to read works such as periya Puranam that  
used to bring tears in his beautiful eyes as well.   
Even after realising oneself as beyond the Gross body as a result of intense  
Self Enquiry, to continue to enquiring who am I who am I, would lead nowhere,  
as the the nature of that Self is Endless, it is limitless, therefore, it is  
prudent to assist oneself, ALONG WITH Self Enquiry, the various ambrosial  
nectarine expressions of Upanishads and other such works. This would put an  
end to the turbulent mind that continues to throb even after realising that  
truth that it is beyond the gross body.   
Self Enquiry, begins with Who am I, and once it is realised that one is beyond  
the gross body, the Self Enquiry thereafter becomes "Self" Enquiry, what is  
it, what is its nature, which is gained by the Uchchishtams leftovers of the  
expressions of various saints in various works and Upanishads.

(just shifting the same article here)   
Dear Friends, (addressed in general to one and all)   
i would like to lay some thoughts. I believe, we should not over emphasize  
certain observations by Sri Bhagavan or for that matter some recorded  
expressions made by them such as all other practices are auxiliary, and only  
Self Enquiry alone leads to the Truth, and that certain practices are for  
beginners and self enquiry is for advanced seekers and so on. _We need to  
understand the context in which they are expressed by the Sage and also the  
time in which it was said to that particular sadhaka_. _We should be clear  
that Sri Bhagavan never gave any teaching en-mass, he was very particular  
about it._   
There is no doubt Self Enquiry in itself is the goal and the end, but the  
sadhaka need not glorify the means by _unglorifying the other paths as  
auxiliary paths and terming them as beginner or lesser paths_, this is very  
unbecomming on the part of an aspirant, for this is a dangerous precedent, and  
it is not in line with Dharma.   
 _Sadhakas should never get obsessed with means but focus on Sadhana alone_,   
otherwise, it becomes like what happened with Christ, who was made the only  
Direct means for Salvation, and the popular understanding is that those that  
have been born before Christ and those that have been born after Christ who  
don't believe in Christ have no salvation.   
Self Enquiry is Direct path, there is no denying, _but over emphasizing to an  
extent of pursuing thoughts in the line that other practices are indirect and  
they are eventually only lead to Self Enquiry and why not directly begin Self  
Enquiry,_ such things are best left for the fruit to ripe by itself. Let us  
mind the purpose for which we are here, we are not here to preach and talk  
about efficacies and inefficacies.   
I believe we are not any savior or champions of propagating Self Enquiry, Sri  
Bhagavan Himself did that silently. It is better we just focus on our Sadhana  
over, emphasizing the efficacy of Self Enquiry over other paths. What Sri  
Bhagavan had to convey has expressed Himself in the small book Self Enquiry.  
Our duty is to only practice Sadhana and not to engage in its propagation.  
That is not our job and each sadhaka may pick himself what he needs, by the  
grace of Sri Bhagavan   
Does it mean that all others who are not inclined with Sri Bhagavan are lost  
in some spiritual maze? have there not been realized souls before Sri Bhagavan  
and have there not been there other Guru's who have been guiding lights? All  
paths are equal in the eyes of Self. All paths lead to the Sun of Truth.   
We can talk about Self Enquiry, we can write lots about Self Enquiry, glorify  
the path, talk about its greatness, but wisdom calls that certain expressions  
of Sri Bhagavan ought not to be misrepresented and what Sri Bhagavan said or  
what Sri Annamalai Swami said are case specific, and i firmly believe, in a  
common platform, Sri Bhagavan would not appreciate expressing thoughts such as  
Self Enquiry is Direct _and that other paths are are only for beginners_, _or  
that if one pursues Self Enquiry one need not bother about waking up late in  
the morning etc.._ _no such disciplines are necessary_ i mean we don't preach  
these out in the open, even if they are expressed by Sri Bhagavan. It is doing  
gross injustice to Sri Bhagavan!   
Lord Krishna says, यज्ञानां जपयज्ञोऽस्मि among acts of worship I am the  
worship called Japa. There are plenty of expression to quote counter, if need  
be, but what is important is to pick up the essence.   
All spiritual practices are an end to itself, or we can say all spiritual  
practices lead by themselves its own way of Self Enquiry. It is not in Rhythm  
to thunder exclusivity to Sri Bhagavan. Please do not make him a Jesus Christ.  
I would like to say,   
We Bhagavan devotees are not in some great heaven compared to so many other  
milions of Sadhakas of various other paths across the world of various faiths.

The four sons, of brahmA, sanaka, sanandana, sanAtana, sanat kumAra did  
austere tapas and analysis, but they were unclear of the Supreme Truth. They  
finally decided to come to Lord Shiva to get the knowledge of the Truth. The  
Lord sat under the banyan tree, and the four sages also sat down around Him.  
Lord stayed in the yOga posture without saying a single word. The four sages  
got all their doubts cleared just by that posture. The form in which God  
appeared as a Supreme Guide is the form of wisdom dakshiNAmUrti.   
This explains that the Truth cannot be explained in words and must be  
experienced. Including the great chinmudra posture, the posture of shrI  
dhakshiNA mUrti, who is the teacher of all the teachers. As thirumUlar says,  
the posture of the guru is a thing to be thought about always. That is the  
clarity ! (theLivu guruvuru chin^dhiththal thAnE)

Friends, just do not restrict where the life is taking you, experience  
everything life has to offer, we have heard aplenty to resist all external  
perceptions and remain within, but on the contrary, i have found that there is  
more spirituality in the so called Non-Spirituality and less spirituality in  
Spirituality itself (yes it is all how we see, but) Do not operate from  
cliches. Just to say some example, watch good films, watch good talents around  
you, look at the world how it operates, do not fear Rajas, do not resist the  
Rajas around you, Life is Beautiful. Spirituality is broadening and never  
narrowing.

Everything is the expression of the Supreme Atman!   
Look at how many different ways the Brahman is expressing itself,   
In how many beautiful ways, what a wonder it is,   
Simply look without being bound by any paradigms.   
It is You! you are expressing yourself in all of them!   
Do not resist yourself, for you would deny your nature!

_WHY art thou silent! Is thy love a plant   
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air   
Of absence withers what was once so fair?   
Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?   
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant--   
Bound to thy service with unceasing care,   
The mind's least generous wish a mendicant   
For nought but what thy happiness could spare.   
Speak--though this soft warm heart, once free to hold   
A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,   
Be left more desolate, more dreary cold   
Than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow   
'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--   
Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know! _   
(William Wordsworth)

In one and all, there is inherently the shine of Supreme God Head or Absolute  
Self Realisation, great repository of knowledge, it is too little of  
significance in the whole scheme! What really matters most is whether: We have vanquished Anger, the first and foremost.   
We have vanquished Ego, the self inflicted right to defend or negate.   
We have vanquished Emotions, Attachments and Desires.   
We have vanquished the pains of Afflictions.   
We have vanquished Greed, Jealousy, Hatred.   
We have vanquished Violance in thought, word and deed.   
We have vanquished Restraint (a need to self check, indicates the existence of  
Malaas as above)   
All spiritual practices are primarily for the annihilation of the above, and  
lest for any attainment of salvation as such, which is just a residue!

A bird sat absent-mindedly on the mast of a ship anchored in the Ganges.  
Slowly the ship sailed out into the ocean. When the bird came to its senses,  
it could find no shore in any direction. It flew toward the north hoping to  
reach land; it went very far and grew very tired but could find no shore. What  
could it do? It returned to the ship and sat on the mast. After a long while  
the bird flew away again, this time toward the east. It couldn't find land in  
that direction either; everywhere it saw nothing but limitless ocean. Very  
tired, it again returned to the ship and sat on the mast. After resting a long  
while, the bird went toward the south and toward the west. When it found no  
sign of land in any direction, it came back and settled down on the mast. It  
did not leave the mast again, but sat there without making any further effort.  
It no longer felt restless or worried. Because it was free from worry, it made  
no further effort.

Quite true friend.It is alright even if we carry a spoon.What if I carry an  
inch tape and try to measure?This is the problem I find in many persons.   
The other thing that intrigues me is this -In this workaday world we are  
consulting others for anything unknown to us;we do not hesitate to learn from  
others.we think the 'Guru' is not relevant for these things or putting it the  
other way,that he has arranged all this.Now here is the Interesting thing-When  
one thinks of consulting or learning from any spiritual sadhak or Teacher,this  
is considered as Taboo or not being faithful to the 'Guru'.One then tends to  
believe that one has to only derive all the inspiration and guidance from the  
so called 'Guru'(I mean manasika). It is indeed very well if one can derive  
such an inspiration and takes to it in right earnest.   
Yet,what should also be appreciated is that the guidance of Great ones,should  
one be fortunate to find one, it will be of tremendous help in dismantling  
cobwebs lurking unknown in the deep recesses of one's mind.A few direct blows  
to the 'Ego' will also set one straight and on the royal path.Why not view  
this also as arranged by the One and Only Guru-God?   
In all these matters,Each one has to be lead by his Prayers.I have a very Good  
friend who always was a big votary of Vichara and only that,a Devotee of Sri  
bhagavan.After years of this practice,he decided to be initiated into Kriya  
yoga(Lahiri Mahasaya's lineage).He still loves Sri Bhagavan and considers him  
and also Sri Ramakrishna as his father and Mother.It is not as if he was a  
'dabbler' but an intensely serious sadhaka,a Brahmachari who has now quit his  
job and is focussing on his sadhana Full time-a wonderful soul.   
I also came across another devotee who was caught up in turmoil-to choose her  
Ishta!Sometimes she liked Sri Ramakrishna,Sometimes Holy Mother and sometimes  
Swami Vivekanda.She had posted it in the Holy Trio Forum ddicated to Sri  
Ramakrishna Devotees.I happened to see it,and as I found that the Forum  
Members were not responding adequately -I sent a mail to her Id.I am not a  
member of that Forum. She was profusely thankful. These things happen and one  
cannot be only sentimental about these things and wallow in it.   
God is one and the whole world is our Guru-This is why God has sent us into  
this world to be schooled here.   
Namaskar.

Stray thoughts...   
Lord Krishna says in Gita -   
कर्मणयेवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।   
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि। 2.47   
कर्मणयेवाधिकारस्ते   
Karmanye Vadhikaraste, we have all right, choice, freewill, upon any karma, or  
action. Mostly we have taken it for granted that it is _**" to perform"**_ but  
it subtly also conveys we also have choice to remain still, to become free of  
all karmas. But of-course, this needs to be discerned in the right spirit and  
not with perversion.   
But only we do not have the choice or preference to the expectations.  
Therefore, even the non performance of karmas, if being ones choice, also will  
have its fruits.

The Lord yearns for his beloved devotees that he suffers Himself to enjoin  
Himself wherever that Jivatma may be just like Lord Rama yearned for Sita went  
to Lanka, just like Krishna yearned for Radha would always be in her  
remembrance.   
The Lord is so gracious that he becomes Himself a Jivatma and makes the  
Jivatma, a Paramatma in order to simply undergo the same yearning as His  
beloved devotee.

In the happy moments, praise Him,   
In the difficult moments, seek Him,   
In the busy moments, bless Him,   
In the quiet moments, worship Him.   
In the waiting moments, trust Him,   
In the painful moments, touch Him,   
In the lovely moments, thank Him,   
In the quiet moments, worship Him.   
For the glory in all our moments,   
He is there,   
In goodness, in kindness, in love.

"two Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly   
gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit.   
He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that   
cream into butter and crawled out."

There was once a man got stranded on an island after his ship became wreck.  
Every day he prayed asking God to send someone to rescue him, but to his  
disappointment, no one ever came.   
Months passed and this man learned how to survive on the island. During this  
time, he accumulated things from the island and stored them in a hut that he  
constructed. One day after hunting for food and returning back to his hut,  
much to his dismay he saw that his hut was on fire along with everything else  
he owned!   
All of his possessions were going up in smoke! The only thing he had left were  
the clothes on his back. Initially he was in shock, and then he was consumed  
with anger and rage!   
In his fury he threw a fist into the air and began cursing God and yelling,  
?God, how could you let this happen to me? I?ve been praying everyday for  
months about being rescued and no one has come, and now everything that I have  
is on fire! How could you do to this to me! Why did you let this happen??   
Later the man was on his hands and knees weeping heavily when he happened to  
look up and catch sight of a ship coming in his direction. The man was rescued  
and as they were heading back to civilization the man asked the captain, ?How  
were you able to find me??   
The captain responded, ?We were voyaging across the ocean when we noticed on  
the horizon a column of smoke going up. We decided to go check it out and when  
we did, that?s when we found you!?   
In life we are going to be confronted with challenges, problems, and  
disasters. But keep in mind that what the devil has meant for bad, God can  
transform into your good! What is a catastrophe can sometimes be a blessing in  
disguise. ?The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears, and delivers them out of  
all their troubles. The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and  
saves such as have a contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions of the  
righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.?
