Dear Friends,   
 I heard and read some works by Swami Suddhananda : www.selfknowledge.in   
There is an ashram somewhere near the Arunachala Giri. Probably someone might  
be interested in visiting the ashram.   
to me he appears to have realized. Please dont miss a chance to meet him if  
you get one   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Sankar, you are correct. Keep the checklist and try how   
many one can practise.   
Arunachala Siva.

Withdrawing our attention from what we are not and paying attention to what we  
are is the qualification for self realisation.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and others, by paying attention to the   
self, we become the Self and we do not remain in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar,   
 Nice compiltion !   
Without Satva Guna one cannot find liberation.   
Rajas and tamas bind one and do not allow release possible.   
Love!
