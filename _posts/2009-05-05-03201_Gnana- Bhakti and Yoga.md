## Gnana, Bhakti and Yoga

I heard partly a discourse being telecast in TV yesterday. The discourser  
said, one who prays to Vishnu becomes a great Bhakta, one who prays to Shiva  
becomes a great Gnani and one who prays to Shakti becomes a Yogi (Kundalini)   
Thoughts then flashed in my mind that Sri Shankara was a Great Bhakta, a Great  
Gnani and a Great Yogi too!   
It was nice bit of information and I thought, I would share it here!

Dear Nagaraj,   
Ultimately, Jnana is the royal path. The bhakti marga and yoga marga are  
ancillary routes to the royal path of Jnana. But such compartmentalization  
cannot be understood by most of us. Bhagavan   
Ramana therefore said: 1\. Bhakti is Jnana-matha. Through bhakti one loves god as also other living  
beings. This takes us to the Jnana marga or self enquiry.   
2\. As regards Yoga marga, Bhagavan Ramana said the difficult methods of  
breath-control is only to build the body fit enough to   
proceed with self enquiry as also to make the mind concentrating on   
the breath control exercises. Bhagavan Ramana said, such an elaborate breath  
control technqiues are not necessary. For protecting body, one should eat  
sattvic food with moderate quantities and this is adequate. For concentrating  
the mind, it is enough to watch the breath, and chant a simple mantra to ward  
off other thoughts.   
3\. Karma marga is approved by all the three schools. Only the karma should  
be done with out any ambition, looking for some fruits. etc.,   
and submitting all karma to god.   
Arunachala Siva.

You are correct Dear Subramanian, All paths finally lead one to the path of  
Gnana.   
Sankara says in Vivekachoodamani about action and knowledge   
Chittasya shudhaye karma na tu vasthoopalabdhaye   
Vasthu siddhir vicharena na kinchit karma kotibhih   
Actions are for purification of the mind alone and not for realization or  
knowledge of an existing entity. Vasthu or knowledge about an existing entity  
(realization of the only existing entity which is Brahman) is achieved through  
ENQUIRY alone and not through thousands of karma.   
Ramana Maharshi says in Upadesa Saaram   
Kaaya vaan manah kaaryam uttamam   
Poojanam japah chintanam kramaat   
Work done by body, words and mind is greater to one another in order. The  
action performed through body is Pooja or offering. The actions performed  
through words are JAPA or Chanting. The action performed through mind is  
contemplation or meditation

Dear Nagaraj,   
Some more thoughts on this: 1\. Bhagavan Ramana used to say that Narayana is a great Siva Jnani and Siva  
is a great Mukunda priya (as said by Sankara himself.)   
2. Unless one loves God, he cannot love other beings. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to say that even plucking flowers and bhilva and   
tulsi leaves are themselves sins. Are not the plants and trees   
by exhibiting such flowers and leaves, pray to God?   
3\. In Arunachala Mahatmyam, it is said that trees and plants in   
the Hill are praying to Arunachala with their leaves, flowers, and   
fruits. The fireflys humming at nights are showing arti! The   
rain clouds drop rains to bathe Arunachala.   
4\. Bhagavan Ramana used to pick the fallen muster seeds from   
the kitchen floor, one by one, and put them into the tinbox. He   
has said every bit of grain and seed is Arunachala's gift to people.   
Arunachala Siva.
