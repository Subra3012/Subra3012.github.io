## Sishya

I'm a regular to do girivalam every month. I use ttdc's girivalam package.  
The guide in the bus would brief the passengers about Tiruvannamalai, the  
significance of girivalam, the mahans who meditated and lived in  
Tiruvannamalai et al. During my last trip, he said Bhagavan was the disciple  
of Shri Seshadri Swamigal. I heard the latter helped Bhagavan in getting him  
out of Patala Lingam shrine. Other than this, I never heard Bhagavan was  
anybody's sishya.   
Can one throw some light on this?

My dear Subra1905, as you correctly said that Bhagavan Ramana   
Maharshi was nobody's sishya. His Guru, if at all one can view this   
way, is the Arunachala Siva. Seshadri Swami, of course, along with   
some others, helped Him by bringing Him out of the Patala Linga cave shrine  
and thus showed Him to the world at large. There are several   
misinformations like this. One biographer (fortunately that biography   
never came out) had said that Bhagavan was working as a railway   
clerk and was married already before He came to Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, I agree with you. As aids to self-realization, I   
am looking deeply into the words of Who am I? and see how   
many steps that Bhagavan has prescribed, we are able to follow.   
For example, He says, that both likes and dislikes should be   
eschewed. This is extremely difficult. If the autorickshaw driver   
demands five rupees more than the actual fare, we yell at him.   
This five rupees may give him happiness and he likes it, but since   
it is dislike for us, we do not like it. There are various such prescriptions   
from Bhagavan in Who am I?. I shall write separately about each   
step, at a later date.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Seeking the Truth itself is seeking the Reality.   
It is Aboslute-Knowledge-Bliss. But as steps towards this, we   
have to do many things as mentioned in Who am I?   
1\. Eschew hate and love, both.   
2\. Everything is governed by a Parameswara Sakti. Abide   
in it, without thinking always, that, I will do this or I will do that.   
3\. Trust in Guru. Once you trust in Guru, he will take care of   
everything and once one surrenders to Guru, you will be consumed   
by him, like a fawn in tiger's jaw and saved!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, yes either total surrender or self enquiry is necessary.   
But this is quite difficult. It is like an ant walking on the rock   
continuously to see that the rock disappears.

the practise or " sadhana". At the end of the road, there is neither   
surrender or'surrendered. There is only One without a second.

Dear Subrahmaniyan ji   
No here I learnt another definition for self. First I knew it is everywhere  
all the time and it is only bliss, consiousness and awarness. Now it is  
silence also.   
They say in Tamil, UMAI KANDA KANAVU. Means, after realisation, silence comes  
to that person so he becomes dumb.   
When other asks him, he may not express what he has seen and he may not like  
to express. By the way, I tried Mouna vratham. But I found mind chaters lot  
rather than normal days.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mounam or Silence is not merely abstaining from mouthing of words.\   
In silence, mind works out so many thoughts. True Silence is a   
thoughtlessness. When the words and thoughts cease their work,   
naturally, the deeds also will not take place. In Kanchipuram, Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswati used to observe kashta mounam, where   
even swallowing the saliva will not be there, since swallowing of   
saliva will also make a noise.   
Bhagavan Ramana's mounam was speechless, thoughtless and   
actionless. That is the state, by practising which, one can attain   
the self. Bhagavan also said that the mounam is an uninturrupted   
speech, in the sense that at that stage the individual souls talks   
for ever with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[9] SILENCE IS THE SELF  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 13, 2008, 03:39:49 PM

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mounam or Silence is not merely abstaining from mouthing of words.\   
In silence, mind works out so many thoughts. True Silence is a   
thoughtlessness. When the words and thoughts cease their work,   
naturally, the deeds also will not take place. In Kanchipuram, Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswati used to observe kashta mounam, where   
even swallowing the saliva will not be there, since swallowing of   
saliva will also make a noise.   
Bhagavan Ramana's mounam was speechless, thoughtless and   
actionless. That is the state, by practising which, one can attain   
the self. Bhagavan also said that the mounam is an uninturrupted   
speech, in the sense that at that stage the individual souls talks   
for ever with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Bhagavan says in Who am I? Atma-swrupa is the one   
and only Reality. Everything is imagination! This world, the jiva i.e   
the individual, and God are all imaginations! But it is very difficult to   
shake off the world, ego (the individual mind) and god. Many of   
us are still doing worship of god in some form or other, be it Siva,   
be it Rama or Krishna or Devi. I told you in the other posts, there are   
several steps given as aids to self realization, in Who am I? Each one   
is difficult. But Bhagavan says in the case of god-worship, do not   
shake it off forcibly. Even a dislike to continue the god-worship in the   
home-altar, is a desire! These things will drop off when the appropriate   
time comes.   
Arunachala Siva.

The drop in the ocean is never separate from the ocean even when drop thinks  
that it is separate from ocean.   
All spiritual practices are aimed at removing the false notion that you are  
separate from your ocean of self.   
There is no need to unite drop and the ocean, because in the first place they  
are never separate and cannot be separated.   
The notion that drop is separate from the ocean is just imaginary and all  
disciplines which aim at uniting the   
drop with the ocean are also imaginary.   
You are a wave in the ocean and the wave is never separate from the ocean even  
though it has a name and form unlike the sea.   
Waves appear and disappear in the ocean only,there is no need to unite the  
wave to the sea.   
All that is required is to nullify the false notion that wave is separate from  
the sea which is not possible because it is   
because of the sea wave has it's existence.

Dear DPRSSN Raju, Nice reply. There is no seeking of   
Truth or Reality, because it is within. All that we have   
to do is to remove the enucmbrances. The room's space   
does not grow, it is the same. We only remove the   
encumbrances, to see that there is space!   
Arunchala Siva.

Dear Sankar, What is it that mind does? It produces the thoughts,   
limitless thoughts. If you cease to think, that is, when thoughts   
are annihilated, the mind is killed. Arunachala Siva.

The relation between self and the mind is like rope and the snake.   
While knowledge of rope is real,knowledge of snake imaginary.   
You cannot kill an imaginary snake because it never existed.   
If you focus light to look at the so called snake,   
 you will have the knowledge rope and knowledge of snake disappears.   
Similarly if you focus all the consciousness you have in your hand through   
self-enquiry all the imaginary objective knowledge of mind disappears   
and pure unadulterated adjunctless clear consciousness shines.

Dear all   
Can mind be killed?   
As I understand it, in a fully realized person the ego is killed but not the  
function of ego, Which includes the mind and the body thought.
