## Avudai Akka Song  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 02, 2010, 11:02:55 AM

Avudai Akka sings in her song: Everything is gone; Jnana has come!   
Everything is gone; Jnana has come.   
Gone are the rivers, and tanks for my bathing.   
Jnana has come as a cool pond in my Heart.   
Gone or the wives and sons who would never give liberation.   
Jnana has come within me, as a sure help for liberation.   
Gone are the names and forms which cannot take to the goal.   
The nameless primordial is staying in my Heart.   
Gone are the men and women, boys and girls.   
The Jnana that is neuter, is staying in my Heart.   
Everything is gone and Jnana has come;   
Jnana has come as a cool pond in my Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Avudai Akka Song = 2  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 03, 2010, 06:59:52 AM

In the 19th and early 20th century, it was common amongst all Hindus   
to celebrate the attainment puberty and first menstruation of the girl child.   
There used to be a lot of happy exchanges of words, greetings, eats and   
dance and music at home. This has fallent into disuse.   
Akka sings one such celebration, with a pageant, with inbuilt advaitic  
meaning.   
"Vidya" has become "a big lady" today.   
Let us celebrate. Oh girls, come.   
Upanishad, Brahmasutram, Vedas and Yoga Vasishta came   
 as best girls.   
They make fun of Vidya, apply kumkum, and sandal paste on her face.   
They ask her to sit "one corner" called meditation on God.   
They dance and sing the music of non dual consciousness.   
They distribute laddus of ananda, the payasam of satsangh.   
Let us celebrate, come.   
Here comes the Guru, the grand old ma of the house,   
She tells Vidya to do this and not to do that.   
"Do not jump here and there, (with your thoughts)   
It will pain your belly (mind).   
Keep silent and listen to songs and dance of Upanishads.   
The four day celebrations are over.   
*   
Vidya comes out (of isolation) and has her Holy Bath of Self Realization.   
The girls go away, saying that they have no more work with her.   
The grandold ma of the house looks at Vidya.   
"O Vidya looks really matured.   
She talks a little, she sings a little, she moves with dexterity.   
She eats a little, she sleeps a little,   
Always in the state of Self realization!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Missed the last few verses of the Guru Stotram. Here are they:  **ग ुरुरादिरनादिश्च गुरुः परमदैवतम् ।   
गुरोः परतरं नास्ति तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः ॥१३॥**   
gururaadiranaadishca guruh paramadaivatam   
guroh parataram naasti tasmai shriigurave namah 13   
The Guru is the beginning of the universe, yet he himself is without a  
beginning; the Guru is the highest deity; there is none higher than the Guru.  
Salutations to the Guru.   
 **ब ्रह्मानन्दं परमसुखदं केवलं ज्ञानमूर्तिम्   
द्वन्द्वातीतं गगनसदृशं तत्त्वमस्यादिलक्ष्यम् ।   
एकं नित्यं विमलमचलं सर्वधीसाक्षीभूतम्   
भावातीतं त्रिगुणरहीतं सद्गुरुंतं नमामि ॥१४॥**

ekam nityam vimalamacalam sarvadhiisaakssiibhuutam   
bhaavaatiitam trigunnarahiitam sadgurumtam namaami 14   
Salutations to the true Guru who is the embodiment of the Bliss of Brahman and  
the bestower of supreme happiness, who is detached, Knowledge personified and  
beyond duality, who is like the sky, and is indicated by such Vedic dicta as  
"Thou art That", and who is One, eternal pure, immovable, the witness of all  
the changes in the Buddhi (intellect), beyond all states and devoid of the  
three Gunas.

## Re:[4]Ya Devi Sarvabhutesu  
Author: silentgreen         Date: February 28, 2010, 12:43:50 PM  
---  
This is one of the most popular hymn from Devi Mahatmyam where the devas sing  
praises of Devi Durga. The Devi is not limited as a personal deity but her  
Shakti pervades everywhere, within every being ( **य ा देवी सर्वभुतेषु**).  
Let us also pray for the blessings of the Devi.   
 **य ा देवी सर्वभुतेषु**   
(yaa devii sarvabhutessu)   
 **न मो देव्यै महादेव्यै शिवायै सततं नमः ।   
नमः प्रकृत्यै भद्रायै नियताः प्रणताः स्म ताम् ॥१॥**   
namo devyai mahaadevyai shivaayai satatam namah   
namah prakrtyai bhadraayai niyataah prannataah sma taam 1   
Salutations to the Devi, to the Mahadevi. Salutations always to her who is  
ever auspicious.   
Salutations to her who is the primordial cause and the sustaining power. With  
attention, we have made obeisance to her.   
 **र ौद्रायै नमो नित्यायै गौर्यै धात्र्यै नमो नमः ।   
ज्योत्स्नायै चेन्दुरूपिण्यै सुखायै सततं नमः ॥२॥**   
roudraayai namo nityaayai gouryai dhaatryai namo namah   
jyotsnaayai cenduruupinnyai sukhaayai satatam namah 2   
Salutations to her who is terrible, to her who is eternal. Salutations to  
Gauri, the supporter (of the Universe).   
Salutations always to her who is of the form of the moon and moon-light and  
happiness itself.   
 **क ल्याण्यै प्रणता वृद्धयै सिद्धयै कुर्मो नमो नमः ।   
नैर्ऋत्यै भूभृतां लक्ष्म्यै शर्वाण्यै ते नमो नमः ॥३॥**   
kalyaannyai prannataa vrddhayai siddhayai kurmo namo namah   
nairrtyai bhuubhrtaam lakssmyai sharvaannyai te namo namah 3   
We bow to her who is welfare; we make salutations to her who is prosperity and  
success.   
Salutations to the consort of Siva who is herself the good fortune as well as  
misfortune of kings.   
 **द ुर्गायै दुर्गपारायै सारायै सर्वकारिण्यै ।   
ख्यात्यै तथैव कृष्णायै धूम्रायै सततं नमः ॥४॥**   
durgaayai durgapaaraayai saaraayai sarvakaarinnyai   
khyaatyai tathaiva krssnnaayai dhuumraayai satatam namah 4   
Salutations always to Durga who takes one across in difficulties, who is  
essence, who is the author of everything.   
who is knowledge of discrimination; and who is blue-black as also smoke-like  
in complexion.   
 **अ तिसौम्यातिरौद्रायै नतास्तस्यै नमो नमः ।   
नमो जगत्प्रतिष्ठायै देव्यै कृत्यै नमो नमः ॥५॥**   
atisoumyaatiroudraayai nataastasyai namo namah   
namo jagatpratisstthaayai devyai krtyai namo namah 5   
We prostate before her who is at once most gentle and most terrible; we salute  
her again and again.   
Salutations to her who is the support of the world. Salutations to the Devi  
who is of the form of volition.   
 **य ा देवी सर्वभुतेषु विष्णुमायेति शब्दिता ।

Dear silentgreen,   
Thanks for the Slokas. The famous Guru Brahma, Gurur Vishnur, Guru   
Deva Maheswara, is said to appear only in Sri Guru Gita. This Guru   
Gita has got many rescensions. Shri Sivananda's Ashram has published   
one, which is the longest. Sri Kanchi Math has brought out this in Sanskrit   
and Tamil versions, which my wife reads in her classes. This mantra is   
included in all minor poems of Sri Sankara also.   
Sri Devi Mahaatmyam has got 700 verses. It is called Sri Durga Saptasati.   
Of these, several portions alone are chanted separately. One such is   
Yaa devi sarvabhuteshu.... Sri Ramakrishna speaks highly of this and this   
is chanted in SRK Maths. In Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, it is chanted during   
Dasara festivals.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. What is asat. First, uttering lies, left and right, everyday.  
First   
one should give up this asat in words, and maintain Satyam, the Truth, the   
Real. Bhagavan Ramana had to only utter a couple of lies, after His death   
experience. Firstly, He said He had electricity class and left the Madurai   
home. On the way, He had to say that He had lost His belongings to   
Muthu Krishna Bhagavatar to enable Him obtain some money for futher   
journey by pawning His ear-studs. Thereafter, He never uttered lies.   
To keep up Truth in thoughts, words and deeds, I think, is the first step.   
Saint Tiruvalluvar had said: A lie is occasionally a truth, if such a lie   
can bring you blemishless good. Bhagavan Ramana uttered these two   
lies as per Tiruvalluvar's dictum.   
Arunachala Siva.

Kali is Mahaa Maayaa unleashed. She did not even care about her husband.   
Mahaa Maayaa will become peaceful only if you surrender to her. Then   
she will show her soumya form, nice beautiful, calm form, as the cute   
wife of Siva. Sri Sankara says: "Who can measure Maayaa's tricks? In a   
few seconds, like the ball falling down from the stairs, one sadhak can   
fall in seconds, if she does not show concern for you." It is like the story   
of Bilwa Mangal, the author of Sri Krishna Karnamrutam. He was a compulsive  
sex monger, who climbed to the upper storey of his lover's   
house, holding a snake as a rope. He had earlier crossed the stream on   
a crocodile. Maayaa will do anything to befall you. Surrender to her.   
That is why Sri Sankara composed his famous Sri Devi Kshamaparadana   
Stotram.   
Arunachala Siva.
