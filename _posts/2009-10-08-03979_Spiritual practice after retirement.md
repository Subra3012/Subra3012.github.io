## The Young age etc., and the Waking state etc.,  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 10, 2009, 03:44:10 PM

There are two types of changes for a human life. The first   
is with reference to body, which constantly changing from   
birth, young age, middle age, disease, senilty, old age to death.   
This is deha-maya. The other is with reference to the mind,   
which is in wakeful state, dream state and deep sleep state.   
This is mano-maya.   
Vyavruthasu... in these changing states, anuvarthamana...   
that which is constantly shining, aham-sphurna, is aham- aham...   
the I-I. What one seeker should do is to ignore the changing   
body and mind states, prakateekarothi bhajatham... constantly   
meditate on this I-I. Nan... Nan as Bhagavan Ramana said   
in Who am I? Then this I-I will become one's nature.   
For this what one seeker should do? He should pray to the   
Guru, Sri Dakshinamurthy, who is showing a hand-pose,   
Chin-mudra and this is Permanent, bhadraya.   
Verse 7 of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram states: Balyadhishvapi jagradhadhisha tata sarvasvayas thasvapi   
Vyavruthas-anuvarthamanam, aham-ahamityanta sphurantham   
sadha,   
Svatmanam prakatikarothi bhajatam, yo mudhraya bhadhraya   
Thasmai Sri Gurumurtaye, Sri Dakshinamurthaye!   
Now this Chinmudra or the handpose, is only a physical show?   
Sri Dakshinamurty shows his right hand, where three fingers are   
a little away from the index finger and this index finger touches   
the bottom of the thumb. This is physical chinmudra and for this   
the meaning is that the individual soul should keep away from   
the three impurities of karma, maya and ego and hold the   
feet of Guru or God. The feet of Guru is the sublime way of   
surrendering to ensure atma-jnana. Muruganar has written   
about 3000 Verses under Pada-malai, Garland to the Guru's   
feet. This is on Bhagavan Ramana's feet.   
But this Chinmudra refers estoerically another thing also.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Weight-lifting in Gym  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 08, 2009, 07:53:57 AM

Why do people go to Gym and do weight-lifting? It is only   
by practising lifting of heavy objects, one gets greater   
muscle power and remain healthy. Weight is lifted not to   
make the weight, more muscular!   
The world is also like this. It is like a bent tail of a dog   
or a weight. We deal with the world only to attain mental   
strength, capacity to struggle against heavy odds, to attain   
more perseverence and tolerance and calmness.   
We do this shadow boxing only to gain our boxing skills.   
No one can change the world and make it happier. Great   
reformers have done this and have failed.   
For this, one has to totally repose faith in Guru. Because   
Guru is beyond world, beyond the concept of Space. He is   
also beyond time, in the eternal NOW. They are such great   
personalities that they need no training from the world.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Spiritual practice after retirement  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 08, 2009, 04:16:03 PM

Most of us, in the past and also in the present times, think that   
spiritual practice can be reserved for post-retirement life. This   
is, as if the life is on our hands. Anything can happen by the time   
you become 60. One can have a heart attack and kick the bucket.   
Or one can be afflicted with some diseases, which come in the   
way of one's concentration or attention. Or, mere senility will   
give tiredness, sleepiness, and one complaint everyday.   
We have to start spirituality, right at least, in the middle age.   
And this needs God's grace. The simple practices of sandhya,   
bhakti, listening to discourses, reading books on spirltual practices and self  
realized saints etc., will take us to the right   
mediatative practices and self enquiry.   
Once one old man came to attend a Satsangh. He was in his   
80s and he came with his grandson. He will sit on the first   
row, and within 5 minutes of the word "go", he will go to sleep!   
He will sleep and drop his head, at least 10 times in 90 minutes!   
The discourser became uneasy, because this oldie makes him lose   
all interest in speaking and also suggests him to go to nap in the   
middle. One day, the disourser told the grandson that he would   
give Rs 2.00 everyday, if that guy wakes up his grandpa with   
walking stick whenever he goes to sleep. The grandson readily   
agreed. This went on for 2 days.   
Incidentally this grandson who is 7 years old, is really the   
child of post 2K years. He can operate the internet as if   
it is a rubber ball. Very clever guy.   
The grandson stopped his work after 2 days. The disocurser   
called him and asked him why. This fellow said: Sir you are   
giving Rs 2/-. But my grandpa gives Rs 5.00 everyday, if I   
do not disturb his sleep during the discourse!   
deham pranaabhi indriyanyapi chalam buddhincha sunyam vidhu: Stree balandha jadopamast tvahamithi pranta bruchanam   
vaadihina..... (Sri D.S. Verse 5)   
This body, breath, sense organs, buddhi, the sense of stupor or nothingness,  
will deteriorate and make one to become foolish like a woman or a young boy or  
a insentient object, as time   
engulfs you. This is Maha Maya of Pruthivi, asat, imagined   
delusions and desires. Go to the Guru, before it is too late. Hurry up please  
it is time, hurry up please it is time......   
Arunachala Siva..
