consciousness.   
Here is the story of Ajja and talks with him.

## After having darshan

When we offer flower, fruits and coconuts to God and do archana, these things  
become pure and prasad. Before archana we never put flower on our eyes   
Because these things had grace of God. We also pray infront of God. but we  
come back same person as before we enter into temple   
where as ordinary flower and fruits become prasad. where is the mistake?  
Because we always carry our mind with us always. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What silentgreen wrote about Eating Vegetables will also hold   
good for an answer. Bhagavan Ramana said: Even there, do   
not pluck the flowers or fruits. Place only the fruits and flowers   
that have fallen from trees and plants. But we cannot do that. So, we can  
place flowers and fruits to Godhead, since what Bhagavan Ramana told was an  
extreme measure. That way, are we not killing bugs and mosquitoes by applying  
HIT and other solutions?   
Once a devotee asked Bhagavan Ramana: Is it wrong to eat   
eggs too? Bhagavan Ramana said: Yes, it contains a potential   
life. Bhagavan Ramana further said in some other connection: Even the slab  
on which you are sitting contains innumerable bacterias. Are you avoiding?  
So everyone can follow without taking it to the exterme which only Bhagavan  
Ramana could do.   
Arunachala Siva.

That is such a beautiful question   
You can be a prasad if you get "touched" by God & You recognize the Touch!   
incidentally, we are all touched by God every moment. .. coz every moment God  
is to our left, right, up, down. .. everywhere. .. in and through us. .. you  
will not be wrong if you say: "i am always in the embrace of my God". .. God  
embraces us always. ..   
so if we recognize that the flower is touched by god, it becomes prasad.   
if we recognize that we are touched by God. .. we become the Prasad.   
infact, we are already consumed by God. .. long before you recognize it. ..  
you are "inside" god!   
So its this recognition... so a flower need not be offered to God. .. its  
already offered. its never separate to be offered. if you pluck it and try to  
offer. .. you are doing the mistake of thinking its not offered before you  
gave it! in this whole universe not a single entity is ours to offer to God!  
Everything is already God's!   
so only our ego can be truely offered! But where is it to offer once we  
understand that everything is already offered! ?   
Love!

If everything is already offered, i do not have anything to offer except my  
mind or ego which God never likes I believe.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No, No. Guru or God will like your mind or ego, however much   
it is dirty. Do not worry. He is a great washerman. Saint   
Manikkavachagar sings in Kovil Tirupathigam, the song that   
is liked by Bhagavan Ramana, very much.   
O You have given You to me   
And taken me to You.   
O Sankara, tell me,   
Who is cleverer in the bargain?   
I got an endless bliss from You,   
What have you got from this poor me?   
You have taken my Heart as Your abode.   
O Siva the Lord of Tiruperundurai,   
You have taken my body as your Temple,   
What recompense can I ever pay you?   
 \- Kovil Tirupadigam, Verse 10.   
The scholars in Saiva Siddhantam like Muruganar says that   
the saint's union with Siva is complete with this song.   
Arunachala Siva.
