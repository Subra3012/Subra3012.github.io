## Ashta Virasthanams  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 09, 2009, 07:37:45 AM

Ramanaduli asked about the Ashta Virasthanams, the 8 Heroic   
Deeds of Siva, a couple of weeks back. I checked up with   
Tirumandiram of Saint Tirumoolar, one of the 63 Saints of Siva,   
in Periya Puranam. In Tantra II of the said book in Chapter 2,   
there is a reference to the 8 heroic deeds of Siva. Eight Temples   
are there, to commemorate these heroic deeds. Remember, the   
eight temples do not indicate that the places where the heroic   
deeds took place, but were constructed by Tamil kings only   
to commomerate the deeds.   
1\. The first is Tirukkoilur, in Chingelput District of Tamil Nadu.   
This is to remember the killing of Antakasura, a demon by Siva.   
Tirumoolar sings: Antaka the Asura   
Frightening unto God of Death   
Whose name he bore   
Armed with boons divine   
Harassed worlds all,   
\-- Thus the celestials moaned to the Lord, And the Lord,   
Lifting high his trident sharp   
Pierced him to certain death.   
2\. The second is Daksha. The temple is there in Tirupparialur,   
in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu. This is to remember killing   
of Daksha by Siva. Daksha was the father of Katyayani, Parvati, who was born  
to him, by penance. She is Siva's wife. When   
Daksha performed a sacrifice, for which he ignored Siva, and also caused shame  
to Parvati, Siva killed him, in the form of Veerabhadra.   
Tirumoolar sings: Daksha, the son of Brahma fatally erred;   
Deadly was his sin,   
To defy the Lord's primacy,   
And the Lord smote his head,   
And consigned to flames,   
And then bethought,   
"Such like are needed for this world   
And object lesson to serve"   
And so, fixed a sheep's head to the trunk   
Thus let him be.   
This is also described by Saint Manikkavachagar in his   
Tiru Undiyar, in Tiruvachakam.   
3. The third is punishment to Brahma and Vishnu. This temple is in Tirukandiyur, in Thanjavur District, Tamil Nadu. Brahma at one time was five-headed as Siva. Brahma and Vishnu, encouraged by the flattery of gods and sages challenged Siva's supremacy.   
Siva, assuming the form of Kala Bhairava, pinched away one of the five heads  
of Brahma with his finger nail. Bearing Brahma's   
flesh oozing skull, Bhairava demanded Vishnu to drain out his blood into the  
skull and fill it up. Vishnu in fear obeyed. thus were the two gods shown  
their place.   
Tirumular sings: All pervasive are the Lord's feet,   
All worlds they support,   
All life they sustain,   
That this heavenly being may know   
In mounting rage, he nipped Brahma's head,   
And in the skull drained Vishnu's blood,   
When they, His supremacy defied.   
4\. The fourth is Jalandhara, a giant, the foster son of Varuna, the sea-god.  
By virtue of his prenances, he received a boon that no one could kill him. He  
thus became all powerful and began to harass the celestials. They took refuge  
in Siva. Siva confronted Jalandhara and drew a circle around him. He  
challenged the giant to lift the earth within the circle. Jalandhara lifted  
the circle and immeditely the circle became a powerful discus and destroyed  
him. Thus Jalandhara destroyed himself as per the boon. This heroic deed is  
remembered in Tiruvirkudi, near Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.   
Tirumular sings: The Lord pervades all,   
My heart too He fills with joy,   
He spoke the Vedas, and scriptures all,   
Him - the haughty Jalandhara challenged in duel,   
And the Lord with his toe marked a circle,   
And into it He saw the monster's final end.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says that the discus was presented later to Vishnu, as  
his weapon.   
to be continued....   
Arunachala Siva.

When we offer flower, fruits and coconuts to God and do archana, these things  
become pure and prasad. Before archana we never put flower on our eyes   
Because these things had grace of God. We also pray infront of God. but we  
come back same person as before we enter into temple   
where as ordinary flower and fruits become prasad. where is the mistake?  
Because we always carry our mind with us always. Is it?

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What silentgreen wrote about Eating Vegetables will also hold   
good for an answer. Bhagavan Ramana said: Even there, do   
not pluck the flowers or fruits. Place only the fruits and flowers   
that have fallen from trees and plants. But we cannot do that. So, we can  
place flowers and fruits to Godhead, since what Bhagavan Ramana told was an  
extreme measure. That way, are we not killing bugs and mosquitoes by applying  
HIT and other solutions?   
Once a devotee asked Bhagavan Ramana: Is it wrong to eat   
eggs too? Bhagavan Ramana said: Yes, it contains a potential   
life. Bhagavan Ramana further said in some other connection: Even the slab  
on which you are sitting contains innumerable bacterias. Are you avoiding?  
So everyone can follow without taking it to the exterme which only Bhagavan  
Ramana could do.   
Arunachala Siva.

That is such a beautiful question   
You can be a prasad if you get "touched" by God & You recognize the Touch!   
incidentally, we are all touched by God every moment. .. coz every moment God  
is to our left, right, up, down. .. everywhere. .. in and through us. .. you  
will not be wrong if you say: "i am always in the embrace of my God". .. God  
embraces us always. ..   
so if we recognize that the flower is touched by god, it becomes prasad.   
if we recognize that we are touched by God. .. we become the Prasad.   
infact, we are already consumed by God. .. long before you recognize it. ..  
you are "inside" god!   
So its this recognition... so a flower need not be offered to God. .. its  
already offered. its never separate to be offered. if you pluck it and try to  
offer. .. you are doing the mistake of thinking its not offered before you  
gave it! in this whole universe not a single entity is ours to offer to God!  
Everything is already God's!   
so only our ego can be truely offered! But where is it to offer once we  
understand that everything is already offered! ?   
Love!

If everything is already offered, i do not have anything to offer except my  
mind or ego which God never likes I believe.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No, No. Guru or God will like your mind or ego, however much   
it is dirty. Do not worry. He is a great washerman. Saint   
Manikkavachagar sings in Kovil Tirupathigam, the song that   
is liked by Bhagavan Ramana, very much.   
O You have given You to me   
And taken me to You.   
O Sankara, tell me,   
Who is cleverer in the bargain?   
I got an endless bliss from You,   
What have you got from this poor me?   
You have taken my Heart as Your abode.   
O Siva the Lord of Tiruperundurai,   
You have taken my body as your Temple,   
What recompense can I ever pay you?   
 \- Kovil Tirupadigam, Verse 10.   
The scholars in Saiva Siddhantam like Muruganar says that   
the saint's union with Siva is complete with this song.   
Arunachala Siva.
