For the past twenty-odd years I have read S. S. Cohen's English translation of  
the Srimad Bhagavata and found it to be an invaluable source of both spiritual  
and day-to-day guidance.   
This work, along with Tripura Rahasya and Advaita Bodha Deepika, was  
recommended by Bhagavan for those who found difficulty in understanding His  
teachings.   
For those who are unfamiliar with this work, you can find extracts on this  
website under the News and Articles section - go to: http://www.arunachala-  
ramana.org/articles/extract_srimad_bhagavatam_1.htm

This ancient Sanskrit work, along with the Srimad Bhagavata and Advaita Bodha  
Deepika, was recommended by Bhagavan for those who found difficulty in

For those who are unfamiliar with this work, you can download the entire book  
from dozens of websites - just do a search for Tripura Rahasya.   
There are a number of errors and unclear sections in the book and I suspect  
different hands have been at work in editing the English translation over the  
years, even the most recent reprint still contains many errors.   
Also a number of verses were missed out in the English translation and these  
should be added again.   
Perhaps those members who are familiar with Sanskrit and English might  
consider clarifying it for the benefit of all.

## Re:[90] The Vedas  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: August 08, 2014, 07:22:34 AM

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas-The upangas** continued...   
 **Mimamsa and Adi Sankara**   
Buddhism on the one hand, Nyaya and Mimamsa on the other which were opposed to  
it, and Sankhya which does not accept Isvara but respects the pramanas of the  
Vedas: of these our Acarya accepts elements that are to be accepted and  
rejects elements that are to be rejected. He establishes the Vedantic system  
which harbours all these and which is their source. Sankara's view is not at  
variance with the ultimate message of Buddhism, that is the exalted state of  
jnana. He accepts some of the basic concepts of Sankhya like Purusa that is  
jnana by itself and equivalent to the Nirguna-Brahman and Prakrti which is the  
same as Maya. At the same time, he accepts the Vedic rituals of Mimamsa and  
the Isvara of Nyaya. But he sees each of them as an aspect of the one Truth,  
not as the final goal which it is to the various individual systems mentioned.  
He integrates these different aspects into a harmonious whole in his own  
system of thought.   
As we have already seen, Udayana and other supporters of the Nyaya system  
criticized Buddhism on the score that it was silent on the question of God,  
while mimamsakas like Kumarilabhatta attacked the same because it did not  
favour Vedic rituals. The acarya was in sympathy with these views and believed  
that Vedic sacraments, considered all-important by the mimamsakas were  
essential to the cleansing of the mind and to the proper conduct of the  
affairs of the community. However, he was opposed to the mimamsakas not only  
because they did not accept an entity like Isvara as the dispenser of the  
fruits of our actions but also because they did not believe that, after being  
rendered pure by works, there is any need for one to go further and take the  
path of jnana. He also did not agree with their view that to become a sanyasin  
giving up all karma is not right.   
Kumarilabhatta and Mandanamisra are particularly important among the  
mimamsakas. The Acarya had a debate with Kumarilabhatta during the last days  
of that mimamsaka and won him over to his viewpoint. Similarly, Mandanamisra  
also became a convert to Advaita Vedanta and came to be one of the Acarya's  
chief disciples assuming the title of Suresvaracarya.   
 **If the Acarya opposed Mimamsa, which is one of the fourteen branches of  
Vedic lore, it was not because he thought it to be wholly unacceptable. He was  
in agreement with the sacraments dealt with in that system, but he differed  
from it on the question of devotion to the Lord. He further believed that the  
fruits yielded by the rites, rewards like paradise, must be dedicated to  
Isvara and that in this very act of renunciation the mind is purified**.  
Sankara's teaching is this: it is only if we realise that Isvara is the Phala-  
data, the one who awards the fruits of our actions, that we will not be  
tempted by petty rewards like paradise. Only then will we be inspired to go  
beyond to attain the higher reward of inner purity. **The Vedic works were  
wholly acceptable to our Acarya. But for the mimamsakas they were an end in  
themselves; they did not transcend them to become devoted to the Supreme  
Godhead and to acquire jnana, the final realisation that Isvara and we are one  
and the same. Sankara criticised mimamsakas for their failure to understand  
this truth**. **That he did not oppose Vedic karma is proved again by the fact  
that in his upadesa (teaching) -it is called Sopana-Panchaka- before giving up  
his body he made the admonishment that the Vedas must be chanted every day and  
that the rites mentioned in them must be performed**.   
 **Vedo nityam adhiyatam   
Taduditam karma svanushtiyatham**   
The Acarya, however, taught us not to stop with karma (performed for the sake  
of karma), but to go beyond it. The rites that we conduct must be made an  
offering to Isvara. This is a means of obtaining inner purity and also that of  
receiving instruction in jnana. That is the time when we must give up all  
karma to meditate upon the teaching we have received, indeed meditate on it  
with intensity and make it our inner experiential reality. **Sankara takes us,  
step by step, in this way to final release. He opposed the mimamsakas because  
they failed to understand the purpose of Vedic karma and refused to go beyond  
it.**   
continued....

Sri Bhashyam is a commentary of Brahma Sutras by Sri Ramanujacharya. Sutras or  
thread or Aphorism of Para Brahmam.   
The Vedas and Upanishads were neatly categorized by Badarayana or Vyasa or  
Krishnadvaipayana (He is known by these names) Before he categorized the Veda,  
upanishads etc... the great sages of the yore even before Vyasa, Vashishta,  
Vishwamitras. It was a time when there was no written record, teaching was  
only by listening to their Guru. these great sages transfered from generations  
to generations the sutras or Aphorisms of Brahma Gnana. They are very very  
abstract aphorisms and are the root of the entire Vedas themselves. Vedas  
themselves are birthless, Brahma Sutras are considered the roots of the Vedas.   
Greats like Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka and few others have written  
commentary on Brahma Sutras. It is so abstract that it is capable being  
interpreted in multiple ways. These commentaries were supported with evidences  
from Upanishads by Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva etc...   
The very fact that it is capable of being interpreted in multiple ways viz.  
Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, Dwaita proves that ultimate truth can be attained by  
any of the interpretations!   
Sri Ramanuja wrote a commentary on Sutras to as a proof(study) his system of  
doctrine Vishishtadvaita like Shankaras Advaita.   
proof or study here to find out what the Brahma Sutras say finally? do they  
really convey what the student has understood from the Vedanta!   
Shankara through his study of Vedas, understood Advaiata Bhava and through his  
study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras too conveyed the same  
doctrine of his Advaita   
Ramanuja through his study of Vedas, understood the Vishishtadvaita(Qualified  
Advaita) and through his study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras  
too conveyed the same doctrine of his Vishishtadvaita   
Similarly, Anandatheertha or Madhvacharya his doctrine Dvaita   
No study of Vedanta is complete without close examination of these Brahma  
Sutras. They are also called as Nyaya Prasthana or logical standing point of  
Vedanta.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I have not yet read the book on Sri Ramakrishna published by RK Math. However  
I have read the story of Sri Ramanuja from different sources.   
Sri Ramanuja's reforms were rather too strong for his time. Admitting women  
and all castes in the maTams. He questioned the authority of Adi Sankara's  
maTams. There indeed was a lot of ideological opposition. Also he was not  
prepared to sign the declaration that "nothing is greater than Siva". The  
aazvaars accepted Siva, but accorded a higher status to Vishnu. Ramanuja  
considered naadhamuni, aaLavandhaar and the aazhvaars as his spiritual  
leaders.   
Even among the Vaishnavites, there are two groups, one follow Vedanta Desikan  
of 13th Century and others Sri Ramanuja.   
Since I have not read the book, to have a clear understanding, it would be  
great if you can share the exact text from the book on Sri Ramanuja so that we  
can investigate for our understanding   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M   
SRK Math as philosophy, approves only Advaita. But Sri Ramakrishna's  
religious tolerance is well known. He supported   
all religions and sects. Sri Ramakrishananda, who came to Madras   
and started the Madras Math, the second in the whole world, after   
Belur, wanted to know about Sri Ramanuja who is a Tamil scholar and  
visishtadvati. Hence, Sri Ramakrishananada, read Sri Ramanuja's books and  
wrote a biography on him. Sri Ramanuja's book naturally would consist ideas  
establishing Visishtadvata and also the Supremacy of Narayana. Sri  
Ramakrishnanada is faithful to Sri   
Ramanuja's philosophy while writing the biography. That is all.   
Srimad Bhagavatam, written by Sage Vyasa, speaks about the supremacy of  
Narayana. It says Narayana gave birth to Brahma and   
Brahma gave birth to ten sons, one of them is Siva. Sage Vyasa   
is neutral. That is why his Brahma Sutram, gives rise to interpretations by  
all the three great Saints. Sankara, Sri Ramanuja   
and Madhwa. Sri Ramanuja's Brahma Sutra Bhashyam, naturally interprets Brahma  
Sutram, as per qualified non dualism. Sage   
Vyasa's Skandam, extols the supremacy of Skanda. All devi slokas,   
and devi bhashyam extols the supremacy of Uma. This is not uncommon in Hindu  
philosophy. Abhirami Andati says She is one,   
and she became many. That sums up the whole thing. Sankara is   
par excellent, because he extolled Advaita, Non dual Brahman. But he also  
wrote numerous slokas on all the deities. You should read Sri   
Soundarya Lahari, of Sri Sankara. He says that Uma, Sri Lalita  
Tripurasundari, is the greatest, and all gods including Siva, remain as four  
legs of her sleeping cot and Siva her bed! Can you beat it?   
Arunachala Siva.

A little more to add from my previous post...   
Sri Vaishnavas understand the Vedas to teach that Sriman Narayana is the  
Supreme Brahman, and that meditation and surrender to him is the only means to  
moksha.   
The Tamil heritage of the Sri Vaishnavas also teaches them that Narayana alone  
is the supreme entity. With these as a background, the question of worshipping  
Siva as envisioned in temples and puraanas cannot even arise, since according  
to the Vaishnava tradition, Siva is not God as such.   
This is somewhat contrary to the smaarta view that both Vishnu and Siva are  
merely subjective and ultimately false conceptions of the formless,  
undifferentiated Absolute.   
According to me these differences arises form the doctrine stand point of  
view. Just like how Jesus is for Christians, Vishnu was to Vaishnavites, He is  
the only supreme God Vushnu is the only Brahman. Whereas from Shankaras stand  
point of view, Vishnu, Shiva are only representation or manifestation of the  
supreme reality or Bharman.

Thanks a lot,   
I have to admit, at the beginning I had little knowledge of siva and I was a  
devotee of Lord Vishnu. Until the age 22 or 23 for the first time I visited  
Arunachala, got introduce to Siva and importantly with Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi from there till now its no turning back (date: around 2004), honestly  
speaking it was Arunachala who made me to visit the Scared Chidambaram Temple.   
An interesting incident occur in my life i want to share with you people.   
We had our house shifted in 2007 August, while shifting there was a aluminum  
cast idol of Nataraja, while shifting I found this Idol and told my mother  
that let the idol be thrown or kept away in old house, my mother said it is  
siva and should be not thrown. Even at that moment I had no knowledge of  
''Dancer of the Cosmos, the Lord of the Universe', NATARAJA.   
Ok we moved to new house(rent), that same year December 2007 we visited Scared  
Chidambaram Temple, we went inside we were searching for main deity, we came  
across Lord Govinda, and asked for the main deity, an retired Professor made  
us to turn the otherside, suddenly all people lifted their hands up in  
salutation, and there was the Idol of Nataraja behind it was the Secret.   
But all i can say now is that I pray both Siva and Vishnu likewise giving more  
to Nataraja.   
\   
The quest for me was to understand our ancient Tamil works on Hinduism through  
books.   
But there seems to be many books.   
I'm a tamilian but being brought up in Bangalore, can speak tamil but cannot  
write or read it. Yes one day i will learn soon.   
Going by what Subramanian.R and Nagaraj post, it looks so complicated our  
Hinduism is. But for a common man hearing what Subramanian and Nagaraj words  
it is really difficult to understand and to accept which.   
More confusion has got into me.   
Siva Chidambaram

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I would say don't get too much into intellectual and complications in your  
efforts or sadhana. somehow I or we have landed here with so much study or  
readings. The reality is that there is no difference between you and me in  
spite of the complications and extra intellectual learning from my side.   
At the end of the day, if you are successful in tears dropping from your eyes  
out of devotion Bhakthi, nothing is equivalent to that. Just be as you are.  
Don't get caught in too much intellectualisation as well. Don't let yourself  
be confused. discard what is confusing as poison and keep going. Even mine or  
our posts. I would even go further saying don't even bother knowing further  
the doctrines of Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita and all. Just shower  
love.   
Swami Vivekananda has said: _It is a man-making religion that we want. It is man-making theories that  
we want. It is man-making education all round that we want. And here is the  
test of truth --anything that makes you weak physically, intellectually, and  
spiritually, reject as poison, there is no life in it, it cannot be true.  
Truth is strengthening. Truth is purity, truth is all knowledge; truth must  
be strengthening, must be enlightening, must be invigorating._**   
Keep it very simple, I have come to understand that love and loving others and  
above all **FORBEARANCE** is the ultimate realisation. thats what jnanis do.  
we should strive to relieve or help others of their pain, spread love. love is  
everything.   
Thirumular has said all that needs to be told in 2 simple beautiful words the  
sum of all knowledge of all Vedas and scriptures of all religions. Refer to a  
post on Auvaiyar's Aathichoodi simple teachings in this forum. they make best  
set of principles anyone needs to follow.   
 **Anbe Sivam** Love, indeed is the all pervading God!   
Truly there is nothing more to know at all even from Vedas or Upanisdhads or  
any other scriptures of the world.   
As the saying goes:  **PAROPARAKARYA PHALANTI VRIKSHAH - The trees bear fruits to serve  
others.   
PAROPAKARAYA VAHANTI NADYAH - The rivers flow to serve others   
PAROPAKARAYA DUHANTI GAVAH - Cows give milk to serve others.   
PAROPAKARTHAM IDAM SHAREERAM - This human body is meant to serve  
others.**   
We should never forget these in our life and even in our spiritual quests, we  
may tend to get lost in our search by forgetting our real purpose (above)   
Paropakaram is the beginning and the end of all knowledge and even Self  
Realisation.   
This body is not ours so it is only for Paropakaram

Thanks   
Going by the posts,   
Should I completely stop bothering about the books as Nagaraj quotes and go  
ahead with simply love to god.   
There arose a confusion in one of the posts, a post quoted Sankara stating  
Siva is one of the names of vishnu then the main thing what made the greats to  
divide gods, did it happen based on the rich and poor.   
But again if one comes across these great people it will certainly make them  
to know what they preached, why our Bhagavan Ramana himself has written many  
books, so if i come across Ashram book stall i will quite get one.   
My objective is to know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita in simple  
terms, please

To know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadvaita is to know your Self. So  
why not find out your Self first and then you will know what is Advaita,  
Dwaita or Visishtadvaita. Bhagawan Ramana says first find out who is it that  
wants to know what is Advaita, Dwaita or Visishtadvaita.   
Who is the enquirer?

**Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita, Advaita**   
In short,   
Dvaita --> Devotee feels God is separate and worships God as a master.   
Vishishtadvaita --> Devotee feels God is whole and he is part of God.   
Advaita --> Devotee merges in God completely and no separateness remains.   
Here is a puranic story which shows that all the three ways of connecting to  
God can exist in the same devotee: Once Ramachandra, God-incarnate, said to his great devotee Hanuman,   
 _My son, tell Me in what relation you regard Me, and how you meditate upon  
Me._   
Hanuman replied:  _O Rama, at times I worship Thee as Purna, the undivided one.   
Then I look upon myself as an Amsa, a part, a fragment as it were, of  
Divinity.   
At other times I meditate upon Thee, O Rama, as my Divine Master and think of  
myself only as Thy servant.   
When however, I am blessed, O Rama, with Tattva Jnana, or true Knowledge, I  
realise that I am Thou and Thou art I._   
Om Shanti. .

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
There is no need for confusion. Bhagavan Ramana has used one   
simile. There are toffees. Some are green, some are yellow, some   
are red. Each child likes one particular colour and shape even though  
sweetness is same in all. And that is the simile which you should keep in  
mind, while praying to your god, your ishta devata. All are one. The only  
other thing is: You should not dislike or hate the other toffees, because  
some other child likes it! Do not hate other gods.   
You pray to your chosen deity and then do meditation and self enquiry. All  
gods merge in the Self within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
The English prose rendering of Periya Puranam published by Sri   
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, is by one Rangachari. The original   
sources are Tiru Thondar Thohai by Sundaramoorthy, which lists all the 60 (the  
remaining three being Sundarmoorthy himself and his   
mother and father). This is part of his own composition which comes   
under Book VII of Saiva Canons. A slightly more elaborate Tamil composition  
is Tiruthondar Tiruvandati, by Nambi Andar Nambi, which comes in Book XI of  
Saiva Canons. A good prose version in Tamil is by   
Kripananda Variayar titled Sivan Arut Selvar. I go by original   
Tamil verses of Periya Puranam, by Sekkizhar, which is Book XII of   
Saiva Canons. This is a composition of about 4500 delightful verses.   
The English version of Rangachari and Tamil version of Kripananda   
Variyar would serve the purpose. The Tamil book is published by   
Vanadhi Padippagam, T Nagar, Chennai 600 017.   
Arunachala Siva.
