## Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 12 And 13  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 11, 2010, 08:23:46 AM  
---  
**Verse 12**   
Bhima roop dhari asur sanghare   
Ramachandra ke kaj sanvare   
**Verse 12 Meaning**   
With over-whelming might you destroyed the Asuras (demons) and performed all  
tasks assigned to you by Shri Ram with great skill.   
 **Verse 13**   
Laye Sanjivan Lakhan Jiyaye   
Shri Raghuvir Harashi ur laye   
**Verse 13 Meaning**   
 **You brought Sanjivan (A herb that revives life) and restored Lakshman back  
to life, Shri Raghuvir (Shri Ram) cheerfully embraced you with his heart full  
of joy.**   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 12 tulasidas tells that lord hanuman performs with great skill/zest  
all tasks assigned by Lord Shri Rama.   
God-Guru's grace is much required if we are to progress in this spiritual life  
and to eradicate ignorance in us.   
As known with ramakrishna paramahamsa's grace narendra has become swami  
vivekananda and has revived hinduism and can easily say that he is one of the  
most influential hindu saints in 20th century.   
When he asked his master ramakrishna whether he as seen god,master said in  
return "Is there anyone who has not seen god?" which impressed vivekananda and  
be became a great disciple of bhagavan ramakrishna.   
As guru ramana says,   
As a lion seen in a dream by an elephant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a  
sage, awakens the disciple from the dream of ignorance.The cause of all  
miseries is the impure vasana, the belief that holds the body to be âIâ.   
The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you will only  
receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of the ocean;  
the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is entirely upto  
you.   
In Verse 13 tulasidas describes that Lord Hanuman has brought Sanjivan (A herb  
that revives life) and restored Lakshman back to life which made Lord Rama  
happy.   
Miracles do happen with guru's grace and we have seen many incidents in past  
regarding miracles.   
In Mahabharata war lord krishna saved arjuna and other pandavas manytimes with  
his miracles else pandavas would have lost the war.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Few Swami Vivekananda Selected Sayings and Utterances

SAYINGS AND UTTERANCES   
Volume 5, Sayings and Utterances   
1\. Man is born to conquer nature and not to follow it.   
2\. When you think you are a body, you are apart from the universe; when you  
think; you are a soul, you are a spark from the great Eternal Fire; when you  
think you are the Âtman (Self), you are All.   
4\. Strength is in goodness, in purity.   
6\. You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.   
 **15\. To believe that mind is all, that thought is all is only a higher  
materialism.**   
18\. As soon as you make a sect, you protest against universal brotherhood.  
Those who really feel universal brotherhood do not talk much, but their very  
actions speak aloud.   
28\. Have charity towards all beings. Pity those who are in distress. Love all  
creatures. Do not be jealous of anyone. Look not to the faults of others.   
 **31\. There is really but one Self in the universe, all else is but Its  
manifestations.**   
 **36\. Of all the scriptures of the world it is the Vedas alone that declare  
that even the study of the Vedas is secondary. The real study is "that by  
which we realise the Unchangeable". And that is neither reading, for  
believing, nor reasoning, but superconscious perception, or Samâdhi.**   
41\. Let me die a true Sannyâsin as my Master did, heedless of money, of  
women, and of fame! And of these the most insidious is the love of fame!   
 **43. "This is a great land," said Swamiji on one occasion in America, "but I  
would not like to live here. Americans think too much of money. They give it  
preference over anything else. Your people have much to learn. When your  
nation is as old as ours, you will be wiser."**   
59\. Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone.   
67\. Never loved a husband the wife for the wife's sake or the wife the  
husband for the husband's sake. It is God in the wife the husband loves, and  
God in the husband the wife loves. It is God in every one that draws us to the  
one we love, God in everything and in everybody that makes us love. God is the  
only love.   
69\. In everyone is God, the Atman; all else is but dream, an illusion.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramakrishna Paramhansa and Swami Vivekananda First Meeting  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:57:46 AM

**When Vivekananda came to Ramakrishna his name was still Narendranath --  
later on Ramakrishna named him Vivekananda. When he came to Ramakrishna he was  
extremely argumentative, an atheist, a rationalist. He wanted proof for  
everything.   
There are some things that have no proof -- it cannot be helped. There is no  
proof for godliness: it is, and yet there is no proof. There is no proof for  
love. It is, and yet there is no proof. There is no proof for beauty. It is,  
and yet there is no proof.   
If I say, "Look how beautiful these ironwood trees are," and you say, "I don't  
see any beauty -- Trees are just trees. Prove it!," it will be difficult. How  
can one prove they are beautiful? To be beautiful you need a sense of beauty  
-- there is no other way. You need eyes -- there is no other way. It is  
reported that Majnu said, "To know Laila you will need the eyes of Majnu." It  
is true; to see Laila there is no other way. The king of his area called Majnu  
and said. "You are mad! I know your Laila -- an ordinary girl, jet black --  
nothing special.  
I feel sorry for you, so here are twelve girls from my palace -- they are the  
most beautiful women of the country. You can chose any one you like. Seeing  
you cry, my heart also cries. " Majnu looked at them and said, "There is no  
Laila among them. They cannot even be compared to Laila, they are not even  
worth the dust of her feet." The king said, "Majnu, you are mad...!" Majnu  
said, "That may be so, but I must tell you one thing: to see Laila you will  
need the eyes of Majnu." Majnu is right. To see the beauty of trees you need  
an eye for art -- there is no other proof.   
If one wants to know love, one will need the heart of a lover -- there is no  
other proof. And godliness is the collective name of all the beauty, all the  
love and all the truth of this universe. For it an unwavering consciousness is  
needed, a witnessing is needed... where no word remains, no thought remains,  
no wave arises... where no mental dust remains and the mirror of consciousness  
is perfectly pure. What proof? **Vivekananda told Ramakrishna, "I want proof.  
If God exists then prove it!"  
Ramakrishna looked at Vivekananda. This youth had great promise, great  
potential; much was ready to happen within him. There was a great treasure  
with which Vivekananda was unacquainted. Ramakrishna looked into, peered into,  
the past lives of this youth. Vivekananda had come carrying a great treasure,  
a great treasure of integrity, but it was suppressed under his logic.   
Seeing this, a cry of anguish and compassion must have risen from  
Ramakrishna's heart. He said, "Forget all this. We'll talk about proof and  
such things later on. I have become a little old, I have difficulty reading;  
you are young, you eyes are still strong -- read from the book lying there."   
**It was the Ashtavakra Gita. "Read a little out loud to me." It is said that  
Vivekananda saw nothing wrong in this, this fellow was not requesting anything  
special. He read three or four sutras and every cell began trembling. He  
started to panic and he said, "I cannot read on." Ramakrishna insisted, " Go  
ahead and read. What harm can there be in it? How can this book hurt you? You  
are young, your eyes are still fresh, and I am old, it is hard for me to read.  
I must hear this book -- read it out to me."   
It is said that Vivekananda kept on reading aloud from the book -- and  
disappeared in meditation.** Ramakrishna had seen great potential in this  
youth, a very promising potential, like that of a bodhisattva who one day or  
other is destined to become a buddha. Sooner or later, no matter how much he  
wanders, he is approaching buddhahood. When Vivekananda came to Ramakrishna  
his name was still Narendranath -- later on Ramakrishna named him Vivekananda.  
When he came to Ramakrishna he was extremely argumentative, an atheist, a  
rationalist.   
**Swami Vivekananda Searching Job**   
There is a small memoir in the life of Vivekananda. **When Vivekanandas  
father died, there was so much poverty in his home that often there was not  
enough food for both mother and son. So, Vivekananda would tell his mother,  
Today I am invited to a friends house, I will go there. In fact there was  
no invitation, no nothing, he would just roam around on the roads and later  
return home. Otherwise the food was so little that his mother would feed him  
and would remain hungry herself.   
So, he would return home with an empty stomach but happy and laughing saying  
loudly, It was a wonderful meal! Such delicious food dishes were cooked! He  
would enter the house talking of those food stuffs that were nowhere cooked  
for him, that he had not eaten anywhere.   
When Ramakrishna came to know of this, he said, How mad you are! Why dont  
you ask God and all will be taken care of. Vivekananda said that it will be  
too ordinary a thing to talk about eating and drinking with God. Still  
Ramakrishna asked him to ask at least once and see. He sent Vivekananda inside  
the temple. One hour passed, one and a half hours passed, Vivekananda came out  
from the temple and was very blissful and estatic. He came out dancing.  
Ramakrishna asked, Did you get it? Did you ask for it? Vivekananda said,  
Get what? Ramakrishna said, I had told you to put forward your demand. What  
makes you return so blissful?  
Vivekananda said, I forgot that completely  This happened several times.  
Ramakrishna would send him in and when Vivekananda came out of the temple, he  
would inquire about it. Then Vivekananda would remember what he had been sent  
in for. Ramakrishna said, Are you mad or something? Because while going  
inside, you promised me that you will ask.   
**Vivekananda would say, When I go in, there remains not even a faint memory  
that I have to ask God for something. On the contrary, a feeling of giving  
arises in me, that I should give myself to Him. And when I give myself, there  
is such bliss, so much of it that there is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor the  
need to ask**   
Vivekananda could not ask. It was not possible for him. Until now no truly  
religious person has asked for anything from God. And those who have asked, it  
ought to be understood well that they have nothing to do with religion. The  
religious man has only given.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Secret of Eternal Youth By Param Pujya Sant Shri Asaramji Bapu  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 05:09:22 AM  
---  
First of all, let us understand the meaning of Brahmacharya.   
'Yajnavalkya Samhita' states: "Brahmacharya is abstaining from all kinds of Maithuna or sexual enjoyment  
forever, in all places and in all conditions- physically, mentally and  
verbally."   
The great sage Vyasa said: 'To abandon the pleasure gained through the sexual organs by restraint is  
defined as celibacy."   
Lord Siva said to Goddess Parvati,   
"O Parvati! What is there on this earth which cannot be accomplished if one  
has control over his sexual fluid?" That is, all powers reside at the divine  
feet of the Enlightened Urdhvareta (one who is able to sublimate his sexual  
energy through the practice of yoga). In fact, Siddhis (divine powers) become  
his facile servants. Such a Sadhaka can attain Self-Realisation within a short  
span of time. Even the gods (deities) have attained immortality through  
Brahmacharya".   
"The gods have conquered death by Brahmacharya and penance. Indra, the King of  
gods, has attained a still higher status, through the self-discipline of  
Brahmacharya." (Atharva veda: 1. 5. 19)   
 **Preservation of semen gives life**   
Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as the  
buttermilk is thinned after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned  
by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen, the more the body deteriorates  
and weakens. **The preservation of semen is the secret of good health and  
longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and  
spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of Brahmacharya will tide over  
a crisis of any disease very easily.** One who follows Brahmacharya strictly  
is usually not afflicted by any disease. That is why, in scriptures, it is  
said: "Death is hastened by letting out semen from the body. Life is saved and  
prolonged by preserving it. Semen is the real vitality in men. It is the  
hidden treasure in man."   
"There is no doubt that people die prematurely by letting the semen out of the  
body; knowing this, the Yogi should always preserve semen and lead a life of  
strict celibacy." \- Siva Samhita   
 **How is semen formed?   
According to Ayurveda, from the digested food chyle is formed. Out of chyle  
comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat  
comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. Conversion of  
Dhatu at every step takes a period of five days. Thus semen is the last Dhatu  
that is formed out of food. It takes approximately 30 days and 4 hours to  
complete this cycle. Scientists believe that an intake of 32 kgs. Of food  
produces 800 Gms. of blood, which in turn forms only 20 Gms. of semen. Now,  
you can see how precious the semen is!**   
If a man leads a life of celibacy even in householder's life and has  
copulation for the sake of progeny only, he can bring forth healthy,  
intelligent, strong, beautiful and self-sacrificing children. Higher forms of  
animals do have the sex impulse, but it becomes active only during the mating  
season; and thus they maintain health. Man, with his boasted intellect, has to  
learn lessons from birds and animals. Even animals have more self-control than  
men. It is only the so-called man who has degraded himself much by indulgence.  
At the heat of sexual excitement, he repeats the same ignoble act again and  
again. Man only violates the laws of nature and consequently suffers from  
innumerable diseases. He has degenerated to a level far lower than that of  
animals in this respect.   
Lack of self-control gives rise to diseases. **The western world has suffered  
moral and ethical degradation by following the Freudian psychology. It is  
clearly observed in statistical data. Population of India is three times that  
of U.S.A. Yet, consumption of drugs in U.S.A. is 10 times that in India. In  
New York City, a ten-year study, Mental Health in metropolis, claimed that  
approximately 80 per cent of adults showed some symptoms of Mental illness,  
with one in four actually impaired.**   
(Srole, Leo, Langer, Thomas, et al, Mental health in Metropolis, The midtown  
Manhatton Study.)   
Freudian psychoanalysts failed to give any solution to the problem of  
suppressing desires. So the people alarmed of getting mental disorders,  
continued to satisfy their desires even by illegal means. This in turn  
increased the incidence of crimes.   
On an average one case of rape is recorded per six seconds and about 2 million  
cases of pre-marietal pregnancy are recorded every year in U.S.A. Teenage  
pregnancy is a burning problem of U.S.A. Pre-marital sex is common in U.S.  
because they advocate free sex. As a result of that they compare the sexual  
gratification after marriage with the previous pre-marital experiences and  
when they find it less, they ask for divorce.   
About 65% of marriages result in divorce. As they have violated the nature's  
law of self-control, they suffer from sexually transmitted diseases. The most  
horrible is AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), which is spreading  
like an epidemic. The family life is disturbed by internal conflicts,  
dissatisfaction and rage. The social life is full of chaos, terror, insecurity  
and arrogance. This is not caused by poverty or lack of materials.   
**The U.S. has 4 % of the world 's population. They have made provisions for  
40 % of the global material productions (like cars, TVs etc.). Yet the  
criminal tendency is so high that one case of burglary is recorded per ten  
seconds. There are 425 prisoners per one lakh population whereas there are  
only 23 prisoners per one lakh population in Indian jails. In U.S.A. 14  
million cases of crime were recorded by the police department during the year  
1992. This is because the people under the influence of Freudian psychology  
try to satisfy all desires (not only sexual). The social life is degraded.  
Unchecked criminal tendencies lead to chaos, terror and insecurity.**   
 _In the present-day world, unfortunately, many people read pornographic  
literature, view sexy films on television and in theatres, view blue films in  
privacy, as a result we see all around us, the number of physical, mental and  
moral wrecks increasing every day._ Many a times such people indulge in  
unnatural sex. Masturbation or homosexual tendency lead them to wastage of  
seminal energy many times a weak. They may discharge seminal energy in bad  
dreams or wet dreams. Due to excessive loss of semen, enlargement of testes  
and sometimes pain in the testes develops. The evil after-effects that follow  
the loss of seminal energy are dangerous. Persons are physically, mentally and  
morally debilitated.   
The body and the mind refuse to work energetically, because the semen is not  
used up in the body to form Ojas that give vibrant health, strong will power  
and sound mind. Later on, such people develop impotency for the testices  
cannot produce semen with normal sperm count. Life for him loses all zest,  
zeal and charm. He becomes a victim of a number of diseases like anaemia, loss  
of memory, gloominess, palpitation of heart, pain in the back, loins, head and  
joints, weak kidneys, fickle mindedness, enlargement of testes, pain in the  
testes, debility, nervous breakdown, restlessness of mind, lack of thinking  
power, etc. He goes through hellish suffering. The scripture declares  
emphatically,   
'Atharva Veda' declares: "I have abandoned the lust that wastes my seminal energy. I throw away those  
sexual desires forever as they destroy my strength, intelligence and health. I  
will never become a victim of sexual desires' "   
But what happens to one who does not lead the life of celibacy. 'Atharva Veda'  
says,   
"The lust is the cause of diseases, dire diseases. It is the cause of death,  
fatal death. It makes one walk with tottering steps. It causes mental debility  
and retardation. It destroys health, vitality and physical well being. It  
burns all the Dhaatus (viz.chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen).  
It pollutes the purity of mind."   
Alcoholic drinks (liquor), tobacco (chewing), cigarettes stimulate passion.   
In Quran Sherifs Allaah Pak Trikol Roshal's Sipard, it is written:"O  
believers, this wine and gambling, and these arrows you use for divination,  
are all acts of Satan, so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.   
 **Ramakrishna Param Hamsa said, "Whenever you see a beautiful woman, and if  
evil thoughts crop up in your mind, visualise the 'World Mother' (Jagadamba)  
in her. She is a manifestation of 'World Mother'. That is why she is so  
beautiful. She is Divine mother blessing me with her Darshana. Entertain this  
Bhava (attitude), evil thoughts will die.**   
When Governor of Kalyana, Bahlol Khan was defeated by Major General of  
Shivaji's army, the latter presented a beautiful Begum to Shivaji. Strict  
celibate Shivaji looked at her with reverence, and said, "If I have to become  
beautiful, I will take birth through your womb, mother." Saying this he  
scolded his Major and ordered him to send her with full honour to her husband.  
**Shivaji was a strict celibate because he was a disciple of a mighty saint  
Samartha Ramadasa.**   
For protecting the semen, it is essential to wear always a strip of cloth  
(Langoti or Kaupin or loin cloth) over the private part, for there will be no  
night emission and growth of inflammation or any other disease of the  
testicles. This will help you in keeping up Brahmacharya.   
Immoral songs produce a bad, deep impression in the mind. **Aspirants should  
run away from places where vicious songs, poems, vulgar film songs, pop music  
or disco songs are sung or played on radio, transistor or cassette player.**   
Our great martyrs Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Vir Savarkar were  
inspired by patriotic literature to dedicate and sacrifice their lives for the  
liberation of India. Therefore, the glory of good literature is beyond words.  
There are so many great inspiring spiritual books reflecting the glory of  
Indian civilization viz, 'Yoga-Vagistha Maha Ramayan', 'Shrimad Bhdgavadgita',  
'Upanishads', 'Daas Bodh', 'Vivek Chudamani', 'Sukhmani', publications of Shri  
Ramakrishna mission, books by Swami Ramatirtha, etc etc.   
Make study of such literatures an indispensable part of your daily routine.  
Books that deal with love stories exciting passion and pornographic  
literatures should be either thrown into dustbin or reduced to ashes. You  
should strictly avoid these and give them not to others for reading. Reading  
of spiritual literature is of immense value in observing Brahmacharya.   
**Always read a spiritual book in the morning after taking bath (and before  
going to job) and at night just before retiring to bed. The pure, sublime-  
elevating thoughts of the book will displace the evil (passionate) thoughts of  
your mind and you will not become a victim of sexual thoughts and fantasies.**   
"Semen is brightness, strength and (Self) Atma." -(Satapath brahman).   
 **Grandsire Bhishma and the great Abhimanyu**   
There were two great battles, which took place during the war of Mahabharat.  
One is of grandsire Bhisma and the other of Abhimanyu.   
**Bhisma was a Naisthika Brahmachari, i.e. life long celibate. Therefore he  
was a man of boundless power.** Lord Krishna had taken a vow that during the  
war he would not wield any weapon. However, he was compelled to break his vow  
in the face of the allconquering and irresistible attack that Bhisma mounted  
on the army of Pandavas. Even Arjuna armed with celestial weapons could not  
combat Bhisma's onslaught and Lord Krishna was forced to take up a wheel of a  
chariot to protect Arjuna from the arrows showered by Bhisma. It was through  
the power of Brahmacharya (alone), that Bhisma could conquer death. When he  
was pierced by sharp arrows all over the body, his survival was impossible.  
Yet (god of) death could not snatch his life. **Lying on the bed of arrows, he  
gave wonderful discourses on political, philosophical, religious, social and  
moral subjects to Yudhisthira. Bhisma waited for the beginning of auspicious  
Uttarayana. Then he willingly left his body.   
The second battle was that of a charming and brilliant hero Abhimanyu.  
Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu fought single handed against the terrific strategy of  
Kauravas called Chakravyuha.** Bhima, the chief of Pandava army, was left  
behind. Abhimanyu fought with commendable valour wielding a wheel of a chariot  
all alone amidst great warriors of Kauravas. But in the end he was killed  
because Abhimanyu sowed the seed of Pandava dynasty before proceeding to his  
last battle. He had passed the night before the great battle in the amorous  
company of his wife Uttara. **Due to this act of infringement of Brahmacharya,  
he could not conquer death, unlike grandsire Bhisma.**   
 **An experiment done in U.S.A.**   
A scientific experiment was carried out in an American school of science. 30  
students were given no food for a fixed period of time. It was observed that  
their libido subsided. But when they were given food, libido increased. This  
shows that fasting gives only a temporary benefit in observation of celibacy.   
 **Techniques for Conservation of Seminal Energy**   
Tulsi (Basil) cures many diseases. Moreover, it helps in conservation of  
seminal energy. It improves power of memory. Leaf of Tulsi is an excellent  
herbal medicine. It restores imbalance of wind, bile and phelgm and thereby  
helps in cure of many ailments caused due to their imbalance. It is very  
useful in cases of blood disorders, cough, worm- infestation etc. It is good  
for cardiac disorders also."   
Herbal aid to celibacy: One can make this Ayurvedic Churna, without much cost  
at home. Take dried **Amalas** (goose berries) the fruits of a tree Emblica  
Officinalis and grind them into powder. Ready-made Amala powder is available  
in the market also. Mix two parts of the Amala powder with one part of  
powdered rock-sugar. You may get this ready-made mixture from ashram also.   
Mere thinking of a woman with sexual feelings causes a Sadhaka's downfall.  
Therefore, beware! Try to know the heart of the scriptures and saints and take  
its benefits by following it.   
"These sexual propensities, though they are at first like ripple, acquire the  
proportions of a sea on account of a bad company. **Whenever the mental image  
of a woman crops up in your mind with evil thoughts, repeat mentally "Om  
Durgaa Devyai Namah " and do mental prostrations." \- Swami Vivananda**   
"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live  
coals. From the contact comes sensation, from sensation thirst, from thirst  
clinging, by ceasing from that, the soul is delivered from all sinful  
existence." \- **Lord Buddha**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Srila Prabhupada on Profit and Loss  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 09, 2010, 09:44:36 AM  
---  
In the evening, Srila Prabhupada lectured again on Bhagavad-gita. He chose  
Text 13 of Chapter Two: dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara. As he  
started to explain the meaning, a child began to cry. Prabhupada chuckled.  
Generally, he became annoyed when interrupted in class. When the devotees saw  
their spiritual master take the disturbance in stride, they were relieved and  
also laughed. Prabhupada used the child's crying to make a point: "So on one  
side, profit; on one side, loss. On one side, you get a child; and on the  
other side, you cannot hear. This is the material world. **As soon as you get  
some profit here, on another side, there is loss. As soon as you want to  
construct a big skyscraper, on another side-digging earth. "**   
Srila Prabhupada derided the foolishness of modern man, who engages in  
"digging and piling," never questioning the usefulness of his endeavor. He  
never considers that he will soon have to leave his body against his will, and  
he shows no interest in the message of Bhagavad-gita that you are not this  
body, but the proprietor within.   
Prabhupada next explained that the word "occupier" is more appropriate than  
the term "proprietor": " **If you rent a house, the proprietor is a different  
man. The tenant is the occupier; no proprietorship. So I am the spirit soul. I  
am not the proprietor. I am simply an occupier. The rascal materialists do not  
know that the proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He is  
giving me a particular apartment according to my capacity for paying rent. "**   
" **This is my position; otherwise, why doesn 't everyone get a first-class  
body, a king's body or rich man's body? One child is born-immediately he is a  
rich man. So there is no arrangement? And another child born at the same  
moment is a very poor man. Why?** Because if I am able to pay more rent, I  
transfer to another, very luxurious apartment. Or if I cannot pay the present  
rent, then I have to move to another, less expensive apartment."   
 _Then Srila Prabhupada described how the environment affects our  
consciousness: "A poor man living in a poor cottage or very unclean apartment-  
his mentality is one way. Another respectable gentleman living in a very nice  
house, his mentality is different. So according to the circumstances, the  
mental changes are there, but both men are human beings. Similarly, there are  
so many apartments, or different types of bodies-8,400,000 types of bodies.  
The occupier, the living being or the soul, is of the same quality, but  
according to the apartment or body he has occupied, he has developed a certain  
consciousness and mentality."_   
Prabhupada reminded his young audience that their birth in a developed country  
such as Germany was testimony of past pious activities and offered them a  
great opportunity for self-realization: "If you have done nicely to occupy a  
first-class apartment, then nature will give you a nice body. Therefore I say  
repeatedly that you Western boys and girls-you are given a very good chance by  
nature. Once upon a time, the European people were dominating all over the  
world, because they are very intelligent. They have got good resources, good,  
nice body, beautiful body. Everything is very good. But don't spoil it; use it  
for understanding further good."   
 **He said that misidentification with one 's land of birth should not let us  
forget that God is the creator and therefore the actual proprietor of  
everything: "Why I am falsely identifying myself with the land? 'I am German  
because I am born in this land of Germany.' That is also false. No land is  
Germany or France or England. Land is land. You have falsely named it: 'This  
is Germany.' What is this Germany? Say two or three hundred years ago, there  
was no Germany. The land was created by God. So it is God's property. Where is  
the difficulty to understand? You did not create anything, not even your own  
body. That proprietor is also Krsna. Because as soon as Krsna asks you,  
'Please vacate,' you must vacate immediately. Can you remain in this body? The  
proprietor asks you to vacate. So you have to vacate. Or the proprietor does  
not repair it. Then you voluntarily vacate: 'This is not useful anymore.'"**   
Returning to the Sanskrit verse, Prabhupada illustrated another meaning of it,  
namely, the imperceptible nature of the bodily changes and how the soul, as an  
observer, is always the same: "So it is to be understood that I existed in the  
past in a different body. As I existed, say seventy years before in a  
different body, I was jumping as a boy. Now I cannot jump; now I have to use  
the cane. This is a different body. If the same body still existed, then I  
could jump like a boy. I remember that I jumped. But now it is not possible. I  
have to take the help of three men." Prabhupada laughed, and the devotees  
joined in. He was in a jolly mood, pleased to see many young faces. He hoped  
that they would take Krsna consciousness seriously before their bodies  
dwindled with old age and the great opportunity to achieve perfection within  
this lifetime was lost.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Significance of Aarati - The Ritual Lamp  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 13, 2010, 08:06:31 AM  
---  
It has a deep philosophical and ritualistic significance.   
**The flame in the Aarti represents the soul of the devotee, which is offered  
to the deity.** To forget the self in the sacred invocation of heavenly  
power,to be one with it, is the quintessence of Aarati as of bhakti. ..Waving  
of the light before the deity is a ritual known as Aarati,which is done  
towards the close of the worship sequences. Either camphor (karpura) or a set  
of three, five or seven wicks dipped in ghee or oil is used.   
The light containers may be in the form of a serpent (Naga deepa), chariot  
(Ragha deepa), elephant (Gaja deepa),Nandi (Bull deepa), and so on. The first  
round of waving must be from the head of the deity to th feet, the second from  
the face to the knees, and the third from the neck to the loins.   
**(Condensed from Tattavaloka, Dec. 2008) - - (Taken from Sri Ramana Jyoti,  
February 2009)**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Secret of Eternal Youth By Param Pujya Sant Shri Asaramji Bapu  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 05:09:22 AM  
---  
First of all, let us understand the meaning of Brahmacharya.   
'Yajnavalkya Samhita' states: "Brahmacharya is abstaining from all kinds of Maithuna or sexual enjoyment  
forever, in all places and in all conditions- physically, mentally and  
verbally."   
The great sage Vyasa said: 'To abandon the pleasure gained through the sexual organs by restraint is  
defined as celibacy."   
Lord Siva said to Goddess Parvati,   
"O Parvati! What is there on this earth which cannot be accomplished if one  
has control over his sexual fluid?" That is, all powers reside at the divine  
feet of the Enlightened Urdhvareta (one who is able to sublimate his sexual  
energy through the practice of yoga). In fact, Siddhis (divine powers) become  
his facile servants. Such a Sadhaka can attain Self-Realisation within a short  
span of time. Even the gods (deities) have attained immortality through  
Brahmacharya".   
"The gods have conquered death by Brahmacharya and penance. Indra, the King of  
gods, has attained a still higher status, through the self-discipline of  
Brahmacharya." (Atharva veda: 1. 5. 19)   
 **Preservation of semen gives life**   
Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as the  
buttermilk is thinned after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned  
by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen, the more the body deteriorates  
and weakens. **The preservation of semen is the secret of good health and  
longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and  
spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of Brahmacharya will tide over  
a crisis of any disease very easily.** One who follows Brahmacharya strictly  
is usually not afflicted by any disease. That is why, in scriptures, it is  
said: "Death is hastened by letting out semen from the body. Life is saved and  
prolonged by preserving it. Semen is the real vitality in men. It is the  
hidden treasure in man."   
"There is no doubt that people die prematurely by letting the semen out of the  
body; knowing this, the Yogi should always preserve semen and lead a life of  
strict celibacy." \- Siva Samhita   
 **How is semen formed?   
According to Ayurveda, from the digested food chyle is formed. Out of chyle  
comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat  
comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. Conversion of  
Dhatu at every step takes a period of five days. Thus semen is the last Dhatu  
that is formed out of food. It takes approximately 30 days and 4 hours to  
complete this cycle. Scientists believe that an intake of 32 kgs. Of food  
produces 800 Gms. of blood, which in turn forms only 20 Gms. of semen. Now,  
you can see how precious the semen is!**   
If a man leads a life of celibacy even in householder's life and has  
copulation for the sake of progeny only, he can bring forth healthy,  
intelligent, strong, beautiful and self-sacrificing children. Higher forms of  
animals do have the sex impulse, but it becomes active only during the mating

burns all the Dhaatus (viz.chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen).  
It pollutes the purity of mind."   
Alcoholic drinks (liquor), tobacco (chewing), cigarettes stimulate passion.   
In Quran Sherifs Allaah Pak Trikol Roshal's Sipard, it is written:"O  
believers, this wine and gambling, and these arrows you use for divination,  
are all acts of Satan, so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.   
 **Ramakrishna Param Hamsa said, "Whenever you see a beautiful woman, and if  
evil thoughts crop up in your mind, visualise the 'World Mother' (Jagadamba)  
in her. She is a manifestation of 'World Mother'. That is why she is so  
beautiful. She is Divine mother blessing me with her Darshana. Entertain this  
Bhava (attitude), evil thoughts will die.**   
When Governor of Kalyana, Bahlol Khan was defeated by Major General of  
Shivaji's army, the latter presented a beautiful Begum to Shivaji. Strict  
celibate Shivaji looked at her with reverence, and said, "If I have to become  
beautiful, I will take birth through your womb, mother." Saying this he  
scolded his Major and ordered him to send her with full honour to her husband.  
**Shivaji was a strict celibate because he was a disciple of a mighty saint  
Samartha Ramadasa.**   
For protecting the semen, it is essential to wear always a strip of cloth  
(Langoti or Kaupin or loin cloth) over the private part, for there will be no  
night emission and growth of inflammation or any other disease of the  
testicles. This will help you in keeping up Brahmacharya.   
Immoral songs produce a bad, deep impression in the mind. **Aspirants should  
run away from places where vicious songs, poems, vulgar film songs, pop music  
or disco songs are sung or played on radio, transistor or cassette player.**   
Our great martyrs Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Vir Savarkar were  
inspired by patriotic literature to dedicate and sacrifice their lives for the  
liberation of India. Therefore, the glory of good literature is beyond words.  
There are so many great inspiring spiritual books reflecting the glory of  
Indian civilization viz, 'Yoga-Vagistha Maha Ramayan', 'Shrimad Bhdgavadgita',  
'Upanishads', 'Daas Bodh', 'Vivek Chudamani', 'Sukhmani', publications of Shri  
Ramakrishna mission, books by Swami Ramatirtha, etc etc.   
Make study of such literatures an indispensable part of your daily routine.  
Books that deal with love stories exciting passion and pornographic  
literatures should be either thrown into dustbin or reduced to ashes. You  
should strictly avoid these and give them not to others for reading. Reading  
of spiritual literature is of immense value in observing Brahmacharya.   
**Always read a spiritual book in the morning after taking bath (and before  
going to job) and at night just before retiring to bed. The pure, sublime-  
elevating thoughts of the book will displace the evil (passionate) thoughts of  
your mind and you will not become a victim of sexual thoughts and fantasies.**   
"Semen is brightness, strength and (Self) Atma." -(Satapath brahman).   
 **Grandsire Bhishma and the great Abhimanyu**   
There were two great battles, which took place during the war of Mahabharat.  
One is of grandsire Bhisma and the other of Abhimanyu.   
**Bhisma was a Naisthika Brahmachari, i.e. life long celibate. Therefore he  
was a man of boundless power.** Lord Krishna had taken a vow that during the  
war he would not wield any weapon. However, he was compelled to break his vow  
in the face of the allconquering and irresistible attack that Bhisma mounted  
on the army of Pandavas. Even Arjuna armed with celestial weapons could not  
combat Bhisma's onslaught and Lord Krishna was forced to take up a wheel of a  
chariot to protect Arjuna from the arrows showered by Bhisma. It was through  
the power of Brahmacharya (alone), that Bhisma could conquer death. When he  
was pierced by sharp arrows all over the body, his survival was impossible.  
Yet (god of) death could not snatch his life. **Lying on the bed of arrows, he  
gave wonderful discourses on political, philosophical, religious, social and  
moral subjects to Yudhisthira. Bhisma waited for the beginning of auspicious  
Uttarayana. Then he willingly left his body.   
The second battle was that of a charming and brilliant hero Abhimanyu.  
Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu fought single handed against the terrific strategy of  
Kauravas called Chakravyuha.** Bhima, the chief of Pandava army, was left  
behind. Abhimanyu fought with commendable valour wielding a wheel of a chariot  
all alone amidst great warriors of Kauravas. But in the end he was killed  
because Abhimanyu sowed the seed of Pandava dynasty before proceeding to his  
last battle. He had passed the night before the great battle in the amorous  
company of his wife Uttara. **Due to this act of infringement of Brahmacharya,  
he could not conquer death, unlike grandsire Bhisma.**   
 **An experiment done in U.S.A.**   
A scientific experiment was carried out in an American school of science. 30  
students were given no food for a fixed period of time. It was observed that  
their libido subsided. But when they were given food, libido increased. This  
shows that fasting gives only a temporary benefit in observation of celibacy.   
 **Techniques for Conservation of Seminal Energy**   
Tulsi (Basil) cures many diseases. Moreover, it helps in conservation of  
seminal energy. It improves power of memory. Leaf of Tulsi is an excellent  
herbal medicine. It restores imbalance of wind, bile and phelgm and thereby  
helps in cure of many ailments caused due to their imbalance. It is very  
useful in cases of blood disorders, cough, worm- infestation etc. It is good  
for cardiac disorders also."   
Herbal aid to celibacy: One can make this Ayurvedic Churna, without much cost  
at home. Take dried **Amalas** (goose berries) the fruits of a tree Emblica  
Officinalis and grind them into powder. Ready-made Amala powder is available  
in the market also. Mix two parts of the Amala powder with one part of  
powdered rock-sugar. You may get this ready-made mixture from ashram also.   
Mere thinking of a woman with sexual feelings causes a Sadhaka's downfall.  
Therefore, beware! Try to know the heart of the scriptures and saints and take  
its benefits by following it.   
"These sexual propensities, though they are at first like ripple, acquire the  
proportions of a sea on account of a bad company. **Whenever the mental image  
of a woman crops up in your mind with evil thoughts, repeat mentally "Om  
Durgaa Devyai Namah " and do mental prostrations." \- Swami Vivananda**   
"A wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning pit of live  
coals. From the contact comes sensation, from sensation thirst, from thirst  
clinging, by ceasing from that, the soul is delivered from all sinful  
existence." \- **Lord Buddha**

**THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY AND CHRISTIANITY   
Volume 6, Lectures and Discourses  
**The Vedas are, in fact, the oldest sacred books in the world. Nobody knows  
anything about the time when they were written or by whom. They are contained  
in many volumes, and I doubt that any one man ever read them all.**   
The religion of the Vedas is the religion of the Hindus, and the foundation of  
all Oriental religions; that is, all other Oriental religions are offshoots of  
the Vedas; all Eastern systems of religion have the Vedas as authority.   
It is an irrational claim to believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ and at  
the same time to hold that the greater part of his teachings have no  
application at the present time. If you say that the reason why the powers do  
not follow them that believe (as Christ said they would) is because you have  
not faith enough and are not pure enough  that will be all right. But to say  
that they have no application at the present time is to be ridiculous.   
I have never seen the man who was not at least my equal. I have travelled all  
over the world; I have been among the very worst kind of people  among  
cannibals  and I have never seen the man who is not at least my equal. I have  
done as they do  when I was a fool. Then I did not know any better; now I do.  
Now they do not know any better; after a while they will. E **very one acts  
according to his own nature. We are all in process of growth. From this  
standpoint one man is not better than another.**

In Churches, when the priest addresses the listeners: "O sinners!",   
the faithful Christians who have come for the Sunday mass listen   
to the call meekly. Suppose after the Church mass is over   
and when one Robert comes out to the street and if I call, "O Robert!   
the Sinner!", he will immediately look at me sternly and quickly remove his  
shoes to beat me. This is because Robert believe that he is not a sinner and  
just because the priest said so, he had kept quiet.   
But Hinduism says everyone "You are the Being in happiness. Happiness is your  
birth right. You are the Atma. Your miseries   
will not touch your Atma. You are not born, nor are you going to die! You  
are eternal!"   
But the Western religions think otherwise. Wolter A. Keers says humorously: "....but if you live in London or Melbourne or Ottawa or Amsterdam, and you go  
to the baker early in the morning and you tell him, "Of course, I was never  
born!" and you repeat it to the green grocer and to a policeman and to a  
doctor, I'd like to see how long you still roam about free in the streets of  
such cities [without being locked up inside a police station or a lunatic  
asylum]...."   
We are happiness in our true nature. It is our ego which shrouds our  
happiness and give us miseries.   
Arunachala Siva.
