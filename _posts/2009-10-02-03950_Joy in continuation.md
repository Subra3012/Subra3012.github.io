**Joy in continuation**   
The world moves on, for there is joy in continuation.   
Do you think technology will finally satisfy all human needs and bring life to  
a comfort of standstill existence?   
Possibly not, for the Universal Consciousness expresses its Joy in the waves  
of the continuation of life.   
Do you think a saviour will come who will bring the world to a standstill  
perfection?   
Possibly not, for the Universal Consciousness expresses its Joy in the waves  
of the continuation of life.   
A group of scientists meet to discuss the possibility of a great invention.   
The conference continues, who can say when the invention will be feasible, if  
at all.   
If it is feasible after 3 years, life continues to express the possibility of  
the invention.   
If it materializes tomorrow itself, life continues to search for the next  
invention.   
...for the Universal Consciousness expresses its Joy in the waves of the  
continuation of life.   
Sri Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: You have the right to action only and not to fruits thereof. Neither be  
inactive.   
So when one is working not for the fruits of action, and neither is one  
inactive, then what is the work for?   
Because, the Universal Consciousness expresses its Joy in the waves of the  
continuation of life.   
The waves must roll, for there cannot be inactivity and the waves must roll  
towards an apparent destination.   
A student fails in the exam and feels himself being dragged down and his  
classmates rising up.   
Now, where have the classmates risen?   
And where have the student dragged down?   
The classmates have risen "to continue".   
And the student has been dragged down "to continue".   
So life lives for living itself, with purpose and without purpose.   
The Divine Consciousness seems to be purposelessly purposeful.   
For, the Universal Consciousness expresses its Joy in the waves of the  
continuation of life.   
And there is joy in continuation.

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes. The world continues. The lives in the world continue.   
New discoveries and new inventions continue. In this joy   
of continuation, a man is restored to Peace, when he continues   
his pursuit for inward joy and succeed. Godhead is the Ultimate   
Joy and Peace and Bliss. But some scientists, as you may be   
aware, are trying to search the God Particle, Higgs Particle, the   
Boson, in a large lab near Swiss-French border. They do not   
know that God is within and not outside. The funny thing is,   
these scientists have kept a large icon of Nataraja, the Hindu   
God of Cosmic Dance, at the main-gate and they offer prayers   
and fllowers every morning by keeping silent for about 2 minutes,   
to ensure success of their project!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, amiatall,   
Thank you for the interesting information.   
I have read snippets of biographies of some scientists and found that many  
scientists are there who believe in spirituality. They are well aware of the  
limitations of science. However science has a methodology of correlating  
experimentally verified facts with earlier known facts and have their own set  
of terminologies and concepts. So every scientist need to stick to this  
framework for searching/publishing results. So let us see how near external  
science comes to spirituality.   
It is true that Quantum mechanics is showing some remarkable departure in this  
field. Scientific logic which previously was tuned to Newtonion mechanics is  
being defied by certain quantum phenomenon. However those phenomenon cannot be  
denied either because they have been substantiated by experiments.   
Things are becoming quite interesting.

Dear silengreen and amiatall,   
Quite interesting responses! Two small information on this   
further: 1. The Einstein's Theory of Relativity (Special Theory) states: A particle can remain either as a particle (corpuscles) or a wave (energy  
form) at the same point of time! Two observers can   
see it at the same time, differently. One can see it as Matter,   
Siva and the other as Energy, Sakti. Both are correct! Only   
observers' perceptions vary.   
2\. Einstein who was a Jew and was an agnostic, later (after   
1927), held a big board hanging in his study in Syracuse University,   
where he was a professor-emeritus and this had a legend: "I now believe in a God, who is very subtle!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Another interesting scientific principle is Heisenbergs uncertainty principle  
which relates to subatomic particles such as electron. It states:  _The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the  
momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa._   
\--Heisenberg, uncertainty paper, 1927   
Therefore our knowledge of nature is always limited. When we seem to get hold  
of one aspect of nature, the other aspect seems to slip out. The process of  
observation itself seem to introduce a parameter.   
Albert Einstien insisted that quantum mechanics must be based on a wholly  
deterministic theory which may be uncovered in future. He famous saying is   
_God does not play dice_ . Einstien countered the uncertainty principle with  
certain thought experiments. Niels Bohr countered Einstien with his own  
thought experiments and said thus: " _It is not the job of scientists, to  
prescribe to God how He should run the world_."

Dear silengreen,   
Very nice. It is the onlooker who makes the difference. In   
fact, Einstein went on to make his Unified Field Theory, which will   
combine all the four states, four already known theories.   
1\. Gravitational Theory.   
2\. Theory of relativity of time and space.   
3\. Weak electron theory.   
4\. Strong electron theory.   
But he could not come to any conclusion till his demise.   
Later, Stephen Hawking, the Newtonian Professor of Mathematics,   
in Cambridge Univesity attempted for such a theory. But his   
health became too bad and he could not make much progress.   
It will be also interesting that Swami Siddeswarananda, who   
came to Tiruvannamalai, (he was in SRK Math, Paris, with a   
lot of scientific background) discussed this with Bhagavan Ramana.   
Bhagavan Ramana gave a patient hearing and said finally: These things can be solved only when the onlooker becomes   
unified with the Self and not otherwise. Some devotee immediately pointed  
out: "Yes, it is the onlooker who should   
change. How can the same milk when mixed with butter milk   
or yeast becomes good curd, when one housewife does it and   
the other housewife does not succeed? How one housewife   
prepares good sambhar with the same ingredients and the   
other housewife does not succeed?"   
The housewife, the onlooker or the doer makes all the differences   
and not the nature per se! Of course, God's grace is essential.   
Nochur Venkataraman said one story. Once one gentleman   
who was in his 50s had some chestpain and went to the doctor. The doctor  
observed after some scan and x-rays: "There is a   
hole in the arterial valve in the heart. I can replace it with bypass  
surgery."   
The not-well-to-do patient asked: If I spend money how many years shall I  
live? The doctor said: "Seven years is the guarantee!"   
The patient went home praying to God. He prayed everyday   
for an easy death and not to be bedridden. The story goes   
that he lived for another 25 years. The doctor who himself   
had a heart problem and went through a good bypass surgery,   
died within 2 years thereafter!   
Arunachala Siva.
