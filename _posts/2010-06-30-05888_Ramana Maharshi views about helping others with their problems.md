Q: But how can I help another with his problem, his troubles?   
A: What is this talk of another - there is only the one. Try to realize that  
there is no I, no you, no he, only the one Self which is all. If you believe  
in the problem of another, you are believing in something outside the Self.  
**You will best help him by realising the oneness of everything rather than by  
outward activity.**

Dear prasanth,   
Very true. This country is not able to still solve the problems of   
poverty because the rulers have not realized the God within.   
If they had first solved their own poverty of self knowledge, they   
would have by this time removed the poverty of food in the nation.   
The so called elite society cannot solve the problems of food in   
poor people, because they have still not understood the God within   
and seen God in everybody.   
All social reformations and poverty alleviation programmes have   
not been successful because the rulers who designed such programmes have not  
realized that God is within and God is   
everywhere. They are afraid to punish the guilty because they   
are themselves guilty of all wrongs. Recently Mani Shankar   
Iyer (the former member of Parliament) has spoken in the Institute of Social  
Science that the elite has not understood the poverty in their own lives and  
how can they remove the poverty in others? I think, it is Plato who has said  
that a Jnani should be made the King of a nation.   
Arunachala Siva.
