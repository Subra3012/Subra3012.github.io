## Karthikeya's sorrow

While the deities hailed the glory of Kartikeya for having killed Tarakasur,  
Kartikeya himself was   
saddened by his act. He told the deities--'I regret for having killed  
Tarakasur because he was a great   
devotee of Lord Shiva. Is there any way to atone for my sin?'   
Lord Vishnu consoled him - 'Killing a wicked person, who nourishes himself on  
the blood of innocent people, is   
not a sinful deed. But, still, if you feel guilty then there is no better way  
to atone for your sin than worshipping Lord   
Shiva. Install Shivalingas and worship them with deep devotion.'Kartikeya  
instructed Vishnukarma to make three   
divine Shivalingas. Later on Kartikeya installed these Shivalingas at three  
different places and worshipped them   
with appropriate rituals. In course of time these three holy places came to be  
known as Pratigyeshwar,   
Kapaleshwar and Kumareshwar. Kartikeya, while worshipping at Kapaleshwar  
sprinkled holy water on the   
Shivalinga and prayed so that Tarakasur's soul rested in peace. He also  
offered sesame seeds to lord   
Kapaleshwar and prayed -   
'May my offerings made in the form of sesame seeds reach Tarak--the descendant  
of Sage Kashyap.'   
This way, Kartikeya was absolved of his sins.

Dear Munagala,   
The puranas even have answer for your question. in all the previous Yugas, the  
Bad was separate from us. The bad manifested themselves as Asuras and used to  
attack the good and torture the simple Saatvic people. God manifested then to  
kill these asuras. But today, the Suras and Asuras are within ourselves. they  
are not separate from us. Those days the Saatvic people were so strong in  
their faith that the Asuras could not enter them or shake them of their faith.  
Today we are all so shallow in our faith and it becomes an easy welcome for  
Asuras to enter our heart and start ruling us.   
In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad there is a story of Da Da Da. Dama Dana Daya.   
Indra from Devaloka, Humans from Bhuloka and Asuras came to Brahma as asked  
him thus   
Indra - Allthough I have all the luxuries and every wealth, still I feel  
incomplete, Please enlighten me   
Humans - I am raising good crops and have good wife, family and sons and  
relatives and so many relationships, still I feel incompete, Please enlighten  
me   
Asuras - All though I have so many kingdoms and power in my hand, undefeated,  
still I feel incomplete, please enlighten me   
to which Brahma replied to them Da Da Da for each of them   
They prostrated to Brahma and bid farewell to him and went back to their  
respective worlds.   
After a long contemplation,   
Indra understood that Da means Dama - Restrain from pleasures, desires, then  
contentement is arrived at.   
Human understood that Da means Dana - Share amongst others their crops and  
happiness, thats their way to contentment.   
Asuras understood that Da menas Daya - To show compassion towards others and  
restrain from hurting others. thats their way to contentment   
Today, Indra is within us as our Indriyas, Asuras is within us as our Ego and  
we ourselves are here by the reason of our Karmas - Vasanas.   
Indra has forgotten Dama   
Asura has forgotten Daya   
We have forgotten Dana   
They are all within us. we need to follow the Da Da Da instruction and keep in  
check Indra, Asura and ourselves.   
Bhagawan has taken Avatar today as Sri Ramana Maharshi to dispel or destroy  
the Asuras and Indras and Humans (Ego)

Dear mungala,   
Yes. In today's world, the man is two in one, with daivic and asuraic  
qualities. We have got a range of both, in all of us. The LTTE leader  
Prabhakaran feels that he is doing good to Tamils. But at the same time, he  
has killed thousands of people whom he considered were against his principles.  
He is a typical example of modern man.   
Dear Nagaraj,   
Muruga made the three brothers whom he killed, as peacock vehicle and rooster  
flag and he also had an elephant vehicle, to complete   
the score.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. There are no brahmins today. A brahmin should not keep stock   
of food overnight, he should beg and take everyday's food. He should   
not teach for payment but can only take the offering given by the disciple at  
the end of the course. None of us are doing these. Rama   
befriended and called Guha (the hunter, the 4th class) as his brother,   
took Sugriva (a monkey, animal being) as another brother and finally   
a rakshasa, Vibhishana as his brother. God is befriended by everyone who  
takes refuge under him. And that is the only way for all of us.   
Surrender to Guru/God and following His principles and teachings.   
Arunachala Siva.
