23. I transcend even a moment of time. I alone am auspiciousness. I alone am incorruptible joy.   
I alone am the constant.   
24\. I alone am the inscrutable Self. I am devoid of thought. I am the  
enlightened and the supreme   
abode. I am bereft of intellect.   
25. I alone am the truth always. I alone am happiness always. I alone am the ever attained. I am   
the easily found cause.   
26. I am the knowledge easily attainable, ever hard to attain for the wise. I am the Self that is just   
consciousness alone. I alone am the solid mass of consciousness.   
27\. I alone am you, indeed I am. Brahman alone am I, there is no doubt. I  
am the Self, there is no   
doubt. I alone am the all pervasive, there is no doubt.   
28. Truly I am the lovable Self, truly truly, again and again. I am the pervasive Self without senility.   
I alone am my own Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.
