We live with the ego,in ego,centered in the ego.We say "I","I" without knowing   
its import.We do not know the nature of "I" but we go on announcing "I am,I  
am".   
So this type of I amness is false because we do not know who this "I" is.   
So the one who says "I" is a false "I".Many think that Self-inquiry is to find  
out   
really "who am i".In Self-inquiry if we can cling to "I" thought constantly  
other   
thoughts are rejected.So the whole bundle of thoughts which is commonly   
called ego is rejected,negated just by clinging to "I" thought.So if we go on   
inquiring "who am i" like that we are bound to find that ego is ephemeral.   
So this inquiry leads to dissolution of false "I" i.e ego, in awareness.   
Once we are aware of the ego process a distance is created between our   
consciousness and the ego and we no longer give energy to it.   
Ego is not self sustaining entity unlike the Self,so if energy supply is  
stopped   
because we are aware of it,it subsides slowly and naturally and it lasts for   
quite sometime even after energy supply is cut to it till its past momentum   
comes to zero level.   
Many feel that they get some answer by doing "who am i' inquiry if they   
go on doing it sincerely.There is going to be no answer.It is only that the   
question and the questioner will dissolve.Then there will be no one to ask   
the question "who am i".When you existentially that false 'I' is not,the "real  
I" opens.   
When the ego is not,you are for the first time encountering your being.   
That being is a conscious void.So when you become aware of ego it dissolves.   
Try to find out whether there is any center in you that you can call your "I".   
Go deep down within yourself,go on trying to find out where is this "I',   
Where is the abode of this ego.So Self-inquiry is the process of negating   
the false 'I',it is not a technique in literal sense.   
When you are an ego,you are like a peak.Ego means you are above every one else   
whether they recognize it or not.Because you feel like a peak nothing can  
enter you.   
With Self-inquiry we find that ego does not exist.Then one becomes a depth,a  
valley,   
a vacant space,like a conscious sky which cannot be bound to anything.   
We can bind somethingness but we cannot bind nothingness.   
When we find our being which is nothing but bottomless vacuum,in that void   
the whole existence begins to pour into our being from everywhere.   
This type of feeling that we are a conscious void happens when we   
surrender our ego to a mater and he begins to flow into us immediately.   
If we cannot feel energy flowing into we must know well that we have not   
surrendered our ego to the master who is none other than your own Self.   
Once we know that through surrender we receive something unknown,   
unbelievable,unexpected,never even dreamed of, then we surrender to   
the existence totally.(Poorna saranagathi).So surrendering to the master   
gives you the courage for total surrender.   
So Self-inquiry is the process of dissolving the false "I" in Self awareness   
which implies surrendering of ego to the Self awareness.   
In this way "when you are not as the ego",for the first time you are "as you  
really are".

Dear Dr. Raju,   
Yes. Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Verse 1243: When one enters into and abides as the plenitude   
[Purnam], which is all consciousness and which shines as the   
real import of the unerring Vedas, it is impossible to perceive   
the three divisions of time, the three persons [I,you, he/she/it]   
and the triputis.   
Verse 1244: When examined, [it will be known that] these subtle   
ideas just declaimed are the silent discourse joyously bestowed   
upon me by Ramana, the Jnana Guru, my true Lord, who instructed me by  
manifesting before me as the foremost Brahma Jnani.   
Verse 1245: In my true perspective 'I alone am, and 'you' are not. In your  
true perspective 'you' alone are and 'I' am not. In the perspective of the  
Self, Self alone is and everything else is not.   
When one ponders over the matter, all those things and people   
are only 'me'.   
About true surrender, total surrender: Verse 1248: Know that Murugan will remain forever under the   
sway of the benevolent power of consciousness, supreme Ramana. Never will he  
submit to the malignant power of maya, the world, even under circumstances in  
which dire and distressing poverty   
comes.   
Verse 716: Even if you do nothing more than unceasingly think   
of that first name 'I-I' with the attention focused on that 'I' sense, that  
practice will take you to the source of from where rises the illusory thought  
of 'I', which is the embryo of the ego that connects you to the body.   
Verse 717: The literal meaning of the word 'I' is the ego that limits itself  
to the body. Because it [the ego] appears and disappears, when you examine  
it, you will know that the Self, the abiding substratum of the ego, is  
definitive import [of that word 'I'].   
Bhagavan Ramana says this in Verse 20-21 of Upadesa Undiyar.   
Arunachala Siva.

In maharishi's Gospel, Bhagavan defines ego and self in a very very simple  
term for any body to easily understand as under.   
 **" I am this, I am that is EGO and I as I is the SELF".**

Dear Dr. Raju and viswanthan,   
Yes.   
Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2253: Why do you still retain this attachment to the mental concepts   
of 'I' and 'mine', when, on that day, you had offered up all those   
things to me, avowing them to be mine?   
The same idea, Muruganar gives in Guru Vachaka Kovai, Verse 317: After surrendering one's body and possessions to the Jnana Guru,   
to regard the body as 'I' and the possessions as 'mine' constitutes   
the sin of stealing back what has been given as a gift [to the Guru]/   
You should know that avoiding this fault is the impeccable worship   
of the Sadguru.   
Bhagavan Ramana requests Arunachala, in the Verse 101 of the   
Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: As snow in water melts, kindly dissolve me in You, who is all Love   
O Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.
