## Dry Roti and Green Chillies  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 16, 2009, 08:59:53 AM  
---  
In Norther Karnataka [ Where Purandara Dasa was born],   
that is the present Bidar, Dharward, Raichur, Bijapur districts,   
the food habit changes, from rice to roti or chapatti. There   
the poor labourers take dry rotis and green chillies for their   
lunch. They cannot afford ghee roasted rotis and sabji, vegetables. The  
Saint has sung a wonderful song with these   
badvara roti [the poor man's dry rotis] and green chillies   
hasi-mensinkai.   
The man takes first roti with three green chillies. [Chillies   
are famous in that area, we have got Bydgi chillies, Raichur   
chillies and Guntur chillies]. The roti represents the individual   
soul and three green chillies to start with, represent three   
basic traits, kama, krodha and moha. In due course, man   
is not satisified with three chillies alone. He wants the roti   
and its taste hotter, so he takes five chillies. Adding madha   
and mascharya! With these five chillies, he suffers burning   
and pain in stomach. As he becomes aged, he leaves these   
and take only the red chillies, [Red means Efflugence also]   
which are said to be less hot, if not exposed to sun. He finds Narayana or  
Siva as the only support for his roti   
i.e. individual soul!   
The green chillies also represent Prakriti or Maha Maya, the   
goddess Uma, who first shows him the pleasures of the world, which he has to  
go through, find it uninteresting at some stage and then come to Narayana or  
Siva.   
Purandara Dasa says, for the poor, only chillies are the essentials, i.e God's  
name is essential for overcoming worldly sorrows. This God's name which is  
three, Rama, Rama, Rama becomes five, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama Rama in due  
course. Badavarukku adhara.... For poor, it is the support. Then for the  
family welfare also this is the only food. Manaikku Ahara.... Then finally  
the red chillies, the glorius Vittala [Panduranga] reveals Himself as the  
avasra, the need. Bidukadaikku avasara...   
Bidukadai - Liberation.

Sankara TV.)
