A WORD ABOUT GURU VACHAKA KOVAI: I was earlier reading David Godman's Guru Vachaka Kovai several times and this  
book contains apart from   
prose meaning of verses along with connected incidents in Sri Bhagavan's life.  
It also gives a list of Bhagavan's   
Verse and other stray verses of Bhagavan included in Guru Vachaka Kovai. Then  
I read the original Tamizh verses   
of Guru Vachaka Kovai and it delighted me more. The work is the summum bonum  
of Sri Bhagavan's teachings   
nicely versified by Muruganar.   
I thought of giving the Tamizh original verses (1254 + Bhagavan's verses) and  
also the translation in blank verse by   
Prof. K. Swaminathan.   
At the rate of about 15 verses per day and their English translation, it took  
me about 80+ days to post them. I am   
overjoyed in Bhagavan's Grace who made this task possible.   
All glory to Sri Bhagavan.   
All glory to His foremost devotee Sri Mugavaik KaNNa Muruganar.   
Arunachala Siva.
