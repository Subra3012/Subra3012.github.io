## Judgement of God

This post to narrate incidents to illustrate how one needs to reap the results  
of one's actions.   
This is true story I read in a book. A lawyer saw a beggar on the road badly  
afflicted with leprosy from where pus was coming out. After giving some money  
the lawyer was going away, when the beggar called back: O lawyer babu, did'nt you recognize me? I am the same person whose case you  
fought long back. That time you were able to save me from the judgement of the  
world, but see my condition now; you were'nt able to save me from the  
judgement of God.   
This incident deeply affected the lawyer and changed his life.

So true. If you truly, ernestly and deeply believe that vasanas are your enemy  
and that is the one thing you want to defeat, then there is no better medicine  
than karma phala to achieve that goal. If you feel sad when you get bad karma  
phala - then your intent for vasana kshaya is mere hypocracy.

Deepaji and Sanjayji,   
Yes, its very true. Karma phala is purificatory. Some describe it as  
reformative.   
Swami Vivekananda said: Expansion is life. Contraction is death. Karma phala  
is the dominant means of expansion. It is through karma phala that businesses  
learned that if they do not serve customers better, their survival is at  
threat.   
If one intentionally harms other, he can escape from the whole world but not  
from God Who is the Antaryami of everyone. The result is bound to come at the  
right time.   
Similarly, if one does good to others, it may go unnoticed from the whole  
world but not from God. So it is said that deposit to God is the surest  
deposit. Banks can fail, but God does not fail. Either in this life or future,  
the result is bound to come.   
Only when one's ego is totally dissolved, he goes out of the chain of karma  
phala and becomes an instrument of God.
