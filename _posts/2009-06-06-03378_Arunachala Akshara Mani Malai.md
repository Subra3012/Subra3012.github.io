Dear Nagaraj,   
I am not very sure about a Sanskrit version. It has been   
done in Telugu, as per information given by a devotee   
in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Dear Subramanian,   
I was trying to read the Tamizh rendering of Akshara Mani Malai. Its so  
beautiful. Unfotunately, I have not learnt Tamizh thought its my mother tongue  
as I was bought up here in Bangalore. But due to personal interest, I learnt  
Tamizh myself, Though I manage to read easy tamizh reading and understand most  
of it, still I find it little difficult to understand few words in all tamizh  
works of Bhagawan. I have to stick to English and learn the meanings, thats  
the only resort now

Dear Nagaraj   
There is one web site. They play recorded akshara mani malai song. If you  
download it, you can sing along with them.   
In Ramana kendra people also sing on specific days in group. So you can catch  
the correct prounciation.   
There are plenty of great works in tamil literature in the field of advaitam  
but outside India do not know. It is Bhagavan's grace, lots of western people   
have a chance of Tamil language. The credit goes to Bhagavan.

Dear Nagaraj and Ramanaduli,   
There is an official blog of Sri Ramanasramam, www.sriramanamaharshi.org. You  
can go there and there   
is a sub-route to "e library". There all songs of Bhagavan   
Ramana have been recorded in melodious music. You can   
pick up AAMM and listen to it, while reading from the book.   
You are sure to learn it without mastering the language, as   
my wife does many Kannada songs of Purandara Dasa and   
Jnanadeva's Marathi abangams.   
Arunachala Siva.
