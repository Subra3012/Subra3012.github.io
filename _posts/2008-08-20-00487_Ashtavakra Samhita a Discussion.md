Hi Friends,   
 Ashtavakra Samhita or Ashtavakra Gita consists of the teachings of Ashtavakra to Janaka Maharaj. Janaka Maharaj expressed through his life how one might be a king and still remain absolutely unattached.   
 Sri Adi Sankaracharya, in Bhaja govindam says: Jnana Viheena Sarva Mathena  
Bajathi na Muktim janma Shatena [one without knowledge does not obtain  
liberation even in a hundred births, no matter which religious faith he  
follows].   
Bhakti or Karma Phala Tyagam [Detachment to results] is absolutely impossible  
without Jnana. When one understands oneself as one is, one is at once freed  
from the attachment to result and then what ever one does it detached work.  
And similarly when one recognizes that Isa Vyapyam idam jagat [God is every  
where, in out and through us right now], that very recognition leads to a  
total dissolution of ego which is true Bhakti. What is required is only Jnana.  
All else follow. Without knowledge, when one tries to do detached work, he  
finds it impossible, coz he feels bettered by the results of the action. The  
very reason why he performed his action is for the result. So if one tells  
such a person to leave the result, its not possible for him. Similarly with  
bhakti. Sri Krishna says Sarva Darman Parityajya Maam ekam Saranam Vraja  
[leaving all Dharmas (laws), surrender to me alone] and most people dont know  
how to do this ! Coz who is this Me, Krishna? If Krishna is nothing more  
than a mental idea, how can one surrender to his own mental idea, as surrender  
itself means dropping of all mental ideas?   
Nothing works unless one knows oneself and once one knows oneself as one is,  
everything naturally falls in place. When one knows the Gods presence every  
moment, in and through oneself, one cannot but remain in complete surrender.  
When one knows Krishna, one is free, one automatically does detached action,  
coz there remains no one to get attached in the first place.   
Ayam Atma Gudakesha sarva Buteshu samstitah. I am the Soul in all living  
[and non, living ] beings. Krishna is essentially the Self Luminous entity in  
all living beings. Let us see clearly what is meant by Self luminous. Sun is  
self Luminous, moon shines with the light of sun. Same way, this body seems  
alive in the presence of something, the mind functions in the presence of  
some entity. That entity is Krishna, the Soul. That is also Self or Brahman,  
knowing which one is free.   
So The dialogue between Janaka and Ashtavakra starts with a simple question by  
Janaka. [Tp be continued. ..]   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
 Does the word Astavakra is symbolic of knots nerve plexuses from Muladhara to Sahasrara,then from Sahasrara to the Spiritual heart?   
 Even Buddha talked of presence of these knots which directs our attention in a particular way if there is knot and course of attention   
 altered if the knot is released.If the knot of chit-jada grandhi is released the flow of attention from the self towards objective reality   
 is stopped.   
 Or Asta vakra is meant to indicate a physical status?

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, the six centres of Mooladhara etc., are   
different. The Ashtavakra, denotes eight bends in the Sage's   
body, due to some illness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, the actual story is something like this...   
When Asthavakra was in his mother's womb, he used to hear his father recite  
vedanta everyday.   
Once as his father was reciting vedanta, he says " Father, thanks to you, i  
have learnt the whole vedanta but Father, there are some errors in your  
recitation". Angered by the comment, his father curses him and so he is born  
with 8 bends in his body.   
It so happens that his father loses some arguments in the royal court and then  
is sent to Samudra Garba [bottom of the Sea] as punishment. Ashtavakra wins  
back the argument and gets release for his father.   
Later the curse is revoked somehow and he becomes normal. But the name still  
remains.   
From Astavakra Samhita we learn what a Jnani he was !   
Love!

Dear Friends,   
so Janaka Starts with a simple question: katham jnanam avapnothi   
katham muktim bhavishyathi   
vairagyam cha katam prapyam   
ethad bruhii mama prabho.   
"How does Jnana happen, how does Liberation happen? How does one gain  
detachment ? Please, O Lord!, tell me these", thus he addresses Ashtavakra.   
And this question itself is a sign that Janaka Maharaj was a qualified  
disciple. Please see the remarks. He first asks for Jnana, which leads to  
liberation. Clearly, he knows that Self Knowledge alone leads one to  
liberation. Then he asks for Vairagyam, Detachment. Which means he knows that  
Detachment is very important.   
Before we proceed to list down ashtavakra's reply to this sincere question,  
lets first understand a few points.   
Janaka asked this question, Ashtavakra replies in a few verses and Lo! Janaka  
is liberated ! Does this not sound a little strange ?   
But what about practise ? Its not mentioned that Janaka practised anything  
here ! This is due to Sradha: Faith.   
so lets have absolute Sradha, Faith in Ashtavakra's teachings and directly see  
what he says. I shall explain how, with proper Faith, we can use these verses  
to find release and let us see them together and allow Ashtavakra to be  
our Guru. In other words let us make this question of Janaka our own question.  
And let us have the desire to get jnanam, liberation and vairagyam. And let  
us see if these verses really release us or not.   
There are also a few qualifications a sincere sadhaka should quickly obtain  
 through practise. Sri Ramakrishna says that mind is like a white cloth  
which takes what ever colour you dip it in so too, we should quickly and  
with dedication develop a few qualities which Ashtavakra mentions. These  
qualities are all developed with Self Inquiry "Who am I" \ Yoga Vasishta  
mentions 4 qualities: a) Self Control/ Equanimity/ Vairagyam   
b) Contentment   
c) SatSangh [Company of Truth, Sat; that which always is]   
d)vichara: who am i -- who am i is simply a pointer to the Self; not an  
intellectual jargon.   
and mentions that one who practises any one of these will soo develop the  
others also. So one who practises vichara, all the others happen  
automatically.   
Love!   
Silence

Liberation happens when we existentially know that there no bondage at all.   
Dispassion,association with the wise,self-enquiry are aids to it.

My dear 'srkuadi', Your Ashtavakra Samhita posts are excellent.   
Please continue. I am trying to pick up my Sri Ramakrishna Math,   
book, and read concurrently the passages in the same evening.   
Thank you. Your story of Ashtavakra's curse is known to be but I have  
forgotten it. Forgetfulness is a sin. I am happy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 forgetting these things is not a sin perhaps forgetting Self is a sin; but there it ends : if mind starts remembering everything we shall pity ourselves   
Anyways, once surrendered, as you know, whether we forget or not, its God's  
responsibility to save is isnt it ? Only Ramana says we should surrender  
like a cat and not like a monkey, as in monkey's case, there is a chance of  
fall but cat will not fall.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, I agree with you. Forgetting unimportant things,   
like what I ate for breakfast last Thursday, is a gift. As regards,   
the two methods, I believe Bhagavan stressed on the monkey method,   
that we should hold on to Guru with our efforts. Bhagavan says: " God and the Guru will only show the way to release. They will   
not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. In truth,   
God and the Guru are not different. Just as the prey which has   
fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who   
have come within the ambit of the Guru's gracious look will   
be saved by the Guru and will not get lost. Yet, EACH ONE   
SHOULD, BY HIS OWN EFFORT PURSUE THE PATH SHOWN BY   
GOD OR THE GURU AND GAIN RELEASE, AND NOT WITH   
SOMEBODY ELSE'S. Does he, who is Rama, require the help of   
a mirro to know that he is Rama?" (Who am I? 1902)   
Perhaps, Guru's Grace, may be interpreted as a mother cat's   
lifing of the baby-cat through its jaws. But eventually we have   
to be monkeys to win the game.   
Arunachala Siva.

Continuing. ..   
Ashtavakra uvacha [Ashtavakra Replied thus. ..]   
Muktim ichasi chet taath vishayan vivshavat tyaja [If, my son, you desire  
liberation- Shun Sense objects as poision]   
kshama arjva daya tosha satyam piiyuushhavad bhaja. [cultivate tolerance,  
sincerity, compassion, contentment and truthfulness as antidote]   
The very first instruction is to shun sense objects. People run after sense  
objects in the hope of gaining "anandam", "joy" from them. The sense objects  
cannot give anyone anandam for the simple reason that they do not have it to  
give them. For example, i like icecreams. So if someone gives me an icecream,  
i find joy in it. But to someone who does not like it, its not joy. So the  
object does not have it to give us.   
Anandam is our true nature. By wrongly associating it with the sense objects  
we suffer. If we observe carefully as to from where this anandam arises, we  
can find it coming from our Self. This is simply maya that i eat an  
icecream, get the anadam from myself, and think its coming from icecream! This  
is maya. Sri Ramakrishna explains it beautifully: There is a dog biting a dry  
bone. The blood comes from its own injured Gums, while it thinks that its  
coming from the bone ! Its like this. The "I" is temporarily suspended when  
one indulges in sense enjoyments and consequently one experiences the Anandam  
of one's own self. But mistakes it to be due to the sense objects. This is a  
grave mistake This is maya.   
One has to completely rule out this idea that anadam can be got from an  
external object. This has to be lived and practised.   
Most people think that to give up good food, not to talk to girls, to stop  
sleeping etc are ways to shun senses. But they forget that the mind itself is  
a sense ! If we stick to mental peace its attachment to senses. If we  
stick to any mental, physical state its attachment to senses! When one  
identifies with any mental or physical state, its attachment to senses !   
So what can be done abt this ? ? We shall see, as we study this text further,  
how Self Knowledge helps us own this up...now, lets simply see that we wrongly  
associate the bliss with the sense objects instead of the Self.   
And Ashtavakra further explains the qualities that are very important for  
someone trying for liberation: a) Tolerance: Lets look at this deeply. This is a very important quality.  
Tolerance means that we practise "not getting agitated" when something we do  
not like happens. how can this be practised ? We simply witness what ever  
happens. Suppose my hand is hurting due to some wound. a sensation is there,  
it reaches the mind and mind starts making it into a trouble. Pain is a  
sensation, Suffering is due to mental "rejection" of it. This is non-  
acceptance. Tolerance is to Accept all situations as they are. Since we are  
the witness, we can accept what ever happens.   
b) sincerity: Without sincerity one cannot even get Self Knowledge. Even when  
this is taught, one does not get it. conceit is being insincere. One needs to  
be absolutely sincere with oneself -- as to what one wants. An example of  
insincerity is when someone says "I want only God", in reality no one wants  
God one wants to go beyond suffering and God is seen as a way to go beyond  
suffering. But when someone says, i want God for no other reason, he is  
insincere. He cannot be taught Self Knowledge.   
One should be totally guileless. In other words, i should not hide from what  
is. I should see things as they are. People usually do not see waht they do  
not like they put a cover over it. This sort of tendency is dangerous.   
c) compassion: Compassion is love for the fellow beings it automatically  
happens when we recognize ourselves as the Self, which is pure Love.  
compassion is to give "anandam" to others ; when we recognize we are anandam  
 every act of ours spreads anandam.   
d) contentment: When one recognizes that one is already Complete, that there  
is nothing more to gain, one is totally satisfied.   
e) Satyam : Being with Sat, The Self. This is often interpreted as telling  
truth. this is not so. One has to be with that which is Sat -- There are, Sat,  
aSat and Mithya : Sat means that which is there as it is, unchanging. Asat  
means, that which is not there at all, like the horns of a hare. Mithya is  
that which appears to be there, but soon vanishes: like a dream or a mirage.  
Being with Sat is Satyam.   
Then can one tell lies ? No. Coz, that is against rule (b).   
these are the various ways to bring the Knowledge that Ashtavakra teaches into  
life. The knowledge should be used to detach oneself from the sense objects;  
that is to see that the sense objects cannot give us bliss, that the bliss is  
within. and also to bring in these important qualities.   
So the way is, to hear the truth and own it up, by living thus. Its like a  
king who imagined himself to be a beggar. He needs to be told that he is the  
king and then he has to live like the king to finally realize in completeness  
that he is indeed the king. For, he forgot that he is a king so totally that  
telling it once is not enough. So he has to hear that he is king and then,  
stop hankering for the one rupee coin someone gives. This step is  
"renunciation". Since he knows he is a king, he no more runs after people for  
money coz all money that people get is actually from him ! Then, since he  
knows he is the king he acts differently. He is no more disatisfied etc  
.... slowly he owns up his kingdom.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, I am happy to read your nice explanations   
for the requirements for understanding and attaiing the Self,   
in the preliminary verses of Ashtavkara Gita. Plese continue   
daily.   
Only one elaboration on Satyam, Asatyam and mithya. This is   
something, which is not there in Western philosophy. We all   
know only truth and untruth. Upanishads also say a third one   
called 'mithya', which can be translated as 'seemingly real'   
or 'seemingly unreal'. The following examples will help.   
SUN is in the sky - This is truth, or a true statement or a real. Satyam   
Son of a barren-woman - This is always untruth, or a false   
statement or unreal. - Asatyam   
Snake seen in the rope at dusk - This is seemingly real - for   
sometime appears real and later on correct understanding, it is   
unreal. Mithya.   
Thank you, once again, srkudai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Astavakra advising truth seekers to withdraw the attention from the nonself  
and once our awareness rests in itself we are endowed with the qualities of   
tolerance,sincerity,compassion,contentment,truthfulness which are innate  
qualities of unadulterated awareness.

Dear all,   
 Happiness in the sense objects is due to temporary withdrawl of the mind into the causal body(Anandamaya kosa) which has   
pleasurable tendencies(Ananda vrittis)like 1)Priya--the happiness that occurs  
seeing an object we like.2)Moda--the happiness that occurs   
when the object we like is under our possession.3)Pramoda--the happiness that  
occurs because of experiencing the object we like.   
All these are transient,so Astavakra is advising us to renounce such transient  
happiness which is the outcome of interaction of senses   
with the objects.Instead he is advising us to hold on to the self to have  
uninterrupted bliss of self-conscious being.
