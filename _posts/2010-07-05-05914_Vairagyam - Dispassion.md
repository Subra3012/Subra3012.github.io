Practice of Vairagya brings the mind into control quickly.   
Vairagya is "I do not care, its not my business" attitude.   
When one adopts this kind of an attitude with respect to one's own mind and  
body,   
the mind automatically falls in place.   
the mind comes up with various things "I am more comfortable with this, i am  
not comfortable with this etc".   
when one does not give much attention to these petitions of the mind, the mind  
automatically stills down.   
one who cannot be touched by the mind cannot be touched by anything in this  
world. to such a one this world is indeed mere illusion.   
just a shadow. coz it cannot touch him anyways.

Dear Udai,morning i read this.I liked it very much.   
 Let go of what has passed. Let go of what may come. Let go of what is  
happening now. Don't try to figure anything out. Don't try to make anything  
happen. Relax, right now, and rest. -Tilopa.

Dear Raju,   
 Thank you.   
Now what Tilopa says is beautiful. But when the king who took himself to be a  
beggar hears this.   
he sits down. .. but then, he sees a 100 rupee note lying on the road. The  
intention was good... it was strong. but now, that thought is replaced with  
"how nice it will be if i pick this note!   
wow!   
unable to control himself he picks it up. and just then someone comes and  
suspects that he took away the note and so start a chain of events. some  
sorrow, some joy. and after some time he reverts back...oh, i should let go.   
and sits down.   
let go.   
and again something happens!   
do you see ?   
The Sadhana is correct. But it is for the one who knows he is the king !   
The actual suggestion is not "Let go"   
The Suggestion is "Knowing that you are the King, Relax" the knowledge that i  
am the king is useful in protecting from fall. hold onto that! That is the  
point.

Dear srkudai,   
Once Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman was discoursing in Chennai.   
His upper cloth was slightly dislodged from its place. One fat mosquito   
came and sat and on his shoulder and started sucking the blood.   
Nochur did not care, either to close the shoulder, or drive out the   
mosquito, or hit the mosquito. He was continuing his discourse,   
uninterruptedly. The mosquito had been sitting on the shoulder and   
sucking adequate blood for its stomach, flew away on its own!   
Nochur did not now even close the shoulder with his upper cloth.   
[Perhaps another mosquito might come to have its share!]   
[As observed and reported by one of the audience in Sri Ramanodyam, a  
quarterly magazine]   
Once some one asked Bhagavan Ramana: What shall I do when   
a mosquito bites me while in meditation?   
Bhagavan Ramana said: You can either hit it or be quiet. A true   
meditator would first of all not even know that there was mosquito   
perching on his body!   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes.   
I have heard a lot about Nochur Venkataraman from you.   
Can you please tell me something about him? Is he alive ? How old is he ?   
BTW; Ramakrishna tells a nice story. When a thief knows that there is gold in  
the neighbouring room, he is totally concentrating on that gold and nothing  
else.   
Same way, only when one knows the Gold within the Self, would be able to  
lose himself completely.   
one should know oneself as the King and then the beggar drops off of itself.   
inother words. one should know that he is SAT CHIT ANANDA and that this world  
is a waste of time.   
as long as one gives value to this world, one will not be able to lose within.   
and as long as one has not known that one is Consciousness, one will not know  
this world as waste !   
this is one place where experience helps. it helps to convey the fact that  
spending tiem with this world is really useless.   
that this world is not worth a blade of grass.   
one has to know this and then turn within... then that turning within will be  
complete.

Dear srkudai,   
Nochur Venkataraman was born in a village called Nochur, near Palghat.   
He is a Palghat Brahmin, who knows Tamil and Malayalam. His   
knowledge of Sanskrit is stupendous. He is a post graduate in   
Sanskrit with particular reference to Vedanta. He studied in   
Sri Sankara University in Kaladi, Kerala. He is about 35 years old, married  
and has got a cute little child by name Sadasiva. He had almost similar  
experiences in his childhood, his father, uncles etc., dying in quick  
succession in a year. The children in the house, even if there is a good  
function, used to ask the elders : Is today a   
Devasam? [death ceremony function]. Thus he had opportunity   
to think and contemplate as what is death, how a person dies?   
He went to several places including SRK Math (I am not sure whether he joined  
as a probationer and then left it later). He came to   
Tiruvannamalai and was immediately impressed by Bhagavan's   
teachings. He says: Bhagavan opened my Heart! He studied   
thoroughly all of Bhagavan Ramana's works. And started telling to   
small audience in and around Palghat and Tellicherry, about Bhagavan's  
philosophy. His name spread and started discoursing   
in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Chennai, Mumbai and even in Tiruvannamalai. He must  
have got married a few years back, and his only kid is Sadasiva. The couple  
own a house in T'malai but they go to different places for Nochur discoursing  
on Bhagavan Ramana. He goes even to Hardwar. He is an exponent in Srimad  
Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita apart from Bhagavan's teachings. He has recently  
released a book in Malayalam giving the comprehensive life and teachings of  
Bhagavan.   
I met him first in Asramam. Later again recently I met him in   
T'malai, when I went there on 19th and 20th July. I listened   
to his discourse on Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram spread over 7   
days for 14 hours, in Bangalore. Several CDs have come on his talks on  
Bhagavan's works. He is speaking about ULLadu Narpadu   
since 2005. In five years, one week each, spread over 14 hours   
he has covered upto 36 verses. One more discourse is due this   
December 2010. Sri Ganesan, the eldest grand son of Sarvadikari,   
has said in one satsangh, Nochur is today's embodiment of   
Bhagavan Ramana! T.R. Kanakammal has attended his discourse   
in 2009 in Chennai, when she was convalescing.   
I also heard him in a brief question answer session, to an audience   
of about 15 people, in T'malai inside Mother's Temple.   
His CDs are only in Tamizh. If I get in other languages [it might   
come in future], I shall be too glad to send a couple of cassettes.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you so much for the information Subramanian ji!   
He should be really a blessed soul to have got such a wonderful experience!   
Studying vedanta, sanskrit and becoming a devotee of Ramana ! What an  
accomplishment at such a young age!   
That's what God's grace is all about!
