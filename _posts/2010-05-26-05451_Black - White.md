In life, a lesson learned in your past that you will never forget  
completely.When I was in elementary school, I got into a major argument with a  
boy in my class. I have forgotten what the argument was about, but I have  
never forgotten the lesson learned that day.   
I was convinced that "I" was right and "he" was wrong - and he was just as  
convinced that "I" was wrong and "he" was right.   
The teacher decided to teach us a very important lesson. She brought us up to  
the front of the class and placed him on one side of her desk and me on the  
other. In the middle of her desk was a large, round object. I could clearly  
see that it was black. She asked the boy what color the object was. "White,"  
he answered.   
I couldn't believe he said the object was white, when it was obviously black!  
Another argument started between my classmate and me, this time about the  
color of the object.   
The teacher told me to go stand where the boy was standing and told him to  
come stand where I had been. We changed places, and now she asked me what the  
color of the object was. I had to answer, "White." It was an object with two  
differently colored sides, and from his viewpoint it was white. Only from my  
side was it black.   
 **My teacher taught me a very important lesson learned that day: You must  
stand in the other person 's shoes and look at the situation through their  
eyes in order to truly understand their perspective. **

Dear prasanth,   
On the one side, it is mind and on the other side it is the Atman.   
Arunachala Siva.
