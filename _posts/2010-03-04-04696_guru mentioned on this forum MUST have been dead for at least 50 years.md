The Forum rule says: Any guru mentioned on this forum MUST have been dead for at least 50 years.   
I have seen names such as Nisargadatta, who can fall into this category, in  
forum postings.   
I am not sure if it conforms to the forum rule.   
I am not ciriticizing those postings, but I am just asking.

I think the 50 year rule is more of a guideline and is to prevent propaganda  
especially among living gurus. Even Bhagwan could not be mentioned until  
recently if the rule is to be followed strictly!   
In any case, posters cannot be expected to carry a bio of all the gurus to  
check when the 50'th anniversary falls. I am fine with Nisargadatta (or  
anybody else) since it must be a few decades since his death as far as I know.  
Also it should be ok to mention living gurus whenever they make news even for  
all the wrong reasons.   
Just my two paisa.

I asked Graham Boyd the same question. He said it should be followed but for  
some   
stray references. I had, of course, in mind, Kanchi Mahaswami.   
Arunachala Siva.
