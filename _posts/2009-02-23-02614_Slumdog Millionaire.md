Pranam,   
Today while receiving the Oscar for the best song of the year, A. R. Rehman  
(Renowned musician of the Indian film Industry) mentioned, he always had two  
choices in life; to hate or to love. He chose to love and that is why he was  
standing there receiving the most coveted prize in the film industry.   
A simple non-assuming statement but which can have a profound influence on  
anybody's life if one follows it.   
In our self-righteousness and narrow outlook of life we find so many reasons  
to hate another human being. The reasons can be anything from religion,  
culture, to even a different sexual orientation. Many of us do not even  
realize that we have a choice of not hating somebody. Our prejudices and  
opinions take over so completely that we forget that we have this choice.   
After listening to A. R. Rehman's statement I was reminded of Thirumoolar who  
wrote the Thirumantiram where he describes Shiva as Love.

Dear Disciple,   
I did not see the News Channels today. However, the news from   
you is quite satisfying. A.R. Rahman deserves the coveted Oscar,   
the first Indian to receive Oscar. Even the great Satyajit Ray could   
not get it. You know there are a lot of politics there too. There are   
two great choreographers in Indian music today, perhaps after old geniuses  
like Burman and a few others. One is ILaya Raja, who trusted his own music  
wisdom than the modern instruments. He is basically a violinist. He knows  
Tami classics too. He is the devotee of Bhagavan Ramana. He has got some of  
his own songs in praise of Bhagavan Ramana sold as CDs and audios. The other  
is A.R. Rahman. He was born a Hindu and his father was a Hindu. He perhaps  
changed over to Islam, because of the treatement meted out to him by the film  
industry people in the beginning. Now they are after him. He wanted some  
solace from the hate that he had experienced and Islam was found suitable by  
him. But he has learnt to love people and that is the most important thing.  
He is the one who trusted the musical instruments along with his own innate  
genius.   
Arunachala Siva.

This victory is within us.   
I have heard that AR Rahmans sister wasvery ill and was miraculously cured by  
a Muslim Guru. Hence they felt it binding on their part to serve the Muslim  
Guru as a reciprocation like it was a call from the all mighty. Very beautiful  
words - Anbe Sivam. If you are able to love everything then you are able to  
love your Self completely. Hence contentment.   
Sat Guru Paahi Paahi

I read the raving news description in the Hindu, with a lot of photographs.  
Particularly, today, I like the report of Pookutty's,   
the Sound Mixing director's, thanksgiving words, "I am from the   
country and the civilization, which found that sound before the   
silence, and that sound that remains after silence, OM. I dedicate   
this to my country!" Everything starts and ends in Om, the word   
of Siva, the word before gods.   
Arunachala Siva.
