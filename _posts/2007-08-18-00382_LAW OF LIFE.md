PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO OBTAIN BHAGAVAN'S BOOKS &  
MOUNTAIN PATH JOURNAL. AM STAYING IN KWT.I don't know any devotee of Bhagavan  
who are staying in Kwt. Am like fish out of water now. Once I had been to  
Ashram, I really enjoyed the stay.

My dear Sankar, Your understanding is correct. Bhagavan says   
in Who am I? : "if one knows that whatever he gives to others,   
he is giving to himslef, no one will stop from giving." Contemplate   
on these words carefully. If one gives love to others, he is giving   
love to himself. If one gives hatred to others, he is giving hatred   
to himself. If one gives pleasure to others, he is giving pleasure to   
himself. If one gives pain to others, he is giving pain to himself.   
If one gives good to others, he is giving good to himself. If one   
gives bad to others, he is giving bad to himself." If one knows   
this, he will give to others only what is suitable for him to get back.   
This was told by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, to Sivaprakasam Pillai,   
at the age of 21! This is the only teaching of Bhagavan, from where,   
he never went back in his 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.
