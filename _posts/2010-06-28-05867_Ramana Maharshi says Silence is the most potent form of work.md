A very interesting account of Ramanas silence is given by Major A.W.  
Chadwick, also known as Sadhu Arunachala. Chadwick came to Ramanas ashram on  
Nov 1, 1935, having heard of Ramana though Bruntons book Search (Chadwick,  
11). Chadwick asked Ramana about his vow of silence. Ramana said there was  
never any vow, but he had observed how convenient it was:  _while living in temple at one time he found himself seated for a while by a  
Sadhu who was observing such a vow and saw how convenient it was as the crowds  
did not worry the Sadhu in the same way as they worried him. So for  
convenience he pretended to copy him. There was no vow, I just kept quiet, I  
spoke when it was necessary, he explained. I asked him how long this had  
continued. For about two years, he replied. (Chadwick, 18)_   
Once he had achieved perfection, he just sought out quiet places where he  
thought that he would not be disturbed and where he might enjoy Bliss.   
 **It was all a dream anyhow, so why do anything about it? Just sit somewhere  
and enjoy the Self. What did teaching others and helping the world signify?  
There were no others (Chadwick, 19).**   
But it is clear that after Brunton wrote A Search in Secret India, Ramana  
promoted this view of his powers of silence. Here are some quotations from  
Ramana after the date of Bruntons visit: Lectures may entertain individuals for a few hours without improving them.  
Silence on the other hand is permanent and benefits the whole of humanity  
(Talks, 18; Jan. 30, 1935).   
Public speeches, physical activity and material help are all outweighed by the  
silence of Mahatmas. They accomplish more than others (Talks, 227; Oct. 23,  
1936).   
Preaching is simple communication of knowledge. It may be done in Silence,  
too. (Talks, 243; Nov. 18, 1936).   
 **Silence is the most potent form of work (Talks, 370; April 14, 1937).**   
Gurus silence is the loudest upadesa [instruction] If the Guru is silent the  
seekers mind gets purified by itself. (Talks, 501; Sept. 27, 1938).   
Silence is eternal eloquence (Talks, 141; Feb. 24/1936).   
There are no 'others' to be helped. For the Realized Being sees only the Self  
The Realized One does not see the world as different form Himself.

Absolutely, nothing greater than this.   
The eternal Dakshinamurthy Himself.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar used to praise Bhagavan Ramana saying that He attained   
Samadhi without any sadhana whatsoever. He made others [true   
seekers] to attain Samadhi without any sadhana either.   
In fact His Silence in the early years was mistaken by the onlookers   
as Mauna vratham.   
His not desiring to eat anything, ever remaining in the bliss of the Self, was  
mistaken as Upavasam.   
Seeing His long nails and long unkempt hairs, the people thought   
He was a great old Yogi, who is looking young.   
In fact, there was no sadhana [excepting you want to call His   
'death dramatization' in Madurai as sadhana], there was no yoga,   
there was not tapas, no upavasam, only true silence - the Silence that passeth  
understanding.   
I shall give some Padamalai verses, next. Now the time is up for   
powercut. My UPS is not working.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
What are Bhagavan's advices on Sadhana?   
Muruganar gives it in his Padamalai: Verse 334: Grace will not combine with a bat-like mentality. Stick   
to one Path.   
Verse 2635: All meditation practices are the means that enable   
the attainment of strength of mind that is necessary for Atma Nishta.   
What should be the attitude to Sadhana?   
Muruganar says: Verse 2115: Any effort to reach reality, thinking it to be different   
from oneself to go, will cause the nondual experience, wherein   
one abides as reality, to go extremely far away.   
Verse 888: Do not falter, even for a moment, believing that you   
face insurmountable obstacles on the path, but remain vigilant   
in the unfailing guaranteed method you have adopted - that of   
not forgetting the Self.   
Verse 1844: It is harmful to regard as important the ecstatic experiences of  
a mind that has not clearly known reality through   
the Sakti of Siva.   
What constitutes effective Sadhana?   
Muruganar says: Verse 2352: The foremost of all sadhanas is Silence of the Mind.   
That is what true devotees should practice.   
Verse 656: The first and foremost important lessson that has to   
be learned by the sadhakas is Silence.   
Verse 655: The silence of not speaking is the medicine that can   
change the habit of speaking pointlessly like a mad person.   
Verse 868: Unless the mind abides as a mere witness to everything   
and conducts itself in this way, what can all other practices do for   
a sadhaka?   
Arunachala Siva.
