## New guidelines for posting Topics

I have observed some frustration from Members in their submissions and replies  
to Topics, with particular reference to large numbers of separate Topics on  
one single theme - i.e. one Topic for each Verse of a long translation.   
This tends to make it difficult for visitors to navigate the site and find  
things of interest to them, especially for those with slower connections.   
Rather than restrict the number of Posts, I have decided to move all of the  
long Translations and Commentaries to a new Board entitled 'Translations and  
Commentaries by Forum Members'.   
Please use this board to post your translations, serialisations and  
commentaries on long works, leaving the other boards free for single Topics.   
The transfer of Topics had already begun and will continue over the next few  
days - I also have a limited connection here in India, so it takes time.   
My thanks   
Graham -

I think it is a good idea to restrict the number of topics each member can  
start in a day.

Dear Sankar, Doing service to the Guru, may mean services like   
attending to the Guru's bodily needs, when he is in body. Like   
giving him food, water, giving medicines to his ailments etc.,   
When the Guru has shed his body, the service is to read and follow   
his teachings. Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi goes one step further   
and says that the guru-seva or service to the guru, IS ONLY STAYING   
IN THE SELF. In Viveka Choodamani, Sankara says the same thing.   
The service to the guru, is remaining in his 'tattva' that is, his teaching,   
that is staying in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, if you stay in the Self, you are Brahman, you are   
Ramana or you are That.   
Arunachala Siva.

Serving the master(Guru) is to surrendering to him.   
Master is nothing other than our self.   
So surrendering our mind to the self amounts to serving the master who is our  
self.

Dear DRKPSSN Raju, you are correct. Serving the master   
is serving the Self. It is not going to Sri Ramanasramam   
and sweeping the floor. In fact, Bhagavan chided one Western   
devotee, when he tried to do all these things. In Viveka   
Choodamani, Sankara says, the best Guru seva is being in   
the Self, always contemplating on the Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

Origin is self and the manifestations are the result of it's imaginary  
power(kalpana sakti).

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, you are correct. Being and doing are   
the two sides of the same coin, the Siva Sakti, the Inert and   
the Activity. The M and E of Einstein.   
Arunachala Siva.
