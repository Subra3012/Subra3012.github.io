One thousand years after this incident, Ribhu once again decided to see his  
disciple Nidaagh. So he   
once again arrived in Veernagar. At that time, king of that town was leading a  
procession of his army.   
So there was a great crowd on the main road of the town. Nidaagh was carrying  
some worship   
materials from the forest but seeing a huge crowd on the road, he stood aside  
waiting for its dispersion.   
Meanwhile, Ribhu also arrived there. Seeing Nidaagh standing alone away from  
the crowd, Ribhu   
approached him and asked why he was standing there. Nidaagh said- "O Brahmin!  
Today, the king of   
our town had taken out a procession. So I am standing here waiting for the  
dispersion of crowd so that I   
can reach home and offer my worship."   
Ribhu asked - "It appears from your words that you know everything about your  
town. Kindly tell me   
who is the king and who are the subjects?" Nidaagh said- "The one who is  
riding an elephant is the king   
and those who are following him on the ground are his subjects."   
Ribhu said - "O Nidaagh! You have shown me the king and the elephant together  
but did not show their   
distinguishing symptoms separately. Who is the king among them and who is the  
elephant?" Nidaagh said- "The   
one who is above is the king and the one who is beneath is the elephant."  
Ribhu said- "Kindly elaborate what is   
above and what is beneath?" As soon as Ribhu finished his words, Nidaagh  
climbed on his shoulders and said-   
"Look, like the king, I am above you and like the elephant, you are beneath  
me." Ribhu said- "If you are like the   
king and I am like the elephant, kindly explain to me, who are you and who am  
I?"   
Nidaagh at once climbed down and fell at Ribhus feet and said- "Certainly,  
you are the great sage   
Ribhu." Ribhu said- "Yes, I am Ribhu and I have come to preach you out of  
affection." Thereafter Ribhu   
preached Nidaagh on the universality of soul and development of impartial view  
and left. By his   
preaching, Nidaaghs ignorance dispersed and he began to see all the creatures  
equal to impartially.   
O king! Like the Brahmin who attains salvation because of impartial view, you  
also develop an impartial   
view regarding soul. Then you will not see anyone separate from you.  
Everything in this world is a   
manifestation of soul.   
 _Careful study and contemplation of this story will definitely reveal the  
Self. There are so many inner essence and Truth in this story. Bhagawan has  
held high the Ribhu Gita.

Dear everyone,   
Ribhu Gita English blank translation, published by Society for Abidance in  
Truth, SAT, California, is available in Sri Ramanasramam.   
This has been done by Nome and Dr Ramamoorthy. The Tamil verse   
translation of Ulanganatha Swamigal, is published and is available in   
Sri Ramanasramam.   
There is a story about Ribhu Gita, Tamil. The poet did not care to have a  
benedictory verse on any personal god. Nor did he mention   
about Siva or Nataraja in any place. Nataraja of Chidambaram, wanted to  
'test' him. The poet lost his eyesight on completion of   
the work. He became very sad. Nataraja of Thillai appeared to him in dream  
and said: Add benedictory verse on Me and then get back your sight. After  
all, in Saiva-Siddhantam, Brahman is Siva or Sivam. The poet then not only  
added a benedictory verse on the dancing god of Thillai and also one verse at  
the end of each chapter. These verses   
are really delightful!   
For Sad Darsanam, Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri wanted Bhagavan   
Ramana to compose a benedictory verse, and He did two verses to satisfy him!   
Arunachala Siva.
