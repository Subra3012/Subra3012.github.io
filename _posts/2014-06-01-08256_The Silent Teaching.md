Extracts from http://www.arunachalasamudra.org/yogiram.html   
Visiri Saamiyar Sri Sri Yogi Ram Surat Kumar a true saint and our Father's  
devotee.   
Over to Visir Samiyar on Arunachala in his own words/of his life: He always acknowledged with reverence his huge debt to sacred Arunachala and  
Arunachaleswarar Temple, saying: 'This hill and this temple, they have saved  
this beggar,' and with the utmost gratitude for the sanctity of Mount  
Arunachala, he would later say: 'This beggar wandering here and there, tired of wandering but having no home -  
Arunachalesvara, in the form of this hill, had mercy on this miserable sinner.  
So he gives thanks, a thousand thanks, to this holy hill, this holy temple.  
Oh, the magnanimity of the Lord! He has given me shelter for twenty long  
years. Whereas others who come are enabled to stay only days or weeks. . .   
For thousands of years the hill has given shelter to so many dirty sinners  
like me - and Arunachala will give us shelter for thousand of years to come.'   
 When Yogi Ramsuratkumar used to walk around the Hill, out of humility, he would always walk in the opposite direction of all the other pilgrims.   
 Many times Yogi Ramsuratkumar would say: 'The mountain helps us.' He himself spent many years wandering on the mountain, taking shelter in its caves. Based on his own comments, his transformation seems to have been connected in part to his subtle relationship to the divine force within Arunachala.   
Where is the Fire?   
The Fire is there on the hill there.   
But I don't see it there.   
You can see it if you are really bent upon seeing it.   
Are you afraid of being engulfed by it?   
Then you can't see it   
Have courage, no fear   
You are sure to see it   
 Yogi Ramsuratkumar   
 The 'Fire' referred to by Yogi Ramsuratkumar (as poet) is the mystical Fire of Creation, the light that is perceived burning within Mount Arunachala as the embodiment of Shiva: 'This holy Fire burned at the core of the beggar's absolute certainty: his  
faith in a Power that governs everything, controls everything.'   
Yogi Ramsuratkumar

## The Silent Teaching

Hello Friends! This is my first post and many thanks to Graham for providing  
me with an account.   
Having a deep interest in the teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, I  
have practiced self inquiry "on and off" for a number of years.   
I was wondering if other members of the forum have also overlooked - like I  
often do - that while Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi did answer questions, he  
frequently said the silent teaching was the highest and purest form of his  
teaching. Quite often I will read the written teaching, apply it, and will  
tend to view the written teaching as his primary teaching.   
Would I be right in thinking this is not the case. That infact the written  
teaching was given for those who couldn't comprehend his silent teaching. And  
the written teaching is a tool that opens one up to receive his silent  
teaching; which I am sure is still given to those of us who desire it.

Dear rjs7,   
No doubt Sri Bhagavan was engaging Himself in conversation, when questions  
were asked, to clarify His teachings.   
However His Silence was the most potent weapon to melt the mind and curl up  
into the Heart.   
Arunachala Siiva.

Thankyou for your reply Subramanian.R   
Your answer coincides with what I assumed. That self-enquiry is engaged by the  
false-self, and when the realisation occurs that it is the false-self that is  
the one making the effort, you can see through the illusion of the I-am-the-  
body thought and rest in silence.

but when we sit silently we end up in stupor Hence that silence in sannidhi  
of Maharishi really means arresting of all thoughts. If one could not do  
that, it is better to enquire.
