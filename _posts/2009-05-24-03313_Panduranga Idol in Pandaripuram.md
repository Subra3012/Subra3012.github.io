## Panduranga Idol in Pandaripuram

Panduranga, as many of us are aware, is a form of Vishnu,   
as he appeared before Pundalikan, who made him wait to   
complete his service to aged parents. Vishnu who came as   
a boy, waited patiently, on a brick ["seat" as given by   
Pundalika]. The boy remained as god, in Pandaripuram,   
he is called Vittal because he stood on the brick, vit = in   
Marathi. He came to be called as Pandurnga. From this   
Pandaripur, many great lives of nama-sankirtan marga   
[the path of chanting Vishnu's names] sprang up. The   
movement started with Jnaneswar and his siblings. The   
great children are Nivrutti Natha, Jnaneswar, Sophan Nath (?),   
and their only sister Muktabai. While Nivrutti Natha is   
considered as Siva, Jnaneswar, Vishnu, Sophan Nath, Brahma   
and Muktai Bai as Uma. Jnaneswar was for pure bhakti [devotion through nama  
sankirtan], and Jnana. Many of   
us know only his Jnaeswari, the commentary on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, but he has also written a pure advaita work,   
called Amritanubhava. Both are available in print. He has   
also written some poems as replies to one Changdev Vatiswar,   
a great Raja Yogi, describing Jnana.   
Panduranga, a discourser said, is a combination of all these   
four divine forms. One can see in his idol, on the skull,   
a small cavity, where there is a Siva linga, with the base called   
avadai, which represents Uma. He is said to have Brahma   
on the belly bottom, and Saraswati in his tongue and Lakshmi   
in his heart. He does not have chakra and sangh [conch shell]   
which are marks of Vishnu, on his hands. On the other hand,   
he is keeping his two hands on his waist, as if to show that his devotees,  
have to cross the ocean of samsara which would only be waist-deep and they  
need not be afraid to be drowned by the ocean of worldly life. Sri Mahabhakta  
Vijayam, originally in Marathi, now available in all Indian languages, is the  
stories   
of devotees, who had experienced different types of miracles done in their  
lives by Panduranga.   
The followers of nama-sankirtan marga, say Hari Ramakrishna Hari, as the  
chanting name but they are not Vaishnavites. The devotees wear the marks of  
an advaiti [vibhuti], or Sri Churanam [Vaishanavites] or simply sandal paste  
like dvaitis, but without the homa paste in black colour. In fact, the  
disourser, Sri Venkatakrishna Bhagavatar who is telling stories from  
Bhagavatam, profusely quote Bhagavan Ramana's words and conversations and  
miracles.

The phrase "belly bottom" is a voluptuous mistake! Please   
read the phrase as "belly-button" wherefrom a lotus appeared   
and Brhma found him there, as per Bhagavatam.

Dear mmohan,   
Sri Sankara TV is a free to air channel. Because of its   
comparatively weak spectrum allocation, it is not seen   
everywhere. If you go through a cable operator, he   
does proper telecast. Otherwise, it is difficult. It is   
beamed from Bangalore, but it is not even tunable in   
Chennai. Bangalore people are able to see it even without   
cable operator's help. Things will improve in due course.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam,   
Thanks for the info. That explains why I don't get it in Kovai when it can't  
reach even Chennai.
