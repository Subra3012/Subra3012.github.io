Is the heart center like a expansive emptiness and stillness?

Dear kde,   
Heart Centre, has been prescribed by Bhagavan Ramana, so the   
sake of seekers, even though the Self or the Heart is all pervading.   
This Heart Centre is within the chest of a person, two digits right   
to the midchest. It is described in 'sastras' as in the form of   
inverted lotus, with six colours. Kindly see the Reality in Forty   
Verses of Bhagavan and the Supplement.   
The Self is not an emptiness. It is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Buddhists   
called it Sunya or emptiness, or Void.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai   
I understand what you are saying.   
But, I will try to clarify my situation as best I can. At a point in  
September, I was doing quiet well. Probably the best I've been in a long time,  
in many aspects of worldly and spiritual pursuits. Things -studying, cooking,  
activities- were happening almost effortlessly.   
Three weeks ago, some baggage was being felt, reaching a high point of a week  
ago.   
As you can see this is not about any discouraging thoughts and what not, this  
seems to be issues at a deeper level.   
I have resolved to drinking alcohol on a few nights this week, though I  
haven't for many months before.   
Anyway, its almost 5.30am here. I will be going to sleep soon.   
I don't know if this is a mind game that I'm playing with myself.   
Take care   
Laith

Dear Arunachala Siva   
My wish is not to abandon the duties expected, but the opposite.   
This seems to be difficult. Especially now.   
Laith   
P.S. I've read the poem you posted and it's inspiring.   
What I go through has been gone through and it is God's plan.   
I guess there is a feeling of guilt also inside of me, due to many unfulfilled  
expectations imposed on myself.

Dear Laith,   
Yes. .. it is a game your mind is playing with you.   
Need to come out of it.   
Please sleep early... avoid alcohol... and do your duties.   
Not doing these has nothing to do with spirituality or spiritual evolution.   
Above all... Know your thoughts and understand your inner lanscape. .. how  
thoughts/feelings/sensations are driving you... need to see them within.   
This is my advise as a friend... not someone here to criticize. .. but someone  
ever with you to support and help if sought.   
Love!   
Silence

I pray for your peace, and that you may return to the point in your middle  
soon...   
ken Wilber said: in the eye of the hurricane you are safe...   
It is very important to do the work you should do, you will feel much better  
if you are in tune with the plan of god (this means working, studding and  
whatever is happening in your life as a worldy duty)...   
No Alcohol Sir, Meditaiton and Drugs are two different worlds.....   
I guess you sit alot, so please go jogging..... and make some hatha yoga, a  
healthy body is easier to transcend   
drink alot of water to purify you, sometimes we do not have much energy  
because we do not drink water....this can make us frustrated and angry   
2 glass of water before every meal and 1 glass afterwards   
I wish you peace
