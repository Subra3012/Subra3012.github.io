## What do I know about my body?

We all think that we know our body thoroughly as we know about   
the neem tree at the backyard of our house. The truth is that   
we know neither about our body nor about the neem tree. Apart   
from bookish knowledge about photosynthesis and cholorphyll   
and other botanical details, do we know really the neem tree?   
Do we know at what point of time, the green tender leaves first   
appear? We suddenly see the green tender leaves on the tree;   
that is all. We do not know similarly when it does flower, the flower   
becomes the unripe green fruit and then finally the yellow fruit,   
which is of course, not bitter, but somewhat alkaline in taste like   
tarmarind fruit.   
So is the case with my body. How do I know when the first black   
hair is growing grey and then white. When exactly I become bald, with hairs  
receding from the front head. When I get my first cancer node in the  
intestine or liver. When my hyper-tension becomes   
abnormal, when I start producing less insulin and become a diabetic.   
The body constantly changes as the neem tree. That which changes is unreal.  
The Reality is ever the same, no change, no reduction or increase, eternall  
present in the same manner. The Reality is Real, the Atma is nityam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Everyone has someone inside of us, who tells I know this but I do not know  
that. I want to know who is that. EDU ENNAKU THERIKIRADU AANAL EDU ENNAKU   
THERIYAVILLAI. EPPADI SEER THUKI SOLVADU YAR.   
Is that consiousness or atma.   
This atma also needs one body and mind to express is it not? Without body,  
mind, live and organ's congnitions the atma never can be identified. Is it  
correct?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Yes. This differentiation of what I know and what I know not,   
is the biggest question. For both, excepting seeking the grace   
of guru, I do not know any other solution. At least this is what   
I know!   
Arunachala Siva.
