TEXT 18   
kurute gangaasaagaragamanam   
vrataparipaalanamathavaa daanam   
gyaanavihinah sarvamatena   
muktim na bhajati janmashatena   
One may go to the Ganga, observe fasts, and give away riches in charity! Yet,  
devoid of jnana, nothing can give mukthi even at the end of a hundred births.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says with karma we cannot get liberation as  
karma and ignorance are not enemies but only friends.   
We do social service or any good karma(action) hoping to get liberation(self-  
realisation) but not knowing that self-realisation is nothing but we should  
eradicate ignorance in us.   
TEXT 19   
sura mandira taru muula nivaasah   
shayyaa bhuutala majinam vaasah   
sarva parigraha bhoga tyaagah   
kasya sukham na karoti viraagah   
Take your residence in a temple or below a tree, wear the deerskin for the  
dress, and sleep with mother earth as your bed. Give up all attachments and  
renounce all comforts. Blessed with such vairagya, could any fail to be  
content?   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says true happiness lies in independence.  
Dependence is misery.   
TEXT 20   
yogarato vaabhogaratovaa   
sangarato vaa sangaviihinah   
yasya brahmani ramate chittam   
nandati nandati nandatyeva   
One may take delight in yoga or bhoga, may have attachment or detachment. But  
only he whose mind steadily delights in Brahman enjoys bliss, no one else.   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says jnanis mind always will be in brahman  
whatever work they do.That is the reason some jnanis like swami vivekananda  
think to teach others but few jnanis like ramana maharshi think it is better  
to be silent rather than teaching in public places.   
TEXT 21   
bhagavad giitaa kijnchidadhiitaa   
gangaa jalalava kanikaapiitaa   
sakridapi yena muraari samarchaa   
kriyate tasya yamena na charchaa   
Let a man read but a little from the Bhagavad-Gita, drink just a drop of water  
from the Ganga, worship Murari (Krishna) just once. He then will have no  
altercation with Yama (the lord of death).   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Ganga is not only river but jnana  
also.Once Akbar asked birlal which is the best river and birbal said  
Yamuna.Then akbar was astonished and asked why not ganga.Then birbal said  
because lord krishna was there in yamuna so yamuna river is sacred and best  
and moreover ganga is not a river but jnana.   
TEXT 22   
punarapi jananam punarapi maranam   
punarapi jananii jathare shayanam   
iha samsaare bahudustaare   
kripayaa apaare paahi muraare   
Born again, death again, birth again to stay in the mother's womb! It is  
indeed hard to cross this boundless ocean of samsara. Oh Murari! Redeem me  
through Thy mercy.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says there is one upanishad called garba Upanishad  
which is used for infant who is about to come from mother's womb.This  
Upanishad explains in detail about the conception and growth of a child in the  
mothers womb.   
More details in the below website   
http://www.vedarahasya.net/garbha.htm   
Everyone has fear about death and it is the highest fear humans have in their  
life.   
TEXT 23   
rathyaa charpata virachita kanthah   
punyaapunya vivarjita panthah   
yogii yoganiyojita chitto   
ramate baalonmattavadeva   
There is no shortage of clothing for a monk so long as there are rags cast off  
the road. Freed from vice and virtue, onward he wanders. One who lives in  
communion with God enjoys bliss, pure and uncontaminated, like a child and as  
someone intoxicated.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Here rags means torn clothes(raggu ante  
bonta type) found on the road side.   
Adults do every action by thinking what gain he will get.Example: before  
opening any bank account we will ask what benefits we will get etc.   
He says in light lien Picchi leni padi mandi "Picchi" gurinchi pichhigaa  
matladatamee "Pichhi".   
TEXT 24   
kastvam ko.aham kuta aayaatah   
kaa me jananii ko me taatah   
iti paribhaavaya sarvamasaaram   
vishvam tyaktvaa svapna vichaaram   
Who are you? Who am I? From where do I come? Who is my mother, who is my  
father? Ponder thus, look at everything as essence-less and give up the world  
as an idle dream.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says when we give some advice to anyone if  
he likes that advice he tells that from where did you get this wonderful  
thought sir. So it is clear that mind is responsible for all our thoughts. So  
we are existence-consciousness-bliss.   
TEXT 25   
tvayi mayi chaanyatraiko vishhnuh   
vyartham kupyasi mayyasahishhnuh   
bhava samachittah sarvatra tvam   
vaajnchhasyachiraadyadi vishhnutvam   
In me, in you and in everything, none but the same Vishnu dwells. Your anger  
and impatience is meaningless. If you wish to attain the quality of Vishnu  
soon, have Sama Bhaava always.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says annamacharya clearly belongs to Advaita  
Vedanta tradition.His devotional song "Brahmee Vokkati.." clearly shows the  
advaita vedanta essence.In deep sleep everyone is same and there is no world   
Prasanth Jalasutram Commentary: These days our generation are seeking instant results.because we have instant  
coffee,ATMs,microwaves etc we are becoming impatient these days and seeking  
instant results.   
Our companion which is there always with us is mind only.Even our  
wife,children are all relative and will not be with us always.   
TEXT 26   
shatrau mitre putre bandhau   
maa kuru yatnam vigrahasandhau   
sarvasminnapi pashyaatmaanam   
sarvatrotsrija bhedaagyaanam   
Do not waste your efforts to win the love of or to fight against friend and  
foe, children and relatives. See yourself in everyone and give up all feelings  
of duality completely.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says our love,hatred in our friends and  
enemies are there in our mind only and not in them.   
He says it is suggested to live in friendship with everyone in life but not to  
select few friends.   
He says enemies are 2 types   
a) sahetika (who are enemies with reason)   
b) nirhetika enemies (who are enemies without reason maybe because of  
jealousy)   
He says dvaitam means agnanam(ignorance).   
He says whenever we are idle and have no work then try to do japa,imagine so  
that mind will not sit idle.   
Otherwise   
TEXT 27   
kaamam krodham lobham moham   
tyaktvaa atmaanam bhaavaya ko aham   
aatmagyaana vihiinaa muudhaah   
te pachyante narakaniguudhaah   
Give up lust, anger, infatuation, and greed. Ponder over your real nature.  
Fools are they who are blind to the Self. Cast into hell they suffer there  
endlessly.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says We will get angry with one who does not  
agree with our desires.   
Example: In our childhood we used to get angry with our father/mother who does  
not agree when we say that i want to go to movie.   
Similarly mother-in-law will be angry with daughter-in-law because she wants  
love of our son to continue which got discontinued once her son got married.   
He suggests to renounce kama,krodha,anger and be happy.   
TEXT 28   
geyam giitaa naama sahasram   
dhyeyam shriipati ruupamajasram   
neyam sajjana sange chittam   
deyam diinajanaaya cha vittam   
Regularly recite from the Bhagavad-Gita, meditate on Vishnu in your heart, and  
chant His thousand glories. Take delight to be with the noble and the holy.  
Distribute your wealth in charity to the poor and the needy.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says   
"   
nadi(river) loo prayanam chesee vadiki kavali yeeta   
jivita prayanam chesee vadiki kavali gita   
"   
Money if donated for devotional purposes is good.that is the reason why  
lakshmi devi is shown trying to press gently legs of lord vishnu.   
Essence is lakshmi devi(money) is also dependent on lord vishnu who is sitting  
in adi shesha.   
TEXT 29   
sukhatah kriyate raamaabhogah   
pashchaaddhanta shariire rogah   
yadyapi loke maranam sharanam   
tadapi na mujnchati paapaacharanam   
He who yields to lust for pleasure leaves his body a prey to disease. Though  
death brings an end to everything, man does not give up the sinful path.   
TEXT 30   
arthamanartham bhaavaya nityam   
naastitatah sukhaleshah satyam   
putraadapi dhana bhaajaam bhiitih   
sarvatraishhaa vihiaa riitih   
Wealth is not welfare, truly there is no joy in it. Reflect thus at all times.  
A rich man fears even his own son. This is the way of wealth everywhere.   
Note: This is my wife's favourite verse.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Even kamsa in Mahabharata has jailed  
his father Ugrasena.   
TEXT 31   
praanaayaamam pratyaahaaram   
nityaanitya vivekavichaaram   
jaapyasameta samaadhividhaanam   
kurvavadhaanam mahadavadhaanam   
Regulate the pranas (life airs within), remain unaffected by external  
influences and discriminate between the real and the fleeting. Chant the holy  
name of God and silence the turbulent mind. Perform these with care, with  
extreme care.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says praanaayaamam is helpful for the  
longevity of the body but it should not be the only aim of our life.   
pratyaahaaram means as said in bhagavad gita we need to withdraw our senses  
from sense objects just as turtoise draws its limbs from its shell.   
TEXT 32   
gurucharanaambuja nirbhara bhakatah   
samsaaraadachiraadbhava muktah   
sendriyamaanasa niyamaadevam   
drakshyasi nija hridayastham devam   
Oh devotee of the lotus feet of the Guru! May thou be soon free from Samsara.  
Through disciplined senses and controlled mind, thou shalt come to experience  
the indwelling Lord of your heart!   
TEXT 33   
muudhah kashchana vaiyaakarano   
dukrijnkaranaadhyayana dhurinah   
shriimachchhamkara bhagavachchhishhyai   
bodhita aasichchhodhitakaranah   
Thus was a silly grammarian lost in rules cleansed of his narrow vision and  
shown the Light by Shankara's apostles.   
TEXT 34   
bhajagovindam bhajagovindam   
govindam bhajamuudhamate   
naamasmaranaadanyamupaayam   
nahi pashyaamo bhavatarane   
Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, Oh fool! Other than  
chanting the Lord's names, there is no other way to cross the life's ocean.

Karma will not confer liberation and this has been said by   
Bhagavan in Verse 1 of Upadesa Undiyar. On the contrary   
good and bad karmas will sow the seeds for further actions   
and shall never confer liberation, He says in Verse 2 of Upadesa   
Undiyar.   
Sat-sangham. Many times He has said that the true Sat Sangh is   
being with Sat. However He approved Sat Sangh with Jivan Muktas,   
vide Verse 1 of ULLadu Narpadu, Supplement. He again talks about Sadhus in  
Verse 3 and 4. A sincere company with true Sadhus, will help one more than  
all niyama and nitya karmas. The body heat will come down with the cool moon  
rays, poverty will   
go away with acquisition of Karpaga Tree and Ganga will wash away the sins.  
But a sincere devoted company with true Sadhu will do   
all these in one go. Body heat here also means the tapatraya.   
Arunachala Siva.
