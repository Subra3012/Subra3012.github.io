If we posit in the source of the mind,there is an experience of absence of  
mind(naiva manasam).   
All thoughts are welcome.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Many singers and great poets have become dumbfounded in the   
presence of Bhagavan Ramana. Not because they are afraid.   
They only become choked with emotions. They could not sing   
or read their poems. It is like lighting a candle before the Sun.   
However, Bhagavan Ramana encouraged them all. He told   
Sampurnamma: Even if you do not understand head or tail, it   
does not matter, please read Ribhu Gita. Muruganar, the great   
poet (he was a Tamil teacher) came with a poem before Bhagavan   
Ramana when he came for the first time. It was Desika Padigam   
in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. Muruganar could not read even   
one line properly. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye, please give that   
paper to me." And then He read the poem written on Himself by   
Muruganar.   
Many great Tamil pandits cannot read the first Benedictory Verse   
of ULLadu Narpadu in one stretch without getting stuck. The words   
are closely packed and reading is very difficult. Understanding it   
is much more difficult.   
There is also one story about Professional Wailers. About this   
later....   
Arunachala Siva.
