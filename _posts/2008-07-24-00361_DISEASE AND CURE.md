## Aids to self-realization and Who am I?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 24, 2008, 08:21:36 AM  
---  
Bhagavan prescribes many aids to self-realization in Who am I?   
He says that since all books say only control of mind as a final truth,   
there is no use in reading books endlessly. Since the Self is within   
five sheaths, it is futile to search it in books. But in our lives, we   
are quite different. From the younger days, we start with romantic,   
crime and science fiction. Then we read stuff like Camus, Kafka and   
Sartre. The we move to Western philosphy and try to understand   
Kant, Spinoza, Hegel and Nietzsche. At that stage we come to Indian   
philosophy and read J Krishnamurthi, Osho, Zen teachers like   
Watts, Humphreys and Dr. Suzuki. Finally we arrive at Sankara and   
Bhagavan. Even here we go on reading many many books by Sankara and on  
Bhagavan. Perhaps with Guru's grace, we shall end all these and   
sit in Silence, when even books of Ramana may not interest us.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Rama Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 24, 2008, 08:31:31 AM  
---  
Rama Gita is a chapter in Adhyatma Ramayana, which embodies   
advaita principles, as a dilalogue between Rama and Lakshmana.   
While Jnana Vashishta is a dialogue between Sage Vasishta and   
Rama, this one is what Rama preached to Lakshmana. This is of   
62 verses and this has been translated by a monk of Ramakrishna   
Order, in 1908. A sample,   
Verse 16:- "Knowledge and action being very contrary in result,   
cannot be together; the wise should therefore entirely renounce   
action and always keeping aloof from the objects of senses, should   
contemplate on the Self."   
Verse 20:- Avidya once annhilated by secondless and pure theology,   
will not be born again. If Aviday will not appear again, how can the   
understanding 'I do this' appear? The independent knowledge   
therefore does not want any help, and is singly adopted to procure   
perfection."   
Verse 32:- " The three fold state of the intellect of three qualities,   
caused by dream etc., also seem to be in the Self. But as they ae   
opposed to one another, consequently they are simply false   
representation in the Supreme, which is Absolute-Knowledge-Bliss,   
and All Pervading."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[1] Tamil

My dear non duel, Your request for clarification of certain   
Tamil words.   
Sri is literally one full of riches and virtues. It is used as a   
word of respect to each other, but is more meaningful than   
Mister. It also means 'Honourable'.   
Pranams or Namaskarams mean literally obeisances. This   
is used again towards elders and gurus. The elders and   
gurus use the word Aasirvadham which means best wishes   
and blessings.   
Namaste is the word like Greetings. It also means namaskrams   
or pranams. But this is used when one sees another person.   
Ji is a appendix after the personal noun or name to indicate   
respect. It is like saying: Non duel, sir !   
All these words are either Sanskrit or Hindi words which are   
freely used in Tamil and other Indian languages also. If you want   
classic Tamil words, which are not invariably used are: Pranams / Namaste - Vanakkam   
Ji - 'avargal'   
Sri - 'Thiru' '   
We can use to address Bhagavan as: Bhagavan Ramana, Vanakkam   
Bhagavan Ramana avargal   
Thiru Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
Infact, the Tamil word Tiruvannamalai means Thiru-Annamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[1] DISEASE AND CURE  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 27, 2008, 07:40:02 AM

Dear Sankar, Disease as Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi says is,   
dis-ease, that which makes you to lose your 'ease' or happiness.   
Not only bodily ailments, but even those which robs your happiness   
is disease. Our anger, hate, pain, anxiety, disappointment are all   
diseases. These diseases can be cured by the medicines like,   
patience against anger, love against hate, perseverancce against   
pain, courage against anxiety and being without any expectations   
against disappointment. These are again possible only with doing   
our duties and surrendering to the Guru. Or by 'vichara' or enquiry,   
asking within us: To whom are these anger, hate etc., It is for me.   
Who am I? I am not the mind which creates all these.   
Arunachala Siva.

Getting entangled in the imaginations o the mind is disease.   
Positing oueselves in the reality i.e our "self"which is the space or base   
for appearence and disappearence of the mind and the world is the cure.

Dear Subramanian.R   
I'm not sure I see the mind as the villain here but the ego, But not the  
function of the ego which includes mind and body thought. Can the mind be said  
to be bad, can reason and intellect be bad? How can we know the world without  
the use of mind? Its the false identification with the ego with the body and  
mind that is where we find the problems.

Dear kde, the mind and the ego are the branches of the   
same organic tree. In fact, there are 4 things as books   
on Advaita state: The mind, the ego, the intellect, and   
the mind-stuff (chit). The mind is necessary for knowing   
things about Bhagavan Ramana, but if this mind is in the   
path of self-enquiry, then it is suddha-manas or Pure Mind,   
which is helpful not only for reading books but also for   
all worldly activities.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, Suddha manas or Pure Mind is like a mirror where   
one can see the reflection of the objects kept in front of it.   
Viveka Choodamani says that suddha manas is necessary   
for the seekers and jnanis to do work in this world without the sense   
of doership. Bhagavan says it is like a burnt rope! It just is there,   
but does not do anything that we ordinary mortals do!   
Arunachala Siva.
