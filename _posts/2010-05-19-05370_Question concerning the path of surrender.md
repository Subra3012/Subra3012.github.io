With self-enquiry we develop the capacity to "be"which is eternal.   
All thoughts are welcome.

## self-enquiry-Transformation

In self-enquiry there is no attempt to change what we are by thought.   
The awareness in self-enquiry transforms what we are.   
All thoughts are welcome.

## Question concerning the path of surrender

Sri Bhagavan said that self-enquiry and surrender are the only two ways for  
realization. Now, when people asked what should they do when doubts, fears and  
desires arise, Sri Bhagavan replied "see who is it that all these arise to".  
These were (I assume) people who were on the path of jnana. But how should one  
who is taking the path of surrender proceed when doubts, fears and desires  
arise.

Japo Garu,   
Throw all burden on God and be happy.   
Bhagavan ramana clearly tells us in 'Nan Yaar PARAGRAPH THIRTEEN'   
Being completely absorbed in atma-nishtha [self-abidance, the state of just  
being as we really are],giving not even the slightest room to the rising of  
any thought other than atma-chintana selfcontemplation,the 'thought' of our  
own real self], is giving ourself to God. Even though we place whatever amount  
of burden upon God, that entire amount he will bear. _Since one paramesvara  
sakti [supreme power of God] is driving all activities [that is, since it is  
causing and controlling everything that happens in this world], why should we  
always think, 'it is necessary [for me] to act in this way; it is necessary  
[for me] to act in that way', instead of being [calm, peaceful and happy]  
having yielded [ourself together with our entire burden] to that [supreme  
controlling power]?_ **Though we know that the train is carrying all the  
burdens, why should we who travel in it suffer by carrying our small luggage  
on our head instead of leaving it placed on that [train]?**

What Bhagavan said in Who am I? paragraph 13 and what   
prasanth said in his post is the correct answer.   
The surrender is a total process where the ego is killed. In   
Atma Vichara also, the ego is eventually killed. Both are the   
same. Apparently, for many seekers, it would appear that surrender   
is easy. IT IS NOT SO. Total surrender to god or guru which is   
Self-surrender is the same as Atma Vichara and is not less difficult   
than the other one.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks, I like these replies. I found a nice quote regarding this question.   
"If one surrenders oneself there will be no one to ask questions or to be  
thought of."   
(From Be as You Are)

as i see it surrender is not a path at all, it is a stepping off the path,   
stopping.   
surrender is easy as it requires no effort. it is the following of paths with  
the expectation of getting somewhere or something that takes great effort. a  
path can be usefull in that after travelling what is believed to be a path  
that will give you something in the future you become dissillusioned and  
realize you will never find what you are searching for and in this there comes  
a surrender. following a path is actually an avoidance of the fear of  
surrender that must be experienced to surrender. the ego does not have to be  
killed because truth includes even this. ego is simply the mind. in  
surrender the ego is still there but not identified with. there is only one  
real surrender. .. the surrender to the truth of who you really are. it takes  
less than an instant to surrender, but the WILLINGNESS to bear the pain and  
experience the fear without supressing or expressing it, even when you are on  
a cross and god himself has forsaken you, is required.

Actually, or rather paradoxically, to Not Question is the only sadhana  
required to practice the path of Surrender   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Japo,   
You say surrender is easy and requires no effort. It is not correct.   
The surrender, I mean, the total surrender, is as difficult as   
self enquiry. You again say, there is no need for effort. But   
to be in effort-free surrender, is difficult. It requires all efforts   
to be effortless. The total surrender has to be achieved with efforts   
to attain that state. Because we are always thoughts-bound   
and we make all sorts of efforts. Partial surrender, which we always do, is  
somewhat easy. But total surrender is not.   
Arunachala Siva.
