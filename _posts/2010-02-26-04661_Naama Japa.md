As advised by Nanasaheb Chandorkar his wife used to do Naam-Jap regularly.  
Once when She was sitting near Sai Baba in Shirdi, He said, "My mother you  
grind a lot of grains, but the outcome is useless."   
Sai Baba was referring to the chanting or remembrance of God's name in a  
mechanical way. When the name is chanted, sung or remembered, it should have  
the feeling of love, bhava, with it. When we call our near and dear ones,  
there is an element of love in that, when we call a complete stranger on the  
road it is different,than a mother calls her little child. So the name of God,  
chanted or remembered, without any love or feeling is useless.   
Baba (Shirdi Sai Baba) jokingly used to say to Nana, "Nana, amongst all these  
people, there is not even a single swan? There are just crows!"   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Very good. Chanting God's name mechanically is a waste of time. It will simply  
fill the mind with thoughts.   
But chanting God's name with deep devotion has quite a different effect.   
It was possibly Sri Ramakrishna who said: Looking at a still pond there does not seem to be any life in it.   
But sprinkling some puffed rice in the pond we see fishes coming out suddenly  
from within.   
Same with Nama which acts like a puffed rice which will bring out the "fishes"  
from within out heart.
