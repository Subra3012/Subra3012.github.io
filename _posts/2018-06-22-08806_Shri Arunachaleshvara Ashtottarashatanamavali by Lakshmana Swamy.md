**In Praise of Japa**   
https://vedanta.org/2010/monthly-readings/in-praise-of-japa/   
By William Page   
William Page retired from teaching English at Thammasat University in Bankok.  
He has associated with the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in Boston since 1960  
and is a member of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society of Thailand. This article  
was published in the Fall 2009 issue of American Vedantist, and it is  
reproduced here by permission of American Vedantist.   
Japa is one of the main spiritual practices of the Ramakrishna movement.  
Combined with prayer and meditation, it forms a triangle?a three-fold method  
of reaching out for God, establishing him within, and keeping him there.   
Prayer is simply the act of talking to God. The words can be spoken aloud,  
whispered, or uttered mentally. They reach out to God and invite him to come  
down and take his seat upon the lotus of the heart.   
Once he?s there, we begin to do japa and meditate. Japa is the continuous,  
silent repetition of a very short prayer or invocation called a mantra. It  
can be done on its own or in conjunction with meditation. Meditation is the  
act of visualizing God within us. Together, these two practices establish God  
within us and enable us to feel his presence.   
In the intervals between meditation sessions, we usually get preoccupied with  
our daily work. If God gets restless at being neglected and seems inclined to  
leave his seat, we can bring him back by doing japa.   
So prayer draws the Lord from the heavens to the heart, japa and meditation  
establish him on his throne within, and japa keeps him there. Of course, his  
grace is also necessary. Without it, nothing happens.   
Do It Now   
Prayer and meditation require our full attention, but one of the advantages of  
japa is that you can do other things at the same time. Holy Mother, who was  
famous for doing prodigious amounts of japa, undoubtedly did much of it while  
busy with her household chores?husking paddy, sweeping and scrubbing the  
floor, washing and cutting vegetables.   
It?s also a good way to shut down the endless chatter of the mind. We often  
find our thoughts wandering. Japa pulls them back and gives them focus. It?s  
like a thread that ties the mind to the lotus feet of the Lord; it reminds us  
always to pay attention to him.   
Sri Ramakrishna taught a variety of spiritual practices, but Swami Brahmananda  
and Holy Mother placed special emphasis on japa. If you study their  
teachings, you?ll find that they constantly emphasized the necessity of doing  
it, and especially at fixed times in the morning and evening.   
The fixed times establish the habit. Once you get used to doing it at certain  
times, you get restless to do it when those times come. If you don?t do it,  
you feel guilty. In fact, guilt feelings are common among devotees who skip  
doing their japa. If you don?t want to feel guilty, better not skip it!   
A common complaint among beginners is that they don?t feel any results. Swami  
Brahmananda constantly had to reassure his disciples that if they didn?t feel  
any results in the beginning, they would feel them later on. Perseverance is  
the key. In fact, he told one disciple, ?Follow some spiritual discipline for  
at least three years, and then, if you find you have made no tangible  
progress, you may come back and slap my face!? (Swami Prabhavananda, The  
Eternal Companion, Vedanta Press, Hollywood, 1947; p. 129.)   
Vicarious Japa: A Gift from Holy Mother   
Holy Mother said that some of her disciples were incapable of doing much japa,  
so she did it for them. In her old age, when her attendant noticed that she  
was doing japa even in bed, she asked, ?What can I do, my son? The boys come  
and entreat me eagerly. They take the mantra and go home. But nobody does  
any japa regularly. Some don?t do it even once. Yet as I have shouldered the  
burden, should I not look after them? That?s why I do japa and pray to the  
Master, ?O Master, grant them enlightenment, grant them emancipation, and do  
you take on yourself their care in every way here and hereafter!?? (Swami  
Gambhirananda, Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai,  
Fourth Edition, 1986; p. 397. See also Swami Nikhilananda, Sri Sarada Devi,  
The Holy Mother: Her Teachings and Conversations, Skylight Paths Publishing,  
Woodstock, Vermont, 2004; pp. 25-26.)   
I can imagine some people grumbling, ?Holy Mother made it too easy for her  
disciples. She spoiled them. How could they develop any character if she did  
everything for them??   
I can also imagine her giving a sharp reply: ?I am the Mother! Shall I not  
do everything for my children? As for their character, you don?t need to  
worry about it. I will take care of it.?   
Lazy guys like me envy Holy Mother?s disciples. What a soft deal they had!  
We don?t have the luxury of knowing that she?s doing japa for us. Some of us  
have to do three rounds of the rosary just to get started. Sometimes it takes  
that long just to drag the mind away from worldly thoughts and get it settled  
down. That?s especially true in the evening, after a day of being beaten up by  
the world.   
Coffee, Tea, or Japa?   
Early-morning japa, which is recommended most highly, is supposed to take hold  
quickly, because the mind is fresh and doesn?t have to wean itself away from  
worldly thoughts. But you have to make sure that you?re fully awake, or  
you?re likely to fall asleep.   
People like me, who need three cups of coffee just to wake up in the morning,  
are always relieved to read about a disciple of Holy Mother who told her that  
it was impossible for him to do japa before having his morning tea.  
Fortunately for us all, Holy Mother gave him permission to drink his tea  
first. (Gambhirananda, p. 410.)   
I have been quick to interpret this as permission to drink my three cups of  
coffee in the morning before trying to do anything that requires the slightest  
bit of intelligence. I console myself for this weakness by invoking the  
example of an eminent Tibetan lama, the late Kalu Rimpoche, who used to drink  
Tibetan tea while meditating.   
Don?t Mess with the Mantra   
Japa is sometimes difficult for Westerners, because the mantra is in Sanskrit,  
a language we?re unfamiliar with. I know an American devotee who once  
rebelled against his mantra. ?I?m tired of this Sanskrit gibberish,? he  
complained. ?I want an English mantra.? So, although he had been initiated  
by a perfectly well-qualified teacher, he made up an English mantra and  
started doing japa with it.   
At first it seemed new and fresh, and he was heartened by the results. The  
image of his Chosen Ideal glowed within him; it seemed to be cheering him on.  
Novelty is always exciting, and he expected to make rapid progress.   
But surprise, surprise! Novelty wears off pretty quickly unless there?s some  
substance behind it. Pretty soon, about halfway through his rosary, he began  
to nod off, and his old mantra started welling up from the depths of his mind.  
He stopped it, reimposed his English mantra, and succeeded for awhile; but the  
old Sanskrit mantra was stubborn, and kept resurfacing when he least expected  
it. No matter how much he resisted, it kept coming back. Eventually the  
image of the Chosen Ideal seemed to be grinning at him, and then he got the  
message.   
Finally he gave up and returned to his old mantra. ?There?s more to this  
mantra stuff than meets the eye,? he admitted. ?I guess you can?t keep a good  
mantra down.?   
But It?s Boring!   
The big complaint that most people make about japa is that it?s boring. Who  
wants to keep chanting the same old line? What a waste of time! What?s the  
point?   
The point, of course, is to recondition the mind. That?s what spiritual  
practice is all about: to recondition the mind so that it will become a fit  
place for the indwelling of the Lord. But our minds are restless, and scream  
for more exciting fare. This is especially true in our switched-on era, when  
cyberspace is crackling with high-tech entertainment. Who wants to pray when  
you can google? Who wants to chant when you can twitter?   
If we?re serious about spiritual life, we have to shut down the computer and  
dig out the old rosary. Swami Brahmananda?s remark that his disciples could  
come back and slap his face if they didn?t feel any results within three years  
is something we ought always to keep in mind. He didn?t mean three years of  
just piddling around. He meant three years of persistent and intensive  
effort.   
Experience shows that if we keep working on our japa, it gradually takes hold.  
It stops being boring and eventually becomes sweet. The mantra becomes an old  
friend, something solid in the foundation of our minds, an anchor for our  
wayward thoughts. It can be a healing balm in times of grief, a refuge in  
times of trouble. It takes on a life of its own, and rises from our  
subconscious to greet us whenever we turn to it.   
It also becomes something very much like the default setting of the mind.  
When the mind wanders, the mantra often emerges spontaneously. We find it  
resounding within us without making any effort. All we have to do is listen.   
In fact, this may be one answer to the famous Zen koan, ?Who is it that  
recites the Buddha?s name?? When we become established in japa, the Buddha?s  
name recites itself.
