## ULLadu Narpadu - 194

Regarding the buddhi vyabara [intellectual activity] David Godman   
cites the following entry Talks. No. 197: Question: We try to meditate, but there is no progress in our   
meditation. We do not understand how to realize. Can you kindly   
help us towards realization?   
Bhagavan: How do you meditate?   
Question: I begin to ask myself 'Who am I?', eliminate the body   
as not 'I', the breath as not 'I', the mind as not 'I' and I am not   
able to proceed further.   
Bhagavan: Well, that is so far as the intellect goes. Your process is only  
intellectual. Indeed, all the scriptures mention the process   
only to guide the seeker to know the truth. The truth cannot be   
directly pointed out. Hence this intellectual process.   
You see, the one who eliminates all the 'not I' cannot eliminate the 'I'. To  
say 'I am not this' or 'I am not that' there must be the 'I'. This 'I' is  
only the ego or the 'I'-thought. After rising up of this 'I'-thought, all  
other thoughts arise. The 'I' thought is therefore the root-thought. If the  
root is not pulled out all others are at the same time uprooted. Therefore  
see the root 'I', question yourself 'Who am I?'; find out its source. Then  
all these will vanish and the pure Self will remain ever.   
860: The divine Padam says: Desiring something, [imagining it]   
to be wonderful, is the conduct of the ignorant ego-ghost.'   
Verse 2385: Those ignorant people who are itching with the desire for the  
illusory life are whirling in the life of cremation ground.   
Verse 884: Evil desire, a pit that can never be filed, is what plunges your  
life into poverty that can never be overcome.   
Further Muruganar talks about the necessity of serious sadhana   
and attitude towards sadhana: Verse 1551: In order that your mind should become firm, observe with full  
attention, your duty, which is the practice of sadhana.   
Verse 889: Instead of practicing sadhana, superficially, follow it intensively  
in such a way that your mind is totally immersed in it.   
Verse 172: Only the aspiration towards the fair firmament of supreme  
consciousness, which has no final goal other than Mauna, is most worthy  
endeavor.   
Verse 336: Grace will not combine with a bat-like mentality.   
Stick with intensity to one [path].   
Bats nibble at one fruit and fly away, looking for another fruit to nibble at.  
They never stay long enough in one place to finish a single fruit.   
Verse 2635: All meditation practices are the means that enable the attainment  
of the strength of mind that is necessary for Atma Nishta.   
Talks No. 26 and 27 are as under:-   
Question: How is the mind to be eliminated or relative consciousness  
transcended?   
Bhagavan: The mind is by nature, restless. Begin liberating the   
mind from its restlessness. Give it peace. Make it free from distractions.  
Train it to look inward. Make this a habit. This is   
done by ignoring the external world and removing the obstacles   
to peace of mind.   
Question: How is restlessness removed from the mind?   
Bhagavan: External contacts - contacts with objects other than   
itself - make the mind restless. Loss of interest in non-Self,   
[Vairagya] is the first step. Then the habits of introspection and  
concentration follow. They are characterized by control of external senses,  
internal faculties, [samd,dama, etc.,] ending in Samadhi   
[undistracted mind].   
Question: How are they practiced?   
Bhagavan: An examination of the ephermeral nature of external   
phenomena leads to Vairagya. Hence enquiry [Vichara] is the first and  
foremost step to be taken. When Vichara continues automatically, it results  
in a contempt for wealth, fame, ease, pleasure, etc., The 'I' thought becomes  
clearer for inspection.

While in waking state, following the vichara, we say "I see this object, I  
experience this feeling.   
2nd step.... when we go to see who is this "I". we realise this "I" denotes  
the body, mind, and Budhi (which is called ego)   
3rd step..... this is false because all this 3 body...mind..budhi all are not  
permanent.   
4th step......then who is this "I".   
Can we call it the experiencer?   
Again if we want to name or identify, there comes mind. because without the  
mind's faculty nothing can be done   
but it is not our aim. Our true nature is being without mind.. That what  
Bhagavan showed us.   
At last in that process there is no body.....

Dear Ramanaduli,   
When you ask who is this 'I'? It is the enquirer. When this question   
leaves no answer and when the mind curls up into the Self, you   
become the experiencer. Here again, Bhagavan says that there   
is nothing like experiencer too. Because there is no duality. One   
remains as the Experience, Sat Chit Anandam. It that state could   
be permanent, then it is the Self Realization. If it remains only for   
a small time, then it is a glimpse of the Self. The first one is the   
Full Moon and the second one is the crescent moon.   
Arunachala Siva.
