Dear friends, I just wanted to ask something about security. Usually i am  
coming here from my phone,and recently,from few weeks back i noticed some  
strange things happening with it when i am on this site. Sometimes i cant  
post,or my phone just black out. And yestertay,i came through computer,log  
in,posted something,logged,and then saw that i am still on the site,my name  
was there. But,actualy i wasnt. So i changed my password,erased history and  
all. Did anyone had that problem and how to deal with it?

Dear Jewell,   
Better thing is to have the internet connection, with an outside cable  
operator, without through telephone.

Dear Sri Subramanian sir, I am aware of that,but it is easiest for me to go  
like that,it is a habit. But anyway,i had a problem with computer too,which is  
secure. Anyway,i just read that it is usual thing. Thank You for answering me.

I think it takes five minutes for it to display who all are using the site and  
five minutes to remove your name once you have logged out.

d: Password is not a good word   
cguru: Why?   
d: The name prompts you to pass that word, but actually you should not pass  
that word.   
cguru: Good catch
