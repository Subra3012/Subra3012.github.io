Verse 2: நீற்றாரு மேனியராய் நினைவார்தம் உள்ளத்தே   
 நிறைந்து தோன்றும்   
காற்றானைத் தீயானைக் கதிரானை மதியானைக்   
 கருப்ப றியலூர்க்   
கூற்றானை கூற்றுதைத்துக் கோல்வளையா ளவளோடுங்   
 கொகுடிக் கோயில்   
ஏற்றானை மனத்தினால் நினைந்தபோ தவர்நமக்   
 கினிய வாறே.   
When we think in our mind the god who is the air and appears filling the minds  
of those who think about him as one who has completely besmeared his person  
with the holy ash, who is the fire, who is the sun and the moon, who is Rudran  
who has the function of destruction having kicked the god of death. In the  
company of Uma who wears bangles of exquisite workmanship, who condescended to  
dwell in the Kokutikkōyil in Karuppaṟiyalūr. It is indescribable how sweet he  
is to us.   
Arunachala Siva.
