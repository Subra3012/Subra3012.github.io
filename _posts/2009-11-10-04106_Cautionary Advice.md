This board has been created at the request of a member.   
It is probably a good idea, but caution should be exercised when contacting  
strangers.   
Not everyone who visits forums, or attaches themselves to any faith structure  
is genuine or well-balanced.   
Please be careful.

This is to inform that we have created a Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi Satsang  
in Nova Friburgo RJ Brasil. We use material that we have received in 2007 from  
Ramanasraman. Our e-mail is mahabhutani@yahoo.com.br   
NamastÃª!
