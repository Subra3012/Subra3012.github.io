Samyama exemplifies object based meditation, for it strives to establish an  
identity. Prasamkhyana   
best represents the approach independent of object orientation. This  
meditation is characterized   
solely by Viveka Khyati, 'discriminative discernment'. The function of  
Prasamkhyana is to discriminate   
between the pristine nature of the Self (Purusha), and that of Prakriti, the  
very source of all material   
objects. The aim of the meditation is to stop the fluctuations of the mind  
(Chitta Vrtti Nirodha), and   
ultimately, to be free from the bonds of Prakriti. The YS clearly regards  
asamprajnata, as the superior   
of the two ways of meditation which does not rely on objects. (Yoga Sutra  
1.18).   
Sankara too favors meditation which goes beyond the limits of object  
identification: 'Thus the sage identifies himself, by stages, with the vital force that  
comprises everything. Then,   
withdrawing this all comprising vital force into the inner Self, he next  
attains the state of the witness,   
the transcendent Self that is described as 'not this, not this.'  
(Br.Up.Bhashya 4.2.4)   
Sankara accepts the striving to attain identity only as a preliminary stage of  
meditation.When this   
stage is abandoned, the meditator becomes a mere witness (drastr) to all  
associations. He exercises   
discriminative insight by negating (neti, neti) all which is other than the  
higher Self. Such meditation   
is a true reflection of the nature of the Self. which, in the absolute sense,  
can only be identified as   
'not this, not this'. To assist his students on the path of Self Realization,  
Sankara developed a process   
he calls Parisamkhyana, a meditation closely resembling the Prasamkhyana of  
the Yoga Sutra.   
Using this type of meditation as a model, Sankara establishes a new  
interpretation of Upasana.   
An analysis of the sacred utterance, Tat Tvam asi, becomes the basis of a  
meditative process which   
discriminates between Self and non Self, while reaffirming the essential  
unity of Atman and Brahman.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
