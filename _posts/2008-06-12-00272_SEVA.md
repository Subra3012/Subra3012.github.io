## Bhagavan Ramana and Sankara  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2008, 04:28:30 PM  
---  
When I read Sri Ramana Ashotra (hymn of 108 names of Bhagvan   
by Viswanatha Swami, describing His life), daily in the morning, I   
am not but able to compare Bhagavan Ramana, with Sankara. Sankara   
lost his father, Siva Guru, before he was six. Bhagavan Ramana also   
lost His father when He was about twelve. When Sankara went for   
begging food, one poor lady gave him a gooseberry fruit, Sankara   
made golden gooseberries rain in her home, through his famous   
Kanakadhara Stotram. When Bhagavan went for alms, one gentleman,   
who was playing cards on the portals of his house gave Him food, and he   
was blessed later with a famous Upadesa called Vichara Sangraham. He   
is none other than Gambiram Seshayyar. Sankara went to Kaladi, his   
village in Kerala, skyward, and gave salvation to his mother. But in   
the case of Bhagavan, since He was Unmoving, Arunachala, He made   
His mother come to Him. The poor lady came not once but 4 times and   
on the fourth occasion, after placing her on probation and removing   
all the false prides of caste, creed, and 'achara' and after removing   
all the knots of karma, He bestowed her salvation, with the merager   
of "i" with the Absolute. As in case of Jnana Sambandha, who had   
milk from Goddess Uma on the banks of a tank in Sirkali, Bhagavan   
was offered with the milk of Goddess Unnamualai in Tiruvannamalai   
temple through the temple priest! Arunachala Siva.

## Bhagavan Ramana and Sankara

When I read Sri Ramana Ashotra (Hymn of 108 names of Bhagavan   
by Viswanatha Swami, describing Bhagavan's life), daily in the morning,   
I am not but able to compare Bhagavan Ramana with Sankara. Sankara   
lost his father, when he was barely six years old and Bhagavan's father   
also passed away, when the boy was about twelve. When Sankara   
went for begging his food, he was offered a gooseberry fruit by a   
poor old day and Sankara sang the famous Kanakadhara Stotram, when   
golden gooseberries rained on her home. When Bhagavan went for alms,   
one gentleman who was playing cards on the portal of his house, offered   
food and he was later given the famous upadesa called Vichara Sangraham. He  
is none other than Gambiram Seshayyar. Sankara   
went skyward to Kaladi, his village in Kerala, and gave his mother   
salvation. But Ramana is Unmoving, Arunachala, and so, He made   
His mother come to her. The poor lady came not once but 4 times. On   
the fourth occasion, He made her to stay with her on probation. He   
first removed all her false prides of caste, creed and achara. He then   
removed her knots of karma and bestowed her salvation, with   
the merger of "I" with the Absolute. Again, as in the case of Jnana   
Sambandha, who got milk from the Goddess Uma, on the banks of a   
tank in Sirkali, Bhagavan was given the milk of Goddess Unnamulai   
in Tiruvannamalai temple, by the priest, when Bhagavan was   
staying in the temple precincts. Arunachala Siva.

"i" am 51 years old and have had two western "teachers". These teachers  
honored all the "Wisdom" teachings as do i. i have photos of the most recent  
Indian gurus,saints on my home altar. Though the photo of Ramana stuns this  
consciousness into that silent stillness as do his sayings put forth by David  
Godman, etc. & in "Thus Spake Ramana Maharshi". i consider "my" body a tube of  
flesh seemingly used by consciousness for reasons personally unknown, although  
Ramana, Nisargadatta,& Meher Baba give thorough explanations as to this  
seeming "play" of consciousness. i also see no difference between jnana or  
bhakti since both respected Yogas have helped this personal self in it's  
emptying and erasure. This said, i feel a present urge to stay at or near  
Aranachala for an extended period of time if not even possibly the rest of  
this dream life as did Ramana. i am not trying to escape an unpleasant life as  
i have always seemed to live a grace filled existence, mostly because of  
seeing solutions rather than problems and of course surrender in the personal  
sense has been key to a less ego filled life and therefore less suffering. i  
live in a small simple rental on a beautiful 5 acre fruit farm away from any  
city on the island of Maui in Hawaii and earn an average income. i would have  
to save some capital in order to stay an extended period, although i would be  
able to get there if there were possibilities of staying for seva. i am in  
exellent physical health and have always been called on first for seva since  
cooking and cleaning and any seva has always come natural to this "i".Please i  
would sweetly welcome any input or advice. Thank You, Namaste, knowone

You can definitely stay in Tiruvannamalai, for a lifetime, if Ramana   
Wills. As an initial one time expenditure, you may have to buy a   
small apartment, in Tiruvannamalai (You cannot stay for ever inside   
the Ashram), for Rs 0.50 million (approx. US$ 12000.00).   
2\. You may have to get acclimitized to the tropic weather -   
ranging between 35 to 45 degrees celsius.   
3\. You may have to get used to tropical South Indian rice food, hot   
but tasty and water which is not sensitized.   
3\. Clothing is your choice, but Indian cotton clothes are the best   
suited, no suits, overcoats, woolen sweaters and shoes.   
All these will happen to you, if there is Ramana's Will. In fact,   
I saw recently many many "foreigners" who are thoroughly   
enjoying the stay in that divine place. The touring westerners and   
staying westerners are increasing in numbers every day.   
Arunachala Siva.

To Arunachala Siva,   
 Thank you for your timely response! As i live on a tropical island i am a little acclimated to humid weather though not quite as humid as my many friends who have traveled to and lived in India have mentioned. As to hot or even Indian food i have enjoyed both for almost four decades.Concerning purchasing an apartment or some type of residence there do you personally know of any or know someone who does. i did contact Indiaproperty.com and got on there list, i believe i found them on a site about Arunachala. Also i was recently told of the Indian government confiscating property of foreign nationals? Do you know anything about that? i have in-joyed reading your other posts. When i do come to Arunachala, Ramana willing, it would be so nice to meet such knowledgeable persons as yourself. Thank You again, knowone

Dear knowone, as far as I know there is no Indian law, confiscating   
property bought by foreigners, but there is a need to get prior   
approval for any non-resident Indian to buy property in India. This   
is not difficult for any genuine NRI buyer. But, since Tiruvannamalai   
is attracting western seekers in large numbers, the property in   
Tiruvannamalai is sought after very much. This has given rise to a   
good number of unreliable agents who dupe the foreign nationals.   
Hence, one has to be very careful. Please seek the advices of   
Ramansramam, who can guide you, not through this Forum, but   
through their separate e mail address: ashram@ramana-maharshi.org.   
With best wishes, Arunachala Siva.

Hi!   
First off: I'm sorry that I'm replying to such an old topic, and by the  
following NO OFFENCE IS INTENDED AT ALL, I'm just trying to clarify, for  
myself, Ramana's teachings. Ramana Maharshi is the being i respect the most.   
Why wouldn't it be Ramana's will? And isn't it in 'conflict' (in lack of a  
better word) with Ramana simple, beautiful and direct teachings, to  
concentrate on matters not concerned with attaining liberation, such as  
believing that he have a will after his physical death, and that, if he had,  
that it would change future events? Or believing the opposite, that it isn't  
possible, as well?   
Again, this is not a criticism. I have only read "Who am I?", but I'm planing  
to print his collected works from sriramanamaharshi.org and to read it.   
May all have 'luck' in their path towards liberation!

Dear knowone,   
Why do you want to go to Arunachala ? Why dont you practise at your own place.  
In truth, there is really no place where Ramana is not there.   
If you are sincere and a devotee... you should rather spend time on prayer or  
Practise rather than changing your place of stay.   
Changing your place of stay wont change you the person. .. change the  
person... so that you can see Ramana's presence here and now - where ever you  
are.   
So, observe your thoughts and feelings and become independent of them, soon.   
Practise the rememberance of yourself as Self and get liberated. The Self is  
Ramana... it is nearer to you than anything else. Even your body is farther  
from you than Ramana.   
What a futile exercise it would be to try to go to an alien land and buy a  
house there, stay there etc. Stay where you are... and find Ramana there  
itself. .. he is there as much as here.   
This is my advice.   
Love!   
Silence
