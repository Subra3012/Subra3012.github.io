## Attend to the work for which you have come!

Bhagavan Ramana invariably used to tell devotees, Vandha   
Velaiyai Paar.... i.e Attend to the work for which you have come!   
We, human beings have all come here to this world, for the   
purpose of attaining salvation. That is the work for which we   
have come.   
Once a devotee was sleeping in the middle of the Old Hall.   
He would come promptly by 8 am and started dozing off, whether   
there were conversations or not. One attendant was annoyed   
by this. He went to him and woke him up. But he would doze   
off in another few minutes. The attendant again used to do   
his 'waking up'. Bhagavan Ramana saw this and told the attendant: Oye, He has been attending to the work for which he had come. You attend to  
your work for which you have come! Why are you troubling him?"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Oh, is it you?

One afternoon, an old widow, about 60 years old, came with a   
group of women into the Old Hall, prostrated to Bhagavan Ramana   
and stood for sometime. Bhagavan Ramana looked at her and   
exclaimed: "Oh, Is it you?" The old lady became very shy and   
simply rushed out of the Old Hall.   
Bhagavan then told the devotees: Do you know who she is?   
Her family and my family were living in Tiruchuzhi in the same   
house in two portions. I used to go into our kitchen and help   
my mother in some odd jobs in cooking. Amma used to say   
that this girl would be married to me! However, this girl's   
mother used to say: "O, How can I marry my daughter to this   
boy, who always wears a codpiece and help his mother in cooking   
like a female?"   
Bhagavan continued: "Thank God, I did not marry her. There was   
no marriage in my life. Otherwise, what would have happened to   
me now?"   
The devotees laughed heartily, about the hidden meaning in   
Bhagavan Ramana's words!   
Arunachala Siva.

## the difference in between. ....

What is the difference in between Humour and funny. Any way both raises from  
the mind? Is it not?   
I think, there must be learning and inner meaning in jnani's humour whereas  
ajnani's humour would creat some unpleasant situations.

Bhagavan Ramana's humour was quite subtle, invariably. His   
humour was not hurting anyone but at the same time making a   
point for correction.   
Once, too many incense sticks and dasangam were lighted in the   
Old Hall. As people who have gone to the Asramam noticed, the   
Old Hall is quite small and apart from Bhagavan's sofa, where He   
was always sitting or reclining, it can accommodate only about 30   
people. Since the smoke coming out of the incense sticks and dasangam were  
huge, Bhagavan Ramana who was sitting very close to them, was finding it  
difficult even to breathe. The smoke engulfed the whole Hall. Bhagavan  
Ramana was ostensibly irritated. He told the attendants: "See, here a living  
Swami is   
sitting and this Swami is not able to even breathe. Go and place all the  
sticks and dasangam to the Kallu Swami (the stone idol of   
Bhagavan, which had been installed in the front hall of Mother's   
Temple, with a stone sofa). The Kallu Swami will have no difficulty in  
breathing..Nor would it complain....Anyway, tomorrow you are all going to put  
garlands and light incense sticks only to that Kallu Swami."   
Everyone in the Hall burst into laughter. The attendant put out   
some of the incense sticks and dasangam, to reduce the volume of smoke. There  
was however, a prophetic line in Bhagavan Ramana's outburst. Yes. The living  
Swami attained Maha Nirvana and then only Kallu Swami remains today! But the  
Asramam authorities have seen to it, that there is no garland for Bhagavan  
Ramana's staute, nor incense sticks and dasangam are lighted.   
Arunachala Siva.
