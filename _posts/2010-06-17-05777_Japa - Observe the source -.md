## TAT TVAM ASI Japa - Observe the source ?  
Author: srkudai             Date: June 17, 2010, 08:35:28 AM

Today morning, I was doing my japa, when the thought "Ramana says observe from  
where this mantra arises" arose in me.   
I stopped japa for a moment, trying to understand what Ramana might mean!   
During japa, one is essentially supposed to keep the mind on the mantra.  
Everytime mind moves away from the mantra, one should bring it back to the  
mantra.   
But here, Ramana seems to be suggesting that one should keep the mind at the  
Heart! How can that be helpful?   
I thought for some time and then continued Japa : with my mind on the mantra  
itself, as usual.   
And then, I got some clarity. I thought, i should write about it here.   
Suppose I am repeating "OM", so there is "OM" gap "OM" gap "OM" gap. ..   
this is the ideal case. No other thought intervenes.   
Here, what is the source of OM ? What ever is there before OM. That is "void",  
"gap". .. Emptiness. .. or Pure Consciousness.   
hence, to remain with the source is to remain as Consciousness -- these gaps  
or voids are actually states of samadhi. states of no thought... when one is  
able to elongate these voids in between the mantra. .. one is able to remain  
thoughtless for a few moments... one is able to remain as pure consciousness  
in those moments.   
There are two interpretations of "thoughtlessness" here. One is that no  
thought is able to "deviate" our mind from the next mantra. The other is no  
thought is there at all. both are equally valid.   
ultimately, the aim of japa is to remain established in samadhi. The aim of  
samadhi is vasana skhaya [destruction of latent tendencies] and thus through  
repeated practice of samadhi a sadhaka [who knows the Truth if someone  
without self knowledge : sravana and manana does it, he may gain concentration  
but will continue to remain ignorant until the Truth is learnt. The mind is  
purified.] gains purity of mind and will be able to Remain established in  
Self.   
This practice is not different from Self inquiry, as I understand it.   
Intially one should practice japa with shorter gaps... infact, that is the  
only way one can do it, remaining as Self between two mantras and during the  
whole repetitions.... as one gains in practice, one can increase the gaps...  
and then finally remain without the mind running "automatically"   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
Very nice post..   
I would like to add further, some of my experiences, after such an enquiry as  
to where from the sound originates, the need to utter the mantra, naama or Om,  
ends invariably. what is left thereon is simple awareness, we could simply  
say, an awareness of blankness! "I am" feeling. Just I am !   
After a while, this awareness turns its attention on that which is in  
movement, begins to simply observe the breath in and breath out and then the  
only other thing there is awareness about is the heart beats.   
At this stage, I find myself, that in no way could I stop the perception of my  
own heartbeats and the movement of prana. There is tremendous relaxation, the  
breath is normalised. The movement of body gets reduced, as in there is no  
more any need to move the body for any purpose. the only purpose for which the  
muscles seem to move is intake and outake of air and heart beat.   
On further observationm, may be voluntarily or involuntarily, the breath in  
and out frequency reduces drastically i.e. in a minute(vague idea), of an  
average of only about 4 - 6 breaths.   
Therefore, even further, I feel, it is essential to enquire where form the  
sounds of heart beats is originating and where from is the need to breath air  
in and out is originating. It is so very subtle, I have not been able to go in  
further.   
and then, due to the pull of Vasanas, after some time, slowly the awareness  
begins to move back to the world. Prarabdha   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Excellent!   
This is how we can help each other. ..   
From your post, I got something interesting. The heart beat also originates  
from "the same Emptiness" or Pure Consciousness.   
Breath too.   
So all these discontinuous entities, breath, heartbeat, or anything. .. all  
mithya is discontinuous, with intervening Samadhi!   
To merge in that beingness or Consciousness is Samadhi.   
Yes, invariably after some time, the need for japa ends.   
Samadhi is for the purpose of purification of mind too. So its good that you  
are back to the world to see how not to get identified with these  
discontinuous events and remain in samadhi while there are thoughts also !!   
So its said about siva. .. yatra yatra mano yati tatra tatra samadhih. ..  
wherever mind goes there is Samadhi!   
Love!

Quote  
Yes, invariably after some time, the need for japa ends.  
I somehow donot agree with the above statement.   
Where is the need for stopping japa?   
Does not waves belong to ocean? Will the ocean loses its identity even though  
waves come and go?   
So here japa relates to waves and our real nature 'I am' relates to ocean.   
Moreover However hard we may try it is not possible for us to give up japa  
though as said earlier there is no need at all to think that invariably after  
some time, the need for japa ends.   
 **Few examples in bhagavan 's life**   
1) After Bhagavan's mother Mahanirvana **that entire night passed in the  
singing of devotional songs.**   
2) "On the evening of 14 April 1950 At about 5 o'clock, Precisely at that  
moment devotees started chanting 'Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva'. **When  
Sri Ramana heard this his face lit up with radiant joy.**   
3) Bhagavan as known himself wrote many devotional songs in praise of  
arunachala siva like Arunachala Aksharamana Malai, Appalam Song. ..   
4) The daily routine at Skandashram was subject to strict regulation.At four  
o'clock in the morning Alagammal would rise and sing devotional songs, while  
the other community members meditated.Then Akshara Mana Malai (The Marital  
Garland of Letters) was recited.   
5) At five in the afternoon in ramana ashramam music begins from the radio in  
the hall. The songs of Tyagaraja, the poet, singer-bhakta, siddha, can be  
heard with enjoyment. **The Sage is a lover of the fine arts. He is an  
aesthete who can appreciate the sweetness of music.**   
6) Devaraja Mudaliar says,When touching songs were recited or read out before  
him, or when he himself was reading out to us poems or passages from the lives  
or works of famous saints, he would be moved to tears and would find it  
impossible to restrain them.   
7) Bhagavan's famous devotee murugunar wrote many songs in praise of bhagavan.   
 **Moreover Adi sankara himself has wrote N number of stotras in praise of  
many gods.**

Sometimes when i am very peaceful, even to sing song of God would be a burden.  
why sing a song of god when i am already filled with god within and without?   
same here.   
when there is so much absorption already, japa becomes a burden. one would not  
anymore feel like doing japa.   
yes, one might say, i shall continue japa, how can it be a burden and continue  
action! that too is possible.

Dear I,   
Where is butter to be found in Curd? is not butter found in Curd itself after  
Kaivalyam? The need for Japa ends involuntarily, there is already ajapa japa  
in the form of silence, Mauna. Therefore Japa does not really end actually. Is  
not Silence, Mauna a japa? can there be a Japa better than Mauna?   
Thats the Kaivalyam, we begin by mentally doing Nama Japa, Pranava Japa,  
etc... and then just like how butter is removed from Curd, that silence is  
arrived at, that Navaneta, that shuddha Spatika. that silence or blankness is  
the real ajapa japa.

Dear Udai ji,   
How it is possible yatra yatra mono.... when the mind becomes alive there  
would be virthi. In my understanding there should not be mind. For having no  
mind's activities japa, puja, vrath, sitting at Guru's feet or attending  
satsang can help us. But the aim is mind should be disolved in our practices.  
Mind will be there but i.e. never mind stage. This is how my mind understood.

Japa or Self-Enquiry becomes very effective when prior to commencing them, the  
mind is filled with the devotional mood, the "I" which keeps its hood raised  
is brought down to the ground level of humility. The devotion and humility  
clears away the obstacles and during Japa, the heart space opens up and one  
feels the inner bliss.   
It is better to do Japa slowly keeping the awareness in the cavity of the  
heart rather than crowding the mind with words.   
Doing Japa during the early morning is very effective. When practiced day  
after day, a part of the mind always remains in the heart space and the anahat  
may start for some devotees.   
A blissful space gets opened up within which is such that excitement, anger  
etc does not much leave marks on the mind. A person feels real contentment.  
When in very disturbing conditions or health problems, the mind gets  
disturbed, when the disturbing influence is over, the mind clouds easily  
vanish within the inner space without leaving a mark.   
When bliss is felt within the inner space, one will no longer like to read  
books. One would more like to sit quietly rather than read books. Because the  
greatest treasure within the heart has started unfolding.

Dear Amiatall ji,   
You said, "I noticed something.. " which "I" you mentioned. Because my  
understanding is... when we experience something or watching the mind etc.  
etc. we need mind..   
In the same way the gap also can be watched the mind is not it.   
I hope you would clarify this doubt of mine. I have been struggling to find  
out this answer.

Japa starts as a sound-producing Japa to begin with. Then it becomes   
silent Japa without any sound from lips. It is then Ajapa japa. Here   
you are closer to the Source. When this also subsides totally, there   
is only Silence, no Japa, no Ajapa, only Silence that passeth understanding.  
The mind, then can curl up into the Self.   
Saint Manikkavachagar says: It is the state of seeing without seeing   
and thinking without thinking, in Tiruvachakam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Amiatall ji   
I am also very poor in english as well as in this Atma vichara path. But my  
mind found this path is the correct one.   
When I read Bhagavan's teachings my clouded mind gets free for time being.  
Bhagavan explained reapeated clearly that much I can understand. But when I  
keep His book down and get into the worldly matters everything goes in the  
wind. Of course this forum also helps me lots and lots. There are many seniors  
members who understood very well and explains well also. When I sit alone and  
introspect me at first I can see my mind, then I watch the mind, during my  
puja and mantra. I can say what happened. I try to go to source. . Then I do  
not know who watches whom.... Everything becomes confuse. Then I read some  
saints life stories then I tell my self Bhagavan whatever I am doing, you are  
watching please guide me.   
When I read the posts... they say some gap in between mantra and you also  
accepted. . Here I want to know who is the seer to see the gap. That is all.  
Because I do not find any gap. But I read the gap only leads us to silence  
which is our true nature i.e. self.   
I cannot go to the source that is the main problem. I think this forum acts  
like a study group that is all.   
The soul which can reach to the source may help to fellow souls. This is  
reason I asked you.   
Thank you,   
Ramanaduli

Self enquiry itself is fixing the mind at its source (which is also the source  
of the sound of the mantra).   
"To ask the mind to kill itself is like making the thief the policeman. He  
will go with you and pretend to catch the thief, but nothing will be gained.  
**So you must turn inward, and see from whence the mind rises and then it will  
cease to exist.** "   
Breath and mind arise from the same source and when one of them is controlled  
the other is also controlled. As a matter of fact, in the **quest method   
which is more correctly `Whence am I? ' and not merely `Who am I?**'  we are  
not simply trying to eliminate, saying `We are not the body, nor the senses  
and so on', to reach what remains as the ultimate reality, but **we are trying  
to find out whence the `I-thought ' or the ego arises within us. The method  
contains within it, though implicitly and not expressly, the watching of the  
breath. When we watch wherefrom the `I-thought' arises, we are necessarily  
watching the source of breath also, as the `I-thought' and the breath arise  
from the same source**.
