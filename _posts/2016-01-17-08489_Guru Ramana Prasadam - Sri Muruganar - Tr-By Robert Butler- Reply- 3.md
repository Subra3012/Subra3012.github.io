52: When with the unerring arrow of His glance of true knowledge*, my Guru, the  
Supreme Lord, sundered   
the knot between my body and soul, and my mind, transformed into the supernal  
sky of His grace,   
became clear and radiant, the veiling deception of bitter worldly bondage  
disappeared, and the truth   
i then saw was my own self.**   
(* The Brahmasutra, the look of Jnana that never misses its mark'.   
Kanda unmai naanee: 'The truth I perceived was "I". This is an emendation  
of the original 1960   
version: kaivalyam kantathee... 'that which I perceived was final liberation'  
(Anubandham I.v. 17 of   
1960 edition.)   
119: Through the grace of my Master who saw how my mind was bewildered, how I had,  
through the   
delusion of taking myself to the ego, destroyed the integrity of Sivam that  
shines as reality itself,   
I gained the clear realization of the truth in which false knowledge is  
entirely obliterated, so that   
I plunged joyously into the union with that Sivam, the Self.   
127: Self Realization is the primal reality, the bliss of divine silence shining  
free of the ego, as my very   
own form. Through merging in the heart with the Lord of that true  
realization, the vile delusion   
of worldly bondage,the ideas of 'I' and 'mine', disappeared completely.   
268: Those in whose minds the grace of the Lord, whose glance dispels the darkness  
of ignorance, has   
sprung forth abundantly, freeing them from the bewilderment caused by  
delusion, will gain true   
understanding, as the 'I' shines as the real in the firmament of grace within  
the heart. This indeed   
is the perfection of the absolute.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
