## Question about reincarnation  
Author: Joey_               Date: May 02, 2010, 09:40:04 AM

There was a time when there was not a single being in this universe. Now there  
are trillions. Where have all these souls arisen from? Or have all these souls  
always existed?

Dear Joey,   
I am not an anthropologist. But I am telling you from what I have   
read. When the earth was formed, it was full of water. After a   
million years (Earth is about 3 billion years old), water receded in   
some sort of reverse-tsunami and earth-space formed. This earth   
space might have been quite wet. From wetness, unicellular creatures like  
amoeba, bacteria etc., which need no sex union with female, (but needed only  
moisture) were born. As per Darwinian theory, these little ones evolved into  
bigger creatures like cockroaches, spiders, frogs and such creatures.   
With further evolution, animal kingdom came up to Chimpanzee and   
Orang Otang from which man came. The sexual difference between   
a male and a female started from animal kingdom. So when men   
was formed, women were also formed. Their union gave birth to   
more men and women. Since a woman could give birth to at least   
16 children, the numbers grew non-linear manner. And today we   
end up with 7000 million.   
The highest evolution, in the form of citizens, kings etc., came about only  
since 8000 BC. Rama and Krishna were born, were ruling and   
were dead by 3000 BC. Even though Kali Yuga the present eon   
started about 1,42,500 years old, regular citizenry and royalty   
came only about 10000 years back. The humans multiplied and   
with them rivalry due to power, natural wealth (gold and then later   
money), coveting the opposite sex, multiplied and the sins also   
multiplied resulting in death and re-birth.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Joey,   
Similar question was asked to ramana maharshi and below is his answer.   
Quote  
Devotee: "For karma there must be a beginning, but how it began, no one has  
mentioned."   
Bhagavan: "Yes, but it is the same thing. If you are asked 'how did you get  
this?' you say you have got it by 'doing' (karma). How were you born? By  
'doing' (karma) that is all that could be said. If, however, you ask how was  
this karma born, you are told you should not ask such questions.   
**This is known as the Law of the seed and the tree (bija ankura nyayam). The  
tree is born of the seed; again from the tree a seed is born. Where is the  
origin of that seed? That is a question which you are told is not to be asked.  
What can we say to that? That is why I always ask people to find out first how  
they were born and where they were born. "**   
O Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all beings who are mounted upon the  
automation of this body, causing them by His illusive power to spin round  
according to their actions.   
\-- Gita XVIII: 61   
Seek refuge in Him alone, with all your being, O Arjuna! Through His grace,  
you shall obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode.   
\-- Gita XVIII: 62

the buddha said that samsara is endless..   
so how could it have a middle, a beginning, a end?   
maybe this helps also?

Dear Joey,   
There is only one Soul. When it expresses thru different matters or when the  
Single Soul manifests thru matter, the resultant beings falsely assume they  
are different and multiple entities. In our body trillion cells are born and  
die as a process. If you treat birth and death of different beings, as process  
within the Single Eternal Soul-Brahmam,at the absolute level you will admit  
there is neither creation nor dissoultion.It IS ;evolution and involution are  
on going mechanism within it.   
When we are established in Brhamam, we will know the absurdity of the queries  
raised at the level of individual soul/Jivas.

Dear arcsekar,   
You have given an excellent post about the theories of creation   
of multi-million living beings and their dissolution or involution.   
There is only one Soul or Brahman. It brings about multipllcity   
through Its Sakti (Mother or Maya in Hinduism.)   
Sri Abhirami Andati, which is composed by one Abhirami Bhattar   
says in his song: (He is a Sakta, so Sakti is the First Principle   
for him.): "You have been only One, but you blossomed into   
many. And you have spread out in this entire universe. You shall   
also leave them all and be just One at some time. This jugglery   
is only to Siva, your great husband!"   
Srimad Bhagavatam says: "I am one, let me become many."   
I think there is also a statement in Bible with the same meaning.   
Arunachala Siva.

when you say "souls" i suspect you are talking about bodies. there are many  
more bodies now than there were, it is true, but we are not the body. who  
we really are is that which is UNCHANGED before and after all the bodies come  
and go. stories of individual "souls" are just that. .. stories the mind  
tells, just as who we think we are is a story the mind tells. the universe  
is a thing that comes and goes WHITHIN that which is UNCHANGED, awareness  
itself, truth.

The individual manifestation is called Jiva, the mind-breath combination. The  
word individual soul is this. And this is used   
by many saints in Sanskrit and Tamil. There are no individual souls,   
in the absence of creation and dissolution. One another way of   
putting it, is that we are the reflections of the Self, the Unitary   
Principle. There are million pots with water filled in. There are   
million suns (reflections) inside the pots. There are only pots   
and water, which is the basis of reflections. The pot is body,   
the water is mind-breath. When the body is broken, the water is   
transferred to another pot.   
Arunachala Siva.

As I understand it the universe or more likely universes, are always being  
born, dying and reborn. No beginning to the process, and no end to it. But  
time and space exist within the Self anyway.   
It still feels like we need a first cause to it all, but can we find one...   
That just as I understand it, not real knowledge!

Dear kde,   
The universe is also the Self. The Self has no beginning and end.   
But universe as thought forms has a beginning and an end. Thoughts   
are the universe. It is like the reflection of the Sun on a water pot.   
When the water is drained out, where is the reflection? Water is   
the ego. When the ego is not there, there is no reflection but only   
the Real Self. The pot is the body. When pot is broken, for a   
Jnani it is videha kaivalyam, merger with Brahman, leaving the body. For an  
ignorant person, the water is not drained out, but the pot when it breaks,  
instantaneously, the water is transferred to a   
new pot. It is the rebirth, mind and prana with a new body.   
Arunachala Siva.
