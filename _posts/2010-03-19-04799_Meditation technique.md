## Meditation technique  
Author: chrisge87           Date: March 19, 2010, 06:56:16 AM

Hi, I'm new to this forum so please feel free to direct me to where this has  
already been discussed. It seems to me that Bhagavan recommended focusing on  
the right side of the chest in meditation and enquiring "who am I" or  
something similar (to keep it fresh and more effective now and then) when you  
find yourself getting too carried away by your thoughts and to bring you back  
to focusing on the spiritual heart.   
 I find that it is quite effective and I can bring my awareness to the feeling  
of blood being pumped to that area, my chest moving with the breath,  
occassional tingles and when grace comes my way there is a feeling that words  
don't do justice to. I do this for at least 30 mins in the morning and in the  
evening each day (although I wish there was a chance of sangha with a group of  
Bhagavan devotees here in Melbourne to help me be strong in my practise).   
 Can anyone add to or clarify this practise in any way? What sort of  
meditation practise do you maintain? Do you chant something to a picture of  
Bhagavan before you begin? Do you focus on the feeling of blood being pumped  
to the right side of the chest to begin with and/or the chest movement with  
the breath? I know it depends upon the person but what amount of meditation do  
you think you need to do to make a real difference to your level of equanimity  
and peace during the day? Do you have a spiritual community that allows you to  
practise the way you wish to without forcing you to adopt certain beliefs or  
gurus?   
 Thanks.

The exact practice depends from person to person so it is better to read the  
opinions of all and decide what suits you.   
Bhagavan said to find out where the "I" rises from. I feel that it is not  
worth while to search for "I" in any part of the body (right side of the chest  
etc.) but to take it from where exactly one feels it (which often cannot be  
exactly related to body) and abide as the space surrounding the "I". However  
the space surrounding the "I" does not open up unless one practises devotion  
and surrender to God. Devotion and surrender also mitigates the heaviness of  
chest and breath-entanglement problem which might occur during self enquiry.   
Om Shanti

Thank you for your answers. I am a bit of a daydreamer so I have some work to  
do before I can be constantly vigilant about asking "who feels this?" "to who  
are these thoughts coming to?" etc during all my waking hours but I understand  
that the goal is non verbal "attention/mind being held at itself actively". I  
feel this should start to be more present during my usual day when I can get  
my meditation more established.   
 I understand that there is no doer and I don't actually have free will  
anyway, but from the perspective of duality (which I obviously find myself  
faced with) I find that I still need to make an effort (as Arthur Osborne  
explains so well). This effort is in my story.   
 I recently returned from a 7 day Zen meditation retreat. They recommended  
constantly following the breath and repeating "listen!" after each breath. I  
found that the "listen!" became just mechanical after awhile and I began to  
think of Bhagavan and the things that he had said. He definitely told some  
people in the past to focus the attention on the right side of the chest but I  
completely understand what you are saying silentgreen. I have done vipassana  
meditiation in the past where they recommend focusing on some part of the body  
and the sensations found there so that the mind can be fixed on something in  
the present which opens one up to the possibility of transcending the mind to  
some degree. Until I can find a more appropriate place from whence the "I"  
arises I need something I can easily feel to focus on to bring me into and  
keep me in the present moment more firmly.   
 During the retreat, they rang a bell and asked people, when they truly  
listened, where they felt/heard it and almost everyone pointed to the chest.  
This made me think of Bhagavan's words, so I decided to go my own way with my  
meditation technique and found it more effective for me. In the past, I used  
to focus on the point between the eyebrows (Paramahansa Yogananda's technique)  
and found it hard to follow Bhagavan's advice about the chest, but now that  
I've had a break from this for some time I am experimenting with the chest. I  
wonder if visions and ecstactic states are more likely by focusing on the  
third eye?

Raja Yoga which includes Kriya Yoga is tough. And you remain still in   
duality. Try to practice devotion to your God or Guru and make the devotion   
ripen to surrender. This along with Atma Vichara is easier. Ayye adhi  
sulabham, anma viddhai.... Bhagavan Ramana said.

The following extracts have helped me to understand that as soon as I wake up  
in the morning my ego rushes out away from God.   
It is from The Path of Sri Ramana (Part Two) by Sri Sadhu Om.   
The extract is from Chapter 1. The World and God. Pages 14 and 15.   
It is only after the first person feeling I am a man has risen from sleep,  
that the world which is seen in front of us appears. The mind or man who sees  
this world then feels impelled to infer and accept the existence of an  
almighty God who is able to create this world, which is seen so vast and  
multivarious. That is, in the waking state, after the rising of the first  
person feeling I am so and so, which did not exist in sleep, everyone has to  
accept the existence of the other two entities, the world and God, which are  
second and third persons. The world and God are non-existent only when the  
first person feeling I am a man is non  existent, that is, in sleep and in  
the truly awakened state of Self knowledge. At such times no necessity arises  
to accept the world and God. This is a fact we can clearly understand from the  
following teachings of Sri Bhagavan: ...After an I rises, everything rises   
Ulladu Narpadu verse 23   
If the ego comes into existence, everything will come into existence. If the  
ego does not exist, everything will not exist. The ego itself is everything.   
Ulladu Narpadu verse 26   
If the thought I does not exist, no other things will exist.   
Sri Arunachala Ashtakam verse 7.   
It helped me to understand from the moment this first person (I) or ego rises  
it creates through thought, the world(second person) and God (third person).  
It is all in the mind. That is the case in the waking state. In the dream  
state the ego creates another world. Hence Waking is long and a dream is  
short.   
Bhagavan has told us how to get out of this state   
I have found extracts from the following books helpful: a) Who Am I ? (Nan Yar ?)   
The Teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
9\. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind?   
That which rises as I in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where  
in the body the thought I rises first, one would discover that it rises in  
the heart. That is the place of the minds origin. Even if one thinks  
constantly I I, one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that  
arise in the mind, the I thought is the first. It is only after the rise of  
this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first  
personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronoun appear; without  
the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.   
b) Ramana Maharshi: His Life   
A biography by Gabriele Ebert   
An extract taken from pages 128 and 129   
Sometimes devotees would not ask their questions orally, preferring to write  
them down on a slip of paper. Once a simple woman had written to him, I am  
not learned in the Scriptures and I find the method of Self-enquiry too hard  
for me. I am a woman with seven children and a lot of household cares, and it  
leaves me little time for meditation. I request Bhagavan to give me some  
simpler and easier method. Sri Ramana gave her the following practical  
advice, No learning or knowledge of Scriptures is necessary to know the Self,  
as no man requires a mirror to see himself. All knowledge is required only to  
be given up eventually as not-Self. Nor is household work or cares with  
children necessarily an obstacle. If you can do nothing more, at least  
continue saying I,I to yourself mentally all the time, as advised in Who am  
I?, whatever work you may be doing and whether you are sitting, standing or  
walking. I is the name of God. It is the first and greatest of all mantras.  
Even OM is second to it.   
In the 2 extracts here Bhagavan is telling us how to keep our attention on I  
which because it is close to God will lead us to God   
And with advice from some other members of this forum there is some detail on  
how to carry out the practise.   
For example in the post on The Essence and Practise by Sadhu Om: Know that a vichari (a person practicing Self-inquiry) who makes effort with  
the liking always to turn inwards to see the I with the inner eye, will not  
be able to experience the pure Self-consciousness merely by the process of  
sitting ma-jestically with closed eyes for a long period of time at one  
stretch.   
If at one single attempt you strive persistently for long hours without limit,  
to pull Selfwards and restrain the running mind without leaving your hold on  
Self-attention, you will find that you are not able to maintain a steady  
intensity of Self-attention. Therefore, after making one attempt for a few  
minutes, relax your effort for a while, and then again make a fresh attempt  
with renewed effort.

Dear paul,   
Yes, your approach is quite good. Bhagavan Ramana completes Ulladu   
Narpadu, Aganthai uru azhithale mukti, unar. Please experience that   
the ego's death is Experience.

The retreat was held by a rather unconventional American Rinzai Zen Master  
(who is head of the Buddhist Order "Hollow Bones" in the US) called Jun Po  
Denis Kelly. From what I understand, the following of the breath is typical  
but the mental repetition of "listen!" is not. Maybe counting the breaths and  
returning to 1 when your mind wanders is more typical?

Concentration, driving your mind to the object, makes you feel tired.   
Vichara is different from concentration.   
Vichara should be relaxing.   
It is returning home.   
This is only my opinion.

Vichara is only Sraddha, attention constantly. It does not require  
concentration.   
"Koorntha madhiyal agandhai ezum idaithai aazhnthariya vendum...." says   
Bhagavan in Ulladu Narpadu. Keep the attention constantly, towards the place   
where from the ego sprouts. It does not need concentration. Concentration, I   
understand means 'attention' and not in the usual sense of mind-focussing.   
srkudai may please clarify further.   
Arunachala Siva.

Jun Po Denis Kelly told us some of his stories. Some of the stories made me  
think of Ram Dass - An American who took a lot of LSD in the 60's, went to  
India, introduced an Indian sage to LSD who found it interesting but reported  
that it didn't increase his awareness of God as he already sees God etc.   
 Jun Po told me that he used to go and listen to Ram Dass speak and found him  
enthralling. I'm perhaps a but unfair on spiritual teachers as I compare them  
all to Bhagavan and there aren't many that even come close to him. The  
humility and wisdom in Bhagavan's eyes are incomparable for me.   
 I've been thinking of Bhagavan and Eckhart Tolle's awakenings (I think  
Eckhart Tolle has wisdom and humility in the face of great temptation). Both  
men had a sudden awakening through fear essentially. Eckhart could no longer  
bear his depression and something cracked open within him. I am hoping to find  
examples of awakened people that have reached awareness through a path other  
than great pain. Bhagavan obviously woke very early as there was only a thin  
veil there but what fate awaits the rest of us? Where are the available  
masters who became constantly aware through gradual effort? Perhaps  
Nisargadatta is an example but I don't see the same peace, humility and wisdom  
in his eyes. Am I being unfair? While at Tiruvannamalai I greatly enjoyed  
listening to Mooji speak. Perhaps he is a good example? He found awareness  
through Papaji in the same way Gangaji did. I'm not sure of Papaji's full  
story however I know that he found awareness through Bhagavan.

Dear I,   
The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word 'Guru' is that which is heavy or that  
which is of profound impact. Etymologically Guru means remover of darkness.  
Infact gurutatva belongs to the profoundest of the five divine functions  
(pancakrityas) vis.Srishti (creation), Stithi (sustenance), Samhara  
(destruction or devolution), Tirodhana (veiling) and Anugraha (grace).  
Gurutatva belongs to the anugraha mandala. What does anugraha mean? It is the  
power which makes a mature soul to come in contact with an illumined master.  
Its operation is infallible and it confers the greatest blessing on the jiva  
by kindling the inherent jnana (self knowledge). Thus through bestowal of  
Brahmavidya it releases the jiva from the hypnosis of maya. In most of the  
cases this power of grace manifests through the personality of an external  
teacher. This contact is similar to the phenomenon of lighting a lamp. As we  
light a lamp only from an already burning one, so too the disciple gets  
illumined from the enlightened master. Usually the guru is compared with the  
legendary Chintamani which can convert any metal into gold. But Adi Sankara  
says in his Satasloki that Chintamani is an inferior simile. Chintamani can  
only convert the metal into gold. It cannot convert the metal into Chintamani  
itself. But guru does that alchemy. He transfigures the disciple into his own  
likeness through Atmajnana. The experience of the self deals a death blow to  
the disciple's ignorance and makes him transcend all dualistic perceptions;  
even the guru ceases to be an external phenomenon. "The infinite self alone  
shines forth, neither the guru nor the sishya, neither the teaching nor the  
scripture, neither you nor me, neither this world. Only that ever auspicious  
self remains! The one without a second! That alone am I!" (Dasasloki), roared  
Sankara that too right in front of Govinda Bhagavatpada.   
(Thoughts shared by Nochur)   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

I know that it might be damaging once samaya or spritual progress if one speak  
negative about another teacher, or spiritual aspirant who is pure in heart and  
deeds...   
but I never heard about a rule on this forum where you are not allowed to talk  
about teachers, or compare them or whatever...its all a mind game, nothing  
substantial, so nobody can get burned or?   
oh and my guru is the best (for me),,   
its about karma or not? I can feel a strong bond to a special teaching and  
teacher and really believe he is the buddha incarnate....and through this, Iam  
open for blessings from this teacher.   
but then I can feel nothing about another teaching and a teacher and others  
are full of devotion and gratitute for this teacher//teaching...   
is not so?   
this would technically mean that I can judge for myself but not for others or  
not? and when we talk in htis frame there cannot be much danger or?

Maybe you missed it, as it is written in small fonts.   
It is on the portal page of the forum, just above 'Go to Forum.'
