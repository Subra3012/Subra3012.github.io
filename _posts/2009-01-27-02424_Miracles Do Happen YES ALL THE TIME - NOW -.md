Sri H.W.L. Poonja was a visionary right from his younger days,   
and he blossomed into a great Krishna bhakta. He used to ask   
the sadhus to show him god and he never succeeded. One day,   
when he asked a sadhu whom he was feeding, the sadhu told   
him to Sri Ramana Maharshi. He at last, came from Punjab to settle down in  
Madras and from there he came to see Bhagavan Ramana.   
When he saw Bhagavan Ramana on the couch, he found him to be the same sadhu  
whom he had fed. When he asked the standard question to Bhagavan Ramana, He  
said: I can enable you rather to   
be God than to see God.   
Poonja then went to the Hills and was meditating on Krishna. In   
a state of ecstasy he had a vision of Krishna. He came back. Bhagavan asked  
him: Can you see Krishna now? Poonja replied: No. Only when I have a vision. Bhagavan Ramana said: "What   
is the use of a God who comes and goes? If he is a real God, he   
should be with you always!" This shocked him. He then asked   
Bhagavan Ramana for a mantra, but He did not give him one.   
On his return to Madras, he had a dream in which he received a   
mantra from Bhagavan Ramana. He then had a vision of God in   
human form. After this, he lost all interest in rituals and incantations and  
breathing exercises.   
He once again went to Tiruvannamalai and met Bhagavan Ramana.   
He told Him, about his sudden loss of interest in rituals etc., Bhagavan  
Ramana looked at him steadily for some time and then said: "Now, you, that is  
me, that is Bhagavan!"   
The words sank into his heart, and he experienced the most wonderful feeling  
of bliss he had ever known. It was from that   
time, that he began to understand Bhagavan Ramana and His   
teachings!

**" If he is a real God, he   
should be with you always!"  
Wow! that is so lovely!   
Is it that we have to be "real" / live in reality so that Bhagwan will be with  
us always!?

Dear vinita,   
Bhagavan/Siva/Krishna is always with in us. What is hiding our   
understanding of Reality, is our dirty ego.   
Arunachala Siva.

From France : Yes - All the time \- All the time   
I 'm allowed to love another guru who also died   
but that s of no importance   
but concerning miracles, . .   
they are everywhere all the time   
My wife - also initiated, on a day   
30 years ago expressed a doubt concerning the veggy way of life   
It had to do with Eggs.   
We were 20 meter from the house   
and heard a loud noise almost like the sound barrier   
We hasten toward to the house and there at 5 meter from the house was the  
big photo of our Indian guru in the grass   
The photo is 90 cm high and normally stands on the chéminée - fireplace   
mantle 2 meters high and the iron frame is heavy : about 6 KG   
Before the frame on the mantle are say 30 little ceramic objects like   
little ancient teacups from China - all that kind of stuff   
very thin porcelain very breakable - vulnerable   
They were all there un touched - So, that 6 KG frame had countered   
all gravity laws floating OVER these little objects before falling   
There was no wind or something like that   
The room is 12 x 6 meter   
The Mantle was/is still 5 meters from the open door   
This photo frame was on the Ground and half open   
The photo as said in the garden - in our direction   
Exactly at the moment my wife expressed that doubt about eggs.   
I have a friend in insurances: calculations of risks with Math   
He said to make that happen at that moment of doubt   
is billions of times smaller than winning the lotto every week.   
He said : if you place a PC on every atom in the universe   
and let them calculate during the age of the universe : They cannot find the figure of how small the chance is   
so small it is : It's Zero.   
He said : The Only possibility is   
to create the whole universe a_new from the big bang on   
and program that portrait happening in it.   
Funny - isn't it   
And we have so many greater/bigger happenings and because of the anonymity  
here   
I can tell them - my ego much less in it. . . . wow - I have to be  
prudent   
but   
I hear 'n OK because of all the stories from "the big book of yogi miracles"   
they are all so old and in every book of every   
thinkable Ashram - there is need for some modern miracles and I have some   
It might help others to continue the search   
God is so unbelievable actual with you - but a good splendid guru helps 'big  
time'   
we only have to ask !!. . . for help I mean   
and ALWAYS LOOK if the performer, like Ramana, is a veggy   
Even put a detective on that,. . some are faking. ....   
You do it for your spouse, if you think she/he is unfaithful,   
 so why not for our Soul !!   
There cannot be real love without that   
Nobody can torture God in His Jivas and Teach spirituality   
The Karma is haevy and long   
as Christ also said   
seth   
ps   
we here are like all of you, very struggling souls, not holy or   
something like that at all, my wife 10 steps higher (as always)   
she says I'm an un-guided missile. . perhaps   
the reason I start writing here   
(i only came yesterday for a question)
