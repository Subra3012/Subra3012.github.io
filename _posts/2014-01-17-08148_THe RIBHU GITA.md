## Re:[1] THe RIBHU GITA  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 17, 2014, 02:51:29 PM

Dear Sundaram,   
There are three books on Ribhu Gita in English, in Asramam, apart from Tamizh  
Ribhu Gita.   
1\. N.R. K. Iyer's condensed book on RG.   
2\. Another one translated from Tamizh Ribhu Gita by Dr. H. Ramamurti. I  
follow this only.   
3\. The third is Sanskrit-English Ribhu Gita by Lingeshwara Rao.   
Between 2 and 3, there are some differences in chapters.   
Arunachala Siva.
