Dear Ramanaduli,   
I myself do not know. But my son says, you have to use a   
Winbrowser and a translation software. There are several   
Tamil fonts. Azhagi, mylai etc., Each one works with a different   
translation software. I have not had it in my comp due to the   
complications. An outside comp engineer will help you better.

Tamil fonts to type or tamil fonts to read?   
IME has Tamil fonts to type. You do not have to download it. It is in your  
PC.   
You have to add Tamil font settings.   
 வணக்கம்   
Tamil fonts to read - usually you can download fonts from websites you want  
to read.

IME = Imput Method Editor   
(Microsoft IME)   
In your PC, go to Controll panel, then: > Regional & Language option   
> Keyboards and Languages   
> Change Keyboards   
>General   
> Add   
> Choose 'Tamil' in 'Add Input Language' box, and press OK.   
That is all.   
Please look at the photos on the website below if you do not get what I am  
talking about.   
This website explains how to add Chinese font settings.   
You can do the same with Tamil font.   
In 'Add Input Language' tab, choose Tamil instead of Chinese.
