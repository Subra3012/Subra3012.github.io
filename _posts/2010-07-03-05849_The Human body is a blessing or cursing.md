## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Sivananda About Vritti And Mind

The mind-stuff is citta. It is a mental substance.Vrtti or thought-wave is a  
modification of the mind stuff. It is a process. Just as waves and bubbles  
arise from the surface of the ocean, so also these vrttis arise on the surface  
of the mind-ocean.   
Just as the sun's rays emanate from the sun, so also these mental rays  
(modifications of the vrtti), emanate from the mind-sun. Just as the sun  
merges itself into the horizon at sunset, by collecting all its rays, so also  
you have to merge in the sun of suns, absolute consciousness, eternal peace,  
by collecting all the dissipated mental rays and dissolving the mind itself.   
The function of the vrtti in the mind is to cause the removal of the cause of  
ignorance covering objects. Gross ignorance is enveloping all objects. When it  
is removed, then perception of objects becomes possible.   
Through its own effort the mind assumes the shape of any object, and  
concentrates upon itself. When the mind thinks of Brahman, the sole ultimate  
thought of Brahman is formed. Be vigilant. Watch the mind and its activities.  
The object does not bind you - it is the vrtti, the identification with the  
vrtti, that causes attachment and bondage.   
If you become one with the mind, body and vrttis you get various sorts of  
miseries and sufferings. The whole universe is created by the vrttis alone.If  
these mental thought-waves subside you can attain the absolute state of  
highest peace and bliss. Just as soap cleanses the physical body, even so japa  
(repetition) of any mantra, dhyana (meditation) and kirtan (chanting),  
together with the practice of yama and niyama (discipline), cleanse the mind  
of all impurities. Just as you nourish the physical body with food, even so  
you will have to give food for the mind and spiritual food for the soul.   
Only when the modifications cease do you enter the silence. Realise this.  
Close the eyes, draw in the senses, still the mind, silence the thoughts,  
sharpen the intellect, purify the citta, meditate on Om and chant it with  
feeling. Enter the silence. Silence is Atman, the centre - it is in the heart-  
cave. When the mind runs from one object to another, the state in the  
interval, wherein you become mindless, is Brahman.

Mind is a non existent entity from Atma Swarupa. It has no form.   
The thoughts are emanating from the mind, the I-thought, being the   
first child of the mind.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Anma Vidya, Verse 2: The thought 'I am the body' is the thread   
On which are strung together various thoughts.   
Questing within enquiring 'Who am I?   
And when this thought?' all other thoughts   
Vanish. And as I, I, within the Heart-Cave   
The Self shines of its own accord.   
Such Self-awareness is the only Heaven,   
This stillness, this abode of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. Human body is a blessing, no doubt. But one should not take   
more than necessary care towards the body. Bhagavan Ramana   
is, as you have said, Gold Standard. He never wore any sandals   
in His 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai. He never accepted garlands. No  
one must have seen a photograph of Bhagavan Ramana with a garland at anytime.  
He was wearing only a codpiece and in some rare cold days in winter, He used  
to have a shawl around His chest. There was one priest in Asramam doing pujas  
for   
Ramaneswara Maha Lingam. He fell sick and had a serious problem   
on his feet and that made him immobile. When Sri Ganesan came   
to see him and regretted why should Bhagavan Ramana give him   
such an immobility, the priest answered: "Do not worry. I am okay. Only one  
quarter is bad. Three quarters are good." This is   
the extent, one should have consideration for the body.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, Thats true. We should take care of body only that much to  
keep it healthy. And,what is very important,without atachment. When i said  
body is a blessing i ment that everything God gave us is a blessing. With body  
or not we exsist. We are part of something beautiful. And thats only metters.  
That doasnt mean one should be concerned to much with body. It is only just  
the way to realise the Self.

Dear Jewell,   
Yes. That is the correct approach. Saint Tirumoolar says in his   
Tirumandiram: After realizing that Siva is in me, I start taking   
care of my body. Thus I take care of the body only to take care   
of my God. In another song, Tirumoolar says that: "This ULLam,   
[Heart] is a great Temple. This body made of flesh and bones and   
blood is also His Temple. Whatever I drink or eat, is the abulations for Siva  
in me. My five senses are the five lamps for Him!"   
He says in another song: I am doing Agni Karyam i.e., fire sacrifices daily.  
What is the fire sacrifice? What are the items   
that I put on the fire? [In the olden days, they used to put   
ghee, oil, sandal wood, dried cow dung, wood pieces etc.,].   
I am putting good food, good water and breathe in good air,   
to make this fire glow for ever!   
Tirumoolar was a Siva Raja Yogi. He is said to have lived for 3000 years. He  
took care of his body for the sake of Sivam inside.   
Arunachala Siva.
