## Handling of Depression

Depression, the pain of loneliness, helplessness, gloom and despair, is a  
malady that affects everyone, young and old. However, that depressed state of  
mind is not your true state. It is your birth right to vibrate with strength  
and courage, to face life like a Hero.   
Certain environments and disappointing conditions promote depression of mind  
and engender a sense of loneliness. At times, depression develops for no  
reason. However, the reason lies in the Karmic movement of the past.   
Most of us, especially ones who turn into spirituality when life seems futile  
also face depression. Spirituality should not be an alternative to depression  
in life. Life itself is Spirituality. Therefore one should keep a check of  
ones mental state and not ignore this depression hide the realities of life by  
" _turning to spirituality_ "   
Depression has three aspects: 1. Causal - involved in Karmas, backed up by ignorance of one's spiritual nature   
2. Astral - in the form of psychological imbalance   
3. Physical   
When you are depressed, your spirit sinks, and mental weakness restricts the  
flow of vitality in your body and leads to physical imbalance. If you develop  
the habit of being depressed again and again for a sustained period of time,  
various diseases may result.   
Depression is a contagious disease with a destructive influence on the people  
around you. It is said, "Smile and the world smiles with you; weep and the  
world adds a hundred sighs to your grieving soul."   
It can become an addiction. Often, it is cultivated as a habit due to lack of  
psychological education. There will be many times in your life that you will  
need to withdraw from other people in order to reflect and understand a  
situation better. However, falling into a depression is not the correct way of  
withdrawing.

magazine)

Dear Nagaraj,   
Depression is a state of mind with no activity. It is not mano-nasa,   
it is mano-sunya. This results in lethargy and lack of physical   
activities. The way out is to activate the mind, by chanting some   
mantras or slokas. Never keep the mind inactive. If mind is lost,   
due to mano-nasa, then one is the Self. Bhagavan Ramana said that   
the state of Summa Iru is the state at which the mind is bathing in   
Atmaswarupa, it is not inactive mind. (Who am I?) Many fellows   
who retire from office work, becomes neurotic because they do not   
know how to occupy the mind, particularly with spiritual activities.   
Social activities are one way, but even this becomes a boredom after   
some time, unless these are done as a spiritual sadhana. I am   
astonished at the kitchen workers in the Asramam, who, day in and   
day out, preprare nice breakfast, lunch and dinner, without break   
even on Sundays. Book shop workers have no holiday even on Sundays. Unless  
people do these things with spiritual fervour, they   
cannot do them tirelessly.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Yes its very inspiring to see the kitchen workers and book shop workers in  
Ramanashram. No holidays even! We should be least bit complaining here in this  
world   
Do not expect that you can be free of depression instantly and forever just  
because you want that to happen. However, you can treat the disease of  
depression or lessen its occurrence by adopting various methods:  * You can cure many cases of depression by a deeper insight into the problem or misunderstanding that is bothering you. In some cases you may ward off depression by the exercise of your will power alone.  
 * Practice Hatha Yoga and Praanayama (Breathing) exercises whenever you feel your spirit is beginning to sink. These Satvic exercises bring harmony and balance to the mind and body. Or swim or jog or go for an invigorating walk in a beautiful natural setting. Just changing the atmosphere often causes your depressed mood to give way to a cheerful one.  
 * Do not give serious attention to negative thoughts. They are baseless. As you help your mind regain its strength, these thoughts will disappear.   
 * Look your problems straight in the eye and realise that adversity is a great teacher with a divine purpose. It helps you to overhaul your personality so that things hiding in your consciousness are brought to the surface. When you are strong enough, Nature has mysterious way o bringing you the right challenging situations for your evolution. Through each difficult situation, Nature seems to whisper, " _Can I tell you a secret? It is going to be a little painful, and perhaps depressing, but there is no choice. You have to know it. "_

Dear Nagaraj and hello to everyone,   
I found that depression to be the flip side of grand egotism - rather than  
feel that you are an amazing, truly wonderous individual ( and all the conceit  
that comes with that arrogance), a depressed person will say "I am worthless  
and beneath contempt" \- both of these very self-centred perspectives.   
I used to experience depression habitually, but good practice has got me out  
of these bad habits. I met a friend the other day who stated that she "suffers  
from depression". I found myself ranckle at the term "suffers"\- as if it were  
a disease foisted upon an individual, independently of that person. She  
receives CBT - cognitive behavioural therapy - and although I may generalise -  
it's still about feeding the ego with positive thoughts rather than negative  
thoughts - the ego is still present!   
I am so grateful that spiritual practice ultimately provides a way out of this  
mess....   
PB

i totally agree that depression is an experience of being self centred and is  
the other side of arrogance.   
there is some deep conditioning / force of habit that some of us may possess  
which may lead to repetitive behaviour - including feeling of depression.   
spiritual practices break past karma / conditioning, perhaps.   
i too am struggling with some of this....

Dear Munagala,   
Please translate : Vana durga maha mantra to english for those who do not  
understand, I am intrigued as to the meaning of this mantra   
\   
"Om Hreem dum uththishta purushi kim svapishi Bhayam may samupasThitham,   
yadi sakya masakyam va tanmay bhagavathi samaya swaha"   
Thankyou,   
Paintbrush

Dear Munagala   
This roughly translates like this - (Very limited sanskrit knowledge Excuses  
Please )   
Om - Pranava Mantra   
Hreem / Dum - These are Bija Mantras   
uththishta purushi - The Goddess who awakens everyone/ Who rises everyone  
above who pray to her   
kim svapishi Bhayam may samupasThitham - Then how can fear / or dreams come to  
one who prays to the Uththishta Purushi   
yadi sakya masakyam - Suppose possible becomes impossible   
tanmay bhagavathi samaya - reach out to Bhagawati   
Maybe somebody else will be able to translate it better I feel Udai can do  
it better!
