## Six internal enemies  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 27, 2009, 02:17:54 PM  
---  
Any living being has got six external enemies. But the human   
being alone, which can think and consequently create problems   
for him, has got six internal enemies.   
Kamba Ramayanam and Villiputturar Bharatam, two Tamil rendeings   
of Ramayana and Mahabharata speak of six characters who represent   
each, one internal enemy.   
Kama - This is only undeserving desire. Not sexual desire per se.   
An undeserving desire is something like Sanjay Dutt wanting to   
become Prime Minister! Sisubala in Mahabharatam is the example   
for this. In the Rajasuya Yaga, of Dharmaputra, when he wanted   
to give the first offering to Krishna, Sisubala said that he should   
be given the first offering, and quaralled with both Dharmaputra   
and Krishna. He was killed.   
Kobha - unbridled anger. The example is Hiranya Kashyap. He   
got angry with Narayana and got killed by Narasimha who came out   
of the pillar.   
Lobha - not giving even a small portion of one's wealth and riches   
to others. Duryodhana is the example. He did not even want to spare five  
houses to Pandavas. And he died later due to this.   
Matha - limitless arrogance - bloated egoism. Kamsa. Knowing that   
only Vasudeva's eighth child would kill him, he imprisoned Devaki   
and Vasudeva and killed every child from the first child.   
Moha - this is morbid sexual desire towards women other than one's wife.  
Ravana is the unbeatable example.   
Mascharya - enmity towards anyone other than one's enemy. This is Aswathama,  
who killed Pandavas' harmless young children and also tried to kill even  
Utthara's child in the womb. He was killed.   
Arunachala Siva.

It is the Sadguru who recognises a ripe soul and prepare him for self-  
realisation.Many feel that they can choose Sadguru but it is not possible.

Dear Raju,   
 No sir, it is not like that. Sadguru does not chose "ripe" souls !   
A person who has clarity can clearly find a right sadguru. People often say  
that Sadguru shall come when you are ripe no he does not. When we are  
ripe, we start searching and if we are sincere enough we find one!   
Love!

In those days, the people whether ripined or not Bhagavan was atractng like  
magnet and He pushed them for self realisation. Many people did not ask Him  
any questions still they got benifited. It is all His compassion. He Himself  
is God.God came to take His children in Jnana Marga.Without His physical form  
we are drawn to Him. Just imagine if we see Him with our physical eyes His  
physical form. He is the embodiment of Shiva Himself.

Dear Ramanaduli, You are correct. Bhagavan says in Akshara   
Mana Malai, 'Nokkiye karudhi Mey Thakkiye, pakkuvam aakiye...   
Bhagavan a) looks, b) thinks about and c) gives diksha.   
In this process, He 'cooks' (Pakkuvam akiye....)the souls. Even   
if they are not ripe, they are cooked!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Do not feel ever disheartened. He "thinks" about who "think" of Him.   
This "mano diksha" is ever available, even after His Maha Nirvana.   
One day, you will sing: "Enna punniya seithen, Ramana, indha   
ramana duli, un arulai pera..." Again Manikkavachakar! He says   
in Kovil Tirup Padigam, Decad on Kovil, Chidambaram,   
O Siva, you have given me and taken this poor me!   
Who is cleverer in the two?   
I got from you limitless Bliss,   
What have you got from this lowly me?   
O my Siva, you have taken my Heart as your Temple, but live in   
 Tirupperundurai,   
O my father, you have taken my lowly body as your abode,   
What can gift can I give you in exchange?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramani ji   
I am very happy to know there is another dhiksha that is mono dhiksha. These  
replies are giving courage and guidence   
to do further. Once again I thank you, srkudhai and Dr. Raju ji. Bhagavan  
gives very tough test paper everyday. With His grace only I could overcome all  
the obstecles without loosing my awarness. Bhagavan took avatar like  
Dhakshnamoorthy   
He IS available to all the beings. Those who got their realisation were all  
fully dried sticks so as soon as the Jnanan agani   
Fell on'" it got burned. In my case I am still like a wet wood. The stick  
which I use' Pinam chudm kazhli', it gets burned so fast. leaving my thoughts   
If everything goes smoothly I feel I am with my SELF. Once I get problem, I  
will loose "self".

Dear Ramanduli, Bhagavan Ramana's life was the personification   
of silence and Sri Dakshinamoorthy. He taught as was done by   
the Adi Guru, in silence. Mouna vaakya... The sincere seekers   
understood the Self, Para Brahma Tattvam.... They had all their   
doubts cleared without asking for any clarification. Sishyashtu   
Chinna samsaya.....Dakshina also means in Sanskrit, the right side.   
Bhagavan always sat with His chin turned slightly towards right.   
If one stays in the South, and sees the Guru, who is the Spiritual   
North Pole, who is seeing the Southern direction, (dakshinam), and looks   
at Him and then on one's right, one will see the East. The East is where the  
Sun rises. The Sun of Knowledge can be experienced if you turn towards the  
north and then look at your rigtht side.   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan, one is: Sri Dakshinabhi mukayai Namah: Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, as I posted elsewhere, the Guru is one in whose   
presence, (his books, his words, his name), the seeker gets   
total peace and gets all his doubts resolved, without questioning.   
There is no qualification like, living or dead, man or   
woman, young or old. Even the Guru can be a bird and not a   
human being! Please see Avadhuta Gita. Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, your two posts. Scriptures mention three types of   
'dikshas' that is, Sparsa diksha, Sakshu diksha, Mano-diksha   
or Bhavana diksha. The first is by touch, like hen touching the egg   
for hatching. The second is by look, like fish looking at the eggs. The   
third is by thinking, like tortoise thinking about the eggs on the shore.   
Bhagavan used sparsa diksha very rarely. He used looking more   
often. Kayvya kanta Muni has said: "Do not sit directly before the   
Bhagavan! If He looks at you, the hrudaya kranthi (the knots) gets   
snapped immediately and you will not go back to your family!" In 108   
holy names on Bhagavan, there are names Pullambuja Vilochanaya Namah,   
that is one who looks at others with eyes like red lotuses. Again,   
Uttheepata Nayanaya Namah, one who has got a look like piercing   
arrow! Bhagavan used mano diksha or bhavana diksha very rarely.   
(Do not ask how can He think?). The first two were used when He   
was in body. The third one, He uses even today. But the third one is   
a two way process. If one thinks of Him, He will think of him. If one   
has conviction (Bhavana), He will have the bhavana on him. Hence   
there is no need for Bhagavan (or any Guru) to be in body. His   
Presence (Sannidhya) will do but this requires our thinking and   
conviction. The only test is whether you get peace.   
Avdhuta Gita, the English translation of Ramakrishna Math is   
excellent. For that matter, all advaita books of Ramakrishna Math   
are quite good.   
I have not read "No mind, I am the Self." Hence I cannot write about   
Sri Lakshmanaswami's book.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, on Avadhuta Gita. I mentioned about Avadhuta having   
several gurus (24 beings) which included a bird. This story is not   
available in Avadhuta Gita. I am sorry. Avadhuta or Dattatreya is   
the son of Sage Atri and Anasuya. He had 24 gurus and a vulture was   
one of his gurus. He saw a vulure flying with a piece of meat on its   
beak, and several vultures chased it to grab the meat. The bird   
decided to drop it and lo and behlold, after dropping the meat,   
all other birds left it. Avadhuta learned that once you leave your   
possesions, nobody will come near you. Thus he held the bird as   
his guru! The story appears in Markendaya Purana. There are also   
books narrating Dattatreya Charitra. About Avadhuta Gita per se,   
which is a pure advaita text, without stories, I shall write separately.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, Thinking about Bhagavan's frame and repeating His   
name was never discouraged by Bhagavan. But He has said that   
the Brahman is beyond forms and names. But many of us have to   
start only from a name-form worship or contemplation to reach the   
formless worship or contemplation or meditation. Hence this   
allowance. But I still maintain the stand that the Guru need not   
be in a physical body nor he should be a human being. One can   
"see" the Brahman as much as in a hill and in a bird. I propose   
write to David Godman about Sri Lakshmanaswami's saying that   
the Guru should be in a living body. When I get a reply, I shall   
post it. Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, I am happy that Bhagavan is appearing in your dream.   
I had that fortune only on one or two occasions. But kindly do not   
wait for the dream, sleep etc., Please visualize Him in the wakeful   
state, either mentally or through a photograph of Him. The Guru   
will push you inside from the out and the Guru inside your Heart will   
also pull you from inside into the Heart. That is the starting point for   
self-attention or self-enquiry.

Dear nonduel, I am thankful to you for your extrace of David   
Godman's interview with Sri Lakshmanaswami. Both David and   
Sri Lakshmanaswami agree about three types of gurus, Siva within,   
Siva appearing in the name of a guru for a while and the living gurus,   
who are Siva's devotees who are designed to be teachers. In fact,   
in the case of Saint Manikkavachagar, Siva appeared as a Guru for   
a while, in the place called Tirukkazhukundram, and disappeared later.   
Manikkavachagar's life is a wonder. First Siva appeared before him as   
an Effulgent light in a place called Tirupperundurai in Southern Tamil Nadu.  
The Siva appeared as a brahmin guru in Tirukkazhukundram and Manikka-   
vachagar became Self-realized, sang songs in a number of places, and   
finally merged in Siva, again as a light merging with light in Chidambaram.   
Coming to your point, from your posts I guess you need a living guru   
to clarify your doubts about Ramana Way. If this so, there are several   
elders inside Ramanasramam, and David Godman through his website.   
Finding a living guru firstly it may be difficult and secondly you are not   
sure whether they are genuine, in these days of bogus and self-styled   
gurus.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, Thanks for your immediate response. The story   
mentioned by you has also been read from somewhere sometime   
back. Upanishads mention two preconditions for a Guru, one,   
he should be a through scholar in "sastras", that is, scriptures   
and injunctions; second he must be a Bramha Nishta, that is   
he should abiding in Brhaman or the Self. The phrase goes: "Stotriam Brahma-nishtam." In today's world, we have scholars   
aplenty and what is rare is brahma-nishta, gurus abiding in the   
Self. The King in the story is having both qualifications, he is   
able to order and also he has got authority to do so. Whereas   
the other is giving only an order, but has no authority. Hence   
the order of the second was not obeyed. If one could find a   
living guru who has order and authority, there is nothing like   
that. But it is very very rare, and it is like finding the footprints   
of the bird on the sky!   
You are correct. I checked up with David Godman's blog. Sri   
Lakshmana Swami has in fact, suggested the need for a living   
Guru. But he had Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi but do we have one?   
Arunachala Siva.

About 12 years ago I called myself and atheist I was full of hate even for God  
which is strange for an atheist! then over night something changed I was  
filled with an energy to find why I am here to find out if there was something  
more. I started reading Paul Brunton's books in which I first heard of Ramana.  
My point is who was my Guru if not the self?   
When I think of Ramana my heart is filled with love and no words will do. If  
someone tells me I need a living Guru I will tell them I have Ramana I have  
the self.

Dear "kide", I am happy you have started reading Paul Brunton.   
Read other books on Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and also books   
by Him. During the stage of practice, you need a Guru and Bhagavan   
Ramana's photograph or His books will be your Guru. Once the practice   
is completed, you are the Self, at which time, there is no need for   
a Guru, since there is no duality, inside and outside. At that time the   
Self, that is Bhagavan Ramana will shine in all its brilliance and you   
are That. Be as you are.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R   
Thank you for your reply I have BE AS YOU ARE which has the wonderful picture  
of Ramana on the cover it is always close to hand and I look at the picture a  
lot, it is like a magnet. Apart from Paul Brunton's books which I know pretty  
well can you suggest other books that I should read?

A Sadguru is one in whose presence your thought activity subsides by itself  
without any effort on your part and you will taste the bliss of his being.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, you are correct. As Bhagavan Himself   
has said in Ramana Gita, a true guru is one with whom you   
get total peace.   
Dear kdo, regarding other books, you may read Aruthur Osborne's   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi's teachings in His own words.   
You may David Godman's The Power of the Presence. 3 vols.   
Sri Ramansramam has recently brought out a seven volume   
compendium on Bhagavan called The Life and Teachings of Bhagavan   
Sri Ramana Maharshi. It is brought out both in English and in Tamil.   
Arunchala Siva.

Dear Friends,   
 suppose i ask : Do you require a guru for getting knowledge of mathematics? The answer is yes and no. Yes, coz in the absence of a Guru, one may misunderstand. No coz, if a good book is available we might as well understand with self effort and sincerity.   
While this is so for intellectual subjects -- most people seem to think that  
Guru will solve their problems. This is totally wrong. There is this saying  
that if the load is on our head, someone can remove it; but if the load is in  
our head no one can do it for us, we will have to do it ourselves. How to  
unload the mind, we might need some instructions. For example, if someone  
thinks that "Who am i" needs to be repeated, for such a person, someone needs  
to tell him that is not the way. But a sincere Sadhaka can study carefully and  
interact with people like David Godman and find out its true meaning.   
But i think Sri Ramana's books convey the meaning very clearly and would be  
sufficient for us. And these discussions are also ways to interact and get  
things clearer.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, I agree with you. Dear Sankar and srkudai,   
a guru is one who teaches the arts and sciences. Like   
the maths teacher, or Drona who taught archery to Arjuna.   
These people are for worldly knowledge. A Satguru, as the   
name implies, lives in Sat, Brahman, and teaches you how   
to merge in Him.   
As for living and dead gurus, the controversy is still open.   
As for me, Bhagavan Ramana will do and I do not need   
anybody 'living'.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Friends,   
 While selecting modern living gurus please be cautious. If we select someone and the person proves out to be a fraud it is lot of sorrow. We need to be very cautious to see every move of the person before calling him a guru.   
My way is, i pick what ever is correctly said, no matter who says it ask  
doubts and get clarifications : ultimately, i treat no one as guru in ultimate  
sense, but everyone from whom i learnt a new perspective or way is a guru so  
to say. But someone who taught me something vital, if he proves out to be a  
fraud, i wont feel let down, as i took his teaching and not everything aspect  
of his life. This would make sure we wont get let down by personal defects of  
the teacher.   
Love!

It is the Sadguru who recognises a ripe soul and prepare him for self-  
realisation.Many feel that they can choose Sadguru but it is not possible.

Dear Raju,   
 No sir, it is not like that. Sadguru does not chose "ripe" souls !   
A person who has clarity can clearly find a right sadguru. People often say  
that Sadguru shall come when you are ripe no he does not. When we are  
ripe, we start searching and if we are sincere enough we find one!   
Love!

In those days, the people whether ripined or not Bhagavan was atractng like  
magnet and He pushed them for self realisation. Many people did not ask Him  
any questions still they got benifited. It is all His compassion. He Himself  
is God.God came to take His children in Jnana Marga.Without His physical form  
we are drawn to Him. Just imagine if we see Him with our physical eyes His  
physical form. He is the embodiment of Shiva Himself.

Dear Ramanaduli, You are correct. Bhagavan says in Akshara   
Mana Malai, 'Nokkiye karudhi Mey Thakkiye, pakkuvam aakiye...   
Bhagavan a) looks, b) thinks about and c) gives diksha.   
In this process, He 'cooks' (Pakkuvam akiye....)the souls. Even   
if they are not ripe, they are cooked!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Do not feel ever disheartened. He "thinks" about who "think" of Him.   
This "mano diksha" is ever available, even after His Maha Nirvana.   
One day, you will sing: "Enna punniya seithen, Ramana, indha   
ramana duli, un arulai pera..." Again Manikkavachakar! He says   
in Kovil Tirup Padigam, Decad on Kovil, Chidambaram,   
O Siva, you have given me and taken this poor me!   
Who is cleverer in the two?   
I got from you limitless Bliss,   
What have you got from this lowly me?   
O my Siva, you have taken my Heart as your Temple, but live in   
 Tirupperundurai,   
O my father, you have taken my lowly body as your abode,   
What can gift can I give you in exchange?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramani ji   
I am very happy to know there is another dhiksha that is mono dhiksha. These  
replies are giving courage and guidence   
to do further. Once again I thank you, srkudhai and Dr. Raju ji. Bhagavan  
gives very tough test paper everyday. With His grace only I could overcome all  
the obstecles without loosing my awarness. Bhagavan took avatar like  
Dhakshnamoorthy   
He IS available to all the beings. Those who got their realisation were all  
fully dried sticks so as soon as the Jnanan agani   
Fell on'" it got burned. In my case I am still like a wet wood. The stick  
which I use' Pinam chudm kazhli', it gets burned so fast. leaving my thoughts   
If everything goes smoothly I feel I am with my SELF. Once I get problem, I  
will loose "self".

Dear Ramanduli, Bhagavan Ramana's life was the personification   
of silence and Sri Dakshinamoorthy. He taught as was done by   
the Adi Guru, in silence. Mouna vaakya... The sincere seekers   
understood the Self, Para Brahma Tattvam.... They had all their   
doubts cleared without asking for any clarification. Sishyashtu   
Chinna samsaya.....Dakshina also means in Sanskrit, the right side.   
Bhagavan always sat with His chin turned slightly towards right.   
If one stays in the South, and sees the Guru, who is the Spiritual   
North Pole, who is seeing the Southern direction, (dakshinam), and looks   
at Him and then on one's right, one will see the East. The East is where the  
Sun rises. The Sun of Knowledge can be experienced if you turn towards the  
north and then look at your rigtht side.   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan, one is: Sri Dakshinabhi mukayai Namah: Arunachala Siva.
