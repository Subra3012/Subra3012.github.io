**A brief overview of Advaita Vedanta** : #. **The Ultimate Reality** : \- The Absolute Reality (known as Brahman) is non-dual, is the pure subject  
and beyond the reach of words and thoughts, which relate only to objects.   
\- No phenomenal characterizations or predictions can be made of the Brahman  
(neti, neti). In that sense it is attributeless (nirguna).   
\- But being the reality and the source of all phenomenon, it is not an entity  
beyond experience. It is the inner-self (pratyak-atman) of all, the eternal  
subject. It is intuitively cognized, directly and intimately, as the pure  
witness Self (saksi) within by all beings.   
\- Brahman from the emperical point of view is said to have the nature of  
satyam-jnanam-anantam-brahma (absolute existence knowledge infinity) and  
anandam (absolute bliss). Often cit (consciousness) is used in place of jnanam  
(knowledge) and brahman is referred to as sat-chit-ananda.   
#. **The Relative Universe** : \- How the relative universe rises from the absolute, none can say. However  
from the relative point of view it is postulated that an inscrutable veiling-  
projecting Maya power of Brahman, presents to us the relative universe by  
veiling the nature of ultimate reality.   
\- Maya does not infringe the absoluteness of the Brahman. Maya is a fact from  
the emperical point of view but Maya is not Maya to Brahman.   
\- The Maya power arises spontaneously from Brahman without its willing and  
projects the universe. This is like fire radiating heat and light  
spontaneously and not as an act of will.   
\- Due to the Maya power of Brahman, the Brahman appears to be polarized into  
subject and object, within the framework of space, time and causation,  
amenable to change and activity.   
\- When in the waking state, the perceiving subject considers himself as a  
psycho-physical being, subject to changes, the rest of the universe is also  
perceived as an objective physical entity with other psycho-physical beings  
within the framework of space, time and causation.   
\- When in the dream state, the perceiving subject within the dream has a  
dream personality, which is mental in nature, the objective universe and the  
beings in it are also mental within the volatile framework of space, time and  
causation of the dream world.   
\- When in deep sleep state, there is no personality of the perceiving  
subject, the universe is also not perceived as an object.   
\- When in samadhi, one realizes onseself as Atman, there is neither the  
universe, nor its perceiver. Only the non-dual Absolute Brahman remains as  
pure awareness.   
\- The Absolute Brahman causally associated with the totality of the relative  
universe is known as Isvara, the Lord and the ruler of the universe and its  
beings.   
#. **Bondage** : \- The emperical person, being affected by the relative universe with its  
limitations, passes through various types of experiences, undertakes various  
activities to satisfy his desires on account of his sense of limitedness, and  
goes through joys and sorrows, knowledge and ignorance, birth and death etc,  
according to his karma. This is bondage.   
#. **Liberation** : \- In due course, the emperical person becomes aware of the Supreme Self  
(Atman) within him, always calm and unaffected, the eternal witness, and that  
is his true nature. He gives up attachment to his emperical ego and  
personality. With this realization and identification with the Self, the  
emperical personality disintegrates and the soul (jiva) which was only the  
reflection of the Atman in the limited buddhi, disappears into the Supreme  
Self, its source, just as the reflection of the sun in the bowl of water, when  
the bowl is broken, disappears and the sun alone remains in all its glory.  
This is liberation (mukti).   
\- When an embodied person realizes even while living that the whole universe  
and its beings are manifestations of Brahman, the activities of the psycho-  
physical organism, with which his jiva was associated before the rise of  
jnana, now reflect this liberated state, the jiva remaining identified with  
the Witness Atman instead of the body. It is not affected by the universe, and  
his body functions like an actor in a drama. This is called jivanmkti,  
liberation-while-living.   
\- It is the Brahman which appears to us as all the three : Isvara-Jiva-Jagat.  
One cannot eliminate them as one has not created them. But one can transcend  
them by the realization of Atman-Brahman as one's real Self, by giving up the  
emperical personality - just as though one cannot avoid the effect of  
gravitation on earth, one can transcend it by going beyond its reach. The  
universe and Isvara continues to be there for the other jivas.

**A brief overview of Kashmiri Shaivism** : The non-dual Saiva system of Kashmir is known as Trika-Sasana or Trika-Sastra  
because it is a philosophy of the triad: 1\. Siva   
2\. Sakti   
2\. Nara   
or   
1\. Para (highest)   
2\. Parapara (identity in difference)   
3\. Apara (difference)   
The literature of the Trika system of Kashmir falls into three categories: 1\. Agama Sastra: Considered to be revealation by Siva   
2\. Spanda Sastra: Elaborates the principles laid down in the Siva-Sutras.   
3\. Prayabhijna Sastra: Expounds the Trika philosophy by arguments and  
discussions.   
Siva-Sutras is the most important Agama of the Trika system. This was revealed  
to Vasugupta either towards the last part of 8th century or beginning of the  
9th century.   
The following is the philosophical background of the Siva-Sutras.   
#. **The Utimate Reality** : \- The Ultimate Reality, known as Siva (not the Siva with form) is the non-  
relational consciousness and the changeless principle of all changes.   
\- Siva is referred to as prakasa-vimarsamaya. Prakasa is the eternal light of  
consciousness without which nothing can appear. Vimarsa is that aspect of  
Prakasa by which it knows itself. Vimarsa is Sakti, the svabhava (nature) of  
Siva. Vimarsa is the non-relational immediate awareness of I. Vimarsa is the  
Kartrtva Sakti (power of doership) of Siva.   
#. **The Relative Universe** : \- It is the svabhava or the very nature of the Ultimate Reality to manifest.  
Without manifestation, the Ultimate Reality will be like a non-living thing  
like a stone.   
\- The powers of Parama Siva are: 1\. Cit: This is the power of Self revealation, the changeless principle of  
all changes. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Siva.   
2\. Ananda or Absolute Bliss. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Sakti.   
Cit and Ananda are the very svarupa or nature of Parama Siva. The rest may be  
considered to be his saktis.   
3\. Iccha or Will: In this aspect the Supreme is known as Sadasiva or  
Sadakhya.   
4\. Jnana or Knowledge: In this aspect the Supreme is known as Ishvara.   
5\. Kriya or the power of assuming any or every form: In this aspect the  
Supreme is known as Sadvidya or Suddha Vidya.   
\- The universe is the unmesa (opening out) or prasara (expansion) of the  
Supreme as Sakti.   
The following appears in the course of manifestation.   
\- Tattvas of the Universal Experience: 1\. Siva tattva: It is the initial creative movement (prathama spanda) of  
Parama Siva.   
2\. Sakti tattva: Consciousness is polarized into I (Aham) and This (Idam),  
Subject and Object.   
3\. Sadasiva or Sadakhya Tattva: The will (Iccha) to affirm the This (Idam)  
side of the universal experience. The experience is still hazy (asphuta). At  
this stage, Iccha (Will) is predominant.   
4\. Isvara or Aisvarya tattva: The This (Idam) side of the universal  
experience becomes a little more defined (sphuta). At this stage, jnana or  
knowledge is predominant.   
5\. Sadvidya or Suddhavidya tattva: The I (Aham) and the This (Idam) side of  
the univeral experience are equally balanced. At this stage, kriya sakti is  
predominant.   
Upto this stage of manifestation, the svarupa or the real nature of the divine  
is still not veiled. Hence it is called pure order (suddhadhva).   
\- Tattvas of the Limited Individual Experience: Maya tattva: Now begins the play of Maya tattva. From this stage the ideal  
nature of the divine is veiled. Hence it is called impure order (asuddhadva).   
The products of the Maya are the five coverings: 1\. Kala (kalaa): This reduces the universal authorship (sarvakartratva) of  
the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of  
authorship or efficacy.   
2\. Vidya: This reduces the omniscience (sarvajnatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of knowledge.   
3\. Raga: This reduces the all-satisfaction (purnatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about desire for things.   
4\. Kala (kaala): This reduces the eternity (nityatva) of the Universal  
Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of time (past, present  
and future).   
5\. Niyati: This reduces the freedom (svatantrata) and pervasiveness  
(vyapakatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in  
respect of cause, space and form.   
\- Tattvas of the Limited Individual: 1\. Purusa: Siva through Mayasakti limits His universal knowledge and power  
and becomes purusa or individual subject. Purusa is also known as anu.   
2\. Prakrti: Prakrti is the objective manifestation of Siva. Each purusa has a  
different prakrti.   
Prakrti has three gunas: 1\. Sattva (principle of brightness and lightness)   
2\. Rajas (principle of activity)   
3\. Tamas (principle of darkness or inertia)   
\- Tattvas of the Mental Operation: Prakrti differentiates into antahkarana (the psychic apparatus), indriyas  
(senses) and bhutas (matter).   
The Antahkarana consists of the tattvas - Buddhi, Ahamkara and Manas.   
\- Tattvas of the Sensible Experience: All the tattvas of the sensible experience are the products of ahamkara.   
1\. The five powers of sense-perception (jnanendriyas or buddhindriyas) are: (1) Smelling (ghranendriya)   
(2) Tasting (rasanendriya)   
(3) Seeing (caksurindriya)   
(4) Feeling by touch (sparsendriya)   
(5) Hearing (sravanendriya)   
2\. The five powers of actions (karmendriyas) are: (1) Power of speaking (vagindriya)   
(2) Power of handling (hastendriya)   
(3) Power of locomotion (padendriya)   
(4) Power of excreting (payvindriya)   
(5) Power of sexual action and restfulness (upasthendriya)   
3\. The five tanmatras or the primary elements of perception: (1) Sound-as-such (sabda-tanmatra)   
(2) Touch-as-such (sparsa-tanmatra)   
(3) Colour-as-such (rupa-tanmatra)   
(4) Flavour-as-such (rasa-tanmatra)   
(5) Odour-as-such (gandha-tanmatra)   
\- Tattvas of Materiality: The five gross elements or panca-mahabhutas are the product of the five  
tanmatras.   
They are: 1\. Akasa is produced from sabda-tanmatra   
2\. Vayu is produced from sparsa-tanmatra   
3\. Teja (Agni) is produced from rupa-tanmatra   
4\. Apas is produced from rasa-tanmatra   
5\. Prithivi is produced from gandha-tanmatra   
The Individual Self (Jiva): \- Caitanya or Siva forms the very core of the being of every individual. It  
is his real Self.   
\- Physical body (Sthula Sarira): The physical aspect of the individual  
consists of panca mahabhutas. There is also a prana sakti working in him. It  
is by this prana sakti that he is sustained and maintained.   
\- Subtle body (Suksma-Sarira): The antahkarana consisting of manas, buddhi  
and ahamkara together with the five tanmatras form a group of eight, known as  
puryastaka. This forms the subtle body in which the soul leaves the body at  
the time of death.   
\- Kundalini: In each individual, there is a kundalini, which is a form of  
sakti and lies dormant at the base of the spine.   
\- Each individual normally experiences the three states of waking, dreaming  
and deep sleep. Apart from that, there is a fourth state of consciousness  
known as turiya. This is the consciousness of Siva and is pure cidananda.   
#. **Bondage** : The bondage of the individual is due to: \- Innate ignorance or anava mala, due to which Universal Consciousness is  
reduced to an "anu" or a limited creature. It comes about by the limitation of  
the Iccha sakti of the Supreme.   
\- Mayiya mala is the limited condition brought about by Maya. It brings about  
the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of  
the body etc (bhinna vedya pratha). This comes about by the limitation of  
jnana sakti of the Supreme.   
\- Karma mala is the limiting condition brought about by the vasanas or  
residual traces of actions done under the influence of desire. The force of  
these vasanas carries the jiva from one life to another.   
#. **Liberation** : \- Liberation means the recognition (pratyabhijna) of one's true nature which  
means the original, innate pure I-consciousness.   
\- The highest attainment however is that of Siva Consciousness in which the  
entire universe appears as I or Siva. This comes about by Saktipata - the  
descent of Divine Sakti or anugraha (Divine Grace).

Dear silentgreen,   
I am thankful to you for this excellent post, one of those of rare   
excellence that appear in this Forum. In fact, Saiva Siddhantam,   
of South India borrows from Kashmiri Savism and Advaitam. When   
I had been to Tiruvannamalai for 2 days on 19th and 20th, I was   
speaking to Sri J.Jayaraman of the Centenary Library, in the afternoon. He  
said that Saiva Siddantam, Kashmiri Saivism, Veera   
Savism of Karnataka, all borrow the ideas only from advaitam and the  
malaparibagam and iruvinai oppu (i.e. the cleaning of the three   
malas, impurities, ego, kanma (karma) and maya and treating   
the dyads (iru vinai) as same by the sadhaka are the connecting threads for  
these with Advaitam. Both Sri Lalita Sahasranamam and   
Sri Soundarya Lahari of Sri Sankara, touch these aspects. That is why, it is  
said of Sri Sankara that he was an advaiti in heart but   
sakta or saiva siddhanti in practice. Ozhivil Odukkam (Staying   
in the Remains) of Kannudaiya VaLLalar (which Bhagavan has   
quoted in His conversations and also in some of His works) also   
contains these aspects of Saiva Siddhantam/Kashimiri Saivism   
with the ultimate of aim of sadhaka to attain the non dual   
consciousness.   
While Jnana Sambandhar, Tirunavukkarasar and Sundaramurty, leans heavily  
towards Saiva Siddhantam, Saint Manikkavachagar leans heavily towards  
advaitam. Incidentally, one of the theories about Saint Manikkavachagar is  
that he came from North India after throughly understanding various aspects of  
Saivism and then wrote his two works (Tiruvachakam and Tirukovaiyar) with  
accent towards Advaitam. (The Age of Saint Manikkavachagar, by Swami Marai  
Malai AdigaL).   
Arunachala Siva.

Infact, Tirumoolar, the don of Saiva Siddhanta of South, Sri Tirumoolar, whom  
we owe a lot, is from Kashmir.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Saiva Siddhantham tells Sivam means Pasupathi. All jivas all are pasu and Siva  
i.e. shiva is pathi. All jivas should reach pathi. means advaitam is not it.  
THEY SAY ERANDARA KLAPPADHU. The same thing Manikkavachkar says and He  
attained in the same way in Chidambaram. I have not studied Thevaram fully.  
Rarely I have a chance of hearing the lectures in the temple.   
Thrumoolar's story was posted by our Subramaniyan ji long time ago. He comes  
under Siddhar lineage. All siddhas are like sufis with medical knowledge. Some  
siddhas do some miracles for the sake of man kind. All their poems talk about  
Almighty, sivam and advaitam. They never follow rituals. In tamil nadu many  
people follow siddhas system.   
Generally people in south say all siddhas are living in Thruvannamalai. Many  
people say during giri valam they can be blessed by siddhas who are present in  
sushma roopam.
