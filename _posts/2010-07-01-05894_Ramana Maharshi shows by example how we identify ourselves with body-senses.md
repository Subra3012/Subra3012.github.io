**A man says I came from Madras. But in reality he did not come. The  
jutka or some other vehicle brought him from his house to the railway station,  
the train brought him to Tiruvannamalai railway station, and from there some  
other cart brought him here. But he says I came. This is how we identify  
ourselves with the acts of the body and the senses.** Bhagavan also quoted  
from the Vedanta Chudamani to the effect that the activities of the jnani are  
all samadhi, i.e. he is always in his real state,whatever his body may happen  
to be doing.   
The following remarks were also made by Bhagavan this night: The jnani sees he is the Self and it is on that Self as the screen that the  
various cinema-pictures of what is called the world pass. He remains  
unaffected by the shadows which play on the surface of that screen.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana says in AAMM Verse 74: Pokkum varavum il pothu veLi.....   
In the wide open space of pure being, where there is no going   
and and no coming, reveal to me the joy of wrestling with your   
Grace, O Arunachala!   
[Prof. K. Swaminathan adds here: The struggle, the ding-dong   
battle, the prolonged wrestling which is the operation of the   
Grace. In the Old Testament, Jacob wrestles with god for a whole night, until  
God reveals Himself as "I am that I am". It is a   
long fight between the ego and the Self.]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
In Shiva puranam Manikkavachakar also says, POKKUM VARAVUM ILLA PUNNIYENE. For  
space only there is no door, no compartments. It is only vetta veLi. If we  
imagine a vast space it looks we are all floating in the space.   
(Again the "mind" comes here.) But in deep sleep this space also disappears.  
So what is the truth. The person who sees all these? i.e. the person.... at  
last WE!

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In deep sleep, where the mind is suspended temporarily, the concepts of time  
and space go away. But when one wakes up, then these two come back. If one  
conquers the mind or ego, then there is only Space, Vetta VeLi. In fact,  
Bhagavan Ramana says Heart is Space. We are all in the Heart, Atma, the  
Space. Only for beginners, He said that the Heart is on the right of mid  
chest. Upon realization, one understands our body and the whole universe is  
in Space. This Space which is also Effulgence [OLi] contains all the  
remaining four elements, fire, water, earth and air. There is in fact,  
nothing other than Space. This is ULLadu. This is nicely described by  
Bhagavan in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 7.   
Arunachala Siva.
