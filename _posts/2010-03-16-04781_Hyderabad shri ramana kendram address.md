Dear telluravi,   
When I went to Hyderabad in December last and stayed there for a few days,   
I broke my head to find out the address. The telephone directory does not   
have any information. Many friends also could not get me the information.   
It was started by one K.Subrahmanyam. But I am told, he is no more. Kindly   
check up with Asramam directly.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear talluriravi,   
 Hyderabad Ramana Kendram is in Tilaknagar.   
the lane going from fever hospital. .. meets the lane coming from the 6-no.  
bus stop at one point, at that junction, u should move towards the petrol  
pump. just by the side of it, upwards, the center is there.   
[ just stand there [it is the end of the lane from fever hospital], and look  
towards the left u shall be able to find the petrol pump.]   
on the same lane there is also a satya sai temple. Every sunday at around 9 am  
they have some prayer sessions etc. you can also get books then.   
otherdays morning and evening there will be some small sessions. .. around 9  
in the morning and 5:30-6 in the evening i guess. But i went only on sundays!   
it easy to trace.

Dear all,   
Thanks for the information. I have visited Shivam at nallkunta earlier. As Sri  
Ramana kendram is near to it, I think I should be able to go there.   
Thanks   
Ravi
