Hiya Guru grace   
As I understand it expecting anything at all, waiting for a result, looking  
for a goal or any similar mental actions during meditation defiantely  
interferes with meditation.   
Just do it without caring about it.   
If you fall asleep   
.Do it when you are walking, When you are standing up. Do anywhere anytime  
.Stop in the middle of some daily activity and do it.   
Read Ramana's teaching a lot.   
Read one line that you feel inspiring over and over.   
Keep at it !!!   
Don't worry !!   
Let things take the time that they naturally take. That way you wont notice  
the time passing so much.   
Keep Ramana in your thoughts as much as you can.   
Peace

Hi Gurugrace,   
 Here, Now you can find your Self. Coz urself is not lost. Who is seeking the self ?   
find out who you are. .. at the Core. .. you have a body, u r not the body.  
the fact that u can observe your thoughts means that you have thoughts, you  
are not the thoughts. .. and every activity of ur life. .. you are the witness  
...   
That witness in you which watches everything happening, but is not troubled by  
anything that happens. .. what is it ? Awareness. .. Consciousness ?   
That is you. All the states of your life. .. the Sakshi. ..   
when you have a headache. .. you are aware of the headache. .. is the  
awareness troubled by the headache ?   
when there is pain. .. is the awareness of pain, troubled by the pain   
when there is joy, is the awareness of joy elated by the joy ?   
awareness remains unaltered and untouched. .. as a Sakshi : Witness. ..  
throughout ur life. .. That is "U".   
The word "I", right now is wrongly associated with various objects. ..   
when you say "I" am rich, "I" is associated with riches.   
when you say "I" am sick, "I" is associated with body.   
again when u say "I" am intelligent, "I" is associated with intellect.   
In all the above statements the correct association would be to associate "I"  
with the awareness of the "I" thought. ..! that is the true "I" untouched by  
anything. .. and You are That ! whether you agree or disagree. .. whether you  
know or do not know. .. whether anythign remains or does not remain. .. that  
is the TRUTH.   
Thou Art That.   
Love!

Mr Hiyagrace, getting sleep during meditation is the experience of   
most of us. Bhagavan says that we can continue meditation once   
we come out of sleep. Bhagavan even says that it is the mind which   
needs sleep and not the body! One line of Bhagavan that is wanted   
by you. Refer Who am I? " If you control the mind, you can be   
anywhere."

Mr. "gurugrace", while meditating, either without or within, there   
are lots of problems. The foremost is gushing of thoughts. Sleep   
comes next. Fear also comes for most of us. While getting thoughts,   
sleep or fear, do not bother. Ask "For whom are these thoughts,   
sleep or fear?". It will go off. But if you still get sleep, coninue   
meditation, while you become awake. Read "Who am I?" or   
simply say "Arunachala Siva". While I get sleep, I say: "Bhagavan   
Ramana, let me sleep in You." He is taking care.
