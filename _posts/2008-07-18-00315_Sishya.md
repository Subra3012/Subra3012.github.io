## Sishya

I'm a regular to do girivalam every month. I use ttdc's girivalam package.  
The guide in the bus would brief the passengers about Tiruvannamalai, the  
significance of girivalam, the mahans who meditated and lived in  
Tiruvannamalai et al. During my last trip, he said Bhagavan was the disciple  
of Shri Seshadri Swamigal. I heard the latter helped Bhagavan in getting him  
out of Patala Lingam shrine. Other than this, I never heard Bhagavan was  
anybody's sishya.   
Can one throw some light on this?

My dear Subra1905, as you correctly said that Bhagavan Ramana   
Maharshi was nobody's sishya. His Guru, if at all one can view this   
way, is the Arunachala Siva. Seshadri Swami, of course, along with   
some others, helped Him by bringing Him out of the Patala Linga cave shrine  
and thus showed Him to the world at large. There are several   
misinformations like this. One biographer (fortunately that biography   
never came out) had said that Bhagavan was working as a railway   
clerk and was married already before He came to Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.
