## Rules?

Is there anything i should know whilst posting here?   
I just read that we can not mention gurus that have not been dead for 50  
years, is that serious!?   
There are many teachers nowadays teaching self inquiry, it seems strange to  
say they can't be talked about in a Ramana Maharshi forum   
Ramana has spawned a huge upsurge in this timeless teaching of self  
invesitgation, i feel we should embrace it in all its forms?   
Im not challenging the forum, if thats the rules, then so be it...

Dear RobertAdam,   
Some stray references can be made in posts. Commentaries   
of others can be quoted with due reference to the source, and   
even here, it should be limited.

Dear Robert,   
I have refrained from responding to your query because it only creates  
controversy. But I made the rule for some very good reasons.   
As the title of this forum states, it is dedicated to Arunachala and Bhagavan  
Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
Arunachala is reputed to be Lord Siva incarnate in the form of a mountain and  
just being here is a blessing itself. Bhagavan was without doubt a real Jnani  
of the highest order. His words are available to everyone, in a clear and  
precise manner that go straight to the heart. The puranas are also there to be  
read and absorbed.   
It is my view and that of thousands of others, that no further elucidation is  
required, but there are always exceptions.   
So now we come to my responsibility.   
In my fourteen years of coming to Arunachala, 11 of which were spent inside  
the ashram, I witnessed the antics of many of these modern gurus, heard the  
stories of lust, greed and power and saw many things that deeply disturbed me,  
but it is not my job to stand in judgement of others, there is power far  
higher than me that will and does do that, as we have often witnessed here.   
This website in both its incarnations as ramana-maharshi.org and arunachala-  
ramana.org is considered to be something of a reference site and therefore has  
a responsibility to its visitors to neither knowingly or inadvertently lead  
them in the wrong direction.   
Finally and perhaps most important: It is said that to help someone to overcome the cycle of birth and death is  
the greatest service that you can render to God. It is also said that to  
disturb someone's faith in God is the one crime that is **never** forgiven. So  
I selfishly took the decision to limit the site and forum to the subjects  
listed above, all of which are safe.   
Graham

Dear Sri Graham,   
Namaste. I also thank you for your lucid clarification, which sets   
at rest, many many doubts and questions in the matter. Thank you.

Me (my heart) and anything per-ma-nent are uncompetible things. Please, just  
for a second try to forget your logic and meditate on it. If there is "me"

Mind never allows to trust oneSelf, which IS Bliss. Who wants bliss? The mind  
only, which is afraid of suffering. This mind wants to get permanent bliss,  
but agrees on at least temporary as well just for inicial period, does not it?   
It's OK, no problem. Let it desire, it is its nature. But why to be deceived  
with mind's desire? Why not to trust oneSelf that desires nothig, that IS  
everythig.

Quote  
But isn't it that all the imaginative separation is the veil of the bliss?  
This is very true.   
Quote  
Is there a step to be taken forward?  
In spirituality things are subtractive so a step forward should be taken in  
that sense only.   
Quote  
Who wants bliss? The mind only.  
Self is bliss. There is no choice on that. Mind does not separately create any  
desire for bliss.   
Quote  
If there is "me" bliss is always temporary.  
In waking state there is individuality. What is the alternative for  
individuality to exist without "me"? Or do you mean in waking state permanent  
bliss is not possible.   
Now this fact that "Self is Bliss", many many sages have  
understood/experienced and declared. Many other people who are also living do  
not experience bliss like saints. Why? So it is said that there is the veil of  
maya. So spiritual practices are undertaken to remove this veil. Then what  
becomes the indicator that the veil is getting removed? When the original  
thing shines as it is in all its purity. Self being bliss itself should be  
revealed as bliss itself. In that sense bliss becomes the indicator.   
If I smear a white cloth with colors and give it to you for washing, what is  
the indicator that the dirt is removed? The cloth will shine as white again.  
Plain and simple. If the cloth is smeared in a very bad way such that the  
original color is totally hidden, then somebody has to tell what was the  
original color. Otherwise a blackish color when partially washed looks  
brownish and one may think that the original color of the cloth was brown and  
leave half-washing. The sages have told us that the Self is Bliss. Now they  
must have felt it as Bliss and therefore declared so.   
Spiritual practices are not exactly analogous to cloth-washing but this is  
just for the purpose of illustration. I know the objection to be raised here.  
It is: Who will do the washing? If the mind does the washing, will it not add dirt  
instead of removing it? Self is always white. It is the desire to wash by the  
mind that makes it dirty.   
Let it remain open for an honest introspection along these lines.   
\- Self IS Bliss. So it must be "felt" as Bliss only, always. Do we "feel" it  
as it is, its true nature?   
\- If we just be still, will it be "felt" as Bliss, its true nature?   
\- Does spiritual practices add dirt of mind over the Self?   
Saints have been doing spiritual practices for ages. Even to declare that  
"Self is Bliss", sages have done spiritual practices. The truths of the Vedas  
have taken centuries to be established. Have the sages increased the veil over  
the Self by doing spiritual practices?   
(Do not treat it as serious arguments but joint discussions, not like bull-  
fight but bulls grazing together. I am not saying we are bulls, this is just  
for the purpose of illustration)

very interessting topic.   
you know that line of buddha: "there is no way to happiness, happiness is the  
way"   
I understant it in two ways...   
number one is: it is allready there   
number two is: if we feel miserable along the way we will end up feeling  
miserable (permanent)   
if we feel happy and good along the way, we will end up feeling happy  
(permanent)   
now both ways lead nowhere   
so what did the buddha mean?

The Self, as silentgreen said, is Bliss. Mind is not bliss. But   
Mind wants bliss, in million odd ways, (like women, tobacco,   
ice creams, picnics, cinemas, even books) and misses out the   
true bliss. In Sanskrit, these small blisses are santosham or   
happiness and Sukam or Anandam is the true Bliss.

The second way in "happiness is the way", seems to have been used figuratively  
like a highway.   
A highway supports all vehicles which run over it, itself remaining the  
substratum.   
The figurative highway is such that it is underlying all the roads.   
So there is no way to reach the highway, since if you want to reach the  
highway you are trying to reach the highway by walking over it.   
Then what is misery?   
Looks like a vehicle which broke down, tyre punctures or the highway getting  
covered with snow.   
In all the cases the highway is still there.

Quote  
Or do you mean in waking state permanent bliss is not possible.  
Of course not. In any state nothing permanent possible. Only temporary.  
Otherwise it is not a ÂstateÂ. Bhagavan was not a person in states. He is  
Bliss, he is impersonal consciousness.   
Quote  
\- Self IS Bliss. So it must be "felt" as Bliss only, always. Do we "feel" it  
as it is, its true nature?  
No. It must not be ÂfeltÂ, because It IS Bliss. It is not an object of  
perception.   
Quote  
\- Does spiritual practices add dirt of mind over the Self?  
What people call Âspiritual practicesÂ can be very different. I don't think  
self-inquiry can add dirt of mind over the Self... though if a person try  
hard, nothing's impossible:)   
What is the Âdirt of mindÂ? Distrust to the Self. Mind dare not to admit even  
a hint that You Are the Self. Really. Even for 1%. Why to Âfeel BlissÂ, You  
Are Bliss. Believe? Allow this thought to settle in mind. What tries to push  
it away?   
Quote  
Saints have been doing spiritual practices for ages. Even to declare that  
"Self is Bliss", sages have done spiritual practices. The truths of the Vedas  
have taken centuries to be established. Have the sages increased the veil over  
the Self by doing spiritual practices?  
Who told you about those saints, sages and ages? About maya, Vedas and  
spiritual practices? Who are you? Was it really told to You or to imaginary  
separate entity? Aren't you the One who created all this? If you say ÂI am the  
SelfÂ trust what you say. Really. Once only.   
Permanent Bliss Â is a ÂkindÂ of bliss that can disappear only with ÂI amÂ,  
the beingness itself. Correct? If such a bliss recognized, yes, it is a sign  
of spiritual progress.   
Quote  
Do not treat it as serious arguments but joint discussions  
Yes, yes. It is a simple discussion only. Just exchange of personal views.  
It's very nice of you. My great respect.

Having attained the Self, one can never desire anything since he   
has no mind-body consciousness. Such a desire, if at all it happens,   
is the desire of the Self. Kaduveli Siddhar married a dancer, begot a child  
etc., He did that without any desire, but only to satisfy the desire of the  
dancer.   
*   
Since we are all the Self, why should there be self enquiry at all?   
The Self enquiry is only to remove the dirt that hides the Self.   
The Self enquiry is basically an enquiry into the nature of non-Self.   
It is Anatma Vicharam. Atma does not need any Vicharam because,   
where is the 'second' to do Vichara?

Who is this "we"? If this "we" has no doubt in "We are Bliss", trust it  
completely, question of self-inquiry does not arise.   
If I do not feel "the world inside me" but feel myself as a separate entity  
which belongs to the world, self-inquiry helps to figure out what is what.

If everything is bliss, always, why does the "we" ever have a doubt that it is  
not bliss?   
And self-enquiry is needed to find what is what.   
After all, the "we" never has any doubt that it exists, and no enquiry is  
required to find that.

Quote  
Or do you mean in waking state permanent bliss is not possible.  
Of course not. In any state nothing permanent possible. Only temporary.  
Otherwise it is not a ÂstateÂ. Bhagavan was not a person in states. He is  
Bliss, he is impersonal consciousness.   
Quote  
\- Self IS Bliss. So it must be "felt" as Bliss only, always. Do we "feel" it  
as it is, its true nature?  
No. It must not be ÂfeltÂ, because It IS Bliss. It is not an object of  
perception.   
Quote  
\- Does spiritual practices add dirt of mind over the Self?  
What people call Âspiritual practicesÂ can be very different. I don't think  
self-inquiry can add dirt of mind over the Self... though if a person try  
hard, nothing's impossible:)   
What is the Âdirt of mindÂ? Distrust to the Self. Mind dare not to admit even  
a hint that You Are the Self. Really. Even for 1%. Why to Âfeel BlissÂ, You  
Are Bliss. Believe? Allow this thought to settle in mind. What tries to push  
it away?   
Quote  
Saints have been doing spiritual practices for ages. Even to declare that  
"Self is Bliss", sages have done spiritual practices. The truths of the Vedas  
have taken centuries to be established. Have the sages increased the veil over  
the Self by doing spiritual practices?  
Who told you about those saints, sages and ages? About maya, Vedas and  
spiritual practices? Who are you? Was it really told to You or to imaginary  
separate entity? Aren't you the One who created all this? If you say ÂI am the  
SelfÂ trust what you say. Really. Once only.   
Permanent Bliss Â is a ÂkindÂ of bliss that can disappear only with ÂI amÂ,  
the beingness itself. Correct? If such a bliss recognized, yes, it is a sign  
of spiritual progress.   
Quote  
Do not treat it as serious arguments but joint discussions  
Yes, yes. It is a simple discussion only. Just exchange of personal views.  
It's very nice of you. My great respect.

Quote  
Mind is not bliss. But   
Mind wants bliss, in million odd ways, (like women, tobacco,   
ice creams, picnics, cinemas, even books) and misses out the   
true bliss.  
If it's allowed to quate Nisargadatta: "The ambitions of the so-called Yogis are preposterous. A man's desire for a  
woman is innocence itself compared to the lusting for an everlasting personal  
bliss. The mind is a chit. The more pious it seems, the worse the betrayal"  
\-- from "I Am That" chapter 63.

Having attained the Self, one can never desire anything since he   
has no mind-body consciousness. Such a desire, if at all it happens,   
is the desire of the Self. Kaduveli Siddhar married a dancer, begot a child  
etc., He did that without any desire, but only to satisfy the desire of the  
dancer.   
*   
Since we are all the Self, why should there be self enquiry at all?   
The Self enquiry is only to remove the dirt that hides the Self.   
The Self enquiry is basically an enquiry into the nature of non-Self.   
It is Anatma Vicharam. Atma does not need any Vicharam because,   
where is the 'second' to do Vichara?

Who is this "we"? If this "we" has no doubt in "We are Bliss", trust it  
completely, question of self-inquiry does not arise.   
If I do not feel "the world inside me" but feel myself as a separate entity  
which belongs to the world, self-inquiry helps to figure out what is what.

If everything is bliss, always, why does the "we" ever have a doubt that it is  
not bliss?   
And self-enquiry is needed to find what is what.   
After all, the "we" never has any doubt that it exists, and no enquiry is  
required to find that.

Thanks everyone for their inputs. It was a fruitful discussion. Let us end it

How pleasant! A year old mail from last Spring that sprouts new leaves!   
I loved in particular the humor bubbling in the choices and reasons for  
choices, but it was Subramaniam's choice of a 4th book that sparked a reply  
from me.   
D. T. Suzuki's "Essays in Zen Buddhism" was a mainstay for me for many years.  
It's odd, in a way the texts are tedious to read with words and concepts I  
could barely grasp, like a slow sonorous chanting of sutras I saw on TV once,  
then -- suddenly -- a flash of light of insight of understanding that  
disappear almost before I could recognize them.   
Then, one morning, alone on a night shift, about 3 in the morning, I closed  
the copy of the essays I was reading - suddenly, I was up out of my chair  
dancing across the room, on the floor, on the table tops, singing a song.  
Surprised, I then scratched the words down on a manila envelope I pulled out  
of a waste basket:  **You are reality, beyond all belief   
You are the living tree, nourishing my green leaf   
You are the hight, the footstep and the path   
You are the answer, with no questions asked   
You are the beauty shining in each lover's face   
You are that certain place of no time or space   
 Smaller than an atom   
 Bigger than a star   
 Able to go slowly fast,   
 You stay quickly far   
You are, you are, you are...   
You are the holy rock   
You are the distant shore   
You are life itself and even death   
 pales before   
Your emptiness   
Ah, but my books? I dunno, I really don't know, many clamor for attention,  
the thick ones claim they have more to say and the thin ones say that their  
conciseness and brevity is what increases their value -- so, a couple of  
books, one thick, one thin, and a picture of Ramana -- sigh -- but which  
picture?

I have to search for the three volumes of Essays in Zen Buddhism.   
I feel like reading them once again. I bought it in Adyar Library   
of JK in Chennai about ten years back. The new copies would cost me at least  
Rs 2000/=.

Subramiam R.,   
I just checked Amazon for the heck of it - series 3 (the three volumes) costs  
25Â£ (used) and series 2 (the one I have) 5Â£.   
A little known work which I got almost by accident is his "Swedenborg, Buddha  
of the North", goes for 3.60Â£ - it's one of his earliest works and  
introduced me to Swedenborg, a difficult fellow to get to know.
