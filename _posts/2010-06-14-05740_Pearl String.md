## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Rama Krishna says no use of mere lecturing and scholarship

**" What can you achieve by mere lecturing and scholarship without  
discrimination and dispassion? God alone is real, and all else is unreal. God  
alone is substance, and all else is nonentity. That is discrimination.**   
"First of all set up God in the shrine of your heart, and then deliver  
lectures as much as you like. How will the mere repetition of 'Brahma' profit  
you if you are not imbued with discrimination and dispassion? It is the empty  
sound of a conch-shell.   
"There lived in a village a young man named Padmalochan. People used to call  
him 'Podo', for short. In this village there was a temple in a very  
dilapidated condition. It contained no image of God. Aswattha and other plants  
sprang up on the ruins of its walls. Bats lived inside, and the floor was  
covered with dust and the droppings of the bats. The people of the village had  
stopped visiting the temple. One day after dusk the villagers heard the sound  
of a conch-shell from the direction of the temple. They thought perhaps  
someone had installed an image in the shrine and was performing the evening  
worship. One of them softly opened the door and saw Padmalochan standing in a  
corner, blowing the conch. No image had been set up. The temple hadn't been  
swept or washed. And filth and dirt lay every where. Then he shouted to Podo: You have set up no image here,   
Within the shrine, O fool!   
Blowing the conch, vou simply make   
Confusion worse confounded.   
Day and night eleven bats   
Scream there incessantly.. . .   
"There is no use in merely making a noise if you want to establish the Deity  
in the shrine of your heart, if you want to realize God. **First of all purify  
the mind.** In the pure heart God takes His seat. One cannot bring the holy  
image into the temple if the droppings of bats are all around. The eleven bats  
are our eleven organs: five of action, five of perception, and the mind.   
"First of all invoke the Deity, and then give lectures to your heart's  
content. First of all dive deep. Plunge to the bottom and gather up the gems.  
Then you may do other things. But nobody wants to plunge. **People are without  
spiritual discipline and prayer, without renunciation and dispassion. They  
learn a few words and immediately start to deliver lectures. It is difficult  
to teach others. Only if a man gets a command from God, after realizing Him,  
is he entitled to teach. "**

## Pearl String

Dear I,   
Today, it just occured to me, we all, Bhagavans devotees, (not only Sri Ramana  
Devotees, but others as well) are like pearls beeds strung together with "Sri  
Ramana" thread.   
Really how fortunate are we? to be strung with Sri Ramana thread !   
Sometimes, its like, one who stays in Arunachala forgets how fortunate one is  
to be in that great town even residing there! Similarly, we all are just so  
fortunate to be in Sri Ramana family...   
really wonderful...   
Gratitude..

Dear Nagaraj garu,   
I agree with you.   
As guru ramana used to say "power cannot be denied" for the question why he  
had chosen "arunachala".   
Once Dr Raju said in this forum as below   
Quote  
Dear Srk Udai,   
 I am fully aware that body age is not related to spiritual understanding it is quite surprising that a 30yr old young person like you is endowed with so much understanding and i am also surprised to see people vegetating in Tiruvannamalai for the past thity years without any understanding whatsoever,leading a mechanical life there and **highly egoistic** because of the qualification of their just staying at Tiruvannamalai instead of their native place.You have a great future because your present is great.  
So living in arunachalam has advantages only when it goes hand-in-hand with  
our constant self-enquiry sadhana.   
Ramana's family consists of members who follow his teachings irrespective of  
which place they reside.   
If going to arunachalam can increase their faith/devotion and help in their  
sadhana then it is always suggested to visit the HOLY PLACE.

Dear everyone,   
Once Devaraja Mudaliar asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether it is   
really true that one who lives within three yojanas [about 21 miles]   
will attain liberation without diksha etc.." Bhagavan Ramana told   
him: Oye, where is the doubt? It is Supreme Court order. How   
can it be otherwise? (meaning it is Siva vachanam, in Sri Arunachala  
Mahatmyam."   
This is the point of different opinions in this Forum. Brahmasri   
Nochur says: "First consider with full bhvana that Arunachalam is   
the Self. (Verse 1 of Sri AAMM) Then this would automatically come true.  
That is with that bhavana, if you remain within three yojanas, you will attain  
mukti without any formal inititation."   
Verse 1 can be interpreted in two ways: 1\. Those who contemplate Arunachalam in the Heart......   
2. Those who consider with full bhavana that Arunachalam is the Self.   
There could still be many thousands who reside in Tiruvannamalai   
and do not become Bhagavan's devotees. This is like living in   
Kasi and not taking bath in Ganga! These people are called Kshetra Papis, the  
sinners in a Holy Place.   
Arunachala Siva.
