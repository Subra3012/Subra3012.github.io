Dear I,   
Today, it just occured to me, we all, Bhagavans devotees, (not only Sri Ramana  
Devotees, but others as well) are like pearls beeds strung together with "Sri  
Ramana" thread.   
Really how fortunate are we? to be strung with Sri Ramana thread !   
Sometimes, its like, one who stays in Arunachala forgets how fortunate one is  
to be in that great town even residing there! Similarly, we all are just so  
fortunate to be in Sri Ramana family...   
really wonderful...   
Gratitude..

Dear Nagaraj garu,   
I agree with you.   
As guru ramana used to say "power cannot be denied" for the question why he  
had chosen "arunachala".   
Once Dr Raju said in this forum as below   
Quote  
Dear Srk Udai,   
 I am fully aware that body age is not related to spiritual understanding it is quite surprising that a 30yr old young person like you is endowed with so much understanding and i am also surprised to see people vegetating in Tiruvannamalai for the past thity years without any understanding whatsoever,leading a mechanical life there and **highly egoistic** because of the qualification of their just staying at Tiruvannamalai instead of their native place.You have a great future because your present is great.  
So living in arunachalam has advantages only when it goes hand-in-hand with  
our constant self-enquiry sadhana.   
Ramana's family consists of members who follow his teachings irrespective of  
which place they reside.   
If going to arunachalam can increase their faith/devotion and help in their  
sadhana then it is always suggested to visit the HOLY PLACE.

Dear everyone,   
Once Devaraja Mudaliar asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether it is   
really true that one who lives within three yojanas [about 21 miles]   
will attain liberation without diksha etc.." Bhagavan Ramana told   
him: Oye, where is the doubt? It is Supreme Court order. How   
can it be otherwise? (meaning it is Siva vachanam, in Sri Arunachala  
Mahatmyam."   
This is the point of different opinions in this Forum. Brahmasri   
Nochur says: "First consider with full bhvana that Arunachalam is   
the Self. (Verse 1 of Sri AAMM) Then this would automatically come true.  
That is with that bhavana, if you remain within three yojanas, you will attain  
mukti without any formal inititation."   
Verse 1 can be interpreted in two ways: 1\. Those who contemplate Arunachalam in the Heart......   
2. Those who consider with full bhavana that Arunachalam is the Self.   
There could still be many thousands who reside in Tiruvannamalai   
and do not become Bhagavan's devotees. This is like living in   
Kasi and not taking bath in Ganga! These people are called Kshetra Papis, the  
sinners in a Holy Place.   
Arunachala Siva.
