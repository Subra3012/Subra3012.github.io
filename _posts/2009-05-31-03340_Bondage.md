**Bondage**   
\- _Sri Ramakrishna_   
Q. Sir, why are we in bondage? Why do we not see God?   
Master. Man's ego itself is Maya.   
It is the evil that shuts out the Light.   
Verily, with the death of the "I" all trouble cease.   
If by the grace of the Lord a man once gains the knowledge that he is not the  
doer,   
then he assuredly becomes a Jivanmukta, one freed in this very life, and  
transcends all fear.   
How to conquer the Ego   
\- If one ponders over this word "I", trying to track it down, one sees that  
it is only a word which denotes egotism.   
But it is extremely difficult to shake it off.   
So one must say, "You wicked 'I', if you will not go by any means, remain as  
the servant of God.   
The ego that feels itself to be the servant of God is called the "ripe I".   
\- If you find you cannot drive off this feeling of "I", then let it remain as  
the "servant I"   
There is not much to fear from the ego which is centered in the thought,   
"I am the servant of God; I am His devotee".   
Sweets cause dyspepsia, but not sugar-candy which is an exception.   
The "servant I", the "I" of a devotee, the "I" of a child   
each of these is like a line drawn with a stick on the surface of water;   
this "I" does not last long.   
\- Sankaracharya had a disciple who had been serving him for a long time but  
was not still given any instruction by him.   
Once, while seated alone, Sankara heard the footsteps of someone coming  
behind.   
So he called out, "Who is there?"   
The disciple answered, "It is I".   
The Acharya thereupon said,   
"If this 'I' is so dear to you, then either expand it to infinity, or renounce  
it altogether."   
\   
Self-enquiry "expands" the I to infinity.   
Bhakta surrenders the I at the feet of the Guru / God.

DEar sir,   
When does this "I" starts its occupation in human being. At the age of 2.  
Because if some one takes the baby's doll the baby cries or holds tightly.   
Before that age baby does not feel anything. But at the time parents feel  
happy. They say baby is very clever he knows how to look after things   
at this age. So the society also helps to grow this ego to viswaroopam. Later  
we feel how difficult is this.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Why wait for 2 years? The 'I' starts the game, as soon as   
god breathes life into it, say 3rd month of pregnancy of the   
mother. As soon as the babe is born, and held by mother   
on her laps, it looks for the breast to feed itself! Saint Manikkavachagar  
says in Tiruvandapahudi [Tiruvachakam],   
'every month the baby gets some misery, but the 'I' fights   
for its survival'.   
Arunachala Siva.
