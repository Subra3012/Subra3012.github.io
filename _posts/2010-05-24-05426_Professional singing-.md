by-2029-scientist.htm   
A futuristic American scientist has predicted that man could become immortal  
in as little as 20 years' time through nanotechnology and better understanding  
of the body mechanism.   
Ray Kurzweil, known to have predicted future technologies decades ahead has  
written in The Sun, 'I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20  
years we will have the means to re-programme our bodies' stone-age software so  
we can halt, then reverse, ageing. Then nano-technology will let us live for  
ever.'   
The 61-year-old, lauded by Microsoft [ Images ] founder Bill Gates [ Images ]  
as the smartest futurist on Earth said," We are living through the most  
exciting period of human history.   
'Computer technology and our understanding of genes -- our body's software  
programs -- are accelerating at an incredible rate.'   
The scientist says that already, blood cell-sized submarines called nanobots  
are being tested in animals. These will soon be used to destroy tumours,  
unblock clots and perform operations without scars.   
Ultimately, nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of  
times more effectively, he added.   
According to his theory called the Law of Accelerating Returns mankind will  
experience a billion-fold increase in technological capability for the same  
cost in the next 25 years.   
Nanotechnology will help in making humans achieve immortality said Kurzweil,  
'By the middle of the next century we will have back-up copies of the  
information in our bodies and brains that make us who we are. Then we really  
will be immortal.'   
'Nanotechnology will extend our mental capacities to such an extent we will be  
able to write books within minutes. If we want to go into virtual-reality  
mode, nanobots will shut down brain signals and take us wherever we want to  
go. Virtual sex will become commonplace. And in our daily lives, hologram like  
figures will pop in our brain to explain what is happening,' he said.   
The scientist also predicts that humans in future will become cyborgs, with  
artificial limbs and organs.

Dear prasanth,   
Your Joke post makes me visualize some two scenarios: 1. Every body becomes immortal. But they will not be self   
realized. So, the earth will become full and overflowing with   
duds.   
2\. Perhaps, they may stop future births too. Then the earth will be full of  
old people, a 70 year old Subramanian, a 90 year old   
Mr.X and a 120 year old Mr. Y.   
3\. If everybody is immortal, how can Kalki (the 10th avatara of   
Vishnu can come down, to kill people? So Puranas will become   
a falsity. Kalki cannot come down on earth.   
4. In homes, all old couples will be watching, TV serials ad nauseum. In T.V serials too, there will be 100 year old hero   
singing duet song with a 90 year old herione. Even if they   
use special advanced make-ups, there age is quite known to   
audience.   
5. Since everyone is immortal, no one can kill others. So,   
some great Tsunami or earth quake, or a number of Icelandic   
volcanoes have to erupt, to clear up the mess. Or super humans   
from Mars should invade the earth and burn the earth totally!   
Arunachala Siva.

If it happens, real estate business will go up. There would not be empty  
land.Everywhere we can see buildings only. Again some scientist will be  
awarded for his invention which may help people to die.

When the scientist   
When the scientist can create even God, why he cannot create unconditional  
heart and implant in human being so the whole world become heaven?   
whatever he creates it would have mind within which may create lots of  
problem.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Many singers and great poets have become dumbfounded in the   
presence of Bhagavan Ramana. Not because they are afraid.   
They only become choked with emotions. They could not sing   
or read their poems. It is like lighting a candle before the Sun.   
However, Bhagavan Ramana encouraged them all. He told   
Sampurnamma: Even if you do not understand head or tail, it   
does not matter, please read Ribhu Gita. Muruganar, the great   
poet (he was a Tamil teacher) came with a poem before Bhagavan   
Ramana when he came for the first time. It was Desika Padigam   
in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. Muruganar could not read even   
one line properly. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye, please give that   
paper to me." And then He read the poem written on Himself by   
Muruganar.   
Many great Tamil pandits cannot read the first Benedictory Verse   
of ULLadu Narpadu in one stretch without getting stuck. The words   
are closely packed and reading is very difficult. Understanding it   
is much more difficult.   
There is also one story about Professional Wailers. About this   
later....   
Arunachala Siva.
