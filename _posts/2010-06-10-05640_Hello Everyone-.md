Namaskar,   
I am Kshama 25 years old from Malaysia. I am taking baby steps into  
spirituality since my early 20's. I am still a learner and I do have many  
things to learn. In my initial search, I came across Bhagawan Ramana's Who am  
I. I have read it, and contemplated on the writings. I do think it's so  
profound and vast and I still am learning from the insights given.   
From my initial study, I have decided Advaita as the path that I should  
thread. I still have lot's to read. Perhaps members of the forum can suggest  
what should a beginner into Advaita read. I would really appreciate that.  
Thank you.   
Kshama
