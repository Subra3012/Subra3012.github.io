49. You are totally non existent. All these are, likewise completely non existent.   
All of this is totally non existent. Even an iota is absolutely non existent.   
50. The Self alone am I, the supreme Brahman. All of the three worlds are illusory.   
I am indeed the supreme Brahman. I am indeed the supreme Guru.   
51. The idea of the individual is ever unreal. The same notion of Siva is like wise.   
The concept of Vishnu is illusory. Everything is like the horns of hare.   
52. I am indeed ever perfect. I am indeed intersticeless. Ever-satisfied and formless, I am Brahman indeed. There is no doubt of this.   
53. I am indeed the supreme bliss. I am indeed of a momentary existence. I alone   
am. I am you only. You and I indeed non existent, verily non existent.   
54\. I am indeed inaccessible to speech; not formulated by speech or mind.   
I am indeed Brahman, the Self of all. I am Brahman indeed, the blemish-less.   
55. I am indeed Brahman, consciousness alone. I am indeed Brahman, the perpetual. 'This' is ever unreal. I am indeed ever stable.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
