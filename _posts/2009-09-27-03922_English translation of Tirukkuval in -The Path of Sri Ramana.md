## English translation of Tirukkuval in "The Path of Sri Ramana  
Author: Chuck Cliff         Date: September 27, 2009, 10:13:02 AM

Reading "The Path of Sri Ramana", I noticed the quotes from Tirukkuval --  
looking for more information and perhaps a complete text, I noted that the  
translations given in "The Path" are more concise and, hopefully, more  
precise than the translations I have found searching on the internet.   
The question is: were the citations in "The Path" translated for the English  
version or taken from another source?

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I looked into Tamil original books of Sri Sadhu Om. These are   
in 4 volumes unlike the English version. As regards the English   
version, I do not have the second volume.   
Regarding Tirukuval, which literally means the Holy Cuckooing,   
the nice sounds produced by koel (Cuckoo). The imagery is   
that the /lady-love, devotee sends the Cuckoo as the messenger to the Lover or  
Guru. Saint Manikkavachagar has also used this imagery, in Tiruvachakam, Koel  
Pathu, Decad on Cuckoo.   
Now coming to the poem proper, I find in Tamil originals there   
is no Tirukuval but there is one titled Kuyilodu Kooral, which means   
Telling the Cuckoo, that is messaging through Koel, Cuckoo.   
This poem has got 10 verses and this finds place in 3rd volume   
in Tamil, which is full of Sri Sadhu Om's poems, not rendered in   
full in English so far.   
The first verse roughly translates as under: "O Young Cuckoo, for my sake, go to the Master and tell him: "I am withering with exreme desire for his Grace. O blemishless effulgence  
of Grace, O my eye, Sri Ramanesa, the rich medicine   
of Hill, please come" O Cuckoo, won't you cuckoo this to my   
Master?"   
If you could give me one sample translation from the English book, I shall be  
able to tell you further It could be the same poem.   
Sri Sadhu Om is a versatile Tamil poet, next only to Muruganar. His third  
volume in Tamil which is full of poems is simply untranslatable. We should  
request David Godman and Michael James and Robert Butler to help us!   
Arunachala Siva. .

Dear Subrimaniam, I seem again to have wasted your time -- actually, it  
struck me while I was in the kitchen that I had not been sufficiently precise,  
but before I got back to the laptop you had already posted your lengthy reply  
On top of everything else, I mis-spelled the title of the work, Tirukku **r**  
al (my only plea is that my eyes are old)   
An example (I assume it is Michael James' translation)   
 The right way of punishing the wrong-doer is to   
do good to him and to forget his wrong.   
Tirukkural, verse 314   
But still, thanks for the extra information.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. One letter can make a lot of difference. It does not matter.   
As for Tirukural, it is one of the oldest works in Tamil, written   
sometime in 3rd Century AD, by the saint poet Tiruvalluvar.   
It consists of 1300 couplets divided into 133 chapters of ten   
couplets each. It is a work of ethics, nothing is said about God   
or liberation in detail. No doubt it starts with 10 couplets on   
Godhead but here again it is giving interpretations to presume   
it is Siva, or Narayana etc., etc., This work is praised by all   
Tamil scholars for its ethical value, regardless of whether they   
believe in God or not. Muruganar and Sri Sadhu Om have mastered   
it. Bhagavan Ramana used to quote some couplets occasionally.   
A number of English translations are available, the oldest being   
that of G.U.Pope, written in 1900 and he was a Jesuit Father working in  
Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu for missionary work. He has   
also translated Tiruvachakam and he used to keep a copy of   
Tiruvachakam along with Bible in his bedside!   
Arunachala Siva.
