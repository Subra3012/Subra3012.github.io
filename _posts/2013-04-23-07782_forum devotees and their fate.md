## forum devotees and their fate  
Author: ksksat27            Date: April 23, 2013, 05:59:42 PM

Dear all,   
In David Godman blog, there used to be a person Nandu Narasimhan and suddenly  
he expired. Atleast that news reached all of us due to some connection with  
his friends.   
but many devotees who come here may not have anybody in their circle know  
about this forum.   
Suddenly if something happens, we will not be there to convey the same to  
this forum.   
So if possible, everyone tell about this forum to a trustworthy relative or  
friend so that they will post about us when we would have left this world.   
this may appear silly but this has deep meaning.   
what happens is, we are all devotees of Sri Ramana.   
If one devotee falls down in the running towards moksha or slipped while  
alighting the boat, the other devotees will give hands, speaking like what  
happend to Mr. X Bhai ? Where is he not be found now? Has he been left out?   
That devotee with much fracture may be crying, but the other devotees come to  
him, lift him saying 'Bha don't worry, even if you are not having much  
strenght, you have come to satsang, we will take you along in our shoulders"   
Here the less scoring, and fail mark children are especially loved by  
devotees and God, for no one coming here will be left alone, he will be  
lifted up, grace marks added and somehow pushed by all our devotion to cross  
the final boundary towards the Absolute.

Dear Sri Krishnan,   
This is so sweet idea. I am deeply thouched by it.   
It is in the spirit of our Great Bhagavan. He always took care of  
everybody,and acceped all. His heart embraced everyone.   
When someone is going through hard times,he needs helping hand and comforting  
words from friends. And where can we find better friends then among people who  
are traveling on the same path,so to say.   
Thank You for such a beautiful and indeed friendly thoughts.   
With love and prayers,
 ---

ksksat27,   
Thanks for your response...just to add that abiding in the source is not at  
loggerheads with any activity...so does not preclude one from participating in  
this forum or elsewhere...the reverse of it is also true in that participating  
here or in any other forum does not preclude anyone from abiding in the  
source.   
Nice to know that you were in touch with udai...I have expressed a wish to see  
some messages from people like him...and since they are not part of this  
forum,some member who is in touch with them may facilitate any message they  
would like to share here in response to our wish...so that is the intent of my  
post.I am not a Facebook user but have seen how it spreads out as a sort of a  
maze branching out in multiple ways...am using whatsapp in a selective fashion  
...but this sort of a forum without all other bells and whistles(audio/video  
stuff) is best for serious interchange (provided it is used judiciously as is  
the case with anything in this world!)...thanks to graham,this is neat and  
organized and useful for any reader to select topics of interest.   
Namaskar

It has been a long time since I corresponded with Udai and he maintains a blog  
http://selfabidance.blogspot.in/ but it is not frequently updated.   
No doubt lot of social media groups related to Bhagavan have come up but I  
still like to use this forum to post not only post any interesting quote or  
teaching from Bhagavan, Annamalai Swamy or other great teachers but also get  
valuable pointers from other's postings.

This is what i feel also. This forum is very special place. Here,i always  
felt i am so close to Arunachala. I cannot even explain...   
Thanks to Sri Graham,i met wonderful people here.   
Greetings to all our friends who are still coming here but are not posting  
anymore,or are not members anymore!   
I wonder,does anyone knows what happened with Sri Prasanth?

welcome. but here the previous zest with which we used to share our opinions

This is what i feel also. This forum is very special place. Here,i always  
felt i am so close to Arunachala. I cannot even explain...   
Thanks to Sri Graham,i met wonderful people here.   
Greetings to all our friends who are still coming here but are not posting  
anymore,or are not members anymore!   
I wonder,does anyone knows what happened with Sri Prasanth?

I do not know who came to this forum and who left. I only know that  
Subramanian was there, Subramanian is there and Subramanian will be there.
