## Atama Jnana Upadesa Vidhi and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 06, 2008, 09:20:54 AM  
---  
Atma Jnana Upadesa Vidhi, is again a small treatise on Advaita by   
Sankara. It comprises of 72 axioms in prose form detailing the 'seer'   
'seen' concept mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi in 'Who am I?'   
A sample.   
Axioms 4,5, and 6 of Part IV says: That the Self is the Fourth means that It  
consists of Consciousness only and nothing else, like a homogeneous piece of  
gold. Thought it is the Fourth, It is not different from the three well-known  
viz., waking, dream and sleep. We call It the Fourth, because It is the  
Witness of the other three states, as Consciousness in proximity. One has to  
invariably arrive at a void, if the Fourth were a different state, as in that  
case, the truth about the Self could not be known.   
Axiom 13 says: A man of knowledge directly knows within himself that he has  
attained the Self-Knowledge.

## Prasna-Uttara Ratna Malika and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 05, 2008, 08:03:17 AM

Prasna-Uttara Ratna Malika is again a small book, comprising of 67   
slokas. The verses are in the form of two simple questions and two   
simple answers, in each verse. The book details the do's and don'ts for the  
seeker and the ultimate realization.   
Verse 45 :- "What is the source of all happiness? The merits of one's   
good actions. What causes misery? One's sins. By what will one be   
endowed with Lordliness? By the devoted worship of Siva."   
Verse 53:- "What is the most difficult thing for a man to do? To keep   
the mind always under control."   
Verse 54:- "What is the most adorable being? The Power of Pure   
Consciousness.   
Verse 58:- "Who is the Lord of Maya? The Supreme Being. What is the   
greatest magic? The ever changing universe. What resembles a dream   
experience? The activities of the waking life! What is the true being?   
It is Brahman, the Supreme Being."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, there are two posts from you, one on 'Stay' and another   
on 'Stay at Ashram'. In this connection, one 'seeker' has already asked how  
to go to Tiruvannamalai. Several forum members have given replies   
about going to Tiruvannamalai and staying in the Asram. I have also given my  
replies on 28th June. Please see that post from 'seeker' for details. The  
topic heading is: How to go to Tiruvannamalai?'   
Arunachala Siva.
