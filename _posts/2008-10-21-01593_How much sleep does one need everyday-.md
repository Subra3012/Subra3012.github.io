## How much sleep does one need everyday?

Bhagavan Ramana never had sleep in the usual manner of   
everyone, lying on his back. He had, on a few occasions, suggested   
that sleep between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. should be adequate. This   
rule is not everyone, like the labourer who does hard physical   
work, those who are sick and others. He has said that one should   
divide the night time of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. into three parts of 4   
hours each and sleep only during the middle period of 4 hours.   
He has also suggested that once you get up from sleep before than   
the normal waking time, say 5 am instead of 6 am, one should   
not go to sleep further! He also disapproved sleeping during day time.   
Please keep in mind, these are all only aids to meditation and   
other techniques. Presciptions may vary depending upon a person.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagawan used to sleep so deeply that his classmates in the school took his  
body away from the home to a ground and settle the scores   
by beating him badly while he was asleep because they know they cannot face  
him physically while he is awake and used to place his body again in the cot  
in his home,such is his depth of sleep.

Dear sir,   
When I was young in our family during shiva rathiri and vaikunda Akadasi, we  
used to be awake whole night.That day we used to have very light food once in  
a day. So until 12 we used to go to temple, singing bhajan, hearing some  
bhaktas stories. After that I used to fall asleep. That type of sleep now I do  
not have. Anyway, elders say, if you have keep awake on shiva rathiri day, we  
should sleep next day night only.   
Once in front of Bhagavan all devotees were awake whole night on shivarathiri  
day. Bhagavan was siting like a staue.   
Those people were so fortunate.   
Now a days, youngsters who are working IT. hardly sleep.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Dr. Raju and Ramanaduli and srkudai,   
Nice posts. Hindu religion and other faiths that have come up   
on Hindu religion, have always stressed the need for at least,   
early waking up, if not at 2. a.m. Of course, those were the   
days when there were no nightshifts in factories, IT companies   
or call entres. The work was confined to, from sunrise to sunset.   
Bhagavan Ramana and His devotees were living in Tiruvannamalai   
and the atomosphere was like that. Most of the inmates had only   
brain work and a few attended to physical labour like, kitchen   
workers and building masons.   
The idea behind early rising is to feel the Sun's warmth and also breathe   
the ozone in the atmosphere. Those were the days of no global   
warming and plastic wastes and nucelar spent fules. They were   
cleaning the front portion of the houses with cow dung, because   
cowdung in sun's warmth produces methane, a gaseous chemical   
that kill insects and cleans up the air. There are so many things like   
these. Today we are in a different situation. Nevertheless, it is   
good to wake up early and also have limited hours of sleep, wherever   
possible.   
Arunachala Siva.
