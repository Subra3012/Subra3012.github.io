## The nature of consciousness,mind and the need for Self-inquiry.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:09:37 PM

Mind is consciousness in movement.When that movement stops minding  
stops.Suppose we are walking   
and if stop walking legs will be there but the process,the function of walking  
stops.It is like pedalling a   
cycle.As long as you pedal the cycle moves,if you stop pedalling the cycle  
stops moving but cycle will be   
there.So when minding stops consciousness remains as a silent pool of energy.   
You are that consciousness.   
Minding is a function of consciousness but your nature is not the minding.   
The nature of minding is movement.If that movement is stopped due to any  
reason there is nothing like   
mind.Thought is the mind.If there is stilling of thought due to any reason  
there is no entity like   
mind(naiva manasam).   
In such a state we encounter static aspect of consciousness in full senses.   
The nature of such static consciousness is existence,Self-  
knowledge(awareness),bliss   
(Tranquility,peace).   
You think you are the mind. This fallacy that you are the mind gives the mind  
total freedom, because   
then there is no one to master it, to control it. There is no one! Mind itself  
becomes the master. It may   
become the master, but that mastery is just seemingly so. Try once and you can  
break that mastery  it   
is false.This breaking up of process of minding is possible in Self-  
inquiry.Then you will know for yourself   
about   
what is the nature of static aspect of consciousness and what is the nature of  
the minding which is just   
the dynamic function of consciousness.There is nothing wrong in minding but  
identity with that minding   
and thinking that minding as the me(thinker) is the wrong state of  
affairs.Then we go on minding   
(thinking) whether it is   
required or not.Self-inquiry stops that pathological minding,(thinking)   
and we develop mastery over the minding(thinking).If we master the  
minding(thinking) it is one of the   
best servant.But at   
present mind is behaving like a master   
without any control bringing so much disaster,disorder,chaos to the individual  
and society at   
large.Through Self-inquiry we develop the capacity to allow minding(thinking)  
when it is necessary and   
stop   
minding(thinking) where it has no role to play.For example thought i.e  
minding(thinking) has no role to   
play in human relation   
but we are relating with the other through thought only which definitely  
brings conflict,strife in the   
relationship.Then if we can posit in   
static aspect of consciousness during relating with the other,the relating   
is based on present moment and we have a healthy relationship.   
In science,technology we require minding and we should allow minding  
there.Once that task is over we   
should not go on minding but we should be back to our natural center of static  
aspect of consciousness   
and enjoy the serenity,tranquility,peace,bliss of it.This is possible through  
Self-inquiry.   
Then we become the master of our own mind which is superior than being   
emperor of the whole world.Existence feels fulfilled through us by becoming   
master of the mind.This is the purpose for which we are born on earth but   
we are preoccupied with doing all sorts of silly things which takes us no  
where   
from the present state of highly disordered life.

## Pure awareness--Ego awareness and Self-inquiry.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:02:11 PM  
---  
Suppose on a plain paper we mark a zero with a pencil,we feel   
that zero mark is really zero.If we carefully observe even when we think that  
mark of pencil indicates zero with no value   
its background is plain paper which is there even before marking zero by the  
pencil and it will be there even after   
erasing the pencil mark of zero.   
Similarly on the screen of awareness for functional purpose   
awareness mind is created whose essential nature is nothingness.That mind  
gives direction to the awareness   
so that awareness can function in the fleeting phenomenal reality.Mind has an  
utilitarian value in the phenomenal reality   
because awareness acts through it,just like pencil mark of zero on the plain  
paper has utilitarian value.Noe if we want   
have only plain paper we have to erase the pencil mark of zero.Similarly if we  
want to know the nature of awareness   
which is the background of mind,first we must know the   
nature of mind which is nothingness.Once we know that   
a gestalt in our attitude happens and we observe the   
nature of awareness which is the background of the mind.   
We direct our attention towards the source of mind   
which is awareness.The real can be known only through the false, so the ego is  
a must. One has to pass through it. It is a discipline. The real can be known  
only through the illusion. You cannot know the truth directly. First you have  
to know that which is not true. First you have to encounter the untrue.  
Through that encounter you become capable of knowing the truth. If you know  
the false as the false, truth will dawn upon you. So you have two centers. One  
center you come with, which is given by existence itself. That is the self.  
And the other center, which is created by the society, is the ego. It is a  
false thing - and it is a very great trick. Through the ego the society is  
controlling you. You have to behave in a certain way, because only then does  
the society appreciate you. You have to walk in a certain way; you have to  
laugh in a certain way; you have to follow certain manners, a morality, a  
code. Only then will the society appreciate you, and if it doesn't, you ego  
will be shaken. And when the ego is shaken, you don't know where you are, who  
you are.   
The others have given you the idea. That idea is the ego.   
That which is given by the existence is the screen of awareness.That which is  
written on your screen by the   
society is the false center of awareness or ego.If we are   
aware that our essential nature is screen of awareness   
that which is written on the screen will not affect us.   
Suppose there is news paper,we can see the letters on it   
and forget for the time being that writing and reading of   
letters are possible only because paper is there to write   
or read something on it.If we are aware of the fact then   
gestalt happens and we recognize that paper is the background of all these  
letters.Just as letters written with   
white chalk piece on a black board are very clear,we can see   
the contents of the mind,its thoughts,feelings with the background of  
awareness which is possible in Self-inquiry.   
The ego is not individual. Ego is a social phenomenon - it is society, its not  
you. But it gives you a function in the society, a hierarchy in the society.  
And if you remain satisfied with it, you will miss the whole opportunity of  
finding the self.   
And that's why you are so miserable. Try to understand it as deeply as  
possible, because this has to be thrown. And unless you throw it you will  
never be able to attain to the self. Because you are addicted to the center,  
you cannot move, and you cannot look at the self. This throwing is possible  
only through Self-inquiry.

## Tamil Writing Pad  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 14, 2010, 07:10:16 AM  
---  
I have created a Tamil Writing Pad through which one can write Tamil using  
English alphabets.   
Tamil is a bit different since some of the letters have multiple  
pronunciations.   
So multiple alternative English letters have been added for some of the Tamil  
letters.   
The special letters (from Sanskrit) of Tamil has not been included in this  
writing pad.   
You can try out the writing pad at: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_writing_pad.php   
Some examples are: 1\. ammaa [a2m-maa-]: **அ ம்மா**   
2\. maram [maram-]: **ம ரம்**   
3\. meesai [meesai]: **ம ேசை   
4\. thannnniir [thann-nniir-]: **த ண்ணீர்**   
5\. kullirkaalam [kullir-kaalam-]: **க ுளிர்காலம்**   
6\. vaazhaippazham [vaazhaip-pazham-]: **வ ாழைப்பழம்**   
Give your feedback in case of any issues.   
Have a nice day.

Dear silentgreen,   
Thank you very much. In fact, I tried two famous Tamil fonts,   
Azhagi and Kailai. But my comp. mechanic told me that I cannot   
use them since the virutal memory becomes too low, due to MB   
strength of these font-folders. I shall try yours and I shall also   
see whether I can change my machine to a more powerful one.   
The present one is Pentium 5, bought for my son, sometime   
in 2003 and I think it has outlived its utility.   
Arunachala Siva.

Some of the special characters have been included like, ja, ssa, sa etc which  
are used to form quite a large number of words and supported by unicode. For  
example: ஸ்ரீ [s2a-rii] is written using the character ஸ [s2a]

What is the difference from Tamil MS IME?   
The strong point is you do not have to remember the layout of Tamil keyboard,  
right?

I have not used Tamil MS IME till now.   
However I read about it and the differences seems to be as follows: 1\. For Tamil MS IME, you need to install fonts in your local machine; Tamil  
Writing Pad is on the other hand is internet based and there is no requirement  
to install any fonts.   
2\. Tamil MS IME is mainly for writing MS Word documents; Tamil Writing Pad on  
the other hand generates HTML code of alphabets which can be used to write  
Tamil alphabets in HTML pages; for writing MS Word document, the generated  
Tamil alphabets can be pasted directly on the MS Word document.   
3\. Tamil MS IME is for Windows machines only; Tamil Writing Pad can be used  
with any operating system which has the browsers installed: IE, Firefox etc.

I checked the website and was able to find the page and also generate some  
Tamil fonts from English.   
Maybe when you tried, the website was down for some time.   
This is the url for the writing pad: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_writing_pad.php   
This is the url for the symbol map, i.e. shows what english alphabets to type  
to generate tamil alphabets: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_symbol_map.php   
This is the url for some example tamil words generated from English: http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/software/online_tools/multilingual/tamil_example.php   
All the urls can be navigated from the main page through links.
