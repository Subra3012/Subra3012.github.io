It is not unreasonable or fanciful to compare the relationship of Tattuvaraya  
and Sorupananda with one   
that existed between Muruganar and Bhagavan. Tattuvaraya and Muruganar came  
to their Gurus,   
who both liked to teach through silence, and realized the Self soon  
afterwards. They both subsequently   
composed thousands of verses that either praised their respective Gurus, or  
recorded some aspect of   
their teachings. Tattuvaraya's poems in praise of his Guru and Sivaprakasa  
Swami, his Guru's Guru,   
include Venba Antadi (100 verses), Kalitturai Antadi (100 verses), Irattai  
Mani Malai (20 verses),   
Nanmanimalai (40 verses), Jnana Vinodan Kalambagam (101 verses), Kali Madal  
(232 verses), Ula (393 verses), and many many more. Then there was the Bharani  
that Bhagavan mentikoned; a 493 verse poem,   
(Ajnavatai Bharani, on the annihilation of ignorance by the 'hero'  
Sorupananda. Mokavatai Bharani was   
another 850 verse Bharani on the killing of delusion that includes in its  
text 110 songs in which a goddess   
instructs her followers in Vedanta. These 110 songs are often published  
independently as a Tamizh primer   
on Vedanta under the title Sasivanna Bodham. That is the work that  
Tattuvaraya composed while   
Sorupananda was having his meal. Selected translations of one Tattuvaraya's  
works on Vedanta   
(Amrita Saram) will appear in the next issue of the Mountain Path.
