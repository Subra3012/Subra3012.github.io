(The above article appeared in Mountain Path, April - June 2007.)   
*   
One day two destitute-looking Brahmins entered the Hall. It was known that  
they earned their livelihood   
by the wretched and socially demeaning occupation of bearing the dead to the  
cremation grounds.   
Both were extremely hungry after having discharged their duties.   
Custom demand that anyone entering a house recently visited by death should  
take a bath immediately   
upon leaving. This stricture applies particularly if one steps into the  
cremation ground, and more particularly   
if one is involved in removing and physically transporting the departed to  
this place.   
A heated argument had ensued between the two men about the propriety of coming  
to the Asramam to have   
a meal without having bathed. While one of them keenly felt the unseemliness  
of transgressing this hallowed   
custom, the other dismissed it as impracticable in view of their acute hunger.  
Assured of a meal in the   
Asramam, which was on their way home, they thought they might appease their  
appetite. They came to the   
Hall and sat down. One of them excitedly and abruptly said to Bhagavan: 'Swami, I have been insisting on the customary bath before we sit for our  
meal. Is that not but and prosper?'   
Bhagavan responded in a very soft tone,'No one can say you are unjust.' The  
other at once, is a greatly   
agitated voice, burst forth: 'The pangs of hunger are so intense and our entrails are being devoured. Is  
it wrong to eat when hunger   
is so gnawing?'   
Bhagavan quietly replied, 'Who says it is wrong? Not at all.'   
Shocked, looking at one another, they asked in one voice, 'But then who is  
wrong?'

Bhagavan answered: 'Don't think you alone are pall bearers. All of us are carrying these  
lifeless corpses. This body is a   
veritable corpse. Everybody carries it saying 'I, I'. Whoever has the 'I am  
the body feeling' is but a   
pall bearer. As long as one has not gone beyond this, one remains as impure  
and polluted pall bearer.   
The pollution of bearing this dead body cannot be washed away by a dip in any  
tank. Bathing in the holy   
waters of the Atman alone can remove this pollution.'   
The Brahmins, though initially feeling vindicated, were now startled and  
stared at each other. In an   
instant, the entire complexion of the issue stood transformed. Everyone  
without exception was equally   
polluted! All people shared their fate!   
Rid of their social inferiority they felt lifted up. The felicity with which  
Atma Bodha \-- the eternal truth   
\-- was transmitted to them and others in the Hall, and the sama drishti of  
Bhagavan, that knew no   
distinction between regular devotees and stray visitors, however socially  
unsavory their vocation might   
be, left those seated in the Hall astounded. That we are all bound to die is  
known to everyone. But even   
before we die, if we have not yet bathed in the waters of the Atman, we are  
already as though dead,   
bearing with us lifeless corpses lost in the "I am the body" consciousness.  
This was a revelation for one   
and all gathered in the Hall.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

The next minute, the two brahmins were nowhere to be seen. No one knew where  
they had gone,   
to the dining hall for food or elsewhere. But one thing was certain; for  
their spiritual hunger, Bhagavan's   
words had been unexpected feast.   
The exalted and unique greatness of a realized guru is sung gloriously in Guru  
Gita, Chapter I, Verses   
25 and 26, from Skandapurana: The place of residence of a guru is verily kash kshetra.   
His charanamruth (water dipping off his feet) is verily the holy Ganga.   
He is verily Vishweswara, Taraka Brahman, the Savior.   
His foot prints are verily Gaya, Akshayavata (the imperishable banyan tree)  
and Prayag,   
the king of holy waters. Salutations to such a guru again and again.   
The preceding story is not a mere instance of poetic flamboyance, but a stark  
truth, in relation to a   
Jnani like Bhagavan. \--being Brahman in manifested form -- enjoyed the  
purificatory effect of oblations   
in the holiest of holy waters. Need we doubt that the two pall bearers were  
purified the moment   
they came in for Bhagavan's darshan?   
For whom is the Hundi?   
It was the time of Ramana Jayanti and Devaraja Mudaliar desired the members of  
his family to join him   
at the Asramam to receive Bhagavan's grace, on this special occasion. He sent  
them a post card intimating   
his wish. Prompt came the reply expressing helplessness due to scarcity of  
funds. Mudaliar solved the   
problem this way: Break the family hundi containing the offerings to the  
family deity. Venkataramana   
of Tirupathi, and use the funds to finance the pilgrimage to Bhagavan.   
After implementing his plan, he went straight to Bhagavan and confided the  
nature of the correspondence   
between he and his family. Bhagavan neither approved nor disapproved. He  
appeared to have no reaction   
at all. There was not even the usual nod of the head but He merely maintained  
His customary silence.   
On arrival of the family, all were duly introduced to Bhagavan. Then Mudaliar  
said, 'Bhagavan, as for me,   
between Tirupathi Venkataramana and Tiruvannamalia Venkataraman, there is  
absolutely no difference.'   
Bhagavan replied with a smile: 'And did you not amply prove it by breaking the Hundi?'   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
