**Self alone is the real eye. Therefore Self, which is known by itself, alone  
is the real direct knowledge.But insentient people, who do not have Selfs  
sight,claim the knowledge of alien sense-objects to be direct knowledge.**   
 **Sadhu Om:** Sri Bhagavan here describes those who do not see through the  
eye of Self as insentient people, since they see only through the insentient  
physical eyes. Such people say that the knowledge of the objects of this world  
is direct knowledge [pratyaksha aparoksha jnana]. However, **the world seen in  
front of the eyes is not perceived directly, since it is known only through  
the medium of the mind and the five senses.** Self, the knowledge of ones own  
existence, is a more real and more direct knowledge than the knowledge of any  
alien object. **It is only after there is the first knowledge I am that the  
knowledge the world and all else exists can come into being, and hence no  
knowledge except I am can be direct knowledge;** Self alone is the ever-  
direct knowledge.   
 **Will an ornament become gold only when its form is destroyed by melting? Is  
it not [in reality] gold even while it is in the form of an ornament?  
Therefore,know that all the three [unreal] entities [the world,soul and God]  
formed by the mind, are likewise [in reality] nothing but existence-  
consciousness [Self].**   
 **Sadhu Om:** Even while they appear to be many different things,the world,  
the soul and God are in reality nothing but the one Self alone. It is wrong to  
think that they will become Self only after their diverse forms have  
disappeared. In truth, only Self, the substance or reality of those diverse  
forms, is real, while the forms themselves are ever unreal.   
 **If one does not take to the deluded life of modern civilization,if one  
rejects the liking towards the useless worldly knowledges [such as sciences,  
arts and languages],and if one removes the sense of differentiation [bheda-  
buddhi] between Siva [or Paramatma] and the soul [or jivatma], then only will  
the true import of Siva Jnana Bodham shine forth.**

OF GURUS SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By Sadhu Om and Michael James   
Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collection of Bhagavans spoken teachings  
that was thoroughly checked and revised by him during his lifetime. As such it  
has a unique place in the Ramana literature.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar covers in his Padamalai verses also about the the Self   
Knowledge which is the true knowledge. About "I am" -which is   
the true learning.   
Verse 425: To remain naturally merged in the Heart, without rising   
as "I", is the proper dharma.   
Verse 276: Padam declares: "To enquire and know oneself properly,   
nothing except the consciousness 'I am' is necessary.   
Verse 518: Taking the underlying consciousness ["I am"] as the one unique  
refuge for your attention, live your life.   
Verse 1055: The awareness of being, 'I am [sat bodham], which shines as the  
source of the intellect, is the divine grace that enables the attainment of  
true Jnana.   
Verse 2575: When the mind, one pointed and fully focused, knows the supreme  
silence in the Heart, this is [true] learning.   
Verse 1492: As a result of the knowledge obtained from this true   
learning, all false misery will fall away, and a profound peace will   
flourish.   
Verse 616: Bear in mind that the benefit of scholarship is prompting the mind  
to turn about, enabling it to be captivated   
by the light of the Self.   
Verse 1974: The benefit of learning is simply to become established   
within the Heart, in the concept-free state of reality, which is your   
own nature.   
Verse 1821: As long as the holy feet do not touch and come to rest squarely  
upon the head [of the jiva] what benefit can scholarship give?   
Verse 722: Only the learning of akhanda-vritti [unbroken   
experience], one's truth, the substratum, is true learning.   
Verse 342: The benefit of learning should be nothing less than to dwell upon  
the gracious feet of the one whose form is the wealth of pure consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.
