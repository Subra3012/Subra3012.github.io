**MASTER: "It is 'woman and gold' that binds man and robs him of his freedom.  
It is woman that creates the need for gold.** For woman one man becomes the  
slave of another, and so loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.   
"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion,he is no longer attached  
to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder,he is free from fear  
of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the  
other small.Which one will attract the iron? The big one,of course. God is the  
big magnet.Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can 'woman' do?"   
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, shall we hate women then?"   
MASTER: " **He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the eye of  
lust; so he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so  
many aspects of the Divine Mother.** He worships them all as the Mother  
Herself.

Sri Ramakrishna mentions about kamini-kanchanam, woman and   
gold in many of his conversations. But he took it too far, even   
not allowing women inside his room or joining the devotees.   
Only after Sri Vivekananda, women like Nivedita took up the   
path of SRK for their spiritual upliftment.   
Bhagavan Ramana, as SRK, did not ever touch the money.   
But in case of women, He did not differentiate between men   
and women. Many women devotees like Suri Nagamma, T.R.   
Kanakammal were allowed to sit inside the Old Hall and converse   
with women. He has said: Even women can take up sannyasa   
and attain their Atma Bodham. (Sri Ramana Gita). For that   
matter, Smt Visalakshi wife of Kavyakanta Ganapati was one   
of her earliest devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.
