The quest for the source of the "me"(whence am i)and the enquiry into the  
nature of "me"(who am i)is real enquiry.   
All thoughts are welcome.

OFFER YOUR PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TODAY ACCORDING TO GOD"S WILL...   
DRISHTIKON-- PERCEPTION   
There was a millionaire who was bothered by severe eye pain. He consulted so  
many physicians and was getting his treatment done. He did not stop consulting  
galaxy of medical experts; he consumed heavy loads of drugs and underwent  
hundreds of injections.   
But the ache persisted with great vigor than before. At last a monk who has  
supposed to be an expert in treating such patients was called for by the  
millionaire.   
The monk understood his problem and said that for sometime he should  
concentrate only on green colors and not to fall his eyes on any other colors.   
The millionaire got together a group of painters and purchased barrels of  
green color and directed that every object his eye was likely to fall to be  
painted in green color just as the monk had directed.   
When the monk came to visit him after few days, the millionaire"s servants ran  
with buckets of green paints and poured on him since he was in red dress, lest  
their master not see any other color and his eye ache would come back.   
Hearing this monk laughed said "If only you had purchased a pair of green  
spectacles, worth just a few rupees, you could have saved these walls and  
trees and pots and all other articles and also could have saved a large share  
of your fortune.   
You cannot paint the world green." Let us change our vision and the world will  
appear accordingly.   
It is foolish to shape the world, let us shape ourselves first.   
Change Your Perception..!!   
 **KEEP CONFIDENCE, TRUST IN GOD AND NEVER LOSE HOPE...**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Gold Wrapping Paper

**http://ramanujamchats.blogspot.com/2009/02/gold-wrapping-paper.html**   
The story goes that some time ago a mother punished her five year old daughter  
for wasting a roll of expensive gold wrapping paper.Money was tight and she  
became even more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box to  
put under the Christmas tree.Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift  
box to her mother the next morning and then said, "This is for you, Momma."   
The mother was embarrassed by her earlier over reaction, but her anger flared  
again when she opened the box and found it was empty. She spoke to her  
daughter in a harsh manner. "Don't you know, young lady, when you give someone  
a present there's supposed to be something inside the package?" She had tears  
in her eyes and said, "Oh, Momma, it's not empty! I blew kisses into it until  
it was full."   
The mother was crushed. She fell on her knees and put her arms around her  
little girl, and she begged her forgiveness for her thoughtless anger.   
An accident took the life of the child only a short time later, and it is told  
that the mother kept that gold box by her bed for all the years of her life.   
 **Whenever she was discouraged or faced difficult problems she would open the  
box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had  
put it there.   
In a very real sense, each of us, as human beings, have been given a Golden  
box filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children, family,  
friends and GOD.   
There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Desire God and You Shall Have God

The master said, "My child, if you desire after God, God shall come to you."  
The disciple did not understand his master fully. One day both went to bathe  
in a river, and the master said, "Plunge in", and the boy did so. In a moment  
the master was upon him, holding him down. He would not let the boy come up.  
When the boy struggled and was exhausted, he let him go. **" Yes, my child,  
how did you feel there;" "Oh, the desire for a breath of air!" "Do you have  
that kind of desire for God?" "No, sir." "Have that kind of desire for God and  
you shall have God."   
-Swami Vivekananda.   
(Notes from a lecture 'Sadhanas or preparations for higher life')**

Once in David Godman's blog, there were some heated discussions   
as to desiring the Self can be had by a seeker, since all desires   
are to be overcome. Eventually, Godman gave the verdict stating   
that desiring the Self is only the desire, a seeker could have according to  
Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
