## Handling of Depression

Depression, the pain of loneliness, helplessness, gloom and despair, is a  
malady that affects everyone, young and old. However, that depressed state of  
mind is not your true state. It is your birth right to vibrate with strength  
and courage, to face life like a Hero.   
Certain environments and disappointing conditions promote depression of mind  
and engender a sense of loneliness. At times, depression develops for no  
reason. However, the reason lies in the Karmic movement of the past.   
Most of us, especially ones who turn into spirituality when life seems futile  
also face depression. Spirituality should not be an alternative to depression  
in life. Life itself is Spirituality. Therefore one should keep a check of  
ones mental state and not ignore this depression hide the realities of life by  
" _turning to spirituality_ "   
Depression has three aspects: 1. Causal - involved in Karmas, backed up by ignorance of one's spiritual nature   
2. Astral - in the form of psychological imbalance   
3. Physical   
When you are depressed, your spirit sinks, and mental weakness restricts the  
flow of vitality in your body and leads to physical imbalance. If you develop  
the habit of being depressed again and again for a sustained period of time,  
various diseases may result.   
Depression is a contagious disease with a destructive influence on the people  
around you. It is said, "Smile and the world smiles with you; weep and the  
world adds a hundred sighs to your grieving soul."   
It can become an addiction. Often, it is cultivated as a habit due to lack of  
psychological education. There will be many times in your life that you will  
need to withdraw from other people in order to reflect and understand a  
situation better. However, falling into a depression is not the correct way of  
withdrawing.

magazine)

Dear Nagaraj,   
Depression is a state of mind with no activity. It is not mano-nasa,   
it is mano-sunya. This results in lethargy and lack of physical   
activities. The way out is to activate the mind, by chanting some   
mantras or slokas. Never keep the mind inactive. If mind is lost,   
due to mano-nasa, then one is the Self. Bhagavan Ramana said that   
the state of Summa Iru is the state at which the mind is bathing in   
Atmaswarupa, it is not inactive mind. (Who am I?) Many fellows   
who retire from office work, becomes neurotic because they do not   
know how to occupy the mind, particularly with spiritual activities.   
Social activities are one way, but even this becomes a boredom after   
some time, unless these are done as a spiritual sadhana. I am   
astonished at the kitchen workers in the Asramam, who, day in and   
day out, preprare nice breakfast, lunch and dinner, without break   
even on Sundays. Book shop workers have no holiday even on Sundays. Unless  
people do these things with spiritual fervour, they   
cannot do them tirelessly.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Yes its very inspiring to see the kitchen workers and book shop workers in  
Ramanashram. No holidays even! We should be least bit complaining here in this  
world   
Do not expect that you can be free of depression instantly and forever just  
because you want that to happen. However, you can treat the disease of  
depression or lessen its occurrence by adopting various methods: You can cure many cases of depression by a deeper insight into the problem or misunderstanding that is bothering you. In some cases you may ward off depression by the exercise of your will power alone.  
Practice Hatha Yoga and Praanayama (Breathing) exercises whenever you feel your spirit is beginning to sink. These Satvic exercises bring harmony and balance to the mind and body. Or swim or jog or go for an invigorating walk in a beautiful natural setting. Just changing the atmosphere often causes your depressed mood to give way to a cheerful one.  
Do not give serious attention to negative thoughts. They are baseless. As you help your mind regain its strength, these thoughts will disappear.   
Look your problems straight in the eye and realise that adversity is a great teacher with a divine purpose. It helps you to overhaul your personality so that things hiding in your consciousness are brought to the surface. When you are strong enough, Nature has mysterious way o bringing you the right challenging situations for your evolution. Through each difficult situation, Nature seems to whisper, " _Can I tell you a secret? It is going to be a little painful, and perhaps depressing, but there is no choice. You have to know it. "_  
...... To be Continued (Handling Depression Artistically)

Dear Nagaraj and hello to everyone,   
I found that depression to be the flip side of grand egotism - rather than  
feel that you are an amazing, truly wonderous individual ( and all the conceit  
that comes with that arrogance), a depressed person will say "I am worthless  
and beneath contempt" \- both of these very self-centred perspectives.   
I used to experience depression habitually, but good practice has got me out  
of these bad habits. I met a friend the other day who stated that she "suffers  
from depression". I found myself ranckle at the term "suffers"\- as if it were  
a disease foisted upon an individual, independently of that person. She  
receives CBT - cognitive behavioural therapy - and although I may generalise -  
it's still about feeding the ego with positive thoughts rather than negative  
thoughts - the ego is still present!   
I am so grateful that spiritual practice ultimately provides a way out of this  
mess....   
PB

i totally agree that depression is an experience of being self centred and is  
the other side of arrogance.   
there is some deep conditioning / force of habit that some of us may possess  
which may lead to repetitive behaviour - including feeling of depression.   
spiritual practices break past karma / conditioning, perhaps.   
i too am struggling with some of this....

Dear Munagala,   
Please translate : Vana durga maha mantra to english for those who do not  
understand, I am intrigued as to the meaning of this mantra   
\   
"Om Hreem dum uththishta purushi kim svapishi Bhayam may samupasThitham,   
yadi sakya masakyam va tanmay bhagavathi samaya swaha"   
Thankyou,   
Paintbrush

Dear Munagala   
This roughly translates like this - (Very limited sanskrit knowledge Excuses  
Please )   
Om - Pranava Mantra   
Hreem / Dum - These are Bija Mantras   
uththishta purushi - The Goddess who awakens everyone/ Who rises everyone  
above who pray to her   
kim svapishi Bhayam may samupasThitham - Then how can fear / or dreams come to  
one who prays to the Uththishta Purushi   
yadi sakya masakyam - Suppose possible becomes impossible   
tanmay bhagavathi samaya - reach out to Bhagawati   
Maybe somebody else will be able to translate it better I feel Udai can do  
it better!

Dear Matthias,   
What I feel is this: You are correct that the ego-cloud is part of the same awareness.   
(being born earns us the unborn state - a very nice saying)   
By saying that there is ego-cloud is simply a statement of facts which does  
not refute the non-duality of awareness.   
The ego-cloud is simply finely "mixed" thought coating.   
Even with it the awareness remains non-dual.   
It is like clean air and polluted air.   
A mountain person when coming to city feels that the air is heavy.   
If he tells the city person that he is breathing heavy air,   
the city person (if he has never gone outside), may not understand it,   
for he is also breathing air from the non-dual space involuntarily.   
However the fact remains that the air is polluted.   
It partially covers the Pure Consciousness.   
How to sense it?   
Everyone can sense thoughts in the consciousness so there is no need of proof.   
However there is a another good indication.   
The Self is said to be of the nature of Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-  
Bliss)   
Everyone experiences being and consciousness at all times and may not feel  
anything missing with respect to these attributes.   
I feel ananda is the crucial factor.   
Everyone wants peace and happiness.   
If peace and bliss is not manifesting spontaneously from within, it is because  
Pure Consciousness has been "mixed" with thought coating.   
(Ideally Pure Consciousness is always free but we are talking from the  
relative plane)   
Coming back to the city person.   
If the city person goes to a nearby hill and feels the difference;   
coming back to the city, what can he do?   
Will he always put an oxygen mask on the face?   
or, carry a light-weight oxygen cylinder on the back?   
or, go to oxygen booths and breathe fresh oxygen now and then?   
(which can happen anytime in near future)   
or, plant trees and make the city green and the air fresh? (a good step)   
The plight of the city person seems to be helpless.   
Here is where the novelty of self-enquiry comes in.   
If self-enquiry is broken down into two logical divisions: 1\. All thoughts come from the root "I" thought   
2\. With "Who am I?", enquiry, the root "I" merges in the Heart (and becomes  
one with Self).   
(And the entire process should ideally happen seamlessly with non-dual  
awareness.)   
Then we find that self-enquiry as explained by Bhagavan is indeed very novel  
(even intellectually).   
It bridges the gap between the scattered thoughts, the ego-I and the Pure  
Consciousness.   
It also shows the path to follow (heart route) to seekers who are identified  
with body-consciousness.   
This is novel since previously lot of confusions prevailed as to where to fit  
the ego in the scheme of things.   
The first division gives great hope to a meditator, since he need not go on  
detecting thoughts one by one and try to erase it with an imaginary eraser;  
since when ego-I is got hold off, the scattered mind should become gathered  
(ideally vanish from the conscious mind) immediately.   
Neither does the meditator need attempt to fly off from thoughts.   
The second division gives an even greater hope, since "behind" the root "I"  
itself lies the Infinite Being,   
and the entire ego self can be merged in the Heart.   
(The second division I feel is also the bridge between Jnana and Bhakti.   
Jnani's merging is equivalent to Bhakta's surrender though with some  
differences in specifics)   
Upon maturity, the entire process should ideally happen seamlessly, with non-  
dual awareness, without any ego conflict, as a single step and without any  
time delay.   
Sri Sadhu Om used the term Self Attention which is very appropriate to  
summarize the entire phenomenon.   
(To a Yogi, who always abides in the Self, the enquiry is not required  
anymore.)   
However in spite of the best intentions of the enquirer, ego conflict can take  
place if the enquiry is not properly done and gets stuck in the mental level.   
Now what is the relation between Self-Enquiry and purity of mind?   
Ideally Self-Enquiry is a direct process and does not require any other aid.   
(With repeated practice Self-Enquiry itself acts as a purificatory process)   
However with purity of mind, self-enquiry becomes easier.   
The bliss and expansion of the deeper self that is felt with purity of mind  
naturally draws the mind inwards and keeps it in the inner stillness.   
That is why in Patanjali Yoga Sutras Yama and Niyama has been placed before  
Dharana and Dhyana.   
Also we find in the life of Sri Ramakrishna that he used to master different  
sadhanas in days which could have taken years and lifetimes by others. This  
can only happen due to the purity of the mind. When the mind is pure, the  
specifics of the external forms of sadhana does not matter any more.   
Om Shanti. ..

what you say comes froma very clear mind and understading of the path   
I would not add anything to it and it can stay there as it is   
I just htink for myself, that the "view" of atma vichara is important...that  
there is just self, self searchign self   
therefor if we pin down special attainments or a special state...we are on the  
wrong track...because we search for something that is totally beyond our  
reach....jet we try to reach it...   
and that effort is on one side a big problem and on the other side it is  
selfrealised activity...the only activity we should do....   
so our effort should be to reach what is allready there but never  
reachable..and htis is the only effort we should do.....(and it is crucial for  
me, even if I meditate, sometimes 3 or 4 hours a day, even if I meditate Iam  
that....even if I struggle to reach it, Iam that...allready the self  
allways...when the paradox of meditaiton arises and vanishes Iam totally  
it...)   
as in the case of ramana maharshi and other fully realized beeings..we should  
aspire nothing less but this final attainment: to be allways in bliss of the  
self....you see but this is a very high state of realization and very very  
seldom   
and we should keep in mind that we have our karma and no matter what happens  
we are allways the self, so nothing can harm us   
like the famous buddhist saying (I have to translate from german into english  
so it may come out a little wrong): if it is the best for me to die, let me die   
if it is the best to life, let me life   
so if I reach total realisation tomorrow: ok, if I struggle the rest for my  
life: ok...both is just a mind trick   
as what we are is totally beyond illusion and reality....moksha or maya,  
samsara and nirvana it is the root of it...   
and jet not reachabel by our limited efforts, but this kind of effort is the  
only effort we should do...but we should not forget that we will never reach  
it with effort, maybe we reach it through grace...but even this has to be  
proven to me...as I believe that it is always the case...I believe that the  
"grace" is the very fact that it is allways the case....that we cannot attain  
it, because we are allready there and that is the grace...not some miraculous  
happening that will make this miserable matthias into a jnana,that is not  
grace for me....grace is the very fact that Iam allways the Self and that I  
cannot do a thing to earn it or to avoid it...I may feel bliss or I may feel  
like a dog...iam allways allready selfrealized activity...I may acknowledge it  
(nirvana) or be ignorant of it (samsara)....   
and I think that this view is as important as the actual atma vichara or  
meditational praxis....
