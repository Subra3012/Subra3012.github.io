A young man came to a novice guru and asked: How do I know the Self?   
The guru answered: Find out what remains alive after you die.   
The young man was frightened and promptly left the place.   
When the senior guru came to know about this, he asked the novice guru,   
Why did you tell him so?   
The novice guru replied: Sir, I have seen seekers coming to you again and again but never getting their  
doubts cleared.   
So I tried to give such instruction which will end their seeking once for all.

Humor : Chasing rabbits   
There is a zen saying: A hunter who chases two rabbits catches none.   
But what if two hunters chase different rabbits and catches the same.   
A boy who was highly spiritually-minded had to marry due to family pressure   
but was given complete freedom to choose the girl.   
The boy decided to marry only a highly spiritually-minded girl.   
He found a Meerabai-like girl who was also being forced to marry by her  
parents and relatives.   
They agreed to marry each other.   
After marriage, the girl who was a great devotee of Sri Krishna went in search  
of Lord Krishna.   
The boy who was a great devotee of Shiva went in search of Lord Shiva.   
They ended up catching the same "rabbit".

Dear silentgreen,   
A good anecdote. Even in daily life, like spiritual pursuit, to serve   
both God and mammon are not possible. No one can serve two   
masters. Some one was asking a guru: "Why in Hinduism alone,   
there are several gods?" The guru replied: "All are one and the   
same god. It is like having sugar candies of many colours. Each   
child would like a particular colour of candy. But all candies are   
sweet, only colours are different." When someone asked Bhagavan   
Ramana whether he, who was doing Rama Japa could switch over   
to Ramana Japa. Bhagavan Ramana replied: "Why do you think   
Rama and Ramana are different? Continue what you have already   
been doing."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
I agree with you. Fingerprints on the thumb of a person are   
different for each person. No two fingerprints agree. This is   
a great invention of God. And that is why, finger prints are used,   
even to find out criminals. In certain modern hightech offices,   
instead of attendance registers, ordinary or mechanical, they   
use finger prints to know the correct time of entry of an employee   
and his exit from office.   
Arunachala Siva.

We fail to value our culture, history, traditions etc   
To ape western culture has become order of the day. Rama and krishna are  
dismissed as myths just to get Muslim/christian votes.   
The harm these politicians are doing to our culture is really bad.   
I desire a strong spiritual dictator to rule India for some years to get rid  
of all non-sense that is going on.   
Dictator?   
I like Ramana. He would not interfere with people. He would let people do  
what they wanted.   
No dictator will solve anything. Interference/compulsion will not solve  
anything.   
Dictator yourself.

2\. All agricultural loans availed after 1st Jan 1991, will be waived.   
 Even those who have paid will get refunds!   
3\. All agriculturists above 60 years give a life pension of Rs 1000 per   
 month!   
4\. I will not opt for PM's post - Deve Gowda   
 I will not opt for PM's post - Chiranjeevi   
 I will not opt for PM's post - Varun Gandhi   
 Prime Minister post? No way - Rahul Gandhi   
 I will not opt for President's post - Narendra Modi.   
 I will not opt for the post of Chief of Army Staff - Karunanidhi   
5. A voter in Bangalore - I have got two photo ID cards. Can
