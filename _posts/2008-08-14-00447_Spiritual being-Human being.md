## FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE

WHAT IS REAL FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.   
As a spiritual seeker when we get rid of this bodily consciousness is the  
freedom.   
The day we reach it and remainn is the independence.   
Am I right. This is my imagination.   
siva siva arunachalasiva.

Dear Kannan05, There is no freedom no bondage, no   
independence, no dependence, if one could shed   
all thoughts that bind people.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel and DRPVSSN Raju, For whom is this question?   
To me. Who am I?   
Who am I? is the Brahmastram of Bhagavan, the invincible   
weapon!!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju and non duel, the Spirit and the Human discussions   
of yesterday, made me to remember a French professor, about   
whom, my English professor quoted during my college days.   
This French professor did not know much English and he was   
conducting a class with English students. One day, a student   
was making fun in the class and he wanted to punish him.   
He suddenly forgot the phrase Get Out! and so he got out of   
the class, and from the corridor, he was shouting at the student: "Get in, Get in!". Simlarly a student who was asked to rephrase   
the follwing English sentence, with a negative, without changing   
the meaning: The Angels always like the Saints.   
The correct answer would be somewhat: The Angels did not ever   
dislike the Saints.   
Instead, the boy wrote: The Devils always hate the Saints!   
In retrospect, I feel that the entire discussions on Spiritual and   
Human beings are like this.   
Arunachala siva.

Dear Raju, Yesterday, in a post under this Topic, I referred   
to Cow Lakshmi as reincarnation of Echammal and this is   
not correct. Cow Lakshmi, as Bhagavan Himself has confirmed   
was a reincarnation of Keerai Patti (the Grandma of the greens).   
Again, as you have correctly said, Bhagavan was not with Cow   
Lakshmi, till her very end, becuase, unlike Mother Azhagamma,   
she did not have any gushing vasanas, towards the last few   
minutes or hours and so Bhagavan left her to merge in the Self,   
peacefully, without any last minute help.   
Arunachala Siva.
