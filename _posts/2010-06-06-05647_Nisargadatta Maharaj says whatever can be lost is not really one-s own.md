## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda on The Great Teachers of the World

**THE GREAT TEACHERS OF THE WORLD (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club,  
Pasadena, California, February 3, 1900)   
Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses**   
Krishna teaches us not to shirk our duties, but to take them up manfully, and  
not think of the result. The servant has no right to question. The soldier has  
no right to reason. Go forward, and do not pay too much attention to the  
nature of the work you have to do. Ask your mind if you are unselfish. If you  
are, never mind anything, nothing can resist you! Plunge in! Do the duty at  
hand. And when you have done this, by degrees you will realise the Truth: "Whosoever in the midst of intense activity finds intense peace, whosoever in  
the midst of the greatest peace finds the greatest activity, he is a Yogi, he  
is a great soul, he has arrived at perfection."   
Now, you see that the result of this teaching is that all the duties of the  
world are sanctified. There is no duty in this world which we have any right  
to call menial: and each man's work is quite as good as that of the emperor on  
his throne.   
Listen to Buddha's message  a tremendous message. It has a place in our  
heart. Says Buddha, " **Root out selfishness, and everything that makes you  
selfish. Have neither wife, child, nor family. Be not of the world; become  
perfectly unselfish. " A worldly man thinks he will be unselfish, but when he  
looks at the face of his wife it makes him selfish. The mother thinks she will  
be perfectly unselfish, but she looks at her baby, and immediately selfishness  
comes.** So with everything in this world. As soon as selfish desires arise,  
as soon as some selfish pursuit is followed, immediately the whole man, the  
real man, is gone: he is like a brute, he is a slave' he forgets his fellow  
men. No more does he say, "You first and I afterwards," but it is "I first and  
let everyone else look out for himself."   
We find that Krishna's message has also a place for us. Without that message,  
we cannot move at all. We cannot conscientiously and with peace, joy, and  
happiness, take up any duty of our lives without listening to the message of  
Krishna: " **Be not afraid even if there is evil in your work, for there is no  
work which has no evil.** " "Leave it unto the Lord, and do not look for the  
results."   
On the other hand, there is a corner in the heart for the other message: Time  
flies; this world is finite and all misery. With your good food, nice clothes,  
and your comfortable home, O sleeping man and woman, do you ever think of the  
millions that are starving and dying? Think of the great fact that it is all  
misery, misery, misery! **Note the first utterance of the child: when it  
enters into the world, it weeps. That is the fact  the child-weeps. This is a  
place for weeping! If we listen to the Messenger, we should not be selfish.**   
Behold another Messenger, He of Nazareth. He teaches, " **Be ready, for the  
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.** " I have pondered over the message of Krishna,  
and am trying to work without attachment, but sometimes I forget. Then,  
suddenly, comes to me the message of Buddha: "Take care, for everything in the  
world as evanescent, and there is always misery in this life." I listen to  
that, and I am uncertain which to accept. Then again comes, like a  
thunderbolt, the message: "Be ready, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Do  
not delay a moment. Leave nothing for tomorrow. Get ready for the final event,  
which may overtake you immediately, even now. That message, also, has a place,  
and we acknowledge it. We salute the Messenger, we salute the Lord.   
 **And then comes Mohammed, the Messenger of equality**. You ask, "What good  
can there be in his religion?" If there were no good, how could it live? The  
good alone lives, that alone survives; because the good alone is strong,  
therefore it survives. How long is the life of an impure man, even in this  
life? Is not the life of the pure man much longer? Without doubt, for purity  
is strength, goodness is strength. How could Mohammedanism have lived, had  
there been nothing good in its teaching? There is much good. Mohammed was the  
Prophet of equality, of the brotherhood of man, the brotherhood of all  
Mussulmans   
 **Mohammed by his life showed that amongst Mohammedans there should be  
perfect equality and brotherhood.** There was no question of race, caste,  
creed, colour, or sex. The Sultan of Turkey may buy a Negro from the mart of  
Africa, and bring him in chains to Turkey; but should he become a Mohammedan  
and have sufficient merit and abilities, he might even marry the daughter of  
the Sultan. Compare this with the way in which the Negroes and the American  
Indians are treated in this country! And what do Hindus do? If one of your  
missionaries chance to touch the food of an orthodox person, he would throw it  
away. Notwithstanding our grand philosophy, you note our weakness in practice;  
but there You see the greatness of the Mohammedan beyond other races, showing  
itself in equality, perfect equality regardless of race or colour.   
 **Remember the words of Jesus: "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!" **This  
very moment let everyone of us make a staunch resolution: "I will become a  
Prophet, I will become a messenger of Light, I will become a child of God,  
nay, I will become a God!"

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says whatever can be lost is not really one's own  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 06, 2010, 01:09:31 AM

Questioner: I am a retired chartered accountant and my wife is engaged in  
social work for poor women. Our son is leaving for the United States and we  
came to see him off. We are Panjabis but we live in Delhi. We have a Guru of  
the Radha-Soami faith and we value satsang highly. We feel very fortunate to  
be brought here. We have met many holy people and we are glad to meet one  
more.   
Maharaj: You have met many anchorites and ascetics, but a fully realised man  
conscious of his divinity (swarupa) is hard to find. The saints and Yogis, by  
immense efforts and sacrifices, acquire many miraculous powers and can do much  
good in the way of helping people and inspiring faith, yet it does not make  
them perfect. It is not a way to reality, but merely an enrichment of the  
false. All effort leads to more effort; whatever was built up must be  
maintained, whatever was acquired must be protected against decay or loss.  
**Whatever can be lost is not really one 's own; and what is not your own of  
what use can it be to you? In my world nothing is pushed about, all happens by  
itself. All existence is in space and time, limited and temporary.** He who  
experiences existence is also limited and temporary. I am not concerned either  
with 'what exists' or with 'who exists'. I take my stand beyond, where I am  
both and neither.   
The persons who, after much effort and penance, have fulfilled their ambitions  
and secured higher levels of experience and action, are usually acutely  
conscious of their standing; they grade people into hierarchies, ranging from  
the lowest non-achiever to the highest achiever. To me all are equal.  
**Differences in appearance and expression are there, but they do not matter.  
Just as the shape of a gold ornament does not affect the gold, so does man 's  
essence remain unaffected. Where this sense of equality is lacking it means  
that reality had not been touched.**   
Mere knowledge is not enough; the knower must be known. The Pandits and the  
Yogis may know many things, but of what use is mere knowledge when the self is  
not known? It will be certainly misused. Without the knowledge of the knower  
there can be no peace.   
Q: We were told that of all forms of spiritual practices the practice of the  
attitude of a mere witness is the most efficacious. How does it compare with  
faith?   
M: The witness attitude is also faith; it is faith in oneself. You believe  
that you are not what you experience and you look at everything as from a  
distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the  
witness only and the understanding acts. You need nothing more, just remember  
that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself: 'Who am I?', the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease  
to be the object and become the subject of all that happens; once having  
turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found  
yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the  
subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.   
Q: Krishnamurti says that Guru is not needed.   
M: Somebody must tell you about the Supreme Reality and the way that leads to  
it. Krishnamurti is doing nothing else. In a way he is right -- most of the  
so-called disciples do not trust their Gurus; they disobey them and finally  
abandon them. For such disciples it would have been infinitely better if they  
had no Guru at all and just looked within for guidance. to find a living Guru  
is a rare opportunity and a great responsibility. One should not treat these  
matters lightly. You people are out to buy yourself the heaven and you imagine  
that the Guru will supply it for a price. You seek to strike a bargain by  
offering little but asking much. You cheat nobody except yourselves.   
Q: How can I come to see myself as you see me?   
M: It is enough if you do not imagine yourself to be the body. **It is the  
'I-am-the-body' idea that is so calamitous. It blinds you completely to your  
real nature. Even for a moment do not think that you are the body. Give  
yourself no name, no shape. In the darkness and the silence reality is  
found.**

Nisargadatta' statement is not correct in one aspect.   
Before seeking, we have 'lost' the Self for ourself. But Self is   
our own, it is ours. So the 'lost' Self can be 'gained' because it   
is our own.   
Arunachala Siva.
