Hello everyone,   
I have desired to be in the company of those who are on the path to find Him,  
and I have joined this forum in the hopes that this company may be found here.  
I hope to learn from each of you so that I may find God in more and more ways.  
I hope to be humbled and to be of service to those who are truly trying to  
seek God, and I wish to find fuel for which my love of God may burn more fully  
from.   
Aleksandr

silentgreen/Friends,   
Nice post by silentgreen explaining it in his usual simple and uncomplicated  
fashion.   
It is good to review the questions and visit the Fundamentals-The Basic  
question is -Who is a Jnani?Is he an individual and even after his jnAnA  
whether the play of the ego with its choices and preferences continue?   
No analogy will be complete,yet we may consider the Ocean and the Waves as  
analogous to the Self and the Egos.An Ego that is identified with the wave can  
never realize that it is the 'Ocean' unless it ceases that identification  
somehow.In ceasing to identify itself with the 'Wave' it comes to realize that  
it is the Ocean,A Whole without any second thing.   
Now comes the Key question-Having identified itself with the Ocean, will it  
again identify itself with that 'particular Wave' that it originally  
identified with?What will be its relationship with the other waves that are  
part and parcel of that One Ocean?   
The JnAni is one who has identified himself with the Ocean;no way he can come  
to identify himself with the 'Wave',even if he is aware of the waves.Where  
then is the question of his posing a 'risk' to the waves which are all part  
and parcel of himself?Where then is the need for him to follow 'Ahimsa' as a  
Dharma-as such Dharmas are only conducive to the survival of the 'Wave' and  
not the Ocean that now he is.Where is the question of paramarthika and  
vyavaharika for him-All are just the action of the Ocean itself,not just his  
'particular' wave but the dance of the Other waves as well.All his actions are  
automatically the activity of the divine.He realizes that all actions are that  
of the divine only.   
Here is an excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> God alone has become all this-maya, the universe, living beings, and the  
> twenty-four cosmic principles. **' As the snake I bite, and as the charmer I  
> cure.**' It is God Himself who has become both vidya and avidya. He remains  
> deluded by the maya of avidya, ignorance. Again, with the help of the guru,  
> He is cured by the maya of vidya, Knowledge.   
> Ignorance, Knowledge, and Perfect Wisdom. The jnani sees that God alone  
> exists and is the Doer, that He creates, preserves, and destroys. The  
> vijnani sees that it is God who hasbecome all this."  
Namaskar.

Friends,   
Swami Vivekananda says: Quote  
> I am the whole ocean; do not call the little wave you have made "I"  
Hari maharaj,Swami Turiyananda(another disciple of Sri Ramakrishna) has this  
to say about Swamiji: Quote  
> âWhenever Swamiji used the pronoun âI,â he was identified with Brahman  
> and used the word from the nondualistic standpoint.   
> âYou can exercise free will in two ways, either by identifying yourself  
> with him or by surrendering yourself. As long as you keep yourself apart  
> from God, you   
> have no freedom of the will"  
To say even in ordinary parlance,I have the Freedom to choose Tea or coffee  
-one has to assume that the supply of the same is available in the market!What  
sort of a choice that is when it is dependant on so many factors over which  
one has absolutely no control;one may at the most say that one can pick what  
is made available."yallabhase nijakarmopaattaM"(Be content with what comes  
through actions already performed in the past-Bhaja Govindam)   
Namaskar
