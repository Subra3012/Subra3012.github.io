In all temple Pujaris take water from out side of Garbhagraha and do the pujas  
to God. After all the rituals the same water is being distrubuted like a holi  
water.(Theertham) Like water people also go from outside to temple and pray  
whereas   
people comes as same before entering the temple. But ordinary water, flowers  
are called prasad and people give lots of respect. I think they do not have  
mind, we people go with mind and coming with also same mind.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Anything that is offered to God becomes Nivedanam. The god   
does not eat the food or sweets or smell the flowers. It becomes   
holy only by God's mere presence and our devoted offering. The   
best offering to God is to offer our mind or ego. This is the real   
Atma Nivedanam. We do not do that. Instead of offering the mind   
to God, we think about the footwear left outside the temple (lest   
it be stolen), or the women's ornaments in the opposite row.   
What to do? Unless the mind/ego is conquered, no puja, no   
temple worship is complete and pure.   
First the single light is shown to the God. This is unity. Or the   
one mind. Then the five lights (pancha kalpuram) is shown to\   
God. This is symbolic of the need to control the five senses.   
Then the camphor light. The camphor burns and becomes reduced   
to nothing. Like this, the mind/ego should be burnt without leaving a trace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
As you said we have to offer our ego/mind to God. All Gods point to their legs  
by their left hand means come and surrender your mind then after He shows His  
Abhaya varam by His right hand. Other than God who will accept people's  
ego/mind. Our mind is dirty and filthy still God accepts us. That is why He is  
called karuna sagara.   
In the way of doing namaskaram we put our head i.e. mind outwardly but inside  
it plays own rythem. Seeing this double drama of people He uses His Ankush and  
pasam. It is His grace He wants us to save us from this samsara.
