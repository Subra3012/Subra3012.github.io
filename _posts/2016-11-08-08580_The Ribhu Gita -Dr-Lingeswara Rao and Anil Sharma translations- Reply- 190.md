31. You are Brahman, the 'I'. There is no doubt of this. This is Brahman indeed.   
There is no doubt of this. All is mind. There is no doubt of this. All is  
Brahman.   
There is no uncertainty in this.   
32\. As it shines apart from Brahman, it is illusion. All is illusion from  
top to bottom.   
There is neither body nor the five elements nor the mind, being only illusory.   
33. Not there is the existence of the intellect or the senses. Nor there is liberation,   
being just Brahman. There can be not a moment of uncertainty, because of which   
thought is naught.   
34. Know that egoism is unreal; that being so conceit is naught. Nor there is   
thought or remembrance and therefore no ageing. There is no doubt of this.   
35\. If vital air is there, there is life. The sense of smell being, smell,  
there is.   
If there be eyes, there are beings. Ears being, hearing exists.   
36. If skin exists, there is the presence of touch. If tongue exists, there is the   
ability to taste. If there is individual, there is life. If there are feet,  
there is walking.   
37. If there are hands, there is action. If there is a creator, there is the possibility   
of creation. If there is something to be protected, there is the protector  
Vishnu.   
If there is something to be devoured, there is the devourer, Siva.   
38. All is Brahman. There is no doubt of this. All is indeed Brahman alone.   
If there is something to be worshipped then there is worship. If there is  
something   
to be illumined, there is the illuminator Siva.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
