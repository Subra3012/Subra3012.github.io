## Lessons from the Brahma-Vishnu Tussle: S. Raman.

(The article appeared in Jan.-Mar. 2008 issue of Mountain Path)   
The Sri Arunachala Puranam mentions, as he mythological origin of Arunachala,  
the Tiruvannamalai Hill,   
the tussle that took place between Brahma and Vishnu on 'who was the  
greatest?' This argument lased   
from Ardra Darsanam to Maha Sivaratri. It has always fascinated me, not the  
least for the numerous   
lessons that it contains. In this article, I venture to suggest that there is  
more to it than meets the eye,   
especially when it is looked who do not know the story, let us retell it.   
contd.,

Once there was a tussle between the Lord of Creation, Brahma, and the Lord of  
Protection, Vishnu.   
Brahma maintained that since he was the creator, without him there would be  
nothing to protect,   
therefore he was the mightiest. Vishnu contested this, saying that since  
nothing created could   
remain without his acts of protection, he indeed was the greatest. This  
developed into a heated   
argument. As the situation deteriorated, the Lord Supreme (Maheswara) decided  
to intervene   
and he decided to appear before them as an infinite column of light. Bhagavan  
elsewhere described   
this as being accompanied by a thunderous explosion. Maheswara suggested to  
the contenders   
that they might resolve their argument by taking part in a contest of trying  
to find either end of the   
column of light, and that whosoever succeeded could indeed be declared the  
winner. Since both of   
them were, in their own minds, superior to all others neither of them could  
identify the newcomer,   
and so agreed to this fair way of settling the issue. Vishnu took the form of  
a boar and went digging   
in the earth to trace the bottom end of the column, and Brahma took the form  
of a swan and flew up   
to seek the top end of the column. Even after a long time, neither was  
successful. Vishnu got tired   
of the venture and realized that the new entrant was obviously mightier than  
himself and therefore   
he was not in a position to boast of being the mightiest. Having learnt his  
lesson, he retired from   
the contest.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Meanwhile during the flight upwards, Brahma saw a cactus flower (thazhambu)  
floating down from   
the above, and invited it to be a witness as to having sighted the top of the  
column, after convincing it   
with the argument that 'if something comes from above, there is a top and it  
had been seen.' When   
Brahma went down along with the flower, Maheswara realized the trick being  
played by Brahma and   
cursed him, saying that he would never be worthy of worship and there would  
therefore be no temples   
dedicated to him. It was also ordained that, for having been a false witness,  
the 'thazhambu' would   
be prohibited from use in Siva pujas. Thus both the gods were shown that they  
were not the mightiest.   
The column of light had appeared on a Arudhra darshan day (usually the day  
ahead of Ramana Jayanti   
day), and cooled itself down in the form of a Hill on a Mahasivaratri day.  
The cooling down was in response   
to the earnest pleadings by all the devas led by Vishnu as no one could stand  
the heat and light of the column,   
which was at its peak especially after the trick played by Brahma. This event  
is depicted in all Siva temples,   
in the form of Lingodhbhavar, installed on the peripheral pradakshina route  
directly secure to the wall   
behind the temple of main idol of Siva in a temple complex. Also, that is the  
main deity traditionally   
worshipped on the night of the annual Maha Sivaratri day

The lesson from this story is that, in a given situation, one is expected to  
play one's role and to   
respect the responsibilities that others have. That is, there is as much  
independence as there is   
interdependence. Realization of these moral precepts benefits any community.  
Now, what about   
the possibilities of other lessons? Also, suppose that there is a reversal of  
roles of two gods in the   
above event. For instance, could Vishnu have gone upward instead of Brahma,  
and Brahma downward   
in place of Vishnu? This is the most unlikely and quite unnatural, as i will  
explain.   
Why so? Just like any person is driven by their own vasanas, as it would be  
natural to presume that the   
gods too have their tendencies, as long as they see different gods instead of  
the only One. Our   
mythological descriptions of the gods attribute protection qualities to  
Vishnu, and that includes creation   
of wealth. That is the reason for the goddess Lakshmi being his consort.  
Likewise, the generation or   
procreation aspect of Brahma include the ideas and the learning of new methods  
and procedures.   
Is this why the goddess of learning Sarawathi is Brahma's consort? Against  
this background, let us   
consider the process and the result of the tussle.

Arunachala Siva.

Protection of anything or anyone presumes material stability. It starts with  
having some infrastructure   
including land, buildings etc.,and proceeds further with the creation of  
wealth in some form or orther   
in order to engender a feeling of security. Businessmen tend to understand  
this better than others;   
although when taken to its extreme ends by the avaricious, it can lead to the  
exploitation of people.   
Lakshmi, also known as Sri Devi, being one consort of Vishnu the other one is  
known to be Bhudevi,   
who has direct relationship with earth and thus the world. Thus, anything  
worldly, wealth related,   
down to earth tends to be related to the source of wealth, so it is no wonder  
that Vishnu went digging   
through the earth to find the base of the column of light.   
Likewise, creation not only belongs to the realm of physical growth, but also  
that of the development   
of ideas which generate the seeds of thinking, contemplation, and such similar  
traits. The generally   
tend to elevate a person. Ideas form the core of learning, and are  
characteristic of something essentially   
nebulous and fuzzy like thought, which can take shape only when given the  
physical form. Until then it   
has a cloud like character, with no specifically definable form or shape.  
This aspect has more to do with   
the logical nature of things. That is why we describe a person as being in  
cloud when engaged in deep   
thinking. Thus, anything that is related to knowledge or learning, and  
associated with being up in the   
clouds, is the purview of Brahma who, being the consort of the goddess of  
learning, went up towards   
the sky in order to establish his supremacy. Hence reversal of the roles of  
these two gods would not have   
been natural. Now, let us look at the progress and the fruits of the efforts  
of these two gods.

Arunachala Siva.

Vishnu persisted with his efforts, and at some point he realized the futility  
of his work. He was able   
to see clearly that there was a greater power than his. He returned and  
surrendered as a loser ti   
the Infinite. Is not surrender what is expected of anyone who is able to see  
clearly the finiteness of   
oneself. What is the general experience of any person who is very wealthy,  
but is struck by a tragedy?   
He not only learns that all his wealth cannot get him what he needs, much less  
happiness that he desires   
so much. He begins to see the futility of belongings and eventually develops  
detachment from things   
that are not ultimately useful.   
On the other hand, what was the experience of Brahma? He saw a flower falling  
from above, his intellect   
started working in a very logical way, and he coached the flower to be a false  
witness buttressed by a   
convincing argument. He returned with this witness and strove to get himself  
declared the winner.   
How could it ever have happened to the consort of goddess of learning?  
Obviously, there is a lesson here   
for us. If the pursuit of knowledge is not undertaken in the right spirit and  
is confined to ephemeral things,   
there is always the danger of it becoming a double-edged sword. Intelligence  
can become perverted,   
in Sanskrit 'yukti becoming kuyukti', and that marks the fall of a person.  
Knowledge usually picked up   
through worldly senses and things must progressively and ultimately graduate  
to that of knowing oneself.   
If that does not happen, then there is always potential for trouble. It will  
make a person argumentative and   
cunning, ready to coax others into colluding in what is believed to be the  
only right way of behavior, but   
actually is immoral. This is what possibly has been illustrated by Brahma's  
experience.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Action is needed to develop one's well being. It starts with the development  
of comfort for living,   
initially in order to meet basic needs and later on, develops into a yearning  
for more comforts and   
luxuries. Even when this go unchecked and may develop into avaricious ways, a  
sudden shock may come   
to the person in the form of some event, usually in the nature of tragedy. At  
that point, the futility   
of all the material things acquired thus will become apparent. For the  
majority of people, this seems to   
be the way; except that it may take a long time to reach the stage of maturity  
and acquisition of real   
knowledge. But that is the safest path, as it starts with certain ground  
realities. In the pursuit of path,   
knowledge and understanding develop and the mind is prepared for the ultimate  
action of surrender.   
The path taken by Vishnu is representative of this trajectory.   
However, knowledge of the finite and the infinite, if not properly backed my  
maturity of mind, cam   
be dangerous. When that knowledge develops in a person having the right state  
of mind, there is   
the possibility of instant realization of the Self, as they say, by the time  
the second leg is placed after   
the first one while mounting a horse, as in the example of King Janaka. In  
spite of this quick result,   
knowledge can work like a double edged sword, as has been shown in the case of  
Brahma. Further,   
it must be realized that this type of knowledge is only at the intellectual  
level and, at that level, one can   
only ask questions oneself. The answers that are received must again be  
regarded as intellectual and   
hence ephemeral. The right answers will evolve by themselves to the  
questioner, as and when he is ready   
to receive them as experience. At that point, it is said by the seers, that  
there may neither be Brahma nor   
Vishnu!   
In this context, we may recall how Bhagavan when he relatively ranked karma  
and jnana paths, stated   
that the latter was more direct than the former. In ranking the other methods  
in between, He showed how   
all of them are nothing but the variants of the karma path, differing only in  
the ways of practice.   
It may not be out of place to point out that following the grossest method can  
lead a person to the more   
subtle methods, finally resulting in the realization of the ultimate  
knowledge.   
Has the Brahma-Vishnu tussle then got one more lesson for us? Vishnu symbolic  
of path of karma, and   
Brahma, symbolic of the Jnana path, both start with a handicap, namely their  
individual egos. During   
the competition, Vishnu realizes this, and ultimately surrenders. Does it mean  
that the karma path, however   
arduous and long, has the benefit of mellowing and maturing a person even when  
he is not so ready to   
begin with? The subtler method of the Jnana path is more direct, but one must  
be aware of the consequences   
of wrong leads that the self assumed or arrogant intellect may provide. Does  
a fall such as the one that happened to Brahma await a person, who continues  
to look for answers on the intellectual plane?   
All these show that the mythological descriptions and associations have packed  
in them a lot of associative   
information. When earnestly tapped with right state of mind, they can offer  
new perspectives on spiritual   
endeavors.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.

Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi the Goddess of Wealth. Brahma's consort is  
Saraswathi, the Goddess of Knowledge. In this world, if you have any one of  
these two powers - Wealth or Knowledge, you can control and rule. Still, with  
both these powers, you can not fathom the greatness of Almighty.
