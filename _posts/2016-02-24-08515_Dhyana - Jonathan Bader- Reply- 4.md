The six types of Samadhi mentioned in YS. 1.17 and 1.42 may all be attained by  
means of Samyama.   
Sankara, for his part, does not seem particularly concerned to distinguish  
Samadhi from other,   
more general, terms denoting meditation. In his comment on the Brahma Sutra  
(BS.2.3. 29),   
he cites as examples of Samadhi passages which prescribe dhyana and  
nididhyasana: those based   
on object centered consciousness (Samprajanata) and those which reject all  
contact with the objects   
(asamprajanata). (Yoga Sutra 1.18).   
Samyama exemplifies object based meditation, for it strives to establish an  
identity. Prasamkhyana   
best represents the approach independent of object orientation. This  
meditation is characterized   
solely by Viveka Khyati. 'discriminative discernment'. The function of  
Prasamkhyna is to discriminate   
between the pristine nature of the Self (Purusha), and that of Prakriti, the  
very source of all material   
objects.

Arunachala Siva.
