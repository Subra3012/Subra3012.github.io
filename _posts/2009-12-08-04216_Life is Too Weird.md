## Life is Too Weird

I talk to myself a lot. I talk about the virtues of meditation and what the  
mind is. .. I talk about why we are not the body and not the mind, like I am  
trying to convince someone. I think I do it out of habit now. ..   
And then, I wake up. Whilst I am talking suddenly I get the feeling of waking  
up. Wow, it's frightening. Like a near death experience. Bang ! I am  
awake. Talking about it makes it happen.   
And I can't believe it. I can't believe my own consciousness, what am I doing  
here ? What am I ? Why am I awake ? In a universe of a billion stars what  
the hell am I doing here ?   
Suddenly I feel awake and aware, looking out through these animal eyes - what  
am I doing.   
I find it quite scary, and then try to go back to sleep. .. it's too scary.

what is scared is not you....just a shell.   
and it will come and go naturally, the more you meditate and think about a  
sage like ramana maharshi.   
this "I think and then it happens" is a quiet natural thing...it happens to me  
also...when I think about the truth I abide in it...and it is not scary it is  
wonderfull....borderless space....freedom and stillness..   
I wish you a safe and blissfull journey   
matthias

Dear rideover,   
The questions in para3 of your post, are they not from your mind.   
But you are not the mind. Hence ignore and proceed with faith   
and conviction in Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
