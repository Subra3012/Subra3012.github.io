Religion is set to become 'extinct' in nine nations, including Australia and  
Ireland, a study using census data has found.

nine-nations-census-data-shows#ixzz1HPUQpFYf   
The countries in question include Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic,  
Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland.   
The study looked at census data dating back a century and investigated the  
rise in those respondents claiming to have no religious affiliation.   
The results, which were reported at an American Physical Society meeting in  
Dallas, US, claimed that religion will become almost non-existent in the nine  
countries listed as more and more people claim not to follow any form of  
religion.   
Richard Wiener from the University of Arizona said: In a large number of  
modern secular democracies, there's been a trend that folk are identifying  
themselves as non-affiliated with religion; in the Netherlands the number was  
40 per cent, and the highest we saw was in the Czech Republic, where the  
number was 60 per cent.   
Researchers did, however, admit the study only provided suggestive results  
and recognised it did not represent the network structure of modern society  
with the way it calculated each person being influenced equally by all other  
people.

Dear prasanth,   
Do not worry. Another four or five tsunamis triggered by 9.9. R. earthquakes  
will make every one to believe in God, some god.   
The closed churches will be reopened, the priests will be held in   
high esteem, Hinduism will further flourish and so the other theistic   
religions.   
Fear is the key.   
I shall show you fear in a handful of dust... said T.S. Eliot.

We have feared for so long, we have worshiped conceptual deities for so long,  
it can't last. This is going to pass.   
The time comes when man will need to learn to lean on himself. To know  
himself.   
Upcoming events only will make man to say "i am tired of all this" and that is  
when surrender will happen. Great changes will happen. Consciousness will  
flower. Religion as we know it will die. It serves no purpose for man. It  
became the hideout of treacherous ones. The religion has distorted, to fit its  
purpose, the teachings of great jivanmuktas. They said: love yourself, watch  
the watcher, seek the seeker, be still, know thyself, don't try to fix things  
- cut the root.

There has always been a certain percentage of people who believe and a certain  
percentage of people who don't believe.   
This has always been the human condition. Always. I seriously doubt that  
balance will change on any permanent level. By that I mean   
There won't be a time when everyone believes or no one believes for the rest  
of history. Nothing to worry about.

Dear Om Hridayam,   
Srimad Bhagavatam says in this eon, people will forget righteousness, people  
will forget god and will even speak ill of gods, will indulge in immorality of  
all kinds, like thieving, murdering and adultery. The brahmins will eat cow's  
flesh, the lowly will rule the country, the cows will start yielding less and  
less milk, the grains will not grow, the diseases will increase in number and  
variety.   
Still with all that, as you said, some percentage of population will follow  
bhakti marga if not jnana and yoga. When even this pecentage becomes zero,  
the Kalki - the tenth avatara will appear in south India near Tambrabharani  
river, i.e in Tirunelveli-Kanya Kumari districts of Tamizh Nadu, on a  
horseback and wielding a   
sword and kill people and then reconstruct the world with a new generation of  
righteous people. The world will not end. But the population will become  
quite thin, with only a small percentage of the total remaining to rebuild the  
world.   
You must have also heard about the novel Fifth Horseman. A story where fifth  
horseman is none other than Mohammer Gadaffi of Libya. If the fifth horse  
man appears, then one can conclude that world's mass killing of population  
would commence.   
But the hearsay news like that the world will be destroyed in 2012 etc., are  
not true.   
[\b]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan says in Who am I: At the time of death, mind   
carries the prana and goes way [to take a new birth.]. In case there   
is no mind and prana is indrawn into the Self within, there is no   
reincarnation at all. The first classification is only ignorance.

Dear prasanth,   
Once Devaraja Mudaliar asked Sri Bhagavan: "You have been telling   
grace is ever flowing, grace is ever flowing, but I am not able to realize  
it."   
Sri Bhagavan said: "Yes. Grace is ever flowing. But, Oye, you do not   
obstruct its flow."   
'you' here means 'I' of the questioner. The ego. The ego obstructs the flow of  
Grace from Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

All unhappiness is due to the ego; with it comes all your trouble. What does  
it avail you to attribute to the happenings in life the cause of misery which  
is really within you?

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan says in Arunachala Mahatmyam, Verse 4: The ego creates the world and the world binds all beings.   
The English translation is: Because they bind the beings of the worlds, know that the relentless karmas  
become the bondage for Jivas. The effulgent Arunachala is that of which the  
mere sight suffices to cause them to become non existent.   
Arunchala Siva.
