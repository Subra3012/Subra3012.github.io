## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Religion to become 'extinct' in nine nations, census data shows

Religion is set to become 'extinct' in nine nations, including Australia and  
Ireland, a study using census data has found.

nine-nations-census-data-shows#ixzz1HPUQpFYf   
The countries in question include Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic,  
Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland.   
The study looked at census data dating back a century and investigated the  
rise in those respondents claiming to have no religious affiliation.   
The results, which were reported at an American Physical Society meeting in  
Dallas, US, claimed that religion will become almost non-existent in the nine  
countries listed as more and more people claim not to follow any form of  
religion.   
Richard Wiener from the University of Arizona said: In a large number of  
modern secular democracies, there's been a trend that folk are identifying  
themselves as non-affiliated with religion; in the Netherlands the number was  
40 per cent, and the highest we saw was in the Czech Republic, where the  
number was 60 per cent.   
Researchers did, however, admit the study only provided suggestive results  
and recognised it did not represent the network structure of modern society  
with the way it calculated each person being influenced equally by all other  
people.

Dear prasanth,   
Do not worry. Another four or five tsunamis triggered by 9.9. R. earthquakes  
will make every one to believe in God, some god.   
The closed churches will be reopened, the priests will be held in   
high esteem, Hinduism will further flourish and so the other theistic   
religions.   
Fear is the key.   
I shall show you fear in a handful of dust... said T.S. Eliot.

We have feared for so long, we have worshiped conceptual deities for so long,  
it can't last. This is going to pass.   
The time comes when man will need to learn to lean on himself. To know  
himself.   
Upcoming events only will make man to say "i am tired of all this" and that is  
when surrender will happen. Great changes will happen. Consciousness will  
flower. Religion as we know it will die. It serves no purpose for man. It  
became the hideout of treacherous ones. The religion has distorted, to fit its  
purpose, the teachings of great jivanmuktas. They said: love yourself, watch  
the watcher, seek the seeker, be still, know thyself, don't try to fix things  
- cut the root.

There has always been a certain percentage of people who believe and a certain  
percentage of people who don't believe.   
This has always been the human condition. Always. I seriously doubt that  
balance will change on any permanent level. By that I mean   
There won't be a time when everyone believes or no one believes for the rest  
of history. Nothing to worry about.

Dear Om Hridayam,   
Srimad Bhagavatam says in this eon, people will forget righteousness, people  
will forget god and will even speak ill of gods, will indulge in immorality of  
all kinds, like thieving, murdering and adultery. The brahmins will eat cow's  
flesh, the lowly will rule the country, the cows will start yielding less and  
less milk, the grains will not grow, the diseases will increase in number and  
variety.   
Still with all that, as you said, some percentage of population will follow  
bhakti marga if not jnana and yoga. When even this pecentage becomes zero,  
the Kalki - the tenth avatara will appear in south India near Tambrabharani  
river, i.e in Tirunelveli-Kanya Kumari districts of Tamizh Nadu, on a  
horseback and wielding a   
sword and kill people and then reconstruct the world with a new generation of  
righteous people. The world will not end. But the population will become  
quite thin, with only a small percentage of the total remaining to rebuild the  
world.   
You must have also heard about the novel Fifth Horseman. A story where fifth  
horseman is none other than Mohammer Gadaffi of Libya. If the fifth horse  
man appears, then one can conclude that world's mass killing of population  
would commence.   
But the hearsay news like that the world will be destroyed in 2012 etc., are  
not true.   
[\b]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan says in Who am I: At the time of death, mind   
carries the prana and goes way [to take a new birth.]. In case there   
is no mind and prana is indrawn into the Self within, there is no   
reincarnation at all. The first classification is only ignorance.

Dear prasanth,   
Once Devaraja Mudaliar asked Sri Bhagavan: "You have been telling   
grace is ever flowing, grace is ever flowing, but I am not able to realize  
it."   
Sri Bhagavan said: "Yes. Grace is ever flowing. But, Oye, you do not   
obstruct its flow."   
'you' here means 'I' of the questioner. The ego. The ego obstructs the flow of  
Grace from Guru.

All unhappiness is due to the ego; with it comes all your trouble. What does  
it avail you to attribute to the happenings in life the cause of misery which  
is really within you?

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan says in Arunachala Mahatmyam, Verse 4: The ego creates the world and the world binds all beings.   
The English translation is: Because they bind the beings of the worlds, know that the relentless karmas  
become the bondage for Jivas. The effulgent Arunachala is that of which the  
mere sight suffices to cause them to become non existent.   
Arunchala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Very true. In the Asramam which I visited for three days from   
15th June, I and my wife could meet one Swami Shananada Shiva Puri   
Swamigal. He said a story: One man thinks that he is a horse. He is going all over the places braying  
like a horse. He says he will eat only horsegram. Someone suggested to him to  
go to Temples and pray. He went to 100 temples and in all the temples, he was  
braying and people threw him out. Some other person told him to try yoga. He  
tried. But for each inhaling breath and exhaling breath he was braying like a  
horse. Someone then suggested him to do some karma. He said that he can only  
draw a cart and do nothing else, since he imagined that he is a horse.  
Finally, he came to a Jnana Guru. The Jnana Guru looked at him with graceful  
eyes and said: See you are a man. You are a man. You are a man. You stay with  
me for some time and keep on saying I am a man, I am a man, I am a man.   
The man who was imagining that he was a horse really became a man.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. I had been to Tiruvannamalai for three days from 15th June 2011.   
Since the entire Morvi Guest House is demolished and new rooms for 2 people, 3  
people, 4 people etc., are being constructed. It might take some 6 months.  
Hence the Asramam had to manage with the existing Korangu Thottam guest house  
and Post Office Road guesthouse. I applied for approval for stay in June,  
sometime in April itself and I could get positive response. The visit was  
quite satisfying. On day 1, I and my wife spent the entire time in Asramam  
only. On day 2, we had been to giri valam and afterwards spent the time in  
Asramam. Since it was the first day of Tamkizh month, Aani, [Jeshta], there  
was a Sri Chakra Puja for Mother temple's Meru. Ilayaraja had come to Asramam  
to take part in the pujas. On day 3, we spent time in Big Temple and had good  
darshan of Arunachaleswara and Apeeta Kuchambal. We bought some books in book  
stall. We started our return journey about 2 pm. and day 3, and reached  
Bangalore by 7 pm.   
I bough the following books: 1.Spiritual Stories as told by Sri Bhagavan - a collection of all the stories  
told by Him during His conversations.   
2\. Direct Teaching of Sri Bhagavan Ramana - by V. Ganesan, a 1998 edition  
reprinted.   
3\. Separate book on the Recollections of Suri Nagamma. new edition.   
4\. Aruna of the Golden Fire - Sri Ramana's Linga,m of Wisdom and   
 Light. A book with a large number of photographs of Sri Bhagavan   
 and Arunachala, by Michael Highburger.   
5\. Separate book of recollections of T.R. Kanakammal, new edition,   
 under the title Cherished Memories.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
The "I am" \- ness or Existence is experiential and it cannot be   
pointed out or objectified. Sri Muruganar calls it as suttarivu in   
Tamizh, 'the knowledge obtained through someone pointing it out.'   
But Existence cannot be pointed out. It is experiential and that is   
the proof for one who has experienced.   
Arunachala Siva.

39\. Question: What method should I use to make my mind steady and firm?   
Bhagavan: It is sufficient to think always of one thing. If the mind does not  
obey, again start thinking of only one thing. In course of time, the mind will

40\. Question: Sometimes there is meditation, at other times there are worldly  
activities. What is the difference between the two?   
Bhagavan: To be in meditation and to be in activity are both the same. It is  
like calling the same object by its name in two different languages; like the  
crow only having one eye but seeing in two different directions; like the  
elephant using the same trunk for the two activities of breathing and drinking  
water; like the cobra using its eyes for the two functions of seeing and

Dear Ramanaduli,   
All pujas, japas, meditation on a god's form are all activities only. But they   
 if properly done, become one pointed activity, which gives ekakrita -   
single purpose activity and this in turns makes self inquiry easy.   
What to do? Only with the mind, the mind should be destroyed, as

41\. Question: Bhagavan, I have been meditating in your presence for some  
months, and now I am overcome with fear. Why?   
Bhagavan: It is the ego that is experiencing the fear; it is due to the  
feeling that it is gradually losing its grip. It is dying and may resent it.  
[Ask yourself the] question, "To whom is the fear?" It is all due to the  
experience of identifying the Self with the body. Repeated experience from  
non-separation will make one familiar with the state, and the fear will  
automatically vanish.

Dear prasanth,   
It is a nice question and a nice answer by Sri Bhagavan.   
All of us, or at least most of us, when we start self inquiry or self  
surrender, develops immense   
fear. Why? Because, we are not able to conceptualize a personality without  
ego. The ego   
does not leave us and it holds with an iron grip. Because of this fear, which  
is caused by   
the ego which is afraid of losing its identity, we get immense fear. Again, we  
come back to our   
own self and this is a victory for the ego. The ego does not want us to lose  
it so easily. It is   
an unwanted and much dreaded cancer.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said sir.   
42\. Question: What is a mind, which has a form and a mind without form?   
Bhagavan: Pure mind is a space of emptiness. Immediately on waking from sleep,  
a clear awareness arises, without exception in all people. That is formless  
mind. Thoughts such as "I am the body," "This is the world," arise only after  
that, which is the mind with form. In a cinema show the light appears first,  
and the forms appear on the screen only after the light. Likewise, the light  
of the Self comes first and provides space for everything that follows.

Dear prasanth,   
Nochur Venkataraman says: As soon as one wakes up, before the I-thought  
comes, for a small   
fraction of a second, the pure "I" is experienced by everyone. This Pure "I",  
the state of Pure   
Mind or Suddha Manas, if realized permanently, that is Self Realization. Pure  
Mind is another   
name for the Self. Muruganar has covered this aspect of Pure Mind in some of  
his verses in   
Guru Vachaka Kovai.

43\. Question: What you say seems to contradict the statements that the Self  
is beyond the mind, that the mind cannot know Brahman (the absolute) that it  
is beyond thought and speech.   
Bhagavan: That is why they say that mind is two fold; there is the higher pure  
mind as well as the lower impure mind. The impure mind cannot know this but  
the pure knows. It does not mean that the pure mind measures the immeasurable  
Self, the absolute. It means that the Self makes itself felt in the pure mind,  
so that even when you are in the midst of thoughts you feel the One Presence;  
you realize the truth that you are with the deeper Self and that the thought-  
waves are there only on the surface.

**44\. That means "mano nasha" or "anankara nasha" (the destruction of the  
mind or ego) you speak of is then not an absolute destruction?

Q: Where there is a conflict of desires, one for a child and the other for sex  
union, which should be chosen?   
M: If you are able to stifle one of them, why not stifle both? Why should you  
interfere with the laws of nature? Let he who made the laws of nature operate  
them. The sex impulse is strong enough already, why strengthen it further? If  
you understand the truth in nature, sexual desire will not arise at all. If  
you remove the sense of diversity, that which gives sex its power will also be  
removed.   
Nature makes some people barren or deprives others of their children, yet to  
others she gives many children. Thus if you attempt to control birth, try to  
control death as well.

Sannyasa (renunciation)   
Sannyasa is the giving up of the ego. Even though a person may be living as a  
householder in the family circle, the various occurrences of the world will  
not affect him if his ego is surrendered. Thus dream experiences do not really  
affect us. As he quietly lies in his bed, a man dreams he is in water, but his  
bed is not really wet. On the other hand, a person in the sannyasa ashrama,  
yet who is still attached to the body, is a karmi (person of action, not  
renunciation).   
So long as anyone thinks that they are a sannyasin, they are not one. So long  
as one does not think of world-illusion, one is not worldly, but is a real  
sannyasin. The patients must themselves take the medicine prescribed by the  
doctor to be cured of illness. So too, the guru prescribes the path, but the  
aspirants must themselves follow it.   
Where is renunciation? It is not outside us, it is here (pointing to the  
heart). Where is solitude? In the mind. Alexander Selkirk was alone on the  
island but he wanted to get away, so that was not solitude for him. We must  
achieve these things within ourselves. The Kingdom of Heaven is to be found  
within us.   
(Alexander Selkirk, 1676-1721, was put ashore on an uninhabited island in the  
Pacific at his own request; the inspiration for Defoe's story, Robinson  
Crusoe.)

Q: How does a householder fare on the path?   
M: Why do you think of yourself as a householder? If you go out as a  
sannyasin, similar thoughts will haunt you that you are a sannyasin. Whether  
in the house or in the forest, your mind haunts you. The ego is the source of  
thoughts. It creates the body and the world and makes you think you are a  
householder. If you renounce the world, it will only substitute the thought  
"sannyasi" for "householder" and the environment of the forest for the home.  
The mental obstacles will still be there. Changing the environment will not  
help, for the mind must be overcome, in both places. If you can do it in the  
forest, why not in the home? You can make an effort now, whatever the  
environment. Your surroundings never abandon you. Look at me. I left home.  
Look at yourselves. You have come here leaving the home environment. What do  
you find here now? Is it different from your home? That is the reason for  
emphasizing sahaja samadhi. One should be in spontaneous samadhi, i.e. in  
one's pristine state, even in the midst of one's surroundings.

Q: Why did you run away from home as a youth, even though you do not tell  
people to renounce?   
M: Some power took me away. It will not do to give up work. It is only when  
a person has realized, that the world ceases to exist for them. It does not  
mean that we ought to give up our work.

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan said: One cannot give up his householdership and then take  
sannyasa. One cannot give up work and take up\   
a life of renunciation. All these should be directed by a Maha Sakti. And  
again, mere wearing of ochre robes would not mean   
renunciation. One should first internally renounce everything and intensely  
seek for realization.   
Arunachala Siva.

Q: Should one give up home, wife, wealth, etc., since they are all samsara  
(birth and death; life in this world)?   
M: First learn what samsara is. Is all that samsara? Does that mean that  
people who live with them cannot get realization?   
What are you? Are you the body? No. You are pure Consciousness. Retirement  
means abidance in the Self, nothing more. It is not leaving one set of  
surroundings to become entangled in another, nor even leaving the concrete  
world and wallowing in the mental world. The birth of a son, his death, etc.,  
is also in the Self. The question of compatibility does not arise.

Q: From where do these objects arise?   
M: From the same place you arise! The subject also comprehends the object!  
That one aspect is an all-comprehensive aspect. See yourself first and then  
see the objects. What is not in you cannot appear outside.   
What is real can never become unreal, and vice versa. The world becomes unreal  
in sleep, hence it never did possess reality. But Being, the "I," always  
exists, and hence is always real.

Birth and Death   
M: Forgetfulness of your real nature is the real death; remembrance of it is  
the true birth. It puts an end to successive births. Eternal life is then  
yours. How does the desire for eternal life arise? Because the present state  
is unbearable. Why? Because, it is not your true nature. Had it been your real  
nature, there would be no desire to agitate you. How does the present state  
differ from your real nature? Truly, you are spirit. Human beings consider  
themselves limited and that is the root of the trouble. The idea is wrong. In  
sleep there was no world, no ego and no trouble. Something wakes up from that  
happy state and says "I." To that ego the world appears. It is the rise of the  
ego that is the cause of the trouble. But trace the ego to its origin, and you  
will reach that undifferentiated happy source, a state which is sleepless  
sleep. The Self is ever there; wisdom only appears to dawn, though it is  
natural.   
Conscious death and conscious immortality (while still in the flesh) is the  
purpose of evolution.

Q: What is death?   
M: It is in the mind that birth and death, pleasure and pain -- in short, the  
world and ego -- exist. If the mind is destroyed, all these are destroyed too.  
Note that it should be annihilated and not just made quiescent. For, the mind  
is quiescent in sleep and knows nothing. Still, on waking up, you are as you  
were before. There is no end to grief, but if the mind is destroyed, the grief  
will have no background and will disappear along with the mind.

204. Question: Perfection of the intellect is intuition, is that not so?   
Ramana: Intellect is of no use at all for seeing within, for turning inwards  
towards the Self. For that, it has to be killed or extinguished, or in other  
words it has to merge in the Source from which it sprang.

205. Question: Has closing the eyes during meditation any efficacy?   
Ramana: The eyes can be closed or open as one finds convenient. It is not  
the eyes that see. There is one who sees through the eyes. If he is turned  
inwards and is not looking through the eyes they can be open and yet nothing  
will be seen. If we keep our eyes closed it is the same to us whether the  
windows of this room are open or shut.

208\. You can have, or rather you will yourself be, the highest imaginable  
kind of happiness. All other kinds of happiness which you have spoken of as  
pleasure, joy, happiness, bliss are only reflections of the ananda (Bliss)  
which, in your true nature, you are.

209. Whether lights are seen or sounds are heard or whatever may happen, never let go the inquiry, "Who am I?" Keep on asking inwardly: "Who sees these lights or hears these sounds?"
