Understanding the hindu tranditions on why this was done and in what regards  
Sri Ramana did it himself   
I have gathered the information that this is different for each sadhana   
And also that it is done the day before full moon and the day before new moon.  
Is this correct or is it on that very day?   
And why is this done? The only info I have is to boost one's energy, to help  
in one's practice, due to energy rising in a certain way when hair are cut..  
in a certain way (or free from obstructions, hair as insulator)   
And then also, did Sri Ramana Maharshi shave his entire body or only head  
hair? Were private parts, chest and back hair and armpits left untouched?   
I am really looking forward to get this straight. I am looking forward to your  
reply   
Best wishes,   
David

Cutting the hair makes one mostly unrecognizable   
that is all the reason. the idea is to get rid of pride in a certain form, in  
what ever possible way.   
get rid of attachments to body and mind !   
some people cut the hair completely   
some others allow it to grow as it grows.   
its just symbolic.
