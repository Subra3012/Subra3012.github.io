My friend forwarded the following message about Kalaivani and story is very  
interesting.The message reminds me of the provrb that knowldge is no man's  
property.   
 A Really Moving incident!!   
 After a simple Temple Darshan we entered "Giri Trading" and started searching for this Book on Thatva Bodha..   
 We found many people buying various Books and CDs and from their smart walks and accumulation of CDs from Bhajans to Bombay   
 Jaishree,sent a nice feeling in us,that,we have come to the right place  
indeed...   
 I was looking for this Book while my wife started collecting Bharathiar's songs and Ms's Music..I searched everywhere for this Book..   
 There was this Girl Kalaivani,standing next to the Cashier,sincerely watching all our movements..a Black Girl,should be from a nearby Village,might be 17 or 18,should not have crossed 8th Std.,Might be out of POverty she is here..all my Journalist's brain unnecessarily calculated about this Gullible Girl..and tho' she was repeatedly watching me,I ignored her and started searching for"Thathva Bodha"   
 I saw many books from"Sandhya Vandanam" to Swami VIvekananda's Chicago Speech" but having spent a good 40 minutes..I looked at her..she also looked at me curiously..   
 I asked her,knowing fully well that such a girl cannot have any idea of anything,leave alone Thathva Bodah..   
 "Sir,Shall I help you?"(in Tamil)   
 "Yes I am looking for Thatva Bodha?"   
 "Sanskrit Text or English /Sanskrit?"   
 God..she knows..   
 "Sanskrit& English"   
 "Do you like to have the PUblication from Chinmaya Mission or Indu Publications or by Ramakrishna Mutt?"   
 "I dont know..I just want to only Learn you see..I dont really know indeed"   
 "Do you read Tamil Sir?"   
 "Yes I am a Tamilian "   
 (thinking to myself how most of mylife time   
 I like to act in most otherplaces   
 that I am not)   
 "Then Sir,you can take this"..she ran to the Shelf where I had searched for 30 minutes,removed the books in the front side and came out with a Book in Tamil   
 "This one in Tamil by N.Sivaraman by Indu Publications infact is simple and wonderfullYou have the Sanskrit Text too inside.."   
 My God..Why did I under estimate such a Genius..Just because of my Arrogance that I am an NRI..   
 Or Just because I presumed such a Black,gullible girl,   
 who wd have come for this JOb out of absolute poverty,   
 wdn't have any idea of"Thatva Bodha"   
 I decided to change my attitude and realise that I am absolutely an 'Idiot' at this moment in front of this wonderful girl and submitted myself in all humilty..   
 "Madam,Ireally don't have any idea of even who wrote Thatva BOdha till Yesterday..I just attended a lecture on this subject and was fascinated by the lecture and hence"   
 "Did you attend Goda Venkateswara Sastri's lecture in BHarathiya Vidya Bhavan?"   
 "Oh God..How did you know?"   
 "He regularly takes classes on such subjects..infact he is one of the best Sir,in the city on such subjects"   
 "You are interested in such subjects?"   
 "Yes Sir,I read a lot about Swami VIvekananda and Ramakrishna and Thathva Bodha incidentally is my favourite Subject"   
 "You mean to say you have read Thatva Bodha.?"   
 "I have read this one by Sivaraman and once you read it you won't feel like keeping that book on the table at all.."   
 "Why what is so great about this Book?"   
 "Sir,you must be Joking that you don't know about Thatva Bodha.."   
 "Really I accept my ignorance.."   
 my wife was watching from the corner,admiring all her Cd collections..   
 "Sir,according to me if you read this it gives the entire Vedanthic Saramsam and one wd become a bit more humble in life..   
 leaving Ahamkaram once for all.."   
 "Is it a fact that reading this simple book one wd get so humble..   
 "Ofcourse one shd be involved totally into the text..   
 Needs lot of conviction and devotion.."   
 My wife joined the conversation and she felt this girl is indeed a very very talented intelligent girl..so she told me   
 "Why don't you interview her for Washington Post..why at all you shd think of Paris Hilton?"   
 I also felt that I owe something to her..so I asked her whether she can spare sometime for an interview..   
 She politely refused saying   
 "My boss is to give me permission..Besides many people are looking for guidance like you and hence I have to go.."   
 "What is your name anyway?"   
 "Kalaivani"..   
 My wife's admiration for her devotion to duty and her total involvement in her work..made her go direct to the Boss.."Sir,that girl Kalaivani.."   
 "Yes very hard working Girl.."   
 "This is my husband Viswanath. ."   
 "Nice meeting you Sir"   
 "He is the Senior Journalist in Washington Post.."   
 Boss stood up.."Washington Post?"   
 "Yes Sir..I wd like to interview this girl..I am highly impressed..with her ethics.."   
 Boss called her..Time was 5:45 Pm...   
 "Kalaivani,they have come all the way from USA..they wd like to spend sometime with you..can you?"   
 "Sir,there are so many customers waiting for some guidance..   
 it is a rush time..if they can come again tomorrow.."   
 "OK OK I can come again tomorrow.."   
 I again came next day morning leaving all my appointments with Times of India just to see this girl..It was no rush hour..   
 My wife and myself found out....   
 Kalaivani is from a nearby village near Arcot..She has 5 sisters..She is the eldest one..Her father was a drunkard and he died a few years ago caring for none of them..Her mother used to work as a helper in Masonry and passed away two years back..leaving all the 6 on the streets..   
 This girl who had completed her 9th std decided to search for a job and Giri Trading came forward to help her out..She brought all her 5 sisters with her and with her meagre salary she is taking care of them..all the 5 sisters are going to a nearby corporation school..   
 "Kalaivani..but when did you get this enthusiasm to learn about Thatva Bodha?"   
 "Sir after joining here,I decided that the best way to be of help to the customers is to know the subject first..I took small Books on Swami VIvekananda and started reading..I found the subject so fascinating..I decided to read other books in Tamil like Bagavad Gita and Viveka Choodamani..Thats how.."   
 "What is your salary?"   
 "Rs 2500..Sir"   
 "Are you able to manage all your expenses with the 5 sisters..?"   
 "Not at all Sir but the Boss helps me a lot..?"   
 "What is your aim in LIfe?"   
 "I want all my sisters to get education..   
 then they wd get easily employments is it not?"   
 "If I give monthly Rs 10000 for meeting all your expenses..wd that suffice..?"   
 "It is indeed too much but that also I wd accept only thro' my Boss.."   
 We took her to the Boss and told him that we wd like to send Rs 10000 every month so that all her sisters' education wd be completed..Boss said   
 "She deserves it Sir..You can trust me I will hand over the amount to her every month or alternately you can open an acct in her name and start transferring.."   
 My friend John Paul,   
 who is the Regional Manager of Times of India had also come with me..He said"You have done a good thing.."   
 My wife said"I pray that Karpagambal helps Kalaivani to become an expert in Vedantha and start giving lectures in USA..   
 We can arrange for her lectures.."   
 We left wonderstruck....If we go into the interiors of BIhar and Barrackpur..how many moreJewels can be found..   
 I really became humbled**

Very beautiful article and very humbling sir!   
This reminds me of the old tamizh proverb -   
**_Kandadhor vindathillai, Vindadhor kandathillai_**   
One who has seen seldom speaks, and one who speaks has never seen   
and similarly in the Kena Upanishad, we have -   
He who knows, knows not, and he who knows not, knows.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Very True. Persons who have attained Jnana Bodham do not speak   
it out. Only others know it by such Jnani's lustrous face and activities  
which are humble but sublime.   
Take for example Annamalai Swami. Only Bhagavan Ramana knew   
that he would attain enlightenment, years later. So, He asked him   
to stop his work and do sadhana in Palakottu. Later this great jewel   
hidden in the bushes, was discovered by David Godman.   
In Periya Puranam there is the story of Nandanar. He was an   
agricultural laborer and an outcaste and his masters, the brahmin landlords  
did not attain Jnana. He attained and merged with Nataraja in Chidambram. He  
is called Tiru NaLai Povar. The one who was constantly telling, I shall go  
tomorrow. I shall go tomorrow. To Chidambaram! All Guru or God's Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.**

Dear sir,   
Following this thread, here I want to tell a real incident which took long  
time ago. My mother is very very orthodex lady and we were living in a small  
village. There we had to draw water from the well. That time my mother used to  
wait till all other caste of ladies to draw water and leave the place. Before  
she step into the place she would pour water where the ladies stood. For that  
purpose she used to bring little water from home and she instructed to us  
also. One day when she was cleaning the place, one 10 year old girl came to  
draw water and saw my mother and asked why she was doing like this. My mother  
told her because she already took bath and she would not step in and my mother  
told the girl not to come closer till she leave the place. Actually we used to  
get milk and buttermilk from the girl's house as they were belong to the  
milkmaid community (Idaiyar kulam). Immedietly the girl sang in folk style  
which is ringering till to day. She sang. ADHU MATTUM ADHU MATTUM OTHUKIDUMA,  
NANGA THOTA MUTTUM PATTIKIDUMA.   
Hearing this words when mother asked her Eyi.... what are you talking. The  
girl replied... yes amma. you buy buttermilk and milk from us. We pour this  
same water and give, you take from us but now you are cleaning the place where  
we stand". Hearing this   
my mother got shocked. She came home with heavy heart and told this incident.  
She told what the girl told is true but I cannot leave my AACHARAM. Later  
years when I read Adhi shankara I also got shock. The small uneducated village  
girl taught a great philosophy to us. I realised one thing, God or Guru is  
everywhere and they are teaching the inner meaning of life but we only do not  
learn anything. In tamil there is one proverb.. we do not know in which hole  
which cobra will live. ENDHA PURIL ENDHA BAMBU IRRUKUMO.

Dear Sir,   
 Very interesting to note that 10 year old yadhava girl who is not exposed to scriptures is able to tell the highest truth which we the intellectuals come to know of he same truth only by going through scriptures and Bhagavan's teachings and still we are hesitant to follow because of our Ego and conditioning.

Dear viswanathan, ramanaduli,   
viswanathan spoke about Maneesha Panchakam. There itself is the   
message from Chandala to Sankara, where it is proved that scriptural   
reading or any reading is required for Atma Jnanam. Chandala asks: "Which one you want to stay away? There is only Atma. Is it the   
Atma within you that asks the Atma within me, to stay away?   
Moon's reflection falls on Ganga and also on the gutters of Kasi?   
Which moon is purer, or higher in neatness?"   
Again in the same Sankara Vijayam, there is this boy, who is born   
dumb, with unsteady eyes, not speaking to anyone, always introverted. Sankara  
asks the boy: "Who are you?" [the famous   
Ramana question in an obverse way!]. Hastamalaka [this name   
came later] replies: "I am neither man, God, yaksha, brahmin, kshatriya, vaisya, sudra,   
brahmachari, householder, forest dweller, nor sannyasi; but I am   
pure Awareness alone.   
"Just as the sun causes all worldly movements, so do I - the   
ever present, conscious Self, -- cause the mind to be and the senses to  
function. Again, just as ether is all pervading, yet devoid of any specific  
qualities, so am I, free from all qualities.   
"I am that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent, as the image in  
a mirror is not independent of the object reflected."......   
In which Vedapatasala, that dumb, dull witted boy study?   
Arunachala Siva.
