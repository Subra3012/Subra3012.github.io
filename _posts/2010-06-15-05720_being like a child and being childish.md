Apologizing doesn't mean that   
ur wrong and the other is right..   
It only means that u value the   
relationship more than ur ego...   
If everything is going according   
to ur wish then ur lucky..   
If its not then ur too lucky, coz   
its going according to God's wish...   
Ever noticed ur parents spend the   
first 18 months trying to make u stand   
up and talk...and The next 18 years   
trying to make u sit down n listen..   
Either walk as if u rule the world..   
or Walk as if u don't mind who   
the hell rules the world..   
That's the attitude...   
Rock ur life..   
Silly thing about affection..   
when u get little u want more...   
when u get more u desire   
even more..but when u lose it u   
realize "little" was enough..   
Never design ur character like   
a garden where anyone can walk..   
Design it like a sky where   
everyone aspires to reach..   
One of the best messages for mankind...   
"There is no market for ur sorrows..   
So never advertise ur feelings,..."   
One true fact..   
The world's thinnest book has   
only one word written in it..: "EVERYTHING" and   
The book is titled: "what a human wants??"   
True fact of life: When u need ADVICE everyone   
is ready to HELP u..but   
when u need HELP everyone   
is ready to ADVICE u..   
Never accept others definition   
of life..Its Ur life define it urself...   
We are not human beings having   
spiritual experiences..We are spiritual   
beings having human experiences..   
Two nice thoughts..   
Pray as if everything depends on god..and   
Work as if everything depends on   
u...   
To handle urself use ur head...   
To handle others use ur heart..   
To have good relations with all,   
we should keep our nature like   
a theater screen..It accepts all   
characters but remains   
peacefully white...   
Its just meaningless to expect ur   
partner to be like urself coz   
u cant hold their right hand in ur   
right hand to walk together..think over..   
Confidence never comes if v have   
all the answers, but it comes when v   
r ready for all the questions..   
Be bold to face the world..   
When ur depressed..When ur confused   
When u have been hurt the most..   
Don't ever get carried away...   
rather just get in front of the mirror,   
n there u will find d right person who   
could actually help u get out of this..   
There is always a little truth behind   
every "just kidding"   
A little knowledge behind every "I don't know"   
A little emotion behind "I don't care"   
Two aspects of life: If v become 2 sentimental, its   
2 hard to lead life and   
If v become 2 practical, its 2   
tough to respect relations..   
No one in this world is afraid 2 speak   
the truth..   
They are afraid only about the consequences   
that are to be faced after speaking the truth..   
Truth of life: what is status??   
"Spending money which we don't have to   
buy things which we don't need..   
To impress people whom we don't know..."

All like child but do they like childish when we grow?   
But when jnani's case it is accepted. Reason.....

Dear ramanaduli garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say: Every person should be like a child.Then one can  
get Brahmananda.   
Annamalai Swami asked: "Then what is the difference between a child and a  
Jnani?   
Bhagavan Ramana replied: A child does not know anything because of its pure ignorance.   
A Jnani does know everything because of his pure wisdom.   
 **Source** : Sri Ramana Ninaivugal - Tamil - Annamalai Swami.   
 _Once Dr Raju garu in this forum said_   
A child is childish and innocent with his tendencies lying inside in a dormant  
stage and spending up of tendencies not yet started,so his innocence may be  
contaminated at any time.   
 **Jnani is not chidish but have "child like" innocence but his innocence  
cannot be contaminated because his tendencies are destroyed once and  
forever.**
