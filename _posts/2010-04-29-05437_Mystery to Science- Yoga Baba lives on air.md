This is the mul mantra of Lord Ganesh (also called Ganapathi, Vinayaka,  
Vigneshwar). This mantra is said to have the power to remove all evil and  
obstacles.   
 **Origin of the mantra**   
This mantra was first mentioned in Ganapati Atharvarshisha. Ganapati  
Atharvarshisha is said to have been written by Atharva Rishi after he had the  
darshan of Ganapti.   
It is related to Lord Ganeshji. In simple words, it is mool mantra(basic  
chant) of Lord Ganesh.   
Om means universal sound, gam is invocation to Lords shakti (energy) and  
ganapatayae namah means bow to Lord of the world.   
 **What does it mean?**   
Om Gan Ganapatye Namah means the devotee bows/ offers salutations to the Lord  
of the World.   
 **How to pronounce it?**   
There are quite a few ways over how this mantra should be written, especially  
its second word gam. And various authorities stress over different  
pronunciations.   
Here are some ways of pronunciation: Om gan ganapatye namah   
Om gam ganapatye naman   
Om gung ganapatye namah   
Whatever the pronunciation, the meaning is always the same.   
This mantra removes all evil and obstacles that prevent you from reaching your  
goals.   
Chanting the mantra just after bath is very good or very early morning is  
extremely beneficial.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Mystery to Science... Yoga Baba lives on air

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20100429/twl-man-survives-without-food-  
for-70-yea-3fd0ae9.html   
Video in Telugu: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP_Vqbk7gLE&feature=player_embedded   
Indian doctors are studying a remarkable 83-year-old holy man who claims to  
have spent the last seven decades without food and water.   
Military medics hope the experiments on Prahlad Jani can help soldiers develop  
their survival strategies.   
The long-haired and bearded yogi is under 24-hour observation by a team of 30  
doctors during three weeks of tests at a hospital in the western city of  
Ahmedabad.   
Two cameras have been set up in his room, while a mobile camera films him when  
he goes outside, guaranteeing round-the-clock observation.   
His body will be scanned and his brain and heart activity measured with  
electrodes.   
"The observation from this study may throw light on human survival without  
food and water," said Dr G. Ilavazahagan, who is directing the research.   
"This may help in working out strategies for survival during natural  
calamities, extreme stressful conditions and extra-terrestrial explorations  
like future missions to the Moon and Mars by the human race."   
Since the experiment began on April 22, Jani has neither eaten nor drunk and  
has not been to the toilet.   
"The exercise of taking this yogi under the medical scanner is to understand  
what energy supports his existence," Dr Ilavazahagan added.   
"Jani says he meditates to get energy. Our soldiers will not be able to  
meditate, but we would still like to find out more about the man and his  
body."   
Jani, who dresses in red and wears a nose ring, grew up in Charod village in  
the Mehsana district in Gujarat.   
He claims to have been blessed by a goddess when he was aged eight, which has  
enabled him to survive without sustenance.

Complete Case Study of This Indian Yogi   
http://www.sudhirneuro.org/­files/mataji_case_study.pdf   
Here is a case an ongoing research on a yogi who has not eaten ANYTHING or  
drank even a drop of water right from age 11 when he had his experience for  
the first time.   
Doctors and scientists are totally baffled about this phenomenon. Worst part  
is DRDO getting interested to find out how such a state can be achieved by  
soldiers to overcome tough terrain and living conditions.   
The Yogi says that 'Amritam' flows from a hole in his upper palate. Modern  
scientific minds are investigating this phenomenon, thread bare but with NO  
ANSWERS so far. Facts have been verified but NO EXPLANATION.   
Science is attempting to explain yet another unsolved mystery in nature,  
without acknowledging the Divine.

Thank you for the post. I had seen this on TV a couple of days back and the  
team of Doctors representing all the fields of Medical studies appeared  
certain that this is a marvel. Heard the Neurologists confirm that the Yogi  
can give them even perfect quantity of Urine for their medical research.   
Complex issues and certainly something novel will appear to explain this  
phenomenon.

In the book "Autobiography of a Yogi" is mentioned the case of a lady who left  
eating food. Paramamhamsa Yogananda met her. She left eating following certain  
circumstances of her life and learnt to survive by certain yoga techniques  
(which she learnt from a teacher).   
However I do not feel that such techniques will become widely popular (like TV  
or mobile phones) since food is responsible for interactions between human  
beings and the overall unity. God seems to have intentionally designed the  
food dependency to make humans individual entities and at the same time create  
a unity (by dependency) among all.

There was one Kodagu (Coorg) Dhanalakshmi, who was a girl   
in her teens and she became overnight famous even in places   
like Tamil Nadu. Perhaps she must have been a coffee estate   
worker. She started vomiting her food one day and she refused   
to eat anything further. She remained without food and water   
for many many years. Her story was not followed up by press   
or medical team in those years. If she had been alive she must   
be over 50 today.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Beloved Abstract,   
In the Hindu scriptures they talk about sages who were living   
consuming air and water. But these things are not possible   
nowadays. People who are claiming to be doing these are all   
bogus. No such adventures are needed for self realization.   
Once a devotee told Bhagavan Ramana that there was one   
yogi (either on the Hill or somewhere else) who was keeping   
his one hand raised all the time. This hand which he had kept   
in a raised position since 11 years, had become stiff and he   
cannot, even if he wanted, to put it back. Bhagavan Ramana   
smiled and said: "Is it yoga? Or is it going to confer Jnana?   
All foolish acts!"   
Arunachala Siva.
