U.G. is a self styled philospher who lived in Bangalore. He is more   
bogus than JK. He is supposed to have improved upon JK. I met   
him once about 10 years back in Bangalore and was not impressed.   
His job was to criticize everyone in the world including Sankara. I   
bought one book of him, which I did not read completely. The book   
has been thrown to the attic for the good. There are some 'followers'   
for him in India and abroad. In no issue of Mountain Path, there is   
an article about him. That speaks of him.

I have read a lot about UG and also his interviews. Yes he is known for his  
criticisms of Buddha, Shankara, Jesus and evrybody else. He is a very Vehement  
personality and whatever he said were always shocking! Initially I felt this  
guy is a nonsense idiot and a person full of dustbin! but... then deep inside  
my heart the truth's echoed and I just could not ignore the voice of truth,  
then onwards, his criticisms never bothered to affect me, but love, bhakthi  
towards Buddha, Shankara Jesus and others still lay intact, but there is deep  
significance to whatever UG stood for.   
No doubt, he is a maverick, He comes running at you with a big sword to cut  
off your head and drink your blood. But I let it go, for it was eating away  
and drinking all my ego.   
I have not met him though, for I only got to know him after he passed away in  
2007. I got introduced to him by a stranger.

U.G. serves his purpose. We need all kinds of people.   
Most people I meet who are interested in spirituality are really just trying  
to find an easy out. All U. G. seemed to be doing is telling these people  
that no spiritual methodology, which really isn't different than any non-  
spiritual/material methodology, will never bring them what they want. This  
message does not ultimately differ from Ramana's message, albeit the means  
involved for both are very different.   
U.G. has helped my self-inquiry. He has made me question my own assumptions  
and beliefs. For this I am grateful.   
You can find most of U.G.'s work available free online at: http://www.well.com/user/jct/   
U.G. met Ramana, and Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Papaji (I think?).   
Papaji seemed irritated by U.G. and said something like "This man is no guru."  
and I think Papaji also lamented about U.G.'s denial of there being such a  
thing as a spiritual experience.   
Anyway... I'd be curious to hear others thoughts and feelings on this subject.

Very rightly put Dear Matthew, we need all kinds of people and they all serve  
some purpose. I also have the same feeling that UG has helped me in my Self  
enquiry.   
Its true, most people who are interested in spirituality are really trying to  
find an easy out. But isn't it natural? after all every one wants to be happy  
always in bliss... here and now this moment....   
The core of whatever UG stood for can be summarised as.... "whatever you are  
doing to realise is actually taking you farther away from it.."

Infact.... UG's quest for realisation ended only after his meeting with Ramana  
in 1949. some one takes him to Sri Ramana and UG asked him "This thing  
Realisation!..... Can you give it to me? for which Sri Ramana replied "Yes...  
I can give it to you!. .. But are you ready to take it?   
This respose from Sri Ramana ended all his quest and search for  
realisation....   
At one point of time, he met the 35th Acharya of Sringeri and spoke to him  
about his Kundalini experience what he calls calamity, what we can call as his  
death experience. which was acknowledged by the 35 Acharaya of Sringeri that  
even his Guru Sri CHandrashekhara Bharathi had related to him similar  
experiences...   
UG had a desire to stay in solitude for the rest of his life and the Acharya  
also told that he could make arrangements in Sringeri itself but by doing that  
he can never think of getting the solitude that he wants because people would  
however begin to flock over him whereever he may go.   
He then decided that whereever he is, He should tell exactly the way it is....  
and not put any ingredients to what it IS

So I'm curious how many of you here have ever put the question to yourself: Is  
U.G. right, have I been deceived by all these spiritual teachings, have I been  
blind in my faith and refused to question the teachings and the teachers? Has  
this all been an escape for me from my mundane life?   
It's a hard thing to ask...   
& somehow I keep coming back to my faith/conviction in Ramana, Nisargadatta,  
Jiddu Krishnamurti, etc.. .. but sometimes I do wonder, seeing how all the  
time and effort I spent seems to have been without obvious fruit.

As mungala, doubt in our path is the greatest obstacle in enquiry.   
I have read that Papaji met Bhagavan Ramana. JK, I am sure never   
met Him. But I am not sure about UG. Even during the periods when   
Vedantic thoughts were explored and written about, there were completely  
opposite philsophies. Like Sarvaka philosophy, which   
said : Eat, Drink, Copulate, there is no other thing which is real.   
This has been admiitted into Hindu thoughts as Sarvaka is one of the  
philosophies, from ancient times. Each one according to his inclination!

Doubt is enemy and ally. Without the right kind of doubt we would have never  
made to the understanding we have now.   
The doubt I experience is more a lack of convinction / mind being pulled  
between many different proposals without certainty. I guess I need to inquire  
further and find out for myself directly -- that is, more self-inquiry (Self-  
inquiry?). Yet I get the feeling that faith and conviction, if you're lucky  
enough to have it deeply, is the fastest way.   
I remember Nisargadatta saying something to the point of he wasn't sure why he  
was able to have such unshakable conviction in his teacher, but he did, and  
that was all that was needed, even though his teacher died shortly after they  
met.

Hi Matthew,   
I followed the link as a friend has also mentioned U.G,   
Ultimately I had to dismiss UG - I believe he is an individual of some  
attainment, but not realised, as he appeared to be dominated by scorn and  
anger. He also had psychic abilities, which is symptomatic of the rising  
Kundalini energy due to his previous practices - however this may have been  
misdirected (the Kundalini) such is his restlessness - it is well documented  
the dangers of misdirected Kundalini energy and the unbalancing effect (as  
well abilities) that attend the rising of this energy. He speaks a great deal  
of truth ( as far as I can compare with my own experience) but does not  
possess the peace of the sage, so for me, I will not be investigating him any  
more,   
Kind Blessings

Dear Paintbrush,   
I am happy that you have read UG and understood him.   
I met him several years back in a devotee's (!) house in   
Bangalore. He was cantankerous right from the word 'go'.   
He criticized JK, why even Sankara. I do not remember whether   
he spoke about Bhagavan Ramana.   
One meeting was adquate and I found him to be a confused   
person, a sort of paranoid and a compulsive hater of others.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, in his entire series of talks.... he speaks about Ramana thus, infact,  
his quest for realisation/liberation ended only after he met Ramana Maharshi.  
This is verbatim, as told by UG himself. This is recorded in one of his audio  
talks which I have heard myself, He criticised everbody and everything, but  
there are no criticisms related to Ramana Maharshi as per my knowledge. Only  
the details as given below corresponds to UG on Ramana \- Its pretty big, but  
its worth a reading!   
I arrived at a point when I was twenty-one where I felt very strongly that all  
teachers -- Buddha, Jesus, Sri Ramakrishna, everybody -- kidded themselves,  
deluded themselves and deluded everybody. This, you see, could not be the  
thing at all -- "Where is the state that these people talk about and describe?  
That description seems to have no relation to me, to the way I am functioning.  
Everybody says 'Don't get angry' \-- I am angry all the time. I'm full of  
brutal activities inside, so that is false. What these people are telling me I  
should be is something false, and because it is false it will falsify me. I  
don't want to live the life of a false person. I am greedy, and non-greed is  
what they are talking about. There is something wrong somewhere. This greed is  
something real, something natural to me; what they are talking about is  
unnatural. So, something is wrong somewhere. But I am not ready to change  
myself, to falsify myself, for the sake of being in a state of non-greed; my  
greed is a reality to me." I lived in the midst of people who talked of these  
things everlastingly -- everybody was false, I can tell you. So, somehow, what  
you call 'existentialist nausea' (I didn't use those words at the time, but  
now I happen to know these terms, revulsion against everything sacred and  
everything holy, crept into my system and threw everything out: "No more  
slokas, no more religion, no more practices -- there isn't anything there; but  
what is here is something natural. I am a brute, I am a monster, I am full of  
violence -- this is reality. I am full of desire. Desirelessness, non-greed,  
non-anger -- those things have no meaning to me; they are false, and they are  
not only false, they are falsifying me." So I said to myself "I'm finished  
with the whole business," but it is not that simple, you see.   
Then somebody came along, and we were discussing all these things. He found me  
practically an atheist (but not a practicing atheist), skeptical of  
everything, heretical down to my boots. He said "There is one man here,  
somewhere in Madras at Tiruvannamalai, called Ramana Maharshi. Come on, let's  
go and see that man. Here is a living human embodiment of the Hindu  
tradition."   
I didn't want to see any holy man. If you have seen one, you have seen them  
all. I never shopped around, went around searching for people, sitting at the  
feet of the masters, learning something; because everybody tells you "Do more  
and more of the same thing, and you will get it." What I got were more and  
more experiences, and then those experiences demanded permanence -- and there  
is no such thing as permanence. So, "The holy men are all phonies -- they are  
telling me only what is there in the books. That I can read -- 'Do the same  
again and again' \-- that I don't want. Experiences I don't want. They are  
trying to share an experience with me. I'm not interested in experience. As  
far as experience goes, for me there is no difference between the religious  
experience and the sex experience or any other experience; the religious  
experience is like any other experience. I am not interested in experiencing  
Brahman; I am not interested in experiencing reality; I am not interested in  
experiencing truth. They might help others; but they cannot help me. I'm not  
interested in doing more of the same; what I have done is enough. At school if  
you want to solve a mathematical problem, you repeat it again and again -- you  
solve the mathematical problem, and you discover that the answer is in the  
problem. So, what the hell are you doing, trying to solve the problem? It is  
easier to find the answer first instead of going through all this."   
So, reluctantly, hesitatingly, unwilling, I went to see Ramana Maharshi. That  
fellow dragged me. He said "Go there once. Something will happen to you." He  
talked about it and gave me a book, Search in Secret India by Paul Brunton, so  
I read the chapter relating to this man -- "All right, I don't mind, let me go  
and see." That man was sitting there. From his very presence I felt "What!  
This man -- how can he help me? This fellow who is reading comic strips,  
cutting vegetables, playing with this, that or the other -- how can this man  
help me? He can't help me." Anyway, I sat there. Nothing happened; I looked at  
him, and he looked at me. "In his presence you feel silent, your questions  
disappear, his look changes you" \-- all that remained a story, fancy stuff to  
me. I sat there. There were a lot of questions inside, silly questions -- so,  
"The questions have not disappeared. I have been sitting here for two hours,  
and the questions are still there. All right, let me ask him some questions"  
\-- because at that time I very much wanted moksha. This part of my  
background, moksha, I wanted. "You are supposed to be a liberated man" \-- I  
didn't say that. "Can you give me what you have?" \-- I asked him this  
question, but that man didn't answer, so after some lapse of time I repeated  
that question -- "I am asking 'Whatever you have, can you give it to me?'" He  
said, "I can give you, but can you take it?" Boy! For the first time this  
fellow says that he has something and that I can't take it. Nobody before had  
said "I can give you," but this man said "I can give you, but can you take  
it?" Then I said to myself "If there is any individual in this world who can  
take it, it is me, because I have done so much sadhana, seven years of  
sadhana. He can think that I can't take it, but I can take it. If I can't take  
it, who can take it?" \-- that was my frame of mind at the time -- you know,  
(laughs) I was so confident of myself.   
I didn't stay with him, I didn't read any of his books, so I asked him a few  
more questions: "Can one be free sometimes and not free sometimes?" He said  
"Either you are free, or you are not free at all." There was another question  
which I don't remember. He answered in a very strange way: "There are no steps  
leading you to that." But I ignored all these things. These questions didn't  
matter to me -- the answers didn't interest me at all.   
But this question "Can you take it?". .. "How arrogant he is!" \-- that was my  
feeling. "Why can't I take it, whatever it is? What is it that he has?" \--  
that was my question, a natural question. So, the question formulated itself: "What is that state that all those people -- Buddha, Jesus and the whole gang  
-- were in? Ramana is in that state -- supposed to be, I don't know -- but  
that chap is like me, a human being. How is he different from me? What others  
say or what he is saying is of no importance to me; anybody can do what he is  
doing. What is there? He can't be very much different from me. He was also  
born from parents. He has his own particular ideas about the whole business.  
Some people say something happened to him, but how is he different from me?  
What is there: What is that state?" \-- that was my fundamental question, the  
basic question -- that went on and on and on. "I must find out what that state  
is. Nobody can give that state; I am on my own. I have to go on this uncharted  
sea without a compass, without a boat, with not even a raft to take me. I am  
going to find out for myself what the state is in which that man is." I wanted  
that very much, otherwise I wouldn't have given my life.   
Those of you who are interested to know about UG's death experience or  
**Calamity** \- that is what he likes to call his death experience, please  
check these links: 1. Calamity or Death Experience - http://www.ugkrishnamurti.org/ug/main/ugbio/ugbio8.htm

Dear Nagaraj,   
I read your detailed post of UG meeting Bhagavan Ramana.   
I was wondering what would have happened, if UG had said: "I can take it." Perhaps he would have been given the   
experiential ambrosia, which even angels had not tasted.   
As rightly said by Paintbrush, I met an Israeli lady during my   
December 2008 in Tiruvannamalai. She was hardly 25 and she   
was having a long hair and dressed in simple salwar-kamiz.   
She said that she was given a book on Bhagavan Ramana, when   
she was in Israel by an American friend. The typical photograph   
of Bhagavan, (when He was 21) was there and she saw it.   
She could not take her eyes away from that. You know that photo is one of the  
most powerful photos of Bhagavan for sadhaks. She started feeling an  
"effervescence" on right   
chest. She decided immediately that He is her Guru. Within   
two months she came to Tiruvannamalai. She had many sufferiings. The famous  
Yom Kippur war during which her father or uncle had been killed. There was  
chaos in the family. She   
became restless in her life. Her mother was in shambles. She decided only a  
spiritual path would give her peace. And that peace she got it with one deep  
look into Bhagavan photograph!   
In December 2008, she told me that she is going to live in   
Tiruvannamalai for three months. Of course, I could not meet   
her in my March 2009 visit. But I am sure she had arrived!   
Many see Him   
But He calls only a few   
Still less are chosen!   
Arunachala Siva.
