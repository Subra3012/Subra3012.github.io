**Note : Avudyar Koil is a very ancient Temple associated with Saint  
Manickavachagar and being in Tamil Nadu I have never visited it and I intend  
to visit it in due course. Unlike the other popular Shiva temples in Tamil  
Nadu this is not so much popular as this is not a Parihara Sthalam ( i.e place  
for doing pujas and rituals for our own benefit ). This temple is very unique  
and is different from the Other Shiva Temples and So I am using this thread to  
first educate myself as well as others about this temple. Those who have  
visited this temple and have any specific info about this temple can also  
share the same here. **   
 **This God doesn 't have shape - Avudayar Koil Temple, Aranthangi, India**   
http://indiancolumbus.blogspot.com/2010/04/god-doesnt-have-shape-avudayar-  
koil.html   
 Avudayar Koil temple is one of the oldest temples in Tamil Nadu state, South  
India. Avudayar Koil temple is located in the small town named Audayaurkoil,  
which is around 14 kms from Aranthangi city of Pudhukkottai district in Tamil  
Nadu state, India. The town was called as Thiruperunthurai in ancient times.  
The temple is the only attraction of the town, and it attracts hundreds of  
devotees and tourists daily. Avudayar Koil temple (the word "Koil" means  
"temple" in Tamil language) is attractive not only due to spiritual reasons,  
but also due to its architecture and sculpture. It is because of this temple,  
the entire Avudayarkoil town has been declared as 'heritage town' by the  
government.   
Even thought the temple is famously referred as Avudayar Koil, the name of the  
temple is Athmanatha Swamy Temple. The original temple is believed to be built  
by Manikavasagar in the 8th century AD. It is evident that the temple has been  
extended in the later years. Manikavasagar was one of the four important Tamil  
saints of Saivism (Lord Shiva worship) out of 63 Nayanmars (63 important  
saints of Shiva). You can find the idols of all 63 saints in most of the Shiva  
temples in South India. You can find four saints among 63 saints in separate  
shrines or in a higher platform in some temples. Manikavasagar is one of those  
four important Nayanmars. Avudayar Koil temple story is connected to the  
history of saint Manikavasagar.   
The King Arimardhana Pandian asked his minister Thiruvadhavoorar to buy horses  
and gave him money. The minister came to a place named Perunthurai to buy  
horses. However, he was impressed by a Ved "paatsaala". Ultimately, he  
attained "Gnana" (the ultimate knowledge) here, and he used the money to buy  
horses to build this temple. Initially, only a platform like thing was built  
and offering of rice was kept on the platform. The steam was considered as God  
(Shiva) for him. It is the same platform which still present inside the shrine  
and the same rituals are still followed. In the later years, Pandia kings  
extended the temple with beautiful sculptures and pillars. The minister  
Thiruvadhavoorar thus became a great devoteed of Lord Shiva, and got the name  
Manikavasagar. He wrote the famous "Thiruvasagam" in Avudayaur Koil temple.   
The main deity of the temple Athmanatha Swamy (a name of Lord Shiva) doesn't  
have any image or figure. There is just a platform in the main shrine. This is  
a unique feature of this temple. Another unique feature of this temple is that  
you cannot find Nandi, Dwajasthamba, and Chandikeswarar, which are commonly  
found in all South Indian ancient Shiva temples. The main goddess of the  
temple, Yogambal, has a separate shrine. Again, there is no idol for the  
goddess. You can only find Paadam (foot print) in the shrine. There is a small  
idol of goddess located outside the main shrine.   
As you enter the main temple, you can find small Pillayar (Ganesha) idol to  
your left. Next to that, there is a big shrines for the saint Manikavasagar.  
There are ancient paintings found surrounding this shrine. Also, there are  
very beautiful sculptures of Narasimha, Kaali, Ganesha, Subramanya, and  
others. There are also big life size scultpures such as Veerabhadra, Yatcha,  
Daksha, and others. All these sculptures are very beautiful and have  
uniqueness. Once you enter into the temple, there is a small mandapa full of  
scultpures. There are sculptures that are associated with the temple such as  
God making foxes as horses when the King was asking the minister for horses,  
and making the horses back to foxes. You can also find the idols of  
Arimardhana Pandian, Manikavasagar, and others.   
If you enter further into the temple, there is another Manikavasagar shrine  
surrouded by ancient paintings. There are many pillars with beautiful  
sculptures. On the ceiling, you can find Pancha Bhoothas. The main shrine of  
Athmanatha Swamy doesn't have an idol, as described earlier. The corridor  
(prakara) surrounding the Athmanatha Swamy shrine has the idols of Chokka  
Vinayaka, Manikavasagar, Nataraj, Bikshandar, Kali, Veerabhadra, etc. I have  
already mentioned about the shrine of goddess Yogambal. There is a tree  
(Kurutha tree - Sthala vruksham) where the idols of Shiva teaching  
Manikavasagar is found. There is a small shrine for Nataraj with Sivakami, and  
another shrine for Lord Muruga. The outer prakara has idols of Lord Ganesha in  
all the corners. You can also find the temple tank in the outer corridor. The  
idols of Muthu Vinayaka and Muneeswaran are also found there.   
All over the temple, you can find a lot of meaningful sculptures. There is no  
separate shrine or idols for Navagrahas (nine planets) similar to other  
temples. They are found only in the pillars. The 27 stars have figures in this  
temple. There is a saptha swara pillar (musical pillar). The stone chain is a  
famous sculpture in this temple. There are a lot to explore in this temple,  
which cannot be explained in detail in this post. Visit the temple to get your  
own experience.

Athmananda Swamy Temple   
Also known as:Thiruperunthurai Temple, Avudaiyar koil, Audayar Kovil   
http://www.hikeezee.com/explore/destinations/athmananda-swamy-temple-3133   
introduction   
Avudaiyar Koil (temple) also known as Athmananda Swamy Temple and  
Thiruperunthurai temple, is 50 kms from the town of Pudukkottai, a place that  
resounds with kings and traitors, history and bravery and art, music, culture  
and spirituality.. The reigning deity of the temple is Athmananda Swamy, but  
the temple is Avudaiyar Koil. Avudaiyar Koil is one among the 275 ?Paadal  
Petra Sthalams? or shrines that feature in songs sung by great saints and  
musicians.   
Unusually in this Shiva temple, there is no lingam in the sanctum sanctorum.  
Avudaiyar Koil has been embellished with beautiful sculpture and art work as a  
result of which the town of Avudayarkoil has been declared as a ?heritage  
town? by the government.   
Avudaiyar Koil is the temple of Athmanandaswamy. This holy place has an  
honoured place in the history of Shaivism. In inscriptions, this temple is  
known famously as Thiruperundurai (the biggest harbor) and is intimately  
associated with the Saint Manikavachagar, the great poet whose work  
?Thiruvasagam? or sayings is an important religious, spiritual and social  
commentary in Tamizh language..   
Inscriptions found in this temple describe it as a chaturvedi mangalam  
denoting the fact that it was the home of great scholars, who were masters of  
all the four Vedas, the holy scriptures of Hindus.   
 Attractions   
Sculptures   
Avudaiyar Koil?s mandapams (hallways) are decorated with breathtaking  
sculptures. The granite roofs are assembled and are marvelous pieces of  
construction. Avudayar Koil is famous for the art of Kodungai carving, the  
work done under the stone that forms the sun shade or overhang of the roof. It  
usually sits on top of the beam stone and is a superb example of the craft of  
the 9th century artisans. There is a popular story that states that any  
contract written for all subsequent temples specifically exclude the structure  
of Athmanandha Swamy?s Avudaiyar Koil from being replicated. Sculptors from  
these parts consider the sculptures of this temple as a benchmark in carving.   
The shrine of the dancing Lord Ganesha - Nardhana Vinayakar - is designed in  
such a way that the rays of the sun fall on the Lord throughout the year!  
Other masterpieces in carvings are the ones of Goddess Kali and the saint  
himself, Manikavachagar. The larger monolith figures of Agni, fire god and  
Agora Veerabadra (the doorkeepers) at the entrance are stunning.   
The offering of the ?naivedyam? or prasad is also unique in Avudaiyar Koil. On  
a platform in front of the Avudaiyar, the priest spreads hot boiled rice,  
greens and bitter gourd without salt. The steam that rises from these is the  
offering to the Lord.   
The striking granite sculptures in the Avudaiyar Koil temple are the many  
carvings, stone chains and the pillars of the mandapam. There are stone  
inscriptions that record one of the temple?s consecrations as 1891 CE. The  
chariot car of this temple is renowned for its wood carvings.   
Later periods of the temple?s history can be identified by the finest examples  
of the early Chola style of sculptures. An architectural description of the 27  
constellations and stories presented in a line of fresco paintings is  
beautiful.   
Avudaiyar Koil?s highlights are the Kuravan and Kurathi. The figures are  
examples of the attention to intricate details shown by the sculptors. The  
minute details from the toe nails to the hairstyles with every strand of hair  
delineated, to the veins and bones of the body lovingly recreated makes the  
visitor wonder at the dedication of the sculptors of that era.
