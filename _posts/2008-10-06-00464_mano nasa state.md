Mano nasa......   
If we have no manam (mind) suddenly, can we live in the present society. For  
day to day life is not necessary to have mind......Especially if you have a  
family and kids who do not have spiritual incliantion. comments please   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Manonasa does not mean destruction of mind in the literal sense.Mind is a very valuable tool available to us because it is a reflecting medium of Pure conscious being.This reflected light is useful to see the things in the phenomenal reality.Manonasa means destruction of   
snakalpa and vikalpa dosha.Rest of the mind functions normally even after  
manonasa.Bhagawan gave excellent guidance to humanity through   
his teaching on self-enquiry only after manonasa.In manonasa unwanted doshas  
of mind are destroyed,rest are preserved as before.   
You will attend to your family and kids more sanely after you attain  
manonasa.So dont be afraid of manonasa,kindly long for it.

Dear Ramanaduli, What Raju says is correct. Sri Sadhu Om   
says two things about mano nasa.   
1\. As Raju says, killing only the sankalpa and vikalpa dhosha. It   
is like roasting the gold in fire, to remove the impurities.   
2\. The other is destruction of the mind. Here again, even after   
the destruction of the mind, the mind remains as Pure Mind or   
Suddha Manas. This Suddha Manas does all the worldy work.   
It is the Pure Mind with which Sankara and Bhagavan composed   
all the poems and other works!   
Arunachala Siva.
