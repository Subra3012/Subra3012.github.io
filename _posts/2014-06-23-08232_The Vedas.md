The following are the Morning / Evening Vedic and Sanskrit Chants as followed  
in Ramana Ashram and I believe Bhagwan did give an outline for the same and  
others added some later. I once asked David Godman about this but he could  
not give me the proper answer to its background.   
If there is any changes in the list, I will make it.   
Ramana Ashram Morning Vedic and Sanskrit Chants at 8 a.m**   
1) Sri Ramna Chatvarimshat   
2) Sri Arunachla Pancharatnam   
3) Sri Taittriya Upanishad ( Sikisha /Anand /Bhrigu Valli )   
4) Sri Suktam   
5)Maha Narayana Upanishad ( some portions )   
Ramana Ashram Evening Vedic & Sanskrit Chants at 5 p.m**   
1)Dakshinamurti Stotram   
2) Sri Rudram   
3) Chamakam   
4) Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam,Durga Suktam   
5) Mantra Pushpam.   
 6)Upadesa Saram   
7) Nakarmana   
I have updated the list to make some changes after seeing the final version  
from the book  
"The Veda Parayana At Sri RamanaAshram - An English  
Translation .   
 **According to this book :**   
1) In Sri Bhgawan's lifetime, Vedic Chanting/Veda Parayana was held twice a  
day morning and evening, lasting about 40 mts on each occasion, and this is  
still continued.   
2) This with the Puja which follows it is the only ritual which was or is  
generally attended at the Ashram.   
 **3) It was an hour of tremendous silence when he sat immobile as though  
carved in rock. He never allowed anything to interrupt it. **   
 **4) When asked whether people should learn the meaning, so as to follow it,   
he said no : It was sufficient that the chanting served as a support for  
meditation. **   
5) Despite this, it is also true, however, that the portions used for  
chanting were carefully chosen and approved by Sri Bhgawan Himself.   
 **6) Nothing has been deleted from them since Sri Bhagwan 's lifetime and  
only one item added. That is Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra which, mainly on the  
request of the late Major Chadwick ( Sadhu Arunachala ) is now used as the  
opening hymn before the evening chant. **   
7) Technically in the past even listening to the Chanting of Vedas is supposed  
to made available only to Brahmins, but this prohibition was abrogated by Sri  
Bhagwan.

Dear Child Of Arunachala   
This is what I say to people who say they do not have time to visit the parent  
spiritual Organization ( like Ramana Ashram, Sivananda Ashram, Chinmaya  
Ashram, Ramakrishna Asharm etc ) i.e best is to follow some of the schedules  
there at your own home at least once in morning / evening preferably at the  
same time. If there is a morning aarthi / meditation there then follow it at  
the same time and if it is difficult in morning then try to follow it in  
evening. If it is difficult in the weekdays then follow the Sunday /Saturday  
Satsangs at least at your own house at the same time. Unless and until we try  
to develop some form of samskaras at home itself we will not progress much.   
Every Spiritual Organization has its own Satsang format that people can follow  
at least once a week if not daily at their own homes.   
The following gives the Satsang format as advised by Sri Ramana Ashram**   
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/centres/satsang-format/   
What are Ramana Satsang?   
A Ramana satsang is a group of devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi who gather  
together to strengthen their experience of the presence of Sri Ramana, deepen  
their understanding of his teachings and receive inspiration from fellow  
seekers on the path of practice as taught and lived by the Master.   
These meetings usually take place at devotees? homes, on a weekly, biweekly,  
or monthly basis.   
**A typical satsang program is as follows:**   
 1) Reading of the Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, from Talks with Sri  
Ramana Maharshi, or some similar book.   
 **2) Satsang Recitations ( A. AksaharaMana Malai 2.Ramana Satguru  
 3.Upadesa Saram 4.Arunachala Pancharatham 5.Nakarmana )  
 **3)Silent Meditation: this will vary from 15 minutes to an hour.**   
 4)A reading of Reminiscences of the Maharshi, from books like Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, etc.   
 5) If parents bring their children to the satsang, the children are  
encouraged to sing a bhajan or song from the Ramana Bhaje Namam CD or from  
some other composition on or about Sri Ramana.   
This concludes the satsang. Often arrangements for refreshments are made and  
then served to the devotees at this time.   
The Audios for the Satsang recitations are available for free download at the  
link above.

Visited Sri Ramana Ashram with my mother and stayed there ( this is the first  
time for my mother ) from 25-27 August 2019 and also Participated in the  
Punarvasu program ( Monthly Birth Star Celebration of Bhavagavn ) and after  
having an excellent lunch returned back fully refreshed and had an opportunity  
to spend one full day in the entire Ashram Schedule and it was very refreshing

## Re:[15] Lalitha Sahasranamam- Devotee of Lalitha Devi needs help / advice

Namaste PKar,   
Sorry, I am only now seeing this post. What the Devi is showing you is very  
profound. Please don't dissipate the blessings by posting it on an open forum  
or revealing it to anyone who is not your guru.   
If you don't understand the visions or even dreams, ask the Devi for  
clarification. She will give it to you. From what I can see is that she is  
providing your protection. Acknowledge it and thank her for it.   
I know how busy you are as a student in the U.S. but you are doing your best  
by chanting the Lalita Sahasranamam on Fridays. If you can, squeeze in a  
Tuesday as well.   
You seem quite evolved to be getting these visions. Treasure them rather than  
open them up to egoistic, stubborn, angry, hateful people on the spiritual  
path... you said you have posted this on two forums.... God knows who all are  
reading something so divine that is happening to you. It is not to be shared.   
As Lata said, if there is a Chinmaya Mission in your town, go there as often  
as your schedule will permit or to a Hindu Temple. Sit quietly and talk to the  
Devi..... but don't reveal these visions to anyone. Your answers will come. Of  
that I am sure.   
Wish you all the best,   
Child of Arunachala

Hello Child of Arunachala,   
Thank you for your advise. You are right. I was misled and have stopped  
praying for a while now out of anger due to difficult circumstances and  
lethargy. But I am planning to do something about it and will pay heed to your  
advise.   
Regards and may Devi bless you.

Dear Lathaji,   
Apologies for the late response. Thank you for the thought-provoking story. I  
am seeking advice from Devi itself instead of wandering for answers.

## Re:[90] The Vedas  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: August 08, 2014, 07:22:34 AM  
---  
**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas-The upangas** continued...   
 **Mimamsa and Adi Sankara**   
Buddhism on the one hand, Nyaya and Mimamsa on the other which were opposed to  
it, and Sankhya which does not accept Isvara but respects the pramanas of the  
Vedas: of these our Acarya accepts elements that are to be accepted and  
rejects elements that are to be rejected. He establishes the Vedantic system  
which harbours all these and which is their source. Sankara's view is not at  
variance with the ultimate message of Buddhism, that is the exalted state of  
jnana. He accepts some of the basic concepts of Sankhya like Purusa that is  
jnana by itself and equivalent to the Nirguna-Brahman and Prakrti which is the  
same as Maya. At the same time, he accepts the Vedic rituals of Mimamsa and  
the Isvara of Nyaya. But he sees each of them as an aspect of the one Truth,  
not as the final goal which it is to the various individual systems mentioned.  
He integrates these different aspects into a harmonious whole in his own  
system of thought.   
As we have already seen, Udayana and other supporters of the Nyaya system  
criticized Buddhism on the score that it was silent on the question of God,  
while mimamsakas like Kumarilabhatta attacked the same because it did not  
favour Vedic rituals. The acarya was in sympathy with these views and believed  
that Vedic sacraments, considered all-important by the mimamsakas were  
essential to the cleansing of the mind and to the proper conduct of the  
affairs of the community. However, he was opposed to the mimamsakas not only  
because they did not accept an entity like Isvara as the dispenser of the  
fruits of our actions but also because they did not believe that, after being  
rendered pure by works, there is any need for one to go further and take the  
path of jnana. He also did not agree with their view that to become a sanyasin  
giving up all karma is not right.   
Kumarilabhatta and Mandanamisra are particularly important among the  
mimamsakas. The Acarya had a debate with Kumarilabhatta during the last days  
of that mimamsaka and won him over to his viewpoint. Similarly, Mandanamisra  
also became a convert to Advaita Vedanta and came to be one of the Acarya's  
chief disciples assuming the title of Suresvaracarya.   
 **If the Acarya opposed Mimamsa, which is one of the fourteen branches of  
Vedic lore, it was not because he thought it to be wholly unacceptable. He was  
in agreement with the sacraments dealt with in that system, but he differed  
from it on the question of devotion to the Lord. He further believed that the  
fruits yielded by the rites, rewards like paradise, must be dedicated to  
Isvara and that in this very act of renunciation the mind is purified**.  
Sankara's teaching is this: it is only if we realise that Isvara is the Phala-  
data, the one who awards the fruits of our actions, that we will not be  
tempted by petty rewards like paradise. Only then will we be inspired to go  
beyond to attain the higher reward of inner purity. **The Vedic works were  
wholly acceptable to our Acarya. But for the mimamsakas they were an end in  
themselves; they did not transcend them to become devoted to the Supreme  
Godhead and to acquire jnana, the final realisation that Isvara and we are one  
and the same. Sankara criticised mimamsakas for their failure to understand  
this truth**. **That he did not oppose Vedic karma is proved again by the fact  
that in his upadesa (teaching) -it is called Sopana-Panchaka- before giving up  
his body he made the admonishment that the Vedas must be chanted every day and  
that the rites mentioned in them must be performed**.   
 **Vedo nityam adhiyatam   
Taduditam karma svanushtiyatham**   
The Acarya, however, taught us not to stop with karma (performed for the sake  
of karma), but to go beyond it. The rites that we conduct must be made an  
offering to Isvara. This is a means of obtaining inner purity and also that of  
receiving instruction in jnana. That is the time when we must give up all  
karma to meditate upon the teaching we have received, indeed meditate on it  
with intensity and make it our inner experiential reality. **Sankara takes us,  
step by step, in this way to final release. He opposed the mimamsakas because  
they failed to understand the purpose of Vedic karma and refused to go beyond  
it.**   
continued....
