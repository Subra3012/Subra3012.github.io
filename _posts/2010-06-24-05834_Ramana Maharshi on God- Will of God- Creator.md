## The nature of consciousness,mind and the need for Self-inquiry.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:09:37 PM

Mind is consciousness in movement.When that movement stops minding  
stops.Suppose we are walking   
and if stop walking legs will be there but the process,the function of walking  
stops.It is like pedalling a   
cycle.As long as you pedal the cycle moves,if you stop pedalling the cycle  
stops moving but cycle will be   
there.So when minding stops consciousness remains as a silent pool of energy.   
You are that consciousness.   
Minding is a function of consciousness but your nature is not the minding.   
The nature of minding is movement.If that movement is stopped due to any  
reason there is nothing like   
mind.Thought is the mind.If there is stilling of thought due to any reason  
there is no entity like   
mind(naiva manasam).   
In such a state we encounter static aspect of consciousness in full senses.   
The nature of such static consciousness is existence,Self-  
knowledge(awareness),bliss   
(Tranquility,peace).   
You think you are the mind. This fallacy that you are the mind gives the mind  
total freedom, because   
then there is no one to master it, to control it. There is no one! Mind itself  
becomes the master. It may   
become the master, but that mastery is just seemingly so. Try once and you can  
break that mastery  it   
is false.This breaking up of process of minding is possible in Self-  
inquiry.Then you will know for yourself   
about   
what is the nature of static aspect of consciousness and what is the nature of  
the minding which is just   
the dynamic function of consciousness.There is nothing wrong in minding but  
identity with that minding   
and thinking that minding as the me(thinker) is the wrong state of  
affairs.Then we go on minding   
(thinking) whether it is   
required or not.Self-inquiry stops that pathological minding,(thinking)   
and we develop mastery over the minding(thinking).If we master the  
minding(thinking) it is one of the   
best servant.But at   
present mind is behaving like a master   
without any control bringing so much disaster,disorder,chaos to the individual  
and society at   
large.Through Self-inquiry we develop the capacity to allow minding(thinking)  
when it is necessary and   
stop   
minding(thinking) where it has no role to play.For example thought i.e  
minding(thinking) has no role to   
play in human relation   
but we are relating with the other through thought only which definitely  
brings conflict,strife in the   
relationship.Then if we can posit in   
static aspect of consciousness during relating with the other,the relating   
is based on present moment and we have a healthy relationship.   
In science,technology we require minding and we should allow minding  
there.Once that task is over we   
should not go on minding but we should be back to our natural center of static  
aspect of consciousness   
and enjoy the serenity,tranquility,peace,bliss of it.This is possible through  
Self-inquiry.   
Then we become the master of our own mind which is superior than being   
emperor of the whole world.Existence feels fulfilled through us by becoming   
master of the mind.This is the purpose for which we are born on earth but   
we are preoccupied with doing all sorts of silly things which takes us no  
where   
from the present state of highly disordered life.

Question : What is the relationship between God and the world? Is he the  
creator or sustainer of it?   
 **Ramana Maharshi : Sentient and insentient beings of all kinds are  
performing actions only by the mere presence of the sun, which rises in the  
sky without any volition. Similarly all actions are done by the Lord without  
any volition or desire on his part. In the mere presence of the sun, the  
magnifying lens emits fire, the lotus-bud blossoms, the water-lily closes and  
all the countless creatures perform actions and rest.**   
 _The order of the great multitude of worlds is maintained by the mere  
presence of God in the same manner as the needle moves in front of a magnet,  
and as the moonstone emits water, the waterlily blossoms and the lotus closes  
in front of the moon._   
In the mere presence of God, who does not have even the least volition, the  
living beings, who are engaged in innumerable activities, **after embarking  
upon many paths to which they are drawn according to the course determined by  
their own karmas, finally realize the futility of action, turn back to Self  
and attain liberation.**   
 **The actions of living beings certainly do not go and affect God**, who  
transcends the mind, in the same manner as the activities of the world do not  
affect that sun and as the qualities of the conspicuous four elements [earth,  
water, fire and air] do not affect the limitless space.   
 _Question : Why is samsara - creation and manifestation so full of sorrow and  
evil ?   
Ramana Maharshi : God's will!   
Question : Why does God will it so?   
Ramana Maharshi : It is inscrutable. No motive can be attributed to that power  
- no desire no end to achieve can be asserted of that one infinite, all-wise  
and all-powerful being. God is untouched by activities, which take place in  
his presence. Compare the sun and the world activities. There is no meaning in  
attributing responsibility and motive to the one before it becomes many._   
Question : Does everything happen by the will of God?   
Ramana Maharshi : **It is not possible for anyone to do anything opposed to  
the ordinance of God, who has the ability to do everything. Therefore to  
remain silent at the feet of God, having given up all the anxieties of the  
wicked, defective and delusive mind, is best.**   
Question : Is there a separate being Iswara [personal God] who is the rewarder  
of virtue and punisher of sins? Is there a God?   
Ramana Maharshi : Yes.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2070: Nothing happens except that which is divinely ordained. Consequently, it is  
pointless for people [who want the world to be   
different] to experience anxiety and to be debilitated by distress.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1191: Iswara, the supreme being, actuates the jiva in accordance with his prarabdha  
to make that prarabdha completely exhaust itself. Through the power of  
prarabdha, that which is not destined to happen, will not happen, however much  
one may try, and that which is destined to happen will happen irrespective of  
what one may try to do to prevent it. The best course, therefore, is to abide  
in mauna.   
This is a rendering of the note that Bhagavan wrote to His mother, when she  
begged Him to return home in 1898.   
Muruganar has added to his verse 1191 of GVK: No one can do anything, that is opposed to the ordinance of the Supreme Lord  
who possesses unlimited power and who can do anything. Therefore, to end the  
anxiety of the deceptive mind,   
which engenders an evil discontent, the proper course is to remain under the  
spell of the supreme consciousness, which arises from meditating on the divine  
feet, with the mischief of the ego subsided.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 1 - Few Teachings Of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:27:13 AM  
---  
"Glory to Sri Ramana the Sage,   
Who firmly established in devotion   
to the Lotus-feet of Arunachaleswara,   
can undo the evil of the world and   
the misery of those who take refuge   
in Him. Glory to Ramana,   
glowing with merciful love for all."   
"Bhagavan Sri Ramana's Realization is unique   
and unparalleled in the annals of history.   
He realised in his boyhood the Eternal Truth,   
the Self Supreme, without the aid of initiation   
by any external Guru, without the need for   
theoretical knowledge and without any study   
of the Scriptures, and without having resorted   
to any ritualistic form of worship.....other than   
his spontaneous realization of the eternal nature   
of the "I", the Self Supreme."   
 **The sense of body is a thought;   
the thought is of the mind,   
The mind rises after the "I"-thought,   
the "I"-thought is the root-thought.   
If that is held,   
the other thoughts will disappear.   
There will be no body,   
no mind, not even the ego;   
only the Self in all its purity.**   
To remain as the Self   
is not difficult.   
 **Why should one think of birth and death?   
Are you really born?   
....all these are only of the mind.   
So long as the body is considered,   
birth is real. But the body is not "I".   
The Self is not born, nor does it die.   
There is nothing new.   
The Sages see everything as being   
in and of the Self;   
there is no diversity in it,   
Therefore, there is neither birth nor death.**   
The soul remains always uncontaminated.   
It is the substratum funning through these three states:  **Wakefulness passes off, I Am   
the dream state passes off, I Am;   
the sleep states passes off, I Am;   
They repeat themselves,   
and yet "I Am" remains.   
They are like pictures   
moving on a screen at the cinema show.   
They do not affect the screen.   
"I Am" remains unaffected...**   
Any new appearances are bound to disappear.   
Anything created will certainly be destroyed.   
The eternal is not born nor does it die.   
We are now confounding appearances with reality.   
Appearance carries its end in itself.   
What is it that appears newly?   
If you cannot find it, surrender unreservedly   
to the substratum of appearances;   
then, the reality remains as residue.   
Engage yourself in the living present.   
The future will take care of itself.   
Do not worry about the future.   
Doubts cease when the confusion is surpassed.   
Engage in self-investigation,   
then the non-self will disappear.   
The Self will be left over.   
This is self-investigation of the Self.   
The one word "Self"   
is equivalent to the mind,   
body, man, individual,   
the Supreme and all else.   
The Real is That what is;   
the others are only appearances.   
Diversity is not its nature.   
 **We are reading the printed characters   
on paper, but ignore the paper   
which is the background.   
Similarly, you are taken up by the manifestations   
of the mind, and let go the background.   
Whose fault is it?**   
Is there a difference between the   
individual soul and the Self?   
That is what IS.   
The mind obstructs the innate peace.   
Our investigation is only in the mind.   
Investigate the mind;   
then it will disappear.   
There is no entity by the name "mind."   
Because of the emergence of thoughts,   
we surmise something from which they start;   
that we term "mind."   
When we probe to see what it is,   
there is nothing of the sort.   
After it has vanished,   
Peace will be found to remain eternal.
