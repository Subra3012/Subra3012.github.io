Question : What is the relationship between God and the world? Is he the  
creator or sustainer of it?   
 **Ramana Maharshi : Sentient and insentient beings of all kinds are  
performing actions only by the mere presence of the sun, which rises in the  
sky without any volition. Similarly all actions are done by the Lord without  
any volition or desire on his part. In the mere presence of the sun, the  
magnifying lens emits fire, the lotus-bud blossoms, the water-lily closes and  
all the countless creatures perform actions and rest.**   
 _The order of the great multitude of worlds is maintained by the mere  
presence of God in the same manner as the needle moves in front of a magnet,  
and as the moonstone emits water, the waterlily blossoms and the lotus closes  
in front of the moon._   
In the mere presence of God, who does not have even the least volition, the  
living beings, who are engaged in innumerable activities, **after embarking  
upon many paths to which they are drawn according to the course determined by  
their own karmas, finally realize the futility of action, turn back to Self  
and attain liberation.**   
 **The actions of living beings certainly do not go and affect God**, who  
transcends the mind, in the same manner as the activities of the world do not  
affect that sun and as the qualities of the conspicuous four elements [earth,  
water, fire and air] do not affect the limitless space.   
 _Question : Why is samsara - creation and manifestation so full of sorrow and  
evil ?   
Ramana Maharshi : God's will!   
Question : Why does God will it so?   
Ramana Maharshi : It is inscrutable. No motive can be attributed to that power  
- no desire no end to achieve can be asserted of that one infinite, all-wise  
and all-powerful being. God is untouched by activities, which take place in  
his presence. Compare the sun and the world activities. There is no meaning in  
attributing responsibility and motive to the one before it becomes many._   
Question : Does everything happen by the will of God?   
Ramana Maharshi : **It is not possible for anyone to do anything opposed to  
the ordinance of God, who has the ability to do everything. Therefore to  
remain silent at the feet of God, having given up all the anxieties of the  
wicked, defective and delusive mind, is best.**   
Question : Is there a separate being Iswara [personal God] who is the rewarder  
of virtue and punisher of sins? Is there a God?   
Ramana Maharshi : Yes.

Dear prasanth,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2070: Nothing happens except that which is divinely ordained. Consequently, it is  
pointless for people [who want the world to be   
different] to experience anxiety and to be debilitated by distress.   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1191: Iswara, the supreme being, actuates the jiva in accordance with his prarabdha  
to make that prarabdha completely exhaust itself. Through the power of  
prarabdha, that which is not destined to happen, will not happen, however much  
one may try, and that which is destined to happen will happen irrespective of  
what one may try to do to prevent it. The best course, therefore, is to abide  
in mauna.   
This is a rendering of the note that Bhagavan wrote to His mother, when she  
begged Him to return home in 1898.   
Muruganar has added to his verse 1191 of GVK: No one can do anything, that is opposed to the ordinance of the Supreme Lord  
who possesses unlimited power and who can do anything. Therefore, to end the  
anxiety of the deceptive mind,   
which engenders an evil discontent, the proper course is to remain under the  
spell of the supreme consciousness, which arises from meditating on the divine  
feet, with the mischief of the ego subsided.   
Arunachala Siva.
