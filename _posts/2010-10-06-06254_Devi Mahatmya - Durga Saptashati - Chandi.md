**Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi**   
By _Devadatta Kali_   
(condensed from the original writing)   
In The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, M[Mahendranath Gupta] records a Sunday  
afternoon with some visitors to Dakshineswar in the winter of 1883. One of the  
visitors was well versed in the shastras [the sacred Hindu scriptures], and  
the conversation caused M. to fall into a pensive mood. Having some knowledge  
of Vedanta, he later asked Sri Ramakrishna, Is the world unreal?   
Why should it be unreal? Sri Ramakrishna responded. What you are asking is a  
matter for philosophical discussion. Later that evening Ramakrishna returned  
to M.s question and asked him again, Why should the universe be unreal? He  
continued, The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kali temple that it was  
She who had become everything. She showed me that everything was full of  
Consciousness. The image, the altar, the water-vessels, the door-sill, the  
marble floor  all was Consciousness.   
I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss  the Bliss  
of Satchidananda. I saw a wicked man in front of the Kali temple, but in him I  
also saw the Power of the Divine Mother vibrating. That is why I fed a cat  
with the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived  
that the Divine Mother Herself had become everything (M., 345-346).   
The Devisukta (RV 10.125) declares that the Goddess is the power expressed  
through all the gods, that they are united in her who shines with  
consciousness, that her presence is all-pervading, that she supports all of  
creation, that she is the source of righteousness and the revealer of truth,  
that she is the source of all worlds, yet that she shines transcendent beyond  
them. Among Shaktas this Vedic hymn is held in high esteem and is considered  
to be the source from which the entire Chandi sprang. Later, the Chandi itself  
was elaborated upon in the Puranas and Tantras. Still later its imagery  
inspired the Bengali mystics, Ramprasad and Kamalakanta, whose devotional  
songs so often evoked ecstatic moods in Sri Ramakrishna.   
In drawing comparison to the Bhagavad Gita, the authors of the Chandi wanted  
specifically to emphasize the Divine Mothers role, like Krishnas, in  
upholding the moral order of the universe and in leading humankind to  
liberation through the highest knowledge of the Self. The Chandi and the Gita  
have much else in common. Each is an independent text embedded in a larger  
work. The Gita belongs to the Mahabharata; the Chandi is an interpolation in  
the Markandeya Purana. Each is a synthesis of spiritual and philosophical  
knowledge drawn from diverse sources. Each begins with the story of one or  
more human beings in crisis, who will learn from a teacher in human form the  
way beyond all suffering. And each involves the battlefield as a metaphor for  
the field of human consciousness.   
The Bhagavad Gita begins on the battlefield, with Arjuna surveying the armies  
of his kinsmen on both sides, arrayed for battle. Plunged into despair at the  
thought of killing his friends and relatives, he turns to his charioteer,  
Krishna, who is none other than God in human form. Krishna then delivers one  
of the worlds great spiritual messages. The Chandi begins with King Suratha,  
likewise plunged into an existential crisis after losing his kingdom in  
battle.   
A wise and just ruler, Suratha discovers that even his trusted ministers have  
turned against him, and on the pretext of going hunting, he mounts his horse  
and flees for his life. After riding for some time into a dense forest, he  
comes to the ashram of a holy man named Medhas. This forest retreat is a place  
of great calm and natural beauty, where even the ordinarily ferocious tiger  
abides peacefully with the gentle deer. Yet Suratha knows no peace. His mind  
churns in agony at the thought of everything he has lost: his kingdom with its  
riches and privilege, the loyalty of his subjects, the glory of power. These  
thoughts torment him ceaselessly.   
One day another visitor arrives. His name is Samadhi, and he is every bit as  
despondent as the king. Once a prosperous merchant, he has been cast out by  
his wife and sons, who seized his wealth out of greed. He is deeply hurt by  
their betrayal and cannot understand it, being himself a man of good  
character. Most of all, he cannot understand why he still feels love for those  
who caused his deep humiliation and pain. And so, the king and the merchant  
approach Medhas the seer and ask why they are so miserable. Surely, as men of  
knowledge they ought to know better, but they are deeply perplexed.   
You say you are men of knowledge, Medhas remarks. Do you know what  
knowledge is? He explains that what the king means by knowledge is only the  
experience of the objective world. Through the senses, men, birds and beasts  
alike share such a knowledge, each species according to its own capacity. Such  
knowledge is relative. In every way, the knowledge gained through the senses  
is conditioned by time and space, and we are constantly deceived. Medhas  
explains further that animals act out of instinct; but humans have the added  
capacity to reason and make choices, although such choices are most often  
driven by self-interest and the expectation of results.   
If even our simple sense perceptions are so misleading, how much more  
confounded are we by the added factors of reason, will, memory, emotion and  
expectation? The operative principle here is that nothing in this world is as  
it seems to be. Not only are the king and the merchant perplexed, Medhas  
explains, everyone is, because even the wise are thrown into the whirlpool of  
delusion by the blessed Goddess Mahamaya. Who is this Mahamaya? the king  
asks. Whatever there is to know about her, all that I wish to learn.   
And so we arrive at the heart of the Chandi. The story of the king, the  
merchant and the seer acts as a frame that encloses three additional stories  
which Medhas relates to instruct his two disciples. Each story is an account  
of the Divine Mothers fierce, bloody battles with demons. Chandi falls into  
three parts, and they can be related to the three gunas, the basic universal  
energies or qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.   
 **First Part: The story of Madhu and Kaitabha:**   
During a period of cosmic dissolution, Lord Vishnu lies sleeping on the  
thousand-headed serpent Shesha, who drifts on the waters of the  
undifferentiated ocean. Sitting on a lotus that grows from Vishnus navel,  
Brahma, the Lord of Creation, surveys the four directions. Suddenly two  
demons, named Madhu and Kaitabha, spring forth from the wax in Vishnus ears  
and attempt to kill Brahma. Frantically he tries to awaken Vishnu, but the god  
is held in the power of Mahamaya, who is settled over his eyes as his blessed  
sleep.   
And so Brahma praises Mahamaya with a hymn. She allows Vishnu to awaken, and  
he battles with the demons for 5000 years, but without victory. At this point  
Mahamaya intervenes again. She confounds Madhu and Kaitabha with delusions of  
their own might and grandeur. Look at us, the demons think. Not even Vishnu,  
the Supreme Lord, can conquer us. Because he has fought so well, let us offer  
him a boon. They offered a boon and made a great mistake of pride.   
Vishnu replies, There is only one boon to ask: that I destroy the two of you  
here and now. In a last-ditch effort to save themselves, Madhu and Kaitabha  
look around and see only the endless cosmic ocean. Very well, they say, but  
on one condition: slay us where water does not cover the earth. The outcome  
of this story hinges on a pun, because the Sanskrit words for earth and  
thigh are almost the same. And so, Vishnu lifts the two demons to his thighs  
and cuts off their heads.   
Madhu and Kaitabha, in their near-bestial state, recognize no higher reality;  
they are violent, ugly creatures intent on gratifying their base instincts,  
often expressed through the thrill of intimidation or brute force. In their  
physical strength they grow exceedingly vainglorious. But of course pride goes  
before a fall, and their own arrogance becomes their undoing. Through the hymn  
that Brahma addresses to Mahamaya, the universal deluder, we learn much about  
the universe we inhabit. This hymn, the Brahmastuti, is composed in highly  
symbolic language that is often difficult to interpret, but it reveals  
profound insight into the nature of the cosmos. Although the ideas are  
expressed in devotional terms, the concepts are scientific even by todays  
standards.   
The Brahmastuti tells us that creation is a process of manifestation that  
flows from the One to the many. The Divine Mother is the infinite, nondual  
consciousness as well as its dynamic creative power; and she is ever present  
throughout all of creation. Before manifestation, she is the bindu, the  
dimensionless, nonlocalized point of concentrated shakti that contains within  
itself all possibilities. The Divine Mother gives birth to the universe,  
supports it and draws it back into herself in an ever-repeating cycle, because  
creation is without an absolute beginning or an absolute end. In this process,  
she who is nondual consciousness veils her radiant boundlessness with the  
limitations of time and space, name and form, cause and effect. Through these  
limitations she projects the finite world of our experience  a world that is  
both dark and dazzling, terrifying and enchanting. The Divine Mother is the  
all-encompassing source of good and evil alike, who expresses herself in every  
form. Yet beyond this apparent multiplicity, everything  be it spirit, mind  
or matter  is ultimately one.   
to be continued. ..

## Re:[1] Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi  
Author: silentgreen         Date: October 06, 2010, 12:24:02 PM

continued. .   
 **Second Part: The story of Mahishasura:**   
Medhass second story is intended especially for the king. Suratha, like  
Arjuna in the Gita, belongs to the ruling and warrior caste, whose duty is to  
uphold the moral order of the world. In the story that Medhas relates, an ill-  
tempered buffalo demon, named Mahishasura, wages war against heaven, casts out  
the gods, and usurps Indras throne. When the dispossessed gods seek Vishnus  
and Shivas help, the Divine Mother herself comes to the rescue.   
First from Vishnus brow, then from the bodies of all the other gods, a great  
radiance shines forth and coalesces into the beautiful form of Durga. The gods  
bow to her, recognizing that their own individual powers are only aspects of  
her supreme power. After Durga has slain Mahishasuras forces, she stands on  
the blood-soaked battleground facing the buffalo demon himself. Mahishasura,  
bellowing in confrontation, represents willfulness and monumental rage. Under  
his frenzied wheeling, the trampled earth breaks apart, his blasting breath  
tosses mountains into the air, his lashing tail causes the oceans to overflow,  
and overhead his mighty horns tear the gently floating clouds to shreds.   
Consider the symbolism: the power of human anger and greed threatens to  
destroy everything it touches: the goodness of the nurturing earth, the  
stability of the mountains, the expansive beauty of the oceans, the innocence  
of the gentle clouds. Under Durgas attacks Mahisha changes form  from  
buffalo to lion to man to elephant, every time eluding her deathblows. But she  
resolves to slay him, and when Mahisha returns to his mighty buffalo form, she  
pins him beneath her foot and thrusts her spear into his side. Instantly  
Mahisha reveals his true demon form, and Durga beheads him with her great  
sword.   
Like Mahisha, we go through life dissatisfied, often agitated, sometimes full  
of rage; and the causes of our misery change over time. One day its this, the  
next day its something else, and so it goes. Until we can pin down the root  
cause, our discontent cannot be overcome, and like Mahishasura that cause is  
loath to reveal itself. Mahisha represents more than monumental rage. His  
anger is one of six passions that afflict our human awareness. The others are  
lust, greed, pride, jealousy and delusion.   
The Divine Mother is infinite consciousness. When she projects herself as the  
universe of name and form, that consciousness appears divided among all  
beings. This apparent fragmentation creates the sense of individuality. Each  
individual self experiences its existence in terms of I, me and mine, as  
well as not-I, not-me and not-mine. And so the trouble begins. The root  
cause of our inner existential discontent and our outward conflicts is the  
feeling deep down inside that we are limited, separated and incomplete. We  
mistakenly identify with the limited ego, when in fact we are the limitless  
atman. That atman, abiding in every person, is the true Self  the one,  
undivided reality whose essence is pure being-consciousness-bliss.   
Just as Mahishasura is about to be beheaded by Durgas sword of knowledge, his  
glance meets hers, and he gets a fleeting glimpse of that truth  that his  
true identity lies dispassionate and blissful beyond the raging whirlpool of  
his passions. After he is slain, the gods celebrate Durgas triumph over  
Mahishasura in the longest and most eloquent of the Chandis four hymns. Known  
as the Shakradistuti [Praise by Indra and the host of gods], it invites us to  
reflect on the themes of good and evil, fate and free will, karma and divine  
grace.   
The hymn praises Durga as good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous and  
misfortune in the abodes of the wicked (DM 4.5). On the surface, this verse  
implies reward and punishment by a personal deity. The deeper, philosophical  
meaning points to an impersonal balancing principle at work in the universe,  
the law of karma.   
The story of Madhu and Kaitabha was concerned with the power of tamas: how in  
our ordinary state of being, we all walk around dazed and confused. In the  
story of Durga and Mahishasura, the power of rajas predominates. Mahishasuras  
rajasic energy controls him and impels him to destructive acts, but Durga  
controls her own fiery splendor. Her rajas is protective of her devotees and  
intent on destroying evil. Through this story Medhas teaches that through  
active struggle, we can overcome enslavement to our passions and live  
virtuously, in harmony with the world.   
According to Hindu teaching, life has four legitimate aims. These are dharma,  
artha, kama and moksha  virtuous conduct, material comfort, enjoyment and  
liberation. The first three form a category called bhukti, concerned with life  
in the world. Bhukti is the kings immediate concern. Having fled to the  
forest after his defeat, he has failed to fulfill his moral responsibility,  
and he still feels attraction for the privileges of kingship. In other words,  
he has unfinished business in the world. How different is the merchant  
Samadhi. World-weary and ready to renounce the pursuits of dharma, artha and  
kama, he is ready for moksha, spiritual liberation. For his sake, Medhas tells  
his third and final story, one that points toward realizing our inner  
perfection beyond the world   
to be continued. ..

 **Third Part: The story of Shumbha and Nishumbha:**   
Two demons, named Shumbha and Nishumbha, have dispossessed the gods, stripped  
them of their powers and appropriated their wealth and privilege. This time  
the cast of characters is much larger, and the demons seem more like us than  
the ones weve met previously.   
The complex scenario passes through three phases as we move progressively  
inward. The Mothers successive victories over a colorful cast of demons  
symbolize our own efforts at purifying our consciousness of every imperfection  
and misconceived notion. First the myth turns the mirror on our behavior and  
motivations. Next we are drawn in deeper to observe the mind and its workings,  
and finally we face the fundamental question of who or what we are.   
We first meet Shumbha sitting in his palace amid his glittering hoard of  
stolen treasure. The sickening excess of it all reminds us of our own  
materialism run amok. Soon the two fawning servants, Chanda and Munda, enter  
with news that theyve seen a young woman of captivating beauty dwelling in  
the Himalayas. Playing upon Shumbhas vanity, they suggest that he who is all-  
wealthy and all-powerful surely must also possess this jewel among women.  
Little do they know that she is the Devi, the Divine Mother herself, in her  
sattvic aspect. In the same way, we are drawn to the worlds enchantments but  
forget that they are expressions of the Divine. Shumbha, his lust aroused,  
wants to claim her as his own, just as we want to possess all that we find  
attractive and desirable. And just like us, if one way fails, Shumbha will try  
another, and another, with growing frustration.   
When his smooth-talking messenger, Sugriva, delivers a marriage proposal, we  
recognize in him our own lack of complete truthfulness. At first the Devi  
plays along with delicious irony, but after she refuses the marriage proposal,  
Sugrivas honeyed words turn threatening. If cajoling and deceit dont work,  
how about force? Next, Shumbha sends a dim-witted thug named Dhumralochana to  
fetch the Devi, kicking and screaming if need be. In other words, when we set  
our mind to something, how it affects others is not necessarily our concern.   
When Dhumralochanas brute force fails, Shumbha loses all reason and sends  
Chanda and Munda with a huge army to bring back that vile woman in any way  
or in any condition whatever. Notice how in Shumbhas agitated mind the jewel  
among women is now that vile woman. What was once so desirable is now the  
cause of his misery, and his desire now is only for the triumph of his own  
will. Dont we also overreact irrationally when circumstances frustrate our  
intentions? The struggle escalates, and the gently smiling Devi Durga calls  
forth the terrifying, emaciated form of Kali and eight other fierce goddesses  
to combat the demon hordes. Each one of these shaktis is an aspect of her own  
immense power. Each represents a higher function of our own consciousness.   
When Chanda and Munda lie dead, a demon named Raktabija strides onto the  
battlefield. He possesses a unique power. Whenever a drop of his blood falls  
to earth, another demon of identical size and strength springs up. In the  
fighting, demons proliferate from his spilled blood, and utter terror seizes  
the gods, until Durga merely smiles and tells Kali to roam the battlefield and  
lap up the drops of blood as they fall. The demons arising from it soon perish  
between her gnashing teeth; and Raktabija, drained of blood, falls dead.   
This scene bridges two levels of reality. On one level the glistening red  
drops of Raktabijas blood represent the overwhelming power of desire. Like a  
seed, every desire that falls on the fertile soil of our mind grows to  
maturity and bursts with seeds for the next planting. Every desire produces  
the seeds of many more, and we find we are never satisfied. The ghastly image  
of Kali, in her red-eyed, emaciated form known as Chamunda, avidly licking up  
the drops of blood, tells us that desires are best conquered when nipped in  
the bud.   
Another interpretation of the Raktabija episode takes us deeper into the mind.  
Patanjali, whose Yoga Sutra systematized the science of meditation more than  
two thousand years ago, wrote, Yoga is the control of the thought-waves in  
the mind. Anyone who has ever sat to meditate knows how difficult this is. No  
matter how hard we try to concentrate, the mind wanders from here to there.  
One thought gives rise to another. Raktabija symbolizes this normal, unruly  
state of human consciousness, where mental energy is scattered and unfocused.  
Chamunda Kali is the power of concentrated awareness that subdues the thought-  
waves and takes us to a calmer, purer state of consciousness.   
Finally, only two demons remain, the brothers Shumbha and Nishumbha. They are  
almost inseparable, and the Chandi calls Nishumbha the younger brother who is  
dearer to Shumbha than life itself. Shumbha represents the ego, and Nishumbha  
is the sense of attachment, the tag-along sibling that accompanies him  
everywhere. Earlier we spoke about the ego as a sense of separate selfhood.  
What we call ego is a limiting function of consciousness that in Sanskrit is  
called ahamkara, literally the I- maker. It is both a process of  
consciousness and the product of that process. Along with the sense of its own  
individuality, this I-making principle has the power of self-appropriation  
that claims things as its own.   
Here is where Nishumbha comes in. The attachment he represents is called  
mamatva, literally, my-ness. In a sense it is the glue that holds our  
identity together. We consciously attach our sense of self to things that are  
not the Self. We identify with our bodily characteristics, such as sex, size,  
shape, color. We define ourselves by our likes and dislikes, by the people in  
our lives and our relationships to them, by our professions, leisure  
activities, religious or political affiliations and countless other factors  
that combine in ways to make each one of us unique. We use our lifes  
experiences  what we do and what happens to us  to shape and reshape our  
identity. And so, our sense of self is constantly shifting.   
Sri Ramakrishna noted how a fine new garment or a new pair of boots can change  
an ordinary man into a swaggering fool, or how money can make a humble man  
arrogant (M., 169). Is our sense of self so fragile that a slight change of  
circumstance can cause us to reformulate ourselves? Every factor we identify  
with is known in Sanskrit as an upadhi, a defining attribute. But upadhi also  
means a limiting adjunct. We go through life acquiring upadhis, thinking they  
will make our identity bigger and better, but in reality we are merely adding  
to our limitations. Attachments to fame, influence, wealth and possessions  
only make our burden of personal identity heavier. The more we are reined in  
by our defining attributes, the more we lose sight of our larger sense of  
self.   
When we allow our happiness and misery to be dictated by things outside of and  
foreign to our true nature, we lose our autonomy. Lets consider the third  
meaning of upadhi: a substitute, anything that may be taken for something  
else, an appearance mistaken for reality. Our defining upadhis are components  
of a false sense of our own identity. In the end, they are no more than  
worthless tokens of our separation from the infinite Self. But how we hold on  
to them! When the Divine Mother finally slays Nishumbha, we get a graphic  
image of the ferocity of the struggle. Just when she has the demon cornered,  
he sprouts ten thousand arms with ten thousand grasping hands. This picture of  
ugly desperation illustrates just how desperate we are not to let go.   
Even with Nishumbha out of the way, there remains the ego-sense itself,  
denuded of all borrowed attributes. Now Shumbha, alone, stands face to face  
with the Mother. He points to her companion goddesses and chides her for  
relying on the strength of others in the fight. She answers, I am alone here  
in the world. These are but projections of my own power (DM 10.5).  To prove  
her point, the Shaktis vanish into her, and she then slays Shumbha. This final  
victory represents the realization of the true Self.   
There is no way to describe this immediate, unmediated knowledge of the atman;  
but that has not stopped mystics of every religious tradition throughout  
history from trying to express the inexpressible experience of the Divine. In  
the Svetasvatara Upanishad, a text certainly known to whoever composed the  
Chandi, the enlightened seer proclaims, I have known the unchanging, primeval  
One, the indwelling Self of all, everywhere present and all-pervading, whom  
the wise declare to be free from birth and eternal (SU 3.21).   
Medhas then relates how the gods again praised the Divine Mother in a fourth  
and final hymn. Three of its verses (DM 11.10-12) are well known in Vedanta  
circles. They are sung every evening around the world in temples of the  
Ramakrishna Order as the arati hymn Om Sarva Mangala Mangalye. Then, Medhas  
sends his two disciples to the bank of a river, where they meditate and  
worship the Mother devotedly. After three years she appears to them and offers  
each a boon. Suratha asks for the return of his earthly kingdom, followed by  
an imperishable kingdom in the next life. The merchant Samadhi, on the other  
hand, has grown wise and dispassionate. He asks for the knowledge that will  
dissolve the bondage of worldly existence.   
Through the Mothers grace, each boon is granted, in keeping with the Chandis  
teaching that the Divine Mother is bhuktimuktipradayini, the bestower of  
worldly enjoyment and liberation (DM11.7). How conversant Sri Ramakrishna was  
with the teachings of the Chandi is made clear in a conversation he had with  
members of the Brahmo Samaj in the autumn of 1882. In a single paragraph that  
summarizes the essential message of the Chandi, Ramakrishna said, Bondage and  
liberation are both of Her making. By her maya worldly people become entangled  
in woman and gold, and again, through her grace they attain liberation. She  
is called the Savior, and the Remover of the bondage that binds one to the  
world (M., 136).   
A short while later he added, I tell you the truth: there is nothing wrong in  
your being in the world. But you must direct your mind toward God; otherwise  
you will not succeed. Do your duty with one hand and with the other hold to  
God. After the duty is over, you will hold to God with both hands (M.,  
137-138). On another occasion Sri Ramakrishna said, Sometimes I find that  
the universe is saturated with the Consciousness of God, as the earth is  
soaked with water in the rainy season (M., 260). This calls to mind the  
Chandis third hymn, known as the Aparajitastuti, [Hymn to the Invincible  
Goddess].   
Unlike the three other hymns, which are intimately connected to the foregoing  
battle narratives, this one is an ecstatic celebration of the Divine Mothers  
presence in the world. It reminds us simply to see divinity everywhere around  
us, because the Mother abides in all beings as intelligence, order,  
forgiveness, modesty, peace, beauty, good fortune, compassion, contentment,  
and in countless other ways. We need only to remember her presence; and as a  
sign of her grace, it is she herself who abides in us even in the form of  
memory.   
We conclude with two verses from this hymn: To her who presides over the  
elements and the senses and is ever present in all beings, to the all-  
pervading Devi, salutations again and again. To her who pervades this entire  
world and abides in the form of consciousness, salutation to her, salutation  
to her, salutation to her, again and again (DM 5.77-80).

Dear silentgreen,   
Wonderful translation and beautiful pictures of Mother. In this   
Dasara week, this is a very essential post.   
Mahishasura is our ego.   
Sumba and Nisumba are our disease and death.   
Chanda and Musunda are our karma and maya.   
Dhumralochana is our lustful eyes, which is the prime among the   
five senses to cause sinful acts.   
Raktabhija is our blood, every drop of which is the cause of sinful acts.   
Mahakali should vanquish all these and remain as Suddha Maya   
in our mind to invite Siva for staying in our Heart. It is she who   
should give pure intellect to eschew the evils and attain our real   
nature.   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu buddhi rupene samsthitha....   
She should give us thirst and appetite for self realization.   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu thrushna rupena samsthitha...   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu kshudha rupena samsthitha....   
Kalyanyai pranatham vruddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo namah: Nairrudhyai bhoobrutham, lakshmyai sarvanyai the namo namah: Thanks once again, silentgreen,   
Arunachala Siva.**

## Re:[9] Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2010, 07:43:07 AM

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent explanation on Sri Suktam. Sri refers to wealth, not merely   
wealth in the meaning of riches, but also wealth of knowledge, and   
wealth of good conduct, and wealth of good health and ultimate wealth viz.,  
liberation.   
There is one Sakti Mahimna Stotram by Maharshi Durvasa. It contains   
61 slokas, the first one being benediction, the next 51 slokas referring to  
Sakti pitas and the last 9 by way of Palasruti.   
The Verse 27 says: Atmasou sakalendriyachraya mano buddhyadhibi sochita   
Karma baddha thanur janincha maranam prythithi yathkaranam   
Thathe devi mahavilasa lahari dhivyayudhanaam jayas   
Thasmas sadguru mabyuphethya kalayettvameva chen muchyathe   
Devi! This Jivatma suffers due to all the indriyas, manas, buddhi etc., and  
attains all miseries; It is bound by this birth and this body and revolves in  
the wheel of births and deaths. This suffering is due to your maha maya  
vilasam and all your divine weapons. If you direct me to a enlightened Guru,  
I shall get liberated from this. Please bless me.   
Pasam is iccha sakti. Ankusa is Jnana Sakti. Bow and arrows -viz., sugarcane  
and flowers denote the concept of mind, and Jnanendriyas. For an Ajnani this  
renders the bondage of samsara and for a Jnani this renders liberation.   
Raga swarupa pachatya krodharaangujojvala   
Mano rupeshu kodhanda pancha thanmaatra sayaka.   
 \- Sri Lalita Sahasranamam.   
Thanks once again for the exposition of Sri Suktam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
Saraswati is white in colour, like Jasmine flowers. She wears   
white saree. And she is seated on a white lotus with Veena on hand.   
Whiteness is symbolic of Knowledge, the highest knowledge, the   
Self Knowledge. She not only confers knowledge of arts and music   
and scriptures, but also the highest knowledge of Atma Bodham.   
Kalidasa who was a dunce and a fool, was given Sakti mantra   
written by Saraswati on his tongue and he became a world known   
poet. Kumara gurupara, a born dumb, was given milk by a young   
girl [Saraswati in disguise] inside a temple and he became a great   
poet at the age of 5. He sang Sakala Kala Valli Maalai and Kandar   
Kali Venba in Tamizh. He is from Sri Vaikuntam, near Tirunelveli.   
[/b]   
Arunachala Siva.

One must propitiate the Divine Mother, the Primal Energy, in order to obtain  
God's grace. God Himself is Mahamaya, who deludes the world with Her illusion  
and conjures up the magic of creation, preservation, and destruction. She has  
spread this veil of ignorance before our eyes. We can go into the inner  
chamber only when She lets us pass through the door. Living outside, we see  
only outer objects, but not that Eternal Being, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss  
Absolute. Therefore it is stated in the purana that deities like Brahma  
praised Mahamaya for the destruction of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha.   
Sakti alone is the root of the universe. That Primal Energy has two aspects: vidya and avidya. Avidya deludes. Avidya conjures up 'woman and gold', which  
casts the spell. Vidya begets devotion, kindness, wisdom, and love, which lead  
one to God. This avidya must be propitiated, and that is the purpose of the  
rites of Sakti worship.   
\-- Sri Ramakrishna
