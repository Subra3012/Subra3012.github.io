**Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi**   
By _Devadatta Kali_   
(condensed from the original writing)   
In The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, M[Mahendranath Gupta] records a Sunday  
afternoon with some visitors to Dakshineswar in the winter of 1883. One of the  
visitors was well versed in the shastras [the sacred Hindu scriptures], and  
the conversation caused M. to fall into a pensive mood. Having some knowledge  
of Vedanta, he later asked Sri Ramakrishna, Is the world unreal?   
Why should it be unreal? Sri Ramakrishna responded. What you are asking is a  
matter for philosophical discussion. Later that evening Ramakrishna returned  
to M.s question and asked him again, Why should the universe be unreal? He  
continued, The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kali temple that it was  
She who had become everything. She showed me that everything was full of  
Consciousness. The image, the altar, the water-vessels, the door-sill, the  
marble floor  all was Consciousness.   
I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss  the Bliss  
of Satchidananda. I saw a wicked man in front of the Kali temple, but in him I  
also saw the Power of the Divine Mother vibrating. That is why I fed a cat  
with the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived  
that the Divine Mother Herself had become everything (M., 345-346).   
The Devisukta (RV 10.125) declares that the Goddess is the power expressed  
through all the gods, that they are united in her who shines with  
consciousness, that her presence is all-pervading, that she supports all of  
creation, that she is the source of righteousness and the revealer of truth,  
that she is the source of all worlds, yet that she shines transcendent beyond  
them. Among Shaktas this Vedic hymn is held in high esteem and is considered  
to be the source from which the entire Chandi sprang. Later, the Chandi itself  
was elaborated upon in the Puranas and Tantras. Still later its imagery  
inspired the Bengali mystics, Ramprasad and Kamalakanta, whose devotional  
songs so often evoked ecstatic moods in Sri Ramakrishna.   
In drawing comparison to the Bhagavad Gita, the authors of the Chandi wanted  
specifically to emphasize the Divine Mothers role, like Krishnas, in  
upholding the moral order of the universe and in leading humankind to  
liberation through the highest knowledge of the Self. The Chandi and the Gita  
have much else in common. Each is an independent text embedded in a larger  
work. The Gita belongs to the Mahabharata; the Chandi is an interpolation in  
the Markandeya Purana. Each is a synthesis of spiritual and philosophical  
knowledge drawn from diverse sources. Each begins with the story of one or  
more human beings in crisis, who will learn from a teacher in human form the  
way beyond all suffering. And each involves the battlefield as a metaphor for  
the field of human consciousness.   
The Bhagavad Gita begins on the battlefield, with Arjuna surveying the armies  
of his kinsmen on both sides, arrayed for battle. Plunged into despair at the  
thought of killing his friends and relatives, he turns to his charioteer,  
Krishna, who is none other than God in human form. Krishna then delivers one  
of the worlds great spiritual messages. The Chandi begins with King Suratha,  
likewise plunged into an existential crisis after losing his kingdom in  
battle.   
A wise and just ruler, Suratha discovers that even his trusted ministers have  
turned against him, and on the pretext of going hunting, he mounts his horse  
and flees for his life. After riding for some time into a dense forest, he  
comes to the ashram of a holy man named Medhas. This forest retreat is a place  
of great calm and natural beauty, where even the ordinarily ferocious tiger  
abides peacefully with the gentle deer. Yet Suratha knows no peace. His mind  
churns in agony at the thought of everything he has lost: his kingdom with its  
riches and privilege, the loyalty of his subjects, the glory of power. These  
thoughts torment him ceaselessly.   
One day another visitor arrives. His name is Samadhi, and he is every bit as  
despondent as the king. Once a prosperous merchant, he has been cast out by  
his wife and sons, who seized his wealth out of greed. He is deeply hurt by  
their betrayal and cannot understand it, being himself a man of good  
character. Most of all, he cannot understand why he still feels love for those  
who caused his deep humiliation and pain. And so, the king and the merchant  
approach Medhas the seer and ask why they are so miserable. Surely, as men of  
knowledge they ought to know better, but they are deeply perplexed.   
You say you are men of knowledge, Medhas remarks. Do you know what  
knowledge is? He explains that what the king means by knowledge is only the  
experience of the objective world. Through the senses, men, birds and beasts  
alike share such a knowledge, each species according to its own capacity. Such  
knowledge is relative. In every way, the knowledge gained through the senses  
is conditioned by time and space, and we are constantly deceived. Medhas  
explains further that animals act out of instinct; but humans have the added  
capacity to reason and make choices, although such choices are most often  
driven by self-interest and the expectation of results.   
If even our simple sense perceptions are so misleading, how much more  
confounded are we by the added factors of reason, will, memory, emotion and  
expectation? The operative principle here is that nothing in this world is as  
it seems to be. Not only are the king and the merchant perplexed, Medhas  
explains, everyone is, because even the wise are thrown into the whirlpool of  
delusion by the blessed Goddess Mahamaya. Who is this Mahamaya? the king  
asks. Whatever there is to know about her, all that I wish to learn.   
And so we arrive at the heart of the Chandi. The story of the king, the  
merchant and the seer acts as a frame that encloses three additional stories  
which Medhas relates to instruct his two disciples. Each story is an account  
of the Divine Mothers fierce, bloody battles with demons. Chandi falls into  
three parts, and they can be related to the three gunas, the basic universal  
energies or qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.   
 **First Part: The story of Madhu and Kaitabha:**   
During a period of cosmic dissolution, Lord Vishnu lies sleeping on the  
thousand-headed serpent Shesha, who drifts on the waters of the  
undifferentiated ocean. Sitting on a lotus that grows from Vishnus navel,  
Brahma, the Lord of Creation, surveys the four directions. Suddenly two  
demons, named Madhu and Kaitabha, spring forth from the wax in Vishnus ears  
and attempt to kill Brahma. Frantically he tries to awaken Vishnu, but the god  
is held in the power of Mahamaya, who is settled over his eyes as his blessed  
sleep.   
And so Brahma praises Mahamaya with a hymn. She allows Vishnu to awaken, and  
he battles with the demons for 5000 years, but without victory. At this point  
Mahamaya intervenes again. She confounds Madhu and Kaitabha with delusions of  
their own might and grandeur. Look at us, the demons think. Not even Vishnu,  
the Supreme Lord, can conquer us. Because he has fought so well, let us offer  
him a boon. They offered a boon and made a great mistake of pride.   
Vishnu replies, There is only one boon to ask: that I destroy the two of you  
here and now. In a last-ditch effort to save themselves, Madhu and Kaitabha  
look around and see only the endless cosmic ocean. Very well, they say, but  
on one condition: slay us where water does not cover the earth. The outcome  
of this story hinges on a pun, because the Sanskrit words for earth and  
thigh are almost the same. And so, Vishnu lifts the two demons to his thighs  
and cuts off their heads.   
Madhu and Kaitabha, in their near-bestial state, recognize no higher reality;  
they are violent, ugly creatures intent on gratifying their base instincts,  
often expressed through the thrill of intimidation or brute force. In their  
physical strength they grow exceedingly vainglorious. But of course pride goes  
before a fall, and their own arrogance becomes their undoing. Through the hymn  
that Brahma addresses to Mahamaya, the universal deluder, we learn much about  
the universe we inhabit. This hymn, the Brahmastuti, is composed in highly  
symbolic language that is often difficult to interpret, but it reveals  
profound insight into the nature of the cosmos. Although the ideas are  
expressed in devotional terms, the concepts are scientific even by todays  
standards.   
The Brahmastuti tells us that creation is a process of manifestation that  
flows from the One to the many. The Divine Mother is the infinite, nondual  
consciousness as well as its dynamic creative power; and she is ever present  
throughout all of creation. Before manifestation, she is the bindu, the  
dimensionless, nonlocalized point of concentrated shakti that contains within  
itself all possibilities. The Divine Mother gives birth to the universe,  
supports it and draws it back into herself in an ever-repeating cycle, because  
creation is without an absolute beginning or an absolute end. In this process,  
she who is nondual consciousness veils her radiant boundlessness with the  
limitations of time and space, name and form, cause and effect. Through these  
limitations she projects the finite world of our experience  a world that is  
both dark and dazzling, terrifying and enchanting. The Divine Mother is the  
all-encompassing source of good and evil alike, who expresses herself in every  
form. Yet beyond this apparent multiplicity, everything  be it spirit, mind  
or matter  is ultimately one.   
to be continued. ..

## Re:[1] Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi  
Author: silentgreen         Date: October 06, 2010, 12:24:02 PM

continued. .   
 **Second Part: The story of Mahishasura:**   
Medhass second story is intended especially for the king. Suratha, like  
Arjuna in the Gita, belongs to the ruling and warrior caste, whose duty is to  
uphold the moral order of the world. In the story that Medhas relates, an ill-  
tempered buffalo demon, named Mahishasura, wages war against heaven, casts out  
the gods, and usurps Indras throne. When the dispossessed gods seek Vishnus  
and Shivas help, the Divine Mother herself comes to the rescue.   
First from Vishnus brow, then from the bodies of all the other gods, a great  
radiance shines forth and coalesces into the beautiful form of Durga. The gods  
bow to her, recognizing that their own individual powers are only aspects of  
her supreme power. After Durga has slain Mahishasuras forces, she stands on  
the blood-soaked battleground facing the buffalo demon himself. Mahishasura,  
bellowing in confrontation, represents willfulness and monumental rage. Under  
his frenzied wheeling, the trampled earth breaks apart, his blasting breath  
tosses mountains into the air, his lashing tail causes the oceans to overflow,  
and overhead his mighty horns tear the gently floating clouds to shreds.   
Consider the symbolism: the power of human anger and greed threatens to  
destroy everything it touches: the goodness of the nurturing earth, the  
stability of the mountains, the expansive beauty of the oceans, the innocence  
of the gentle clouds. Under Durgas attacks Mahisha changes form  from  
buffalo to lion to man to elephant, every time eluding her deathblows. But she  
resolves to slay him, and when Mahisha returns to his mighty buffalo form, she  
pins him beneath her foot and thrusts her spear into his side. Instantly  
Mahisha reveals his true demon form, and Durga beheads him with her great  
sword.   
Like Mahisha, we go through life dissatisfied, often agitated, sometimes full  
of rage; and the causes of our misery change over time. One day its this, the  
next day its something else, and so it goes. Until we can pin down the root  
cause, our discontent cannot be overcome, and like Mahishasura that cause is  
loath to reveal itself. Mahisha represents more than monumental rage. His  
anger is one of six passions that afflict our human awareness. The others are  
lust, greed, pride, jealousy and delusion.   
The Divine Mother is infinite consciousness. When she projects herself as the  
universe of name and form, that consciousness appears divided among all  
beings. This apparent fragmentation creates the sense of individuality. Each  
individual self experiences its existence in terms of I, me and mine, as  
well as not-I, not-me and not-mine. And so the trouble begins. The root  
cause of our inner existential discontent and our outward conflicts is the  
feeling deep down inside that we are limited, separated and incomplete. We  
mistakenly identify with the limited ego, when in fact we are the limitless  
atman. That atman, abiding in every person, is the true Self  the one,  
undivided reality whose essence is pure being-consciousness-bliss.   
Just as Mahishasura is about to be beheaded by Durgas sword of knowledge, his  
glance meets hers, and he gets a fleeting glimpse of that truth  that his  
true identity lies dispassionate and blissful beyond the raging whirlpool of  
his passions. After he is slain, the gods celebrate Durgas triumph over  
Mahishasura in the longest and most eloquent of the Chandis four hymns. Known  
as the Shakradistuti [Praise by Indra and the host of gods], it invites us to  
reflect on the themes of good and evil, fate and free will, karma and divine  
grace.   
The hymn praises Durga as good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous and  
misfortune in the abodes of the wicked (DM 4.5). On the surface, this verse  
implies reward and punishment by a personal deity. The deeper, philosophical  
meaning points to an impersonal balancing principle at work in the universe,  
the law of karma.   
The story of Madhu and Kaitabha was concerned with the power of tamas: how in  
our ordinary state of being, we all walk around dazed and confused. In the  
story of Durga and Mahishasura, the power of rajas predominates. Mahishasuras  
rajasic energy controls him and impels him to destructive acts, but Durga  
controls her own fiery splendor. Her rajas is protective of her devotees and  
intent on destroying evil. Through this story Medhas teaches that through  
active struggle, we can overcome enslavement to our passions and live  
virtuously, in harmony with the world.   
According to Hindu teaching, life has four legitimate aims. These are dharma,  
artha, kama and moksha  virtuous conduct, material comfort, enjoyment and  
liberation. The first three form a category called bhukti, concerned with life  
in the world. Bhukti is the kings immediate concern. Having fled to the  
forest after his defeat, he has failed to fulfill his moral responsibility,  
and he still feels attraction for the privileges of kingship. In other words,  
he has unfinished business in the world. How different is the merchant  
Samadhi. World-weary and ready to renounce the pursuits of dharma, artha and  
kama, he is ready for moksha, spiritual liberation. For his sake, Medhas tells  
his third and final story, one that points toward realizing our inner  
perfection beyond the world   
to be continued. ..

 **Third Part: The story of Shumbha and Nishumbha:**   
Two demons, named Shumbha and Nishumbha, have dispossessed the gods, stripped  
them of their powers and appropriated their wealth and privilege. This time  
the cast of characters is much larger, and the demons seem more like us than  
the ones weve met previously.   
The complex scenario passes through three phases as we move progressively  
inward. The Mothers successive victories over a colorful cast of demons  
symbolize our own efforts at purifying our consciousness of every imperfection  
and misconceived notion. First the myth turns the mirror on our behavior and  
motivations. Next we are drawn in deeper to observe the mind and its workings,  
and finally we face the fundamental question of who or what we are.   
We first meet Shumbha sitting in his palace amid his glittering hoard of  
stolen treasure. The sickening excess of it all reminds us of our own  
materialism run amok. Soon the two fawning servants, Chanda and Munda, enter  
with news that theyve seen a young woman of captivating beauty dwelling in  
the Himalayas. Playing upon Shumbhas vanity, they suggest that he who is all-  
wealthy and all-powerful surely must also possess this jewel among women.  
Little do they know that she is the Devi, the Divine Mother herself, in her  
sattvic aspect. In the same way, we are drawn to the worlds enchantments but  
forget that they are expressions of the Divine. Shumbha, his lust aroused,  
wants to claim her as his own, just as we want to possess all that we find  
attractive and desirable. And just like us, if one way fails, Shumbha will try  
another, and another, with growing frustration.   
When his smooth-talking messenger, Sugriva, delivers a marriage proposal, we  
recognize in him our own lack of complete truthfulness. At first the Devi  
plays along with delicious irony, but after she refuses the marriage proposal,  
Sugrivas honeyed words turn threatening. If cajoling and deceit dont work,  
how about force? Next, Shumbha sends a dim-witted thug named Dhumralochana to  
fetch the Devi, kicking and screaming if need be. In other words, when we set  
our mind to something, how it affects others is not necessarily our concern.   
When Dhumralochanas brute force fails, Shumbha loses all reason and sends  
Chanda and Munda with a huge army to bring back that vile woman in any way  
or in any condition whatever. Notice how in Shumbhas agitated mind the jewel  
among women is now that vile woman. What was once so desirable is now the  
cause of his misery, and his desire now is only for the triumph of his own  
will. Dont we also overreact irrationally when circumstances frustrate our  
intentions? The struggle escalates, and the gently smiling Devi Durga calls  
forth the terrifying, emaciated form of Kali and eight other fierce goddesses  
to combat the demon hordes. Each one of these shaktis is an aspect of her own  
immense power. Each represents a higher function of our own consciousness.   
When Chanda and Munda lie dead, a demon named Raktabija strides onto the  
battlefield. He possesses a unique power. Whenever a drop of his blood falls  
to earth, another demon of identical size and strength springs up. In the  
fighting, demons proliferate from his spilled blood, and utter terror seizes  
the gods, until Durga merely smiles and tells Kali to roam the battlefield and  
lap up the drops of blood as they fall. The demons arising from it soon perish  
between her gnashing teeth; and Raktabija, drained of blood, falls dead.   
This scene bridges two levels of reality. On one level the glistening red  
drops of Raktabijas blood represent the overwhelming power of desire. Like a  
seed, every desire that falls on the fertile soil of our mind grows to  
maturity and bursts with seeds for the next planting. Every desire produces  
the seeds of many more, and we find we are never satisfied. The ghastly image  
of Kali, in her red-eyed, emaciated form known as Chamunda, avidly licking up  
the drops of blood, tells us that desires are best conquered when nipped in  
the bud.   
Another interpretation of the Raktabija episode takes us deeper into the mind.  
Patanjali, whose Yoga Sutra systematized the science of meditation more than  
two thousand years ago, wrote, Yoga is the control of the thought-waves in  
the mind. Anyone who has ever sat to meditate knows how difficult this is. No  
matter how hard we try to concentrate, the mind wanders from here to there.  
One thought gives rise to another. Raktabija symbolizes this normal, unruly  
state of human consciousness, where mental energy is scattered and unfocused.  
Chamunda Kali is the power of concentrated awareness that subdues the thought-  
waves and takes us to a calmer, purer state of consciousness.   
Finally, only two demons remain, the brothers Shumbha and Nishumbha. They are  
almost inseparable, and the Chandi calls Nishumbha the younger brother who is  
dearer to Shumbha than life itself. Shumbha represents the ego, and Nishumbha  
is the sense of attachment, the tag-along sibling that accompanies him  
everywhere. Earlier we spoke about the ego as a sense of separate selfhood.  
What we call ego is a limiting function of consciousness that in Sanskrit is  
called ahamkara, literally the I- maker. It is both a process of  
consciousness and the product of that process. Along with the sense of its own  
individuality, this I-making principle has the power of self-appropriation  
that claims things as its own.   
Here is where Nishumbha comes in. The attachment he represents is called  
mamatva, literally, my-ness. In a sense it is the glue that holds our  
identity together. We consciously attach our sense of self to things that are  
not the Self. We identify with our bodily characteristics, such as sex, size,  
shape, color. We define ourselves by our likes and dislikes, by the people in  
our lives and our relationships to them, by our professions, leisure  
activities, religious or political affiliations and countless other factors  
that combine in ways to make each one of us unique. We use our lifes  
experiences  what we do and what happens to us  to shape and reshape our  
identity. And so, our sense of self is constantly shifting.   
Sri Ramakrishna noted how a fine new garment or a new pair of boots can change  
an ordinary man into a swaggering fool, or how money can make a humble man  
arrogant (M., 169). Is our sense of self so fragile that a slight change of  
circumstance can cause us to reformulate ourselves? Every factor we identify  
with is known in Sanskrit as an upadhi, a defining attribute. But upadhi also  
means a limiting adjunct. We go through life acquiring upadhis, thinking they  
will make our identity bigger and better, but in reality we are merely adding  
to our limitations. Attachments to fame, influence, wealth and possessions  
only make our burden of personal identity heavier. The more we are reined in  
by our defining attributes, the more we lose sight of our larger sense of  
self.   
When we allow our happiness and misery to be dictated by things outside of and  
foreign to our true nature, we lose our autonomy. Lets consider the third  
meaning of upadhi: a substitute, anything that may be taken for something  
else, an appearance mistaken for reality. Our defining upadhis are components  
of a false sense of our own identity. In the end, they are no more than  
worthless tokens of our separation from the infinite Self. But how we hold on  
to them! When the Divine Mother finally slays Nishumbha, we get a graphic  
image of the ferocity of the struggle. Just when she has the demon cornered,  
he sprouts ten thousand arms with ten thousand grasping hands. This picture of  
ugly desperation illustrates just how desperate we are not to let go.   
Even with Nishumbha out of the way, there remains the ego-sense itself,  
denuded of all borrowed attributes. Now Shumbha, alone, stands face to face  
with the Mother. He points to her companion goddesses and chides her for  
relying on the strength of others in the fight. She answers, I am alone here  
in the world. These are but projections of my own power (DM 10.5).  To prove  
her point, the Shaktis vanish into her, and she then slays Shumbha. This final  
victory represents the realization of the true Self.   
There is no way to describe this immediate, unmediated knowledge of the atman;  
but that has not stopped mystics of every religious tradition throughout  
history from trying to express the inexpressible experience of the Divine. In  
the Svetasvatara Upanishad, a text certainly known to whoever composed the  
Chandi, the enlightened seer proclaims, I have known the unchanging, primeval  
One, the indwelling Self of all, everywhere present and all-pervading, whom  
the wise declare to be free from birth and eternal (SU 3.21).   
Medhas then relates how the gods again praised the Divine Mother in a fourth  
and final hymn. Three of its verses (DM 11.10-12) are well known in Vedanta  
circles. They are sung every evening around the world in temples of the  
Ramakrishna Order as the arati hymn Om Sarva Mangala Mangalye. Then, Medhas  
sends his two disciples to the bank of a river, where they meditate and  
worship the Mother devotedly. After three years she appears to them and offers  
each a boon. Suratha asks for the return of his earthly kingdom, followed by  
an imperishable kingdom in the next life. The merchant Samadhi, on the other  
hand, has grown wise and dispassionate. He asks for the knowledge that will  
dissolve the bondage of worldly existence.   
Through the Mothers grace, each boon is granted, in keeping with the Chandis  
teaching that the Divine Mother is bhuktimuktipradayini, the bestower of  
worldly enjoyment and liberation (DM11.7). How conversant Sri Ramakrishna was  
with the teachings of the Chandi is made clear in a conversation he had with  
members of the Brahmo Samaj in the autumn of 1882. In a single paragraph that  
summarizes the essential message of the Chandi, Ramakrishna said, Bondage and  
liberation are both of Her making. By her maya worldly people become entangled  
in woman and gold, and again, through her grace they attain liberation. She  
is called the Savior, and the Remover of the bondage that binds one to the  
world (M., 136).   
A short while later he added, I tell you the truth: there is nothing wrong in  
your being in the world. But you must direct your mind toward God; otherwise  
you will not succeed. Do your duty with one hand and with the other hold to  
God. After the duty is over, you will hold to God with both hands (M.,  
137-138). On another occasion Sri Ramakrishna said, Sometimes I find that  
the universe is saturated with the Consciousness of God, as the earth is  
soaked with water in the rainy season (M., 260). This calls to mind the  
Chandis third hymn, known as the Aparajitastuti, [Hymn to the Invincible  
Goddess].   
Unlike the three other hymns, which are intimately connected to the foregoing  
battle narratives, this one is an ecstatic celebration of the Divine Mothers  
presence in the world. It reminds us simply to see divinity everywhere around  
us, because the Mother abides in all beings as intelligence, order,  
forgiveness, modesty, peace, beauty, good fortune, compassion, contentment,  
and in countless other ways. We need only to remember her presence; and as a  
sign of her grace, it is she herself who abides in us even in the form of  
memory.   
We conclude with two verses from this hymn: To her who presides over the  
elements and the senses and is ever present in all beings, to the all-  
pervading Devi, salutations again and again. To her who pervades this entire  
world and abides in the form of consciousness, salutation to her, salutation  
to her, salutation to her, again and again (DM 5.77-80).

Dear silentgreen,   
Wonderful translation and beautiful pictures of Mother. In this   
Dasara week, this is a very essential post.   
Mahishasura is our ego.   
Sumba and Nisumba are our disease and death.   
Chanda and Musunda are our karma and maya.   
Dhumralochana is our lustful eyes, which is the prime among the   
five senses to cause sinful acts.   
Raktabhija is our blood, every drop of which is the cause of sinful acts.   
Mahakali should vanquish all these and remain as Suddha Maya   
in our mind to invite Siva for staying in our Heart. It is she who   
should give pure intellect to eschew the evils and attain our real   
nature.   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu buddhi rupene samsthitha....   
She should give us thirst and appetite for self realization.   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu thrushna rupena samsthitha...   
Ya devi sarva bhuteshu kshudha rupena samsthitha....   
Kalyanyai pranatham vruddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo namah: Nairrudhyai bhoobrutham, lakshmyai sarvanyai the namo namah: Thanks once again, silentgreen,   
Arunachala Siva.**

## Re:[9] Devi Mahatmya / Durga Saptashati / Chandi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 12, 2010, 07:43:07 AM

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent explanation on Sri Suktam. Sri refers to wealth, not merely   
wealth in the meaning of riches, but also wealth of knowledge, and   
wealth of good conduct, and wealth of good health and ultimate wealth viz.,  
liberation.   
There is one Sakti Mahimna Stotram by Maharshi Durvasa. It contains   
61 slokas, the first one being benediction, the next 51 slokas referring to  
Sakti pitas and the last 9 by way of Palasruti.   
The Verse 27 says: Atmasou sakalendriyachraya mano buddhyadhibi sochita   
Karma baddha thanur janincha maranam prythithi yathkaranam   
Thathe devi mahavilasa lahari dhivyayudhanaam jayas   
Thasmas sadguru mabyuphethya kalayettvameva chen muchyathe   
Devi! This Jivatma suffers due to all the indriyas, manas, buddhi etc., and  
attains all miseries; It is bound by this birth and this body and revolves in  
the wheel of births and deaths. This suffering is due to your maha maya  
vilasam and all your divine weapons. If you direct me to a enlightened Guru,  
I shall get liberated from this. Please bless me.   
Pasam is iccha sakti. Ankusa is Jnana Sakti. Bow and arrows -viz., sugarcane  
and flowers denote the concept of mind, and Jnanendriyas. For an Ajnani this  
renders the bondage of samsara and for a Jnani this renders liberation.   
Raga swarupa pachatya krodharaangujojvala   
Mano rupeshu kodhanda pancha thanmaatra sayaka.   
 \- Sri Lalita Sahasranamam.   
Thanks once again for the exposition of Sri Suktam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
Saraswati is white in colour, like Jasmine flowers. She wears   
white saree. And she is seated on a white lotus with Veena on hand.   
Whiteness is symbolic of Knowledge, the highest knowledge, the   
Self Knowledge. She not only confers knowledge of arts and music   
and scriptures, but also the highest knowledge of Atma Bodham.   
Kalidasa who was a dunce and a fool, was given Sakti mantra   
written by Saraswati on his tongue and he became a world known   
poet. Kumara gurupara, a born dumb, was given milk by a young   
girl [Saraswati in disguise] inside a temple and he became a great   
poet at the age of 5. He sang Sakala Kala Valli Maalai and Kandar   
Kali Venba in Tamizh. He is from Sri Vaikuntam, near Tirunelveli.   
[/b]   
Arunachala Siva.

One must propitiate the Divine Mother, the Primal Energy, in order to obtain  
God's grace. God Himself is Mahamaya, who deludes the world with Her illusion  
and conjures up the magic of creation, preservation, and destruction. She has  
spread this veil of ignorance before our eyes. We can go into the inner  
chamber only when She lets us pass through the door. Living outside, we see  
only outer objects, but not that Eternal Being, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss  
Absolute. Therefore it is stated in the purana that deities like Brahma  
praised Mahamaya for the destruction of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha.   
Sakti alone is the root of the universe. That Primal Energy has two aspects: vidya and avidya. Avidya deludes. Avidya conjures up 'woman and gold', which  
casts the spell. Vidya begets devotion, kindness, wisdom, and love, which lead  
one to God. This avidya must be propitiated, and that is the purpose of the  
rites of Sakti worship.   
\-- Sri Ramakrishna

During the sadhana of Vichara, one should not get fascinated with the word "I"  
but understand it from the proper perspective. Today there are I-Phones,  
I-Pads, I-Wishes, I-10s, I-20s etc. So we are uttering 'I' more than ever  
before. But this 'I' is more binding than liberating. The 'I' which liberates  
is the source of 'I' and not the word 'I'. That source is nameless and can as  
well be represented by 'You'.   
There are subjective advantages and disadvantages of each: 1\. The advantage of 'I' is the direct focus on the self compared to 'You'  
(without devotion) building a layer of concepts. Here 'You' is only  
objectifying, cutting itself off from the subject 'I'. With devotion and  
proper guidance of guru this will not happen but it is likely to happen for  
many others.   
2\. The advantage of 'You' is a little subtle. It can only be appreciated if  
one is true to oneself. In the journey towards the source of 'I' one finds  
that whatever progress one makes the 'I' will always remain 'smaller' than the  
Cosmic 'I' which creates and destroys the Universe. Even after self-  
realization one does not become the master of creation. One may not even know  
the thoughts going on in the minds of other individuals. Self-realization will  
give the understanding of the True Essence. This understanding of True Essence  
will give the understanding of Maya. But this understanding of Maya does not  
make one the wielder of Maya (Mahamaya).   
So what has happened actually? The essence of Mahamaya is understood and one  
gets the ability to touch the feet of Mahamaya in samadhi. The body and mind  
still needs to take part in the drama of Mahamaya, though in a detached  
manner. Even if this particular body is casted off, there are other bodies  
which continues with the play of the Mahamaya.   
Seeing Sri Ramakrishna still clapping hands and chanting the names of Gods  
after Vedantic realization, Totapuri was annoyed and jeered at him commenting  
whether he was making chappatis by clapping his hands. What is the use of  
going back to the old habit of clapping and chanting when the highest  
realization was imparted to him? Totapuri got the answer in the subsequent  
events of his life. Totapuri understood that Mahamaya which he considered as a  
'rusty' thing for Vedantists till then is not a 'rusty' thing at all. It  
shines always. In fact it shines better in realization than Avidya.   
So appreciating the presence of the Mahamaya as the controller of the  
Universe, as the controller of individual souls, as the Cosmic 'I', Whose  
essence is understood better through self-realization, Whose feet is reached  
through knowledge, one starts appreciating 'You' without discarding the  
appreciation for 'I'.   
Then one may say: 'I am where I am, You are where You are.'

**The world is a dream**   
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The  
fisherman, to be sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to  
those who live in the world? Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who  
could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an  
office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life  
there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street?  
Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as before. Even  
after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live in  
the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were  
living as householders.   
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"   
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."   
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing  
him, the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father.  
Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are  
even.'   
During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night  
on the formless God. _Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize  
God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without  
form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted_. Sambhu Mallick used  
to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a  
friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you  
come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set  
out repeating the name of God! What danger can befall me?' _Through faith  
alone one attains everything._ I used to say, 'I shall take all this to be  
true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden  
talks to me.' What I would think of would   
invariably come to pass."

M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that  
only superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with  
actual events. Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"   
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the  
name of God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would  
invariably come to pass.(To Manilal) _But you must remember, unless one is  
guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith._ Bony people, the  
hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot  
easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?"   
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and  
some other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The  
Master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine  
Mother. There was complete silence.   
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered  
the room and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit  
down. The Master had known her for many years. In her younger days she had  
lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he  
began to converse with her.   
MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy  
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"   
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"   
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"   
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place,  
and my name is inscribed there on a slab."   
MASTER: "Indeed!"   
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."   
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"   
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him,  
touching his feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up  
and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer  
of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed with the holy water the  
spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were amazed to see  
this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead.   
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should  
salute me from a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment,  
the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a few songs."

The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight   
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet.. . .   
Then he sang: High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite,   
When came a gust of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth..   
..   
Again: Dwell, O mind, within yourself;   
Enter no other's home.   
If you but seek there, you will find   
All you are searching for.   
God, the true Philosopher's Stone,   
Who answers every prayer,

**Tuesday, June 5, 1883**   
Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at  
Dakshineswar. M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a  
week-day there were only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered  
there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays.   
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his  
experiences during his God-intoxicated state.   
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat  
my meals here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at  
Baranagore or at Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just  
sit down there without saying a word. If the members of the household asked me  
why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to eat.' _Now and then I  
would go, uninvited of course_, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to  
the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the  
Choudhurys' house.   
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: _'  
Devendra chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?_'  
Mathur Babu was a very proud man. _How could one expect him to go to another  
man 's house uninvited? _ At first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right.  
Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.'   
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar  
near the bridge. _He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding  
me insistent, he took me to Dina 's house in a carriage. It was a small  
place_. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage embarrassed the inmates.  
We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with the  
sacred thread. _The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina  
to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really a  
distressing situation_. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never  
listen to you again.' I laughed.

"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the  
sadhus and invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When  
I sat down for the meal, several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt  
like leaving them and sitting alone. I wondered why they should bother about  
all that. The sadhus took their seats. I began to eat before they had started.  
I heard several of them remark, 'Oh! What sort of man   
is this?' "   
 **Parable of the farmer**   
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the  
steps of his verandah. Hazra, Rakhal, and M. were near him. _Hazra had the  
attitude of a Vedantist: "I am He."_   
MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the  
farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son  
was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the  
boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the  
wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he hasn't even  
one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you  
know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and the  
father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as virtuous.  
They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts.  
Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those  
seven children or this one boy.'   
_To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the dream state. "God  
alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will."_

**Law of karma**   
HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the  
sadhu of Bhukailas. How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They  
had found him in   
samadhi. First they buried him, then they put him under water, and then they  
branded him with a hot iron. Thus they brought him back to consciousness of  
the world. But in the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures. _He  
undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the  
will of God. "_   
MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of  
that holy man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The  
kavirajs prepare   
makaradhvaja in a bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the  
fire. The gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other  
ingredients, and the medicine is made. Then the physicians break the bottle  
carefully and take out the medicine. _When the medicine is made, what  
difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or broken? So people  
think that the holy man was killed. But perhaps his inner stuff had been made.  
After the realization of God, what difference does it make whether the body  
lives or dies?_ "

**Different kinds of samadhi**   
"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My  
own spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of  
Hrishikesh. Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as  
though it were the creeping of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of  
a monkey jumping from one branch to another. Again, sometimes it feels like a  
fish swimming in water. Only he who experiences it knows what it is like. _In  
samadhi one forgets the world. When the mind comes down a little, I say to the  
Divine Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I want to talk to people._'   
"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness  
after attaining samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual  
discipline; but they do not come back. But when God Himself is born as a man,  
as an Incarnation, holding in His hand the key to others' liberation, then for  
the welfare of humanity the Incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness  
of the world."   
M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's  
liberation?"   
HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an  
Incarnation of God exists or not?"   
It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness  
enveloped the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the  
temple garden. The black sky was reflected in the waters of the Ganges.

**Maa Durga**   
The Mahishasura Mardini stotra says:  **अ यि गिरिनन्दिनि नन्दितमेदिनि विश्वविनोदिनि नन्दिनुते**   
Ayi Giri Nandini Nandita Medini Vidhva Vinodini Nandi Nute   
"Vishva Vinodini" means one who fills the whole world with joy. The main Durga  
Puja is during Sharadiya Navaratri in the autumn season. "Mother is coming",  
this thought fills the whole world with joy. In West Bengal, the sharad ritu  
or the autumn season had got correlated with Durga Puja; everywhere people  
look forward: "Maa aasche", the "Mother is coming".   
The "Mahishasura Mardini stotra" vividly depicts the personality of Devi  
Durga. It is quite a big stotra and in quite difficult sanskrit, but still it  
is very popular and has been rendered by various artists. This is because  
Durga Devi is Vishva Vinodini, Her thought itself gives inspiration.   
In a life filled with sorrows the contemplation on the form and personality of  
Devi Durga itself uplifts the soul, filling it with joy and strength. The  
mighty form with ten hands and seated on a lion, worshipped with conch,  
cymbals and drums, takes us to another world altogether. .. as if the Mother  
of the whole universe has come down to earth to bless Her children.   
Jai Durga

**Maa Durga**   
Mahishasura Mardini stotram says:  **भ ूरिकुटुम्बिनि भूरिकृते**   
Bhuri-Kuttumbini Bhuri-Krte   
The Divine Mother has many relations and She has created abundance   
Being the Cosmic Mother, everyone is Her children, so She has many many  
relations.   
For the sustenance of the life of Her children, She has created the trees to  
provide fruits and vegetables, rivers to provide water and atmosphere to  
provide air. So She has created abundance in nature.   
However much man becomes modern, his food will come from trees and plants,  
water from ground, river or sea, and air from atmosphere. So for our daily  
sustenance we depend on Her, and this is reason enough to remember and thank  
Her everyday.   
Jai Durga

**Maa Durga**   
The Mahishasura Mardini stotram starts with describing the Devi as "Vishwa  
Vinodini", One Who gives Joy to the world. The Durga Chalisa similarly starts  
with "Namo Namo Durge Sukha Karani", Salutations to Durga Who bestows  
Happiness. Adi Shankaracharya's Annapoorna stotram starts with describing the  
Devi as "Nityanandakari", One Who always gives Joy. These are not mere  
coincidences.   
Only the Divine can bring that peace which is beyond understanding.   
Only the Divine can bring that Joy which is beyond understanding.   
We often pray to God for overcoming troubles which are the results of our  
karma and also collective karma. But God normally does not interfere with the  
results of karma. On the other hand God gives the taste of Joy which is  
beyond. This Joy enables us to overcome the karmic cause and effects.   
In the story of child Krishna, a lady fruit-seller gave away her fruits to Sri  
Krishna due to the great Joy she experienced in the presence of Krishna. After  
tapasya Sri Vishnu appeared before child Dhruva who had many questions to ask.  
But when Sri Vishnu put His hand on the head of Dhruva, he experienced an  
ineffable peace and all his questions of life were as if answered.   
So salutations to the Divine Mother Who is Nitya Anandakari (Who always gives  
Joy), being the repository of bliss Herself.   
Jai Durga

The steamer had been going toward Calcutta; but the passengers, with their  
eyes fixed on the Master and their ears given to his nectar-like words, were  
oblivious of its motion.Dakshineswar, with its temples and gardens, was left  
behind. The paddles of the boat churned the waters of the Ganges with a  
murmuring sound. But the devotees were indifferent to all this. Spellbound,  
they looked on a great yogi, his face lighted with a divine smile, his  
countenance radiating love, his eyes sparkling with joy-a man who had  
renounced all for God and who knew nothing but God. Unceasing words of wisdom  
flowed from his lips.   
 **Reasoning of jnanis**   
MASTIER: "The jnanis, who adhere to the non-dualistic philosophy of Vedanta,  
say that the acts of creation, preservation, and destruction, the universe  
itself and all its living beings, are the manifestations of Sakti, the Divine  
Power. If you reason it out, you will realize that all these are as illusory  
as a dream. Brahman alone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even this  
very Sakti is unsubstantial, like a dream.   
" _But though you reason all your life, unless you are established in samadhi,  
you cannot go beyond the jurisdiction of Sakti. Even when you say, 'I am  
meditating', or 'I am contemplating', still you are moving in the realm of  
Sakti, within Its power_".   
 **Identity of Brahman and Sakti**   
"Thus Brahman and Sakti are identical. If you accept the one, you must accept  
the other. It is like fire and its power to burn. If you see the fire, you  
must recognize its power to burn also. You cannot think of fire without its  
power to burn, nor can you think of the power to burn without fire. You cannot  
conceive of the sun's rays without the sun, nor can you conceive of the sun  
without its rays.   
"What is milk like? Oh, you say, it is something white. You cannot think of  
the milk without the whiteness, and again, you cannot think of the whiteness  
without the milk.   
Thus one cannot think of Brahman without Sakti, or of Sakti without Brahman.  
One cannot think of the Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relative  
without the Absolute".   
"The Primordial Power is ever at play. She is creating, preserving, and  
destroying in play, as it were. This Power is called Kali. Kali is verily  
Brahman, and Brahman is verily Kali. It is one and the same Reality. When we  
think of It as inactive, that is to say, not engaged in the acts of creation,  
preservation, and destruction, then we call It Brahman. But when It engages in  
these activities, then we call It Kali or Sakti. The Reality is one and the  
same; the difference is in name and form.   
"It is like water, called in different languages by different names, such as  
'jal', 'pani', and so forth. There are three or four ghats on a lake. The  
Hindus, who drink water at one place, call it 'jal'. The Mussalmans at another  
place call it 'pani'. And the English at a third place call it 'water'. All  
three denote one and the same thing, the difference being in the name only. In  
the same way, some address the Reality as 'Allah', some as 'God', some as  
'Brahman', some as 'Kali', and others by such names as 'Rama', 'Jesus',  
'Durga', 'Hari.' "   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

Dear Sri Silentgreen,   
This is one beautiful,beautiful thread! How much love and devotion in it,how

Thank You Very much!

**A Hymn To The Divine Mother   
Thou most beautiful! Whose holy hands   
Hold pleasure and hold pain! Doer of good!   
Who art Thou? The water of existence   
By Thee is whirled and tossed in mighty waves.   
Is it, O Mother, to restore again   
This universe's broken harmony   
That Thou, without cessation, art at work?   
Oh! May the Mother of the universe--   
In whose activity no respite rests,   
Incessantly distributing the fruits   
Of action done, guiding unceasingly   
All action yet to come--bestow Her boon   
Of blessing on me, Her child, for evermore.   
I realise, I know, that it is Thou   
Who holdest in Thy hands dread Karma's rope.   
Is it inherent nature? Something uncreate?   
Or Destiny? Some unforeseen result?--   
Who lacking nothing, is accountable,   
Whose chain of will, untrammelled, grasps the laws,   
May She, the Primal Guide, my shelter be!   
Manifestations of Her glory show   
In power of immeasurable might,   
Throughout the universe, powers that swell   
The sea of birth and death, forces that change   
And break up the Unchanged and changed again.   
Lo! Where shall we seek refuge, save in Her?   
To friend and foe Thy lotus-eyes are even;   
Ever Thine animating touch brings fruit   
To fortunate and unfortunate alike;   
The shade of death and immortality--   
Both these, O mother, are Thy grace Supreme!   
Mother Supreme! Oh, may Thy gracious face   
Never be turned away from me, Thy child!   
What Thou art, the Mother? the All. How praise?   
My understanding is so little worth.   
'Twere like desire to seize with hands of mine   
The sole Supporter of the universe!   
So, at Thy blessed feet--contemplated   
By the Goddess of Fortune Herself--the abode   
Of fearlessness, worshipped by service true--   
There, at those blessed feet, I take refuge!   
She who, since birth, has ever led me on   
Through paths of trouble to perfection's goal.   
Mother-wise, in Her own sweet playful ways,   
She, who has always through my life inspired   
My understanding, She, my Mother, She,   
The All, is my resort, whether r my work   
O'erflow with full fruition or with none.   
\- Swami Vivekananda

Parvati had fallen in love with Shiva and she didnât know what she  
could do about it. She thought of Shiva all the time.   
One day the sage Narada came and told her, Shiva is only pleased with tapasya.  
Without tapasya, even Brahma and the other gods do not get to see Shiva. Why  
donât you perform tapasya?   
Parvati decided to do what Narada had asked her to. She asked her parents for  
permission. Her father agreed with alacrity. Although her mother Menaka was  
not at all keen that Parvati should perform difficult tapasya, she too  
eventually agreed.   
Parvati gave up her jewellery and handsome clothes. She wore deerskin instead.  
There is a peak in the Himalayas known as Gouriskikhara. It is there that  
Parvati went for her tapasy. The meditation was very difficult. During the  
monsson Parvati meditated while seated on the ground. In the winter she  
mediated under the water. Wild beats dared not harm her. All the gods and  
sages assembled to see this wonderful tapasya. The gods and the sages also  
began to pray to Shiva. Lord, canât you see that Parvati is performing  
difficult tapasya? They asked. No one has meditated like this before. No one  
will meditate like this in the future. Please grant her what she wants.   
Shiva adopted the form of an old brahmana (the first of the four classes) and  
appeared at Parvatiâs hermitage. Parvati welcomed the old man and worshipped  
him with flowers and fruits.   
Why are you meditating? asked the brahmana. What is it that you want?   
I wish to have Shiva as a husband, replied Parvati.   
_**You are indeed stupid. Said the brahmana. That is like giving up gold for a  
piece of glass or giving sandalwood for mud. Does anyone give up the water of  
the Ganga and drink water from a well instead? Marry one of the gods instead,  
go and marry Indra. Shiva is a stupid fellow. He has three eyes and five  
faces. His hair is matted and his body is smeared with ashes. He wears snakes  
as garlands. He is always accompanied by ghosts, He has no clothes and no  
wealth. No one knows who his parent are. He live sin the forst and his throat  
is blue with poison. I think you are making a big mistake. Forget about Shiva  
and donât waste your life.**_   
The brahmanaâs words angered Parvati. It is you who are stupid, she said.  
You donât know a thing about Shiva. He is the lord of everthing. You have  
insulted Shiva and cursed am I that I made the mistake of worshipping you. You  
are again going to say something nasty about Shiva. But before you can do  
that, let me go away. I shall not stay to hear Shiva insulted.   
As Parfati was about to depart, Shiva adopted his own form and said, Where are  
you going? I thought that you were praying for me. You canât forsake me now.  
I am not going to let you go. Ask for a boon.   
Please marry me according to the prescribed rites, replied Parvati.   
Shiva agreed and Parvati returned home.   
Siva Puranam

**Maa Durga**   
Adi Shankara's Bhavani Ashtakam starts with:  **न तातो न माता न बन्धुर्न दाता   
न पुत्रो न पुत्री न भृत्यो न भर्ता ।   
न जाया न विद्या न वृत्तिर्ममैव   
गतिस्त्वं गतिस्त्वं त्वमेका भवानि ॥**   
Na Tato Na Mata Na Bandhur Na Data   
Na Putro Na Putri Na Bhrtyo Na Bharta   
Na Jaya Na Vidya Na Vrttir Mama Iva   
Gatis Tvam Gatis Tvam Tvam Eka Bhavani   
Neither father nor mother; Neither relation nor friend, nor the donor,   
Neither son nor daughter, neither servant nor husband,   
Neither wife, nor worldly knowledge or profession,   
You are my refuge, You alone are my refuge, O Mother Bhavani.   
The Divine Mother is the mother of mother, father of father and friend of  
friend. When all else fails, or when life seems to be hopeless, people turn  
towards the compassionate face of God Who can soothe without judging the many  
shortcomings of us.   
Who is there in our worldly life who can comfort us more than our mother? Then  
how much more is the mother of mother, Who has filled all the mothers with  
compassion?

**Maa Durga**   
"Ma" is the central theme of the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.   
The full name of the author "Mahendranath Gupta" while writing the Gospel  
became "M", which is the starting point of "Ma".   
From this starting point, the "katha amrita" or the nectar of words of Sri  
Ramakrishna flowed out to expound "Ma". As it flowed out the divine ebriation  
made the "Master" and "Ma" one.   
After all, what is "Master"?   
"Master" is "Ma-Star", the one who points to the eternal star, which is "Ma".

**Maa Durga**   
Devi Khadgamala stotram is recited in the Sri Vidya tradition. Like the  
devotees of Arunachala does parayana of Arunachala hill and salutes all the  
Lingams on the way, the devotees of the Sri Vidya tradition does the parayana  
of the Sri Chakra reciting this stotram. Traditionally Sri Vidya is very  
secretive and the guru tells the disciple how to contemplate / meditate on  
each manifestation of the Devi in each of the enclosures. It is said that this  
powerful stotra provides a Mala (garland) of Khadga (Sword signifying  
protection of the Divine Mother) to the devotees reciting it. (The Khadgamala  
stotra is available in the internet).   
The name khadgamala is quite interesting from other aspects. Khadga is sword  
and Mala is garland of severed heads of demons worn by the Devi. The demons  
signify ego, so our various manifestations of ego and layers of delusions are  
those heads.   
The tradition of Devi has a different approach compared to Advaita preached by  
many, although the goal is same. Here one does not say in one stroke that the  
world is unreal, so either ignore it or relax. One does not say we are already  
self-realized. The word "Maya" is interesting since it consists of "Ma" and  
"Ya". "Ya" in sanskrit means "She Who". So She Who is Ma is also Maya, infact  
Mahamaya. Also the reverse word "Yama" signifies death or death of the ego,  
and it also contains "Ya" and "Ma". So She Who is Maya is also Yama, the death  
of the ego.   
The Sri Chakra represents the entire Cosmos, both internal and external whose  
central point bindu is where the Devi resides in Her absolute conscious form,  
as the union of Kameswara and Kameswari. All the enclosures can be thought of  
as the gradations of what we normally call "beyond", and find it difficult to  
penetrate, like the durga (Fort). Tantric tradition has this distinctive  
feature. It does not say everything is Atmosphere in one go and summarize. It  
penetrates those and lists out the distinctive features, often symbolically;  
like Atmosphere itself has several layers (Exosphere, Thermosphere, Mesosphere  
etc). In this exploration has come out the chakra system. Centers are listed  
beyond Sahasra. The subtlelity of the higher manifestations have been  
represented by maatras. So Sri Vidya conveys the message that everything is  
Mother, She has different levels of manifestations, She is both Absolute as  
well as behind Maya.   
Swami Vivekananda said that "Man is not travelling from error to truth, but  
climbing up from truth to truth, from truth that is lower to truth that is  
higher". Similarly here a person moves from "Ma" to "Ma", from less intimate  
relationship of Ma to more intimate relationship of Ma. Here Maya is also Ma,  
and Absolute is also Ma. A person proceeds inwards from the outer enclosures.   
In business the future prospect of a person is growth in business, like taking  
it from 5 lakhs to 10 lakhs. But here the future prospect is "khadgamala",  
i.e. progressively getting our heads severed. Nobody will like to think about  
such prospect, much less accept it. And apparently no one forces to accept  
this. But Ma is also Mahamaya. Life situations may give rise to so much  
sufferings or emptiness that one starts thinking that khadgamala is a better  
option. The movement of khadga is everywhere in life. The wealth of a person  
suddenly goes away, the old age severs the physical capabilities one by one,  
and finally the undeniable death. So Ma is there in both fortune and  
misfortune.   
So does Ma rejoice in our misfortunes and wear them as mala? No.   
Because within a mis-fortune may be hidden a fortune. It may take one to  
deeper life. Also, a mis-fortune may signify that it was not our fortune first  
of all. It was the fortune of Ma and She has re-arranged it. So the fortune  
gets re-arranged and the attachment gets severed and goes to Ma as a head in  
mala. Also, death is not the end of everything, but only a stroke of khadga  
and a bead of mala to ma. This is one aspect of khadgamala.   
So khadgamala is a journey of relationship with Ma, amidst the ups and downs  
of life, seeing Ma behind every stroke of khadga. Everything changes  
externally but relationship with Ma becomes more intimate, always asking for  
Her grace and facing the bindu.   
Jai Durga

"My Mother! Who is my Mother? Ah, She is the Mother of the Universe. It is She  
who creates and preserves the world, who always protects Her children, and who  
grants whatever they desire: dharma, artha, kama, moksha. A true son cannot  
live away from his   
mother. The Mother knows everything. The child only eats, drinks, and makes  
merry; he doesn't worry himself about the things of the world."   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna
