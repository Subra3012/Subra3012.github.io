## Topic: Veda Parayana / Vedic Chanting at SriRamana Ashram

The following are the Morning / Evening Vedic and Sanskrit Chants as followed  
in Ramana Ashram and I believe Bhagwan did give an outline for the same and  
others added some later. I once asked David Godman about this but he could  
not give me the proper answer to its background.   
If there is any changes in the list, I will make it.   
Ramana Ashram Morning Vedic and Sanskrit Chants at 8 a.m**   
1) Sri Ramna Chatvarimshat   
2) Sri Arunachla Pancharatnam   
3) Sri Taittriya Upanishad ( Sikisha /Anand /Bhrigu Valli )   
4) Sri Suktam   
5)Maha Narayana Upanishad ( some portions )   
Ramana Ashram Evening Vedic & Sanskrit Chants at 5 p.m**   
1)Dakshinamurti Stotram   
2) Sri Rudram   
3) Chamakam   
4) Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam,Durga Suktam   
5) Mantra Pushpam.   
 6)Upadesa Saram   
7) Nakarmana   
I have updated the list to make some changes after seeing the final version  
from the book  
"The Veda Parayana At Sri RamanaAshram - An English  
Translation .   
 **According to this book :**   
1) In Sri Bhgawan's lifetime, Vedic Chanting/Veda Parayana was held twice a  
day morning and evening, lasting about 40 mts on each occasion, and this is  
still continued.   
2) This with the Puja which follows it is the only ritual which was or is  
generally attended at the Ashram.   
 **3) It was an hour of tremendous silence when he sat immobile as though  
carved in rock. He never allowed anything to interrupt it. **   
 **4) When asked whether people should learn the meaning, so as to follow it,   
he said no : It was sufficient that the chanting served as a support for  
meditation. **   
5) Despite this, it is also true, however, that the portions used for  
chanting were carefully chosen and approved by Sri Bhgawan Himself.   
 **6) Nothing has been deleted from them since Sri Bhagwan 's lifetime and  
only one item added. That is Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra which, mainly on the  
request of the late Major Chadwick ( Sadhu Arunachala ) is now used as the  
opening hymn before the evening chant. **   
7) Technically in the past even listening to the Chanting of Vedas is supposed  
to made available only to Brahmins, but this prohibition was abrogated by Sri  
Bhagwan.

I like this. Devotees actually doing the sacred Hindu spiritual practices and  
connecting directly with the Divine.   
I know everyone will have great experiences and homes will be filled with  
Divine energy.

Dear Child Of Arunachala   
This is what I say to people who say they do not have time to visit the parent  
spiritual Organization ( like Ramana Ashram, Sivananda Ashram, Chinmaya  
Ashram, Ramakrishna Asharm etc ) i.e best is to follow some of the schedules  
there at your own home at least once in morning / evening preferably at the  
same time. If there is a morning aarthi / meditation there then follow it at  
the same time and if it is difficult in morning then try to follow it in  
evening. If it is difficult in the weekdays then follow the Sunday /Saturday  
Satsangs at least at your own house at the same time. Unless and until we try  
to develop some form of samskaras at home itself we will not progress much.   
Every Spiritual Organization has its own Satsang format that people can follow  
at least once a week if not daily at their own homes.   
The following gives the Satsang format as advised by Sri Ramana Ashram**   
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/centres/satsang-format/   
What are Ramana Satsang?   
A Ramana satsang is a group of devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi who gather  
together to strengthen their experience of the presence of Sri Ramana, deepen  
their understanding of his teachings and receive inspiration from fellow  
seekers on the path of practice as taught and lived by the Master.   
These meetings usually take place at devotees? homes, on a weekly, biweekly,  
or monthly basis.   
**A typical satsang program is as follows:**   
 1) Reading of the Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, from Talks with Sri  
Ramana Maharshi, or some similar book.   
 **2) Satsang Recitations ( A. AksaharaMana Malai 2.Ramana Satguru  
 3.Upadesa Saram 4.Arunachala Pancharatham 5.Nakarmana )  
 **3)Silent Meditation: this will vary from 15 minutes to an hour.**   
 4)A reading of Reminiscences of the Maharshi, from books like Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, etc.   
 5) If parents bring their children to the satsang, the children are  
encouraged to sing a bhajan or song from the Ramana Bhaje Namam CD or from  
some other composition on or about Sri Ramana.   
This concludes the satsang. Often arrangements for refreshments are made and  
then served to the devotees at this time.   
The Audios for the Satsang recitations are available for free download at the  
link above.

Hello Child of Arunachala,   
Thank you for your advise. You are right. I was misled and have stopped  
praying for a while now out of anger due to difficult circumstances and  
lethargy. But I am planning to do something about it and will pay heed to your  
advise.   
Regards and may Devi bless you.

Dear Lathaji,   
Apologies for the late response. Thank you for the thought-provoking story. I  
am seeking advice from Devi itself instead of wandering for answers.

**The world is a dream**   
One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The  
fisherman, to be sure, renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to  
those who live in the world? Must they too renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who  
could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: "Suppose an  
office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life  
there. But when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street?  
Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk again and goes on working as before. Even  
after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, one can very well live in  
the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who were  
living as householders.   
MANILAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?"   
MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there."   
Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing  
him, the Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father.  
Whom should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are  
even.'   
During the day-time Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night  
on the formless God. _Whichever attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize  
God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God with form or in God without  
form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted_. Sambhu Mallick used  
to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a  
friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you  
come in a carriage?' At that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set  
out repeating the name of God! What danger can befall me?' _Through faith  
alone one attains everything._ I used to say, 'I shall take all this to be  
true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden  
talks to me.' What I would think of would   
invariably come to pass."

M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that  
only superstitious people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with  
actual events. Therefore he asked the Master, "Was there never any exception?"   
MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the  
name of God and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would  
invariably come to pass.(To Manilal) _But you must remember, unless one is  
guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith._ Bony people, the  
hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot  
easily acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?"   
It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and  
some other devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The  
Master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine  
Mother. There was complete silence.   
After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered  
the room and saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit  
down. The Master had known her for many years. In her younger days she had  
lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's compassion was great. Soon he  
began to converse with her.   
MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy  
men, and thus spending your money in a noble way?"   
BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?"   
MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?"   
BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- I have built a bathing place,  
and my name is inscribed there on a slab."   
MASTER: "Indeed!"   
BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there."   
MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!"   
Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him,  
touching his feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up  
and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer  
of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed with the holy water the  
spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were amazed to see  
this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead.   
Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should  
salute me from a distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment,  
the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a few songs."

The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight   
To the blue lotus flower of Mother Syama's feet.. . .   
Then he sang: High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite,   
When came a gust of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth..   
..   
Again: Dwell, O mind, within yourself;   
Enter no other's home.   
If you but seek there, you will find   
All you are searching for.   
God, the true Philosopher's Stone,   
Who answers every prayer,   
Lies hidden deep within your heart,   
The richest gem of all.   
How many pearls and precious stones   
Are scattered all about   
The outer court that lies before   
The chamber of your heart!

**Tuesday, June 5, 1883**   
Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at  
Dakshineswar. M., too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a  
week-day there were only a few devotees in the room. Generally people gathered  
there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays.   
It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his  
experiences during his God-intoxicated state.   
MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat  
my meals here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at  
Baranagore or at Ariadaha. Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just  
sit down there without saying a word. If the members of the household asked me  
why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to eat.' _Now and then I  
would go, uninvited of course_, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to  
the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the  
Choudhurys' house.   
"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: _'  
Devendra chants the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?_'  
Mathur Babu was a very proud man. _How could one expect him to go to another  
man 's house uninvited? _ At first he hesitated. But then he said: 'All right.  
Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.'   
"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar  
near the bridge. _He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding  
me insistent, he took me to Dina 's house in a carriage. It was a small  
place_. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage embarrassed the inmates.  
We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with the  
sacred thread. _The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina  
to receive us. We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. There are ladies there.' It was really a  
distressing situation_. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I shall never  
listen to you again.' I laughed.

"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the  
sadhus and invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When  
I sat down for the meal, several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt  
like leaving them and sitting alone. I wondered why they should bother about  
all that. The sadhus took their seats. I began to eat before they had started.  
I heard several of them remark, 'Oh! What sort of man   
is this?' "   
 **Parable of the farmer**   
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the  
steps of his verandah. Hazra, Rakhal, and M. were near him. _Hazra had the  
attitude of a Vedantist: "I am He."_   
MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only  
realizes that it is God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer,  
the good and the bad, the real and the unreal; that it is He who is present in  
waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these.   
"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced  
in age. As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the  
farmer was out working in the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son  
was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of death. Returning home he found the  
boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the  
wife said to her ncighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he hasn't even  
one tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you  
know why I am not crying? Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and the  
father of seven princes. These princes were beautiful as well as virtuous.  
They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts.  
Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those  
seven children or this one boy.'   
_To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the dream state. "God  
alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will."_

**Law of karma**   
HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the  
sadhu of Bhukailas. How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They  
had found him in   
samadhi. First they buried him, then they put him under water, and then they  
branded him with a hot iron. Thus they brought him back to consciousness of  
the world. But in the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures. _He  
undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the  
will of God. "_   
MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of  
that holy man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The  
kavirajs prepare   
makaradhvaja in a bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the  
fire. The gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other  
ingredients, and the medicine is made. Then the physicians break the bottle  
carefully and take out the medicine. _When the medicine is made, what  
difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or broken? So people  
think that the holy man was killed. But perhaps his inner stuff had been made.  
After the realization of God, what difference does it make whether the body  
lives or dies?_ "

**Different kinds of samadhi**   
"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My  
own spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of  
Hrishikesh. Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as  
though it were the creeping of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of  
a monkey jumping from one branch to another. Again, sometimes it feels like a  
fish swimming in water. Only he who experiences it knows what it is like. _In  
samadhi one forgets the world. When the mind comes down a little, I say to the  
Divine Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I want to talk to people._'   
"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness  
after attaining samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual  
discipline; but they do not come back. But when God Himself is born as a man,  
as an Incarnation, holding in His hand the key to others' liberation, then for  
the welfare of humanity the Incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness  
of the world."   
M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's  
liberation?"   
HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an  
Incarnation of God exists or not?"   
It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness  
enveloped the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the  
temple garden. The black sky was reflected in the waters of the Ganges.

silentgreen/Nagaraj/Friends,   
 _The touch of Earth is always reinvigorating to the son of Earth, even when  
he seeks a supraphysical Knowledge. It may even be said that the supraphysical  
can only be really mastered in its fullnessÃ¢ÂÂto its heights we can always  
reachÃ¢ÂÂwhen we keep our feet firmly on the physical. Ã¢ÂÂEarth is His  
footing,Ã¢ÂÂ (pAdOsya viswA bhootAni-Ravi)says the Upanishad whenever it images  
the Self that manifests in the universe. And it is certainly the fact that the  
wider we extend and the surer we make our knowledge of the physical world, the  
wider and surer becomes our foundation for the higher knowledge, even for the  
highest, even for the Brahmavidya._

To all the above wonderful posts, I add this of Tagore titled "Aanandadhara  
Bahiche Bhubane": Streams of Bliss are flowing across the Universe,   
Day and Night so many Nectar-like essence (of that Bliss) are overflowing the  
endless Sky,   
The Sun and the Moon drink handfuls of that (and Shine),   
And its undecaying Illumination remains always Luminous. ..   
... and fills the Earth with eternal Life and Light,   
(O Friend) Why are you sitting enclosed within your own thoughts?   
Why are you immersed within your little self?   
Look around expanding your heart,. ..   
... considering the little sorrows as trivial,. ..   
... and Fill your empty Life with that Bliss of Love, O Friend, fill your  
empty Life with that Bliss of Love.
