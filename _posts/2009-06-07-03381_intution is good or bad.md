Dear sir,   
In the path of devotion, or self inquiery, sometimes we can feel what the  
opposite people is going to tell. Due to the old habit, mind is geting ready  
to   
face the situation in favour of ourself. In this situation what we have to  
do. Do we have to ignore intuation.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
You will yourself know by experience whether the intuition   
is good or bad, whether it comes true or not. You can follow   
accordingly.

dear ramanaduli,   
as far as my understanding goes, intuition is neither good nor bad. sometimes  
we may get a foreboding of something going wrong...and it actually turns out  
like that. maybe that is intuition...maybe it is that a certain type of energy  
attracts similar energy. by that i mean, if we have some intrinsic fears,  
which have not recieved the light of consciousness, the fears come to be  
realised.   
however, if we are conscious of these things then whatever happens, we are  
able to deal with it in the best way we can. we just accept the event without  
any recriminations / blame. that takes out the "goodness" or "badness" of the  
event.   
so we may have intutions...but nothing is good or bad....least of all  
intutions.   
love,   
vinita

Dear vinita   
 when there is full of consiousness we do not have fear,anger sort of any bad  
things.?   
 Is it so? All bad things take place due to unconsiousness... Sometimes, I can  
see good and bad. As Udai ji says, I sit and look where the fear is arising   
whether If I avoid to do or thinking the result of event. In this way i am  
wasting time.
