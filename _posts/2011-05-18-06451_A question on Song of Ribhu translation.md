I am about to start a deeper study of the Ribhu Gita, and was wondering your  
opinion on the translation titled: The Song of Ribhu: Translated from the Original Tamil Version of the Ribhu  
Gita By H. Ramamoorthy and Nome   
Namah Shivaya.

Dear amma,   
This is one of the two best books available in English. Dr. H. Ramamurty and  
Nome have done an excellent job, by translating   
into English from Tamizh verses of Ulaganatha Swamigal. If you know   
Tamizh you can also read side by side Ulagatha Swamigal's Tamizh   
versification. Both are available in Sri Ramanasramam. There is one another  
book by Lingeswra Rao, giving Sanskrit Verses and English   
translation. If you know Sanskrit you can read this. But this Sanskrit  
version is at huge variance from Tamizh and Nome's versification.   
I do not know why. But this book is also available in Sri Ramansramam.   
I read only Tamizh book of Ulaganatha Swamigal.   
Arunachala Siva.

hi amma,   
I have the three versions and my favorite one is the one translated from the  
tamil (the song of ribhu).   
The last 2 ones are also good. That one by Lingeswra Rao there is the  
sanskrit.   
If you want a personal advice : read "the song of ribhu" and listen the  
Sanskrit version (generaly sold with the book by Lingeswra Rao).   
Namaste

Dear Subramanian.R   
When youy said : "Dr. H. Ramamurty and Nome have done an excellent job, by  
translating into English from Tamizh verses of Ulaganatha Swamigal"   
That's means that it is really a very good Translation into english?   
Do you know if it exists a Tamizh with only the verses transliterated (roman  
character) ? like Tamil Parayana   
Thanks,   
Namaste

Dear vishnave,   
Ribhu Gita Tamizh is available in Asramam only as a book of   
Tamizh verses. I am not sure whether any individual [say a   
Westerner or for the benefit of a Westerner not knowing Tamizh   
script] has done in Anglicized version. As you correctly said, only   
parayana songs have been done that way.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is there to "Read Ribhu Gita" ? Every verse says the same thing "You are  
Consciousness, you are Awareness, All this is Mithya, All this is in Mind  
alone"   
Same stuff repeated again and again.   
Ribhu Gita is to be meditated upon. For people who know Sanskrit [even a  
little]... listen to the song. That would be a nice way to meditate. For  
people who know Tamil, i am not sure if there is a song, but if it is there,  
listening to it is nice.   
As such the English Translation... loses the punch. In Sanskrit/Tamil. .. as a  
verse that can be sung... its like a great reminder. To meditate on the  
teachings is beautiful.

Excessive recitation quite aloud of authorities   
Will be the cause of excessive fatigue of speech.   
Hearkening to a multiplicity of authorities   
Will be the cause of mental confusion.   
Inquiry into a variety of meanings   
Will be the cause of mental malaise.   
Hence, worthy son! leaving aside everything,   
Profoundly meditate that I am that Brahman.

Namah Shivaya,   
Thanks for the good discussion. As it is said, it is not just about merely  
reading a scripture or spiritual truth, its about realizing them in the depths  
of your heart, and embodying and being fully established in them in the core  
of our being through deep meditation.   
By the divine grace of the One Atman, may Anandam shine in and through us all.   
Namah Shivaya.
