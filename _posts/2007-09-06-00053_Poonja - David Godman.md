Namaskar,   
I am planning to visit Shri Ramanaashram by third week of October. Can some  
body guide me about the exact loaction of Ashram int the town, so it will be  
easy for me to get down accordingly. I will be coming from Chennai by bus.  
Also can accommodation be booked for single in advance at Ashram ?   
Ulhas Sathaye

It is very easy to find the ashram - any rickshaw will happily take you, for  
a ride, for too many rupees, when you first arrive! But from the bus station  
it would cost about thirty rupees and even if they ask more it is very little  
in Western money. The final stop for the Chennai bus will be the bus station  
in Tiru.   
You HAVE to book ashram accomodation in advance - 3-6 months for the winter  
season, as it becomes very busy here. If you have not booked try e-mailing  
right away and then see what happens. If they still have rooms you may be  
lucky.   
Good Luck,   
Regulus

Ramanashramam is a serene place where spiritual halo of Sri Ramana is very  
much obvious. Rank materialists get converted into godly beings there.  
Ramana' potent presence simply transforms you.

Bhagavan had no successors, worthy or otherwise, because he did not found a  
lineage. So far as I am aware, Poonja never claimed that he was a 'successor'  
to Bhagavan. He just said that he was passing on the message of his Master.  
People who claim that they are 'in the lineage' of Ramana Maharshi are usually  
those who are trying to boost their credibility in the spiritual-teacher world  
by claiming some sort of relationship with Bhagavan, or a teaching  
transmission from him.

The suggestion of a successor to Ramana is anathama to his teachings. Who is  
there to succeed and who to be succeeded? Many people had the deepest  
experiences in Ramana's presence. Those best known in the west are the ones  
David Godman wrote books about. What about all the others, many of whom are  
named in books at Ramanasramam about and/or by Ramana's various devotees;  
which naturally begs the question - what lineage? The lineage business seems  
to have sprung up with the so-called successors of Papaji, who was only one of  
many, many people who made claim to breakthrough experiences in Ramana's  
presence. The so-called Papaji lineage has nothing to do with Ramana.

In physical terms lineage simply means 'ancestry'. My physical lineage  
includes my mother and father, my grandparents, and so on. However, in  
spiritual terms, lineage usually denotes an authority to teach, an authority  
that is specifically given by one's teacher. There is no Ramana lineage  
because Ramana never authorised anyone to teach.   
 From what I have read of Papaji, he did not appoint a successor to carry on  
with his teaching work. He did, though, encourage a few people to verbally  
disseminate his teachings. When he was asked about their status, he said they  
he had appointed them as 'messengers', and that they were not Gurus in their  
own right. On other occasions he called them 'ambassadors', noting that  
ambassadors merely have the authority to pass on the instructions of their  
government, implying that these people did not have any authority of their  
own.   
 You cannot claim a spiritual ancestry unless the authority has been clearly  
given in a Guru-to-disciple transmission. Papaji's messengers who received  
their permission to teach from Papaji himself (and incidentally, many of the  
current teachers giving satsang in his name never received even that limited  
permission) can claim to be in a Papaji lineage, but none of them can  
legitimately claim to be in the Ramana lineage because no such lineage exists.   
 In _Nothing Ever Happened_ Papaji said in one of his answers that Bhagavan  
received his authority to teach from Arunachala, his Sadguru. I think that  
this is a reasonable statement, although it is not one that Bhagavan himself  
ever corroborated. In a more general answer Papaji said that it was the Self  
that empowered certain jnanis to teach by giving them the necessary power and  
authority to do their work. I think that this is also a reasonable statement.

The concept of linaeage of a Guru or system applies to a tradition in which  
specific mantra or artifact is passed on from Guru to disciple.In the case of  
Ramana he did not encourage any mantra diksha in the classical sense.So,  
Ramana did not have a successor nor did he authorize a pontiff to teach.   
Poonjaji was one of the several devotees of Ramana to pick up the method of  
Self-enquiry and teach to others...Poonjaji also did not appoint any successor  
in the official sense.He had merely encouraged his chelas "to spread the  
message or teachings of his " \--often diluted or interpreted in his own  
way....That is alright...you can use the teachings of Poonjaji or Ramana in  
the manner you like....there is no lineage involved...IN a similar manner, can  
we say that all physics students who use Newton's laws and equations are in  
the lineage of Newton..that would be funny --to say the least.   
It is better to use the expression ' tradition'\one teaches the tradition  
of Ramana or Poonjaji...the common expression in India for tradition is  
"sampradaya"...Thus we have several traditions or sampradaya even in Classical  
Indian music..that does not mean any official authorization.   
 There are certain rituals which only people in a lineage can do...Thus we  
have nath lineage or Sufi lineage...But Ramana or Poonjaji were  
different...the lineage stamp is a clever method to attract spiritual seekers  
to your camp...that is Okay as a method of advertisementlike franchising  
your cookies.

To name a successor for Ramana, or for, to treat Ramanasramam   
a guru-peetam and find lineage to it is blashphemy. Ramana is   
an "avatar". Do Dakshinamurthy and Skanda, have successors?
