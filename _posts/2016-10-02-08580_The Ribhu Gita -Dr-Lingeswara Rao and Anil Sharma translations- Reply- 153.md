63. The supreme meditation is only consciousness. The supreme adoration is only consciousness.   
You are only consciousness. I am just awareness. All is just consciousness  
only.   
64. This chapter, called 'You are consciousness alone' is hard to to find in sacred lore. The rare one who   
hears this surely becomes Brahman oneself.   
65. By the practice of yogic meditation, one, whose existence is controlled by the seemingly eternal cycle   
of birth and death, gains freedom from the infatuation of Maya. The knots  
born of fear of heart are sundered,   
his desires are fulfilled by His vision that transforms the world to  
transcendence and he becomes eternal and   
immutable in the world. He verily becomes Brahman within himself.   
Chapter 16, a dialogue between Ribhu and Nidagha entitled 'You are  
consciousness alone' in the sixth   
amsa called Sankara of Sri Siva Rahasyam, is concluded.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
