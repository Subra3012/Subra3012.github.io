Hi All - I want to thank the people who are behind the http://www.arunachala-  
live.com website enabling everyone in the world to see the sacred Hill (or the  
God Himself).   
I've just created a simple Windows Vista sidebar gadget which can can be  
installed on Windows Vista, or Windows7 machine only.   
It just shows the latest picture of the live-cam feed, and refreshes every 2  
minutes.   
You can download from here - http://cid-  
baaba32029d203a0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Arunachala.gadget   
Here are the instructions to use the gadget after downloading to your Windows  
Vista or Windows7 machine: 1. Double click on the Arunachala.gadget file which you have downloaded, and select "Install"   
2\. You will now see a gadget opening, and show you the image.   
If you have any difficulties, please let me know. I'll try to write another  
application which can be run on any Windows OS soon, and will put a post on  
this. If there is any copyright violation (I doubt if any since I'm just  
linking to an existing image), please let me know. I will delete this gadget.   
Om Arunachala! Om Ramana!

Dear searchingme,   
Nice. Arunachala is attracting you in modern manner. Good.   
It is the Hill of magnet. You should only be a fit iron rod   
to get attracted.   
Arunachala Siva.
