## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Reason Why Angaraparna Addresses Arjuna As 'tapatya'  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 18, 2010, 01:10:57 PM

**Mahabharata Adiparva Chaitrarathaparva section 173 - 177**   
Pandavas, along with their mother start walking towards Panchala, to obtain  
Draupadi as their wife. At nightfall they reach the banks of river Ganga. A  
gandharva king by name Angaraparna (Blazing chariot), was bathing in that  
river along with his wives and retinue.   
Arjuna approaches water to quench thirst, and the gandharva challenges Arjuna  
for a fight, saying that during nightfall, men are not supposed to enter  
Ganga.   
Arjuna asks Gandharva, why he fought with them, chastised them for entering  
Ganga, as they are not at fault. Angaraparna replies "Even though you are not  
at fault, and I know that you are from Kuru race, I also know the knowledge  
and power of your preceptor Drona, I also know that you five brothers are  
noble and well learned, and good fighters, yet I censured you.   
The reason is, you have completed your studies, yet you have not taken a wife  
and you have not taken up any mode of life and wandering in forest. Lastly,  
being of nobility, you dont have a priest who can guide you on the path of  
virtue, you have not appointed one."   
Gandharava addresses Arjuna as 'Tapatya'. Arjuna was curious to know why he is  
called as Tapatya, as he is son of Kunti and should be called as Kaunteya.   
Gandharva king Angaraparna then tells him the story of Tapati, daughter of  
Surya the sun god.   
There was a king named Samvarana, was a just ruler of earth. Once when he was  
on a hunting expedition, he saw the daughter of Sun god, Tapati, in a dazzling  
golden light. He immediately falls in love with that damsel and requests her  
hand. She says, only her father, Surya can determine who has to be her  
husband. Samvarna then, prays to his chief priest Sage Vashishta, who ascends  
to the world of light, illuminated by Surya and requests his daughter's hand  
for Samvarna. Sun god agrees to that and marries off his daughter tapati to  
Samvarana. They have a illustrious son by name Kuru, on whose name the entire  
race is known as Kauravas.   
 **On Hearing this story Arjuna wanted to know about Sage Vashishta.**   
Gandharva then tells about Sage Vashishta, "Vashishta is the foremost among  
sages. he is the manasa putra (mind-born son) of the creator Brahmaji. His  
wife is Arundhati. He has fully conquered all the 6 enemies of any person, viz  
kama (unreasonable desires), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment  
and delusion), madha (pride) and matsarya (jealousy).   
He is conversant in all Vedas. King Vishwamitra, to spite Vashishta has killed  
all his sons. Even then Vashishta did not retaliate, and exterminate the race  
of Kusikas, to which Vishwamitra belongs. Instead he forgave him. He could  
have brought back his children from the world of death, through his ascetic  
power. Even that he did not do, as he does not want to interfere in natural  
order of things. He has helped many Kings, by being their priest, in putting  
them on the path of virtue. So, O Tapatya, you should also appoint a good  
priest for you."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Secret of the Laughing Buddha  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 19, 2010, 07:18:24 AM

Every one must have seen the statue of "Laughing Buddha".He is also called as  
the "Happy Man"   
In actuality he was named Hotei or Pu-Tai is best known as the jolly Laughing  
Buddha. In China, he is known as the Loving or Friendly One. He is based on an  
eccentric Chinese Ch'an (Zen) monk who lived over 1,000 years ago and has  
become a significant part of Buddhist and Shinto culture. Because of this  
monk's benevolent nature, he came to be regarded as an incarnation of the  
bodhisattva who will be Maitreya (the Future Buddha). His large protruding  
stomach and jolly smile have given him the common designation "Laughing  
Buddha."   
He was truly a great zen master and legend has a great story which is so  
inspirational for all of us.   
The jolly good saint that he was used to go from one place to the other. He  
went to the Town Square and soon people gathered around him. He was so funny  
looking and always smiling that people used to crowd around him.   
He would then distribute sweets and small toys to all children who had  
gathered around him. Then keep his bag down, look to the sky and just start  
laughing. He used to laugh madly and he was not interested whether other  
laughed or not. Soon his laughter used to be contagious and all who had  
gathered would start to laugh.   
The whole town used to laugh and laugh.After sometime he would pick the bag,  
which he had kept down, smile to all, and go to the next town. All his life he  
did only this action and it was said that many people attained Nirvana,  
enlightenment just through this process.Hence he was called as the laughing  
Buddha because Buddha is someone who is enlightened and laughter was his  
unique method. Never before him or never after him such a simple aspect was  
used to achieve what all humans strive for-moksha or enlightenment.   
He would rarely speak and once when he was asked to describe his method he  
told, that he gave sweets to children to symbolically that the more you give,  
the more comes to you. Thereby he unveiled the secret of "Giving with joy".  
Children are said to be GOD because they represent the GOD Nature, which is  
always, be in Present time, smiling and joyful, ego less, and most important  
is without judge mental mind.   
The bag represented problems that all humans encounter. We are mistaken that  
when we have problems, that GOD only gave you a problem and the rest are so  
happy. The problems appear big because we are associated with it- calling it  
as "My Problem". Look at a funny phenomenon, if anyone comes to you with any  
problem of theirs and seek solutions or advice, what you do. You tell them so  
many solutions so easily as though you are an expert in all the fields in the  
Universe. However big the others problems are you can solve it so easily, you  
are a master solver of problems. But then what happens to your own problems.  
Hmm Hmm it is impossible to find any solution.   
This happens only because of your attachment and association with the  
problem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your problem down (symbolically  
keeping the bag down) means "Disassociate with your Problem", "Separate form  
it" and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? Think and thank GOD that you  
only have such a small problem as compared to so many others. Whether you  
laugh or cry the problem is going to be there right. So why not laugh at it.  
Therein is the magic and mind you no small magic, it is huge, apply it to  
realize about the power of laughter.   
On laughing your whole internal chemistry changes and thereby the body  
produces certain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The  
problem now looks too tiny and as you pick it (symbolically he picks back the  
bag before going to the next place) the problem is solved.   
Such a great zen master was Hotei or Laughing Buddha. So next time you look at  
the statue of "laughing Buddha" associate with that great teaching he gave all  
of us, the power of laughter. Each time you see the Laughing Buddha and if it  
reminds you to laugh, a great work has been done.   
Whole life Hotei lived in Laughter. And when the time came to pass away, he  
knew he had to give up his life at an appropriate time. He called his  
disciples and said that after he passes away, they should immediately burn his  
body. The disciples were surprised because there was no tradition of burning  
in Zen. But they followed the master wishes. And as they lit fire to his body,  
"Fire Works and Crackers" started flying all over.   
Hotei was so great that just before he died he hid a lot of crackers and  
rockets in his clothes. So there also he created such laughter by the  
suddenness of the situation.So Hotei not only lived in laughter all through  
his life, he also died in laughter.   
Let us all learn from the great zen master that "It is our birth right to  
laugh" and "No matter what happens we should come back to laughter".

Now a days people are educated, more informative. They work, earn and save  
money. The whole life is going after for their better life. But they last  
their root which gives them pressure and forgot to observe the nature and  
smile.   
Some people they forgot to laugh also. Some body formed a club. i.e. laughing  
club where they meet and learn to laugh. In the same way, people are  
accumulating vastu things which may brings happyness. I have seen this  
laughing Buddha in many houses. Really if u see u would laugh. But when I ask  
the people where did u get the people with great burden heart say yes I bought  
it somewhere. Even the buddha cannot bring laugh to them.

Laughing requires only some face nerves to move. Crying requires more face  
nerves to move. One can laugh naturally. And also artificially. But one needs  
glycerene to weep artificially. One can never weep naturally, unless there is  
a real misery.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Ananda Kanneer, the tears of joy come without any pretence.   
When Bhagavan Ramana was seriously ill and on 14th April 1950,   
the doctors found His blood pressure going down. Pulse rate was   
also going down. He was given oxygen from outside. At about   
8.30 PM, when the doctors wanted to resume oxygen, He showed   
His hands denying for it. He with great difficulty sat on a slanting   
position with pillows at His back. The crowd suddenly chanted in   
chorus Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva. The sound rented the air. A few  
tears of joy dropped out of His eyes. Dr. Karamchandani was witnessing all  
these. Then slowly, slowly, the breath withdrew into His Heart.   
Later, Dr. Karamchandani said: I saw the tears coming down from the outer  
ends of His two eyes. Only tears of joy would come like that. Tears of  
misery would drop from the inner ends of the eyes.   
Karunaiyal ennai aanda nee enakku..... (Padigam, Verse 1)   
Arunachala Siva.

problem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your problem down (symbolically  
keeping the bag down) means "Disassociate with your Problem", "Separate form  
it" and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? Think and thank GOD that you  
only have such a small problem as compared to so many others. Whether you  
laugh or cry the problem is going to be there right. So why not laugh at it.  
Therein is the magic and mind you no small magic, it is huge, apply it to  
realize about the power of laughter.   
On laughing your whole internal chemistry changes and thereby the body  
produces certain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The  
problem now looks too tiny and as you pick it (symbolically he picks back the  
bag before going to the next place) the problem is solved.   
Such a great zen master was Hotei or Laughing Buddha. So next time you look at  
the statue of "laughing Buddha" associate with that great teaching he gave all  
of us, the power of laughter. Each time you see the Laughing Buddha and if it  
reminds you to laugh, a great work has been done.   
Whole life Hotei lived in Laughter. And when the time came to pass away, he  
knew he had to give up his life at an appropriate time. He called his  
disciples and said that after he passes away, they should immediately burn his  
body. The disciples were surprised because there was no tradition of burning  
in Zen. But they followed the master wishes. And as they lit fire to his body,  
"Fire Works and Crackers" started flying all over.   
Hotei was so great that just before he died he hid a lot of crackers and  
rockets in his clothes. So there also he created such laughter by the  
suddenness of the situation.So Hotei not only lived in laughter all through  
his life, he also died in laughter.   
Let us all learn from the great zen master that "It is our birth right to  
laugh" and "No matter what happens we should come back to laughter".

Now a days people are educated, more informative. They work, earn and save  
money. The whole life is going after for their better life. But they last  
their root which gives them pressure and forgot to observe the nature and  
smile.   
Some people they forgot to laugh also. Some body formed a club. i.e. laughing  
club where they meet and learn to laugh. In the same way, people are  
accumulating vastu things which may brings happyness. I have seen this  
laughing Buddha in many houses. Really if u see u would laugh. But when I ask  
the people where did u get the people with great burden heart say yes I bought  
it somewhere. Even the buddha cannot bring laugh to them.

Laughing requires only some face nerves to move. Crying requires more face  
nerves to move. One can laugh naturally. And also artificially. But one needs  
glycerene to weep artificially. One can never weep naturally, unless there is  
a real misery.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Ananda Kanneer, the tears of joy come without any pretence.   
When Bhagavan Ramana was seriously ill and on 14th April 1950,   
the doctors found His blood pressure going down. Pulse rate was   
also going down. He was given oxygen from outside. At about   
8.30 PM, when the doctors wanted to resume oxygen, He showed   
His hands denying for it. He with great difficulty sat on a slanting   
position with pillows at His back. The crowd suddenly chanted in   
chorus Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva. The sound rented the air. A few  
tears of joy dropped out of His eyes. Dr. Karamchandani was witnessing all  
these. Then slowly, slowly, the breath withdrew into His Heart.   
Later, Dr. Karamchandani said: I saw the tears coming down from the outer  
ends of His two eyes. Only tears of joy would come like that. Tears of  
misery would drop from the inner ends of the eyes.   
Karunaiyal ennai aanda nee enakku..... (Padigam, Verse 1)

Every one must have seen the statue of "Laughing Buddha".He is also called as  
the "Happy Man"   
In actuality he was named Hotei or Pu-Tai is best known as the jolly Laughing  
Buddha. In China, he is known as the Loving or Friendly One. He is based on an  
eccentric Chinese Ch'an (Zen) monk who lived over 1,000 years ago and has  
become a significant part of Buddhist and Shinto culture. Because of this  
monk's benevolent nature, he came to be regarded as an incarnation of the  
bodhisattva who will be Maitreya (the Future Buddha). His large protruding  
stomach and jolly smile have given him the common designation "Laughing  
Buddha."   
He was truly a great zen master and legend has a great story which is so  
inspirational for all of us.   
The jolly good saint that he was used to go from one place to the other. He  
went to the Town Square and soon people gathered around him. He was so funny  
looking and always smiling that people used to crowd around him.   
He would then distribute sweets and small toys to all children who had  
gathered around him. Then keep his bag down, look to the sky and just start  
laughing. He used to laugh madly and he was not interested whether other  
laughed or not. Soon his laughter used to be contagious and all who had  
gathered would start to laugh.   
The whole town used to laugh and laugh.After sometime he would pick the bag,  
which he had kept down, smile to all, and go to the next town. All his life he  
did only this action and it was said that many people attained Nirvana,  
enlightenment just through this process.Hence he was called as the laughing  
Buddha because Buddha is someone who is enlightened and laughter was his  
unique method. Never before him or never after him such a simple aspect was  
used to achieve what all humans strive for-moksha or enlightenment.   
He would rarely speak and once when he was asked to describe his method he  
told, that he gave sweets to children to symbolically that the more you give,  
the more comes to you. Thereby he unveiled the secret of "Giving with joy".  
Children are said to be GOD because they represent the GOD Nature, which is  
always, be in Present time, smiling and joyful, ego less, and most important  
is without judge mental mind.   
The bag represented problems that all humans encounter. We are mistaken that  
when we have problems, that GOD only gave you a problem and the rest are so  
happy. The problems appear big because we are associated with it- calling it  
as "My Problem". Look at a funny phenomenon, if anyone comes to you with any  
problem of theirs and seek solutions or advice, what you do. You tell them so  
many solutions so easily as though you are an expert in all the fields in the  
Universe. However big the others problems are you can solve it so easily, you  
are a master solver of problems. But then what happens to your own problems.  
Hmm Hmm it is impossible to find any solution.   
This happens only because of your attachment and association with the  
problem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your problem down (symbolically  
keeping the bag down) means "Disassociate with your Problem", "Separate form  
it" and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? Think and thank GOD that you  
only have such a small problem as compared to so many others. Whether you  
laugh or cry the problem is going to be there right. So why not laugh at it.  
Therein is the magic and mind you no small magic, it is huge, apply it to  
realize about the power of laughter.

produces certain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The
