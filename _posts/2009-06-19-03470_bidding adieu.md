Dear all,   
I feel this is the time for me to bid adieu to one and all here in this Forum.  
I personally have come to understand that discussions are endless loop and  
there is no ending point in this. Also, in my deepest heart, I feel a  
Disciple-Disciple discussions are no good at all for it leads either one to  
Nowhere. Only Disciple-Guru discussion would lead one from Darkness to Light.   
I don't intend to be against this Forum Discussions but only that I have come  
to understand that personally, the need for such discussions, in a general  
Forum; here in me is only halting me in an endless loop.   
It has been nice knowing each one of you all. I thank each one from my deepest  
heart. I pray and wish, each one of you reach to where you aspire to go or  
realise your goals.   
You are welcome to keep in touch with me vie e-mail -   
nagaraj.balas@gmail.com   
With Prayers,   
Best Wishes, Regards & Love,   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj,   
I think everything is happening according to His will. I agree that all are  
deciples. But at the same time after joining this forum I learnt lot of things  
from   
Udai ji, Raju ji and Subramaniyan ji. Because I have not read many books like  
ashtavakra geetha etc. etc. It is not possible to buy all books and read also.   
I thank to Bhagavan for showing this forum. Even we practice or do sadhana it  
is His wish to grant what He likes. Any way I thank you for being a memeber  
here.   
I wish all the best.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks for you suggestions you gave me to my queries, it really helped me to  
stand again as the Holy Mountain.   
You are leaving this forum or you are not going to post or reply for any of  
the queries. Any way analyzing from you words 'endless loop' you must be a  
technical person, the world itself is a endless loop, Siva as cosmic dancer of  
the Universe, dances the dance of creation and destruction.   
Keep in touch.
