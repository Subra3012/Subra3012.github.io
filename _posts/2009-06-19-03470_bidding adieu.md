## Pamban Swamigal - Some more information  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 19, 2009, 01:46:58 PM  
---  
1\. When Pamban Swamigal was 13 years old, he went to the   
coconut garden of his father along with him. It was quite   
early in the morning. He said he would wait at the entrance   
and bid his father go in. When there were first rays of sun,   
he was chanting Skanda Sashti Kavacaham of Bala Devaraya   
Swamigal. He suddenly felt an urge to compose poems. He   
took out a silver writing instrument from his hip, picked a dry   
palmyra leaf and starting writing his first poem, starting as   
To Siva who carries Ganga and who begot Skanda as his   
own form.   
2. He wrote 100 songs in 100 days. He was given upadesa   
of Sadakshara Mantra of Skanda by one brahmin later.   
3\. He got married and became father of three children. Suddenly he felt that  
he should take sannyasa and leave   
the family. A brahmin appared when he was stepping out   
of the house and prevented him from going. He said 'Skanda   
is calling me, I shall go.' However that brahmin did not permit   
him. Skanda appeared in his dream and said: 'How can you say   
I permitted you to take up sannyasa. It is all your ego's   
mischief. Stay with family for some more time and complete   
the life's purpose.' Then the saint realized that the brahmin   
was none other than Skanda.   
4. He was again taught Dahara Vidya, Upasana in Heart   
centre by another brahmin. Bhagavan's method may also   
be Dahara Vidya, but He did not specifically say so in any   
of His conversations. The saint started treating Skanda   
as Siva, Uma, Ganapati, Vishnu -- all in one. He called   
Skanda as six faced Siva.   
5\. He met with an accident in Madras. He was hospitalized   
with fracture in both legs. The doctors said that it would take   
six months to get cured. But in night, the doctors and others   
saw the saint's two legs supported by Spears! He got cured   
in 11 days.   
6\. Pamban Swamigal had written in all 6666 verses with   
20 prose essays. He completed his works with the famous   
Panchamirta Varnam, where he profoundly thank Arunagiri   
Natha, as he had taken a vow that he would complete his   
compositions with the last song mentioning Arunagiri Natha.   
7. He attained Maha Nirvana at the age of 79 in Tiruvanmiyur   
in Madras.   
8. In Tiruchendur when devotees were singing his songs,   
one old lady of 80 years saw a young lad with two young girls   
with him, standing in cognito and lisening to the songs! She   
said it was Skanda, VaLLi and Deivayanai. This place   
is now built with a nice hall for singing Tiruppugazh and   
songs of Pamban Swamigal.   
9. Pamban Swamigal has done a lot of magic with words   
in his poems. All his 6666 songs have been published   
but these are not available now readily. His few songs   
have become more famous and these are sung along with   
Tiruppugazh songs in various towns and cities.   
10. In Panchamirta Vannam last song, he makes a canvas   
where Skanda is dancing with 40 other gods and animals   
including the Rooster and the Peacock. This is easily the   
most wonderful song of the saint poet.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Vittala devotees and Siva devotees  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 18, 2009, 02:06:37 PM  
---  
I heard from a discourse last evening: The devotees of Vittala are not Vaishnavites in a strict sense.   
In fact, they treat Vittala both as Vishnu and Siva. Some   
of these devotees' lives stand parallel to Siva devotees   
of Periya Puranam.   
Periya Puranam speaks of four bhavas of devotees.   
The first is Child-Father relationship, Pitru or Matru   
bhava. We have got Tiru Jnana Sambandhar who considerd   
himself as Siva-Uma's son. In fact, he is an avatara of Skanda.   
In Maha Bhakta Vijayam, Mukta Bai, the girl-child, younger   
sister of Jnana Deva, treated Vittala as her Father.   
The second is Sakya-bhava, or relationship of a friend.   
Sundaramoorthy treated Siva as his friend. He even asked   
Him to go to his wife's place as a messenger to solve the   
love-quarrel. In Maha Bhakta Vijayam, Nama Deva treated   
Vittala as his friend. He used to call Him in singular, as one   
calls his close friend.   
The third is Dasa Bhava. The relationship between a slave   
and a Master. Purandara Dasa is a classic example for this.   
Saint Tiru Navukkarasar treated him as a slave of Siva. He   
used to take a small pick axe and spade to clear the weeds   
in all Siva's temples.   
The fourth is Nayaki-Nayaka Bhava. Saint Manikkavachagar   
is the classic example in Siva saints, even though he does not   
find a place in the group of 63 Saints. Chaitanya Maha Prabhu   
is also an example for Nayaki-Nayaka Bhava. He treated   
Jagannath of Puri if not Vittala, as his husband. Manikkavachagar's Tiru  
Chitrambala Kovai, with 400 verses   
is full of this bhava. He even says certain things which would   
make Arabian Nights hang its head in shame. Later Chidambaram Ramalinga Swami  
said in one of his poems: The brahmins will find this [TCK] as Vedas,   
Tamil pandits as classic Tamil Veda.   
Yogis will call it as a terrific example of Veera Marga*   
And the normal seekers call it a good Kama Sastra!   
[* Veera Marga is one where the yogi treats God or Goddess   
as his bed-mate. Bhairavi Brahmani wanted to teach SRK   
this. SRK refused.]   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
I feel this is the time for me to bid adieu to one and all here in this Forum.  
I personally have come to understand that discussions are endless loop and  
there is no ending point in this. Also, in my deepest heart, I feel a  
Disciple-Disciple discussions are no good at all for it leads either one to  
Nowhere. Only Disciple-Guru discussion would lead one from Darkness to Light.   
I don't intend to be against this Forum Discussions but only that I have come  
to understand that personally, the need for such discussions, in a general  
Forum; here in me is only halting me in an endless loop.   
It has been nice knowing each one of you all. I thank each one from my deepest  
heart. I pray and wish, each one of you reach to where you aspire to go or  
realise your goals.   
You are welcome to keep in touch with me vie e-mail -

With Prayers,   
Best Wishes, Regards & Love,

Dear Nagaraj,   
I think everything is happening according to His will. I agree that all are  
deciples. But at the same time after joining this forum I learnt lot of things  
from   
Udai ji, Raju ji and Subramaniyan ji. Because I have not read many books like  
ashtavakra geetha etc. etc. It is not possible to buy all books and read also.   
I thank to Bhagavan for showing this forum. Even we practice or do sadhana it  
is His wish to grant what He likes. Any way I thank you for being a memeber  
here.   
I wish all the best.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks for you suggestions you gave me to my queries, it really helped me to  
stand again as the Holy Mountain.   
You are leaving this forum or you are not going to post or reply for any of  
the queries. Any way analyzing from you words 'endless loop' you must be a  
technical person, the world itself is a endless loop, Siva as cosmic dancer of  
the Universe, dances the dance of creation and destruction.   
Keep in touch.
