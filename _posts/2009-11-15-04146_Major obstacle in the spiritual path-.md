## Oh! My Well has been stolen

I am living in a village house. There is a beautiful well on the   
rear side, with sweet potable water, reinforced by timely rains.   
But I do not care for this well. I keep on dumping garbages,   
my thoughts, my thoughts about engineering seat, my job,   
my woman, my children, my competitors and enemies in my   
life -- all garbages. One morning suddenly I find that my well   
has been stolen! The Wall is not be seen. The garbages had   
filled in my well completely and there is no well to be seen.   
But I don't know the correct reason. I go to the A1-Police Station   
Inspector and complain to him. He says, 'Come along with me   
in jeep and let us see the spot.' He comes and sees. He says: O scoundrel! The well has not been stolen. You have levelled   
up the well with all your garbages. Now do one thing. Daily   
you scoop out the garbages with a shovel, chanting Arunachala   
Siva, Arunachala Siva or Ramaduta Vayukumara, Gowrisa, or   
Rama Krishna Hari, Ramakrishna Hari.... One day the stolen   
well will be recovered.   
The Well is our mind. At the time of birth, the well is quite clear with  
sweet potable water of good thoughts. Slowly you fill it   
up. The well has been lost and it is not stolen by anyone.   
Then, the A1-Police Station Inspector, the A1 Guru, like Bhagavan Ramana has  
to come and give you a mantra upadesa or the enquiry as Who am I? Then the  
well is recovered.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Major obstacle in the spiritual path.

Carelessness in restraining the vasanas (latent tendencies) is a major  
obstacle in the spiritual path. Though meditation keeps the vasanas under  
check, we have to be very careful in our activities to guard against them.  
Senses always try to drag us down. Quite often we yield to temptations and try  
to come with excuses. We must be honest to ourselves and acknowledge our  
weakness. This doesnÂ’t mean we should think we are weak but we should  
recognize that we are weak. The whole purpose of spiritual enquiry is not to  
attain the truth but to give up the false.

Dear S. Subramanian,   
Absolutely correct. The whole purpose is to remove the unwanted   
falsity and the Truth shall reveal itself. This process is called   
Chidda Suddhi. Again, as you said, the latent tendencies may   
rise at anytime and ruin us. I am given to anger very easily in   
life. But in normal times, there is no sense of anger in me. But   
it rises its hood in no time and harm others and harm me too.   
A slight provaction is all that is wanted to push your hypertension   
by twenty points! Bhagavan Ramana says: It is like the serpent   
inside the ant hill. It does not come out. But you have to catch   
it when it just comes out, before harming the children playing   
around the ant hill. That is the exact moment, when one should   
ask: For whom this anger is?   
Once a devotee was asking Bhagavan Ramana, as to how to control   
the anger. Bhagavan Ramana explained this. But they could not   
understand. Soon both went into the kitchen to prepare some   
evening dinner. There was a small fight. One said: Do you   
know who I am? Another retorted: Do you know who I am?   
Bhagavan Ramana entered the kitchen just then! Both became   
very ashamed. Bhagavan said: See, see, this is the moment in   
which you should catch this anger and crush its neck. In the   
Old Hall, when you were asking this question, there was no anger   
in you. So you did not understand. Now you realize.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nice points.   
Checking the desires can also result in love for God if the devotee thinks: "Oh! God, for you I have checked the vasanas...and because of you I have  
checked the vasanas.".   
If grace of God dawns, vasanas will start fading away.

Dear Subramanian R.,   
 Anger is a great impediment. We are easily hurt when someone wrongs us. A  
few years ago I happened to be furious with my builder. My mind was so  
perturbed I could not meditate for months. Now I realize that no one can  
cheat me unless I allow myself to be cheated. My own ignorance or  
carelessness is to be blamed. Acceptance is an essential characteristic of a  
spiritual seeker.   
S.Subramanian.
