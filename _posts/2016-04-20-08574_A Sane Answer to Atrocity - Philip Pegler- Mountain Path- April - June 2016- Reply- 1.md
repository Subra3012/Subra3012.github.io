It is an inconceivable mystery for which there is surely no adequate  
explanation, but no one can ever destroy   
the unity of the whole. At least this wise saying by a little known but  
inspired twentieth century Christian   
mystic provides a positive way forward and offers some prospect of resolving  
the age old enigma of why a   
loving God permits such widespread suffering.   
Henry Hamblin, whose insightful saying introduces this article, was a second  
English contemplative, who was   
writing just sixty years ago for a small but devoted readership. In the  
spiritual monthly magazine he founded and edited, 'Science of Thought Review',  
he was consistently able with the merest hint of inclusive wisdom   
to deliver a succinct teaching superbly crafted for the moment in hand -- and  
what he has to say here could   
hardly be more pertinent; it remains a distinctly apposite message for our  
turbulent age.   
Yet Hamblin was a firm believer in 'the communion of saints' and never viewed  
himself as standing up alone   
for what is right. He clearly acknowledged that he belonged to a scattered  
brotherhood of enlightened mystics   
down the ages, who have always borne witness to Truth behind the scenes as  
they unobtrusively worked   
to sustain the world in prayer and selfless service.
