**Swami Chidbhavananda joined the Ramakrishna Order at a very young age. Later  
he established his own Asramam near Tiruchi which is flourishing.** His birth  
centenary was celebrated recently.   
 **IT WAS in the year 1922 that a few of us religiously inclined college  
students undertook a pilgrimage from Madras to Tiruvannamalai for a darshan of  
Ramana Maharshi.** The Asramam was then in its initial stage. An august person  
was seated on a raised platform, and it was evident he was the sage whom we  
had come to see.   
Around him on the floor were seated a number of devotees, all intently looking  
at him, and we found our places among them. Silence reigned supreme. The  
presiding deity of the Asramam was the author of that silence, hence its  
perfection. This was a novel experience for us, but we took to this congenial  
environment quite happily.   
 **There was no such thing as a formal introduction of newly arrived  
devotees**. As others did, we sat quietly. Maharshi turned his penetrating  
gaze at us off and on. We felt ourselves highly blessed by his benign look.  
Occasionally he spoke a word or two, which was always pertinent and to the  
point. But his silence was more eloquent. An occasional smile revealed his  
bliss.   
 **Visiting devotees often brought packets of sugar-candy or some such thing  
and offered them to him. He would help himself to a tiny piece from the packet  
and pass it on to the assembled group.** Then and there it would be shared by  
the entire lot.   
I made deeper personal contact with the Maharshi in the year 1928. I had  
renounced the world in 1923 and joined the Ramakrishna Math. In 1926 I entered  
the order of sannyasa.   
 **From 1926 to 1940 I was in charge of the Ramakrishna Asramam at Ootacamund.  
During that period, when I travelled between Ootacamund and Madras, I took as  
many opportunities as possible to go to Tiruvannamalai in order to see the  
Maharshi.** I was not inclined to talk much with him; being seated in his  
presence was more than sufficient. Occasionally he spoke, but his silence was  
what I sought and prized every time I went to him. A purified enquirer made a  
rich harvest of the blissful calmness that prevailed in his presence.   
The Maharshi occupied a couch in a corner of a middle-sized hall in the  
Asramam. Barring this corner the entire hall was at the disposal of the  
visiting public, and anybody could go into the hall at any time of the day or  
night. Visiting devotees would quietly steal in, sit for a while in quiet  
meditation and then leave unobtrusively. One day a man following the path of  
devotion came in and occupied a place very near the sage. Then he unburdened  
all that lay buried in his heart.   
His speech was choked with feeling. He poured forth, "I have gone on  
pilgrimage all over the land. I have been regular in my spiritual practices.  
Many a sleepless night have I passed in prayer. Still to this day I have had  
no mercy from the Lord. I am forlorn." He cried bitterly, but Maharshi sat  
unconcerned. Eventually all his suppressed feelings were worked out, and then  
in a measured voice the sage said, "Strange man. He cries  what is there to  
sob about? Instead of being poised in the blissful Self, he goes on wailing."  
This observation had a telling effect. The man saw that his problem was self-  
created, and a new chapter in his life started.   
On another occasion a talkative man made his appearance in the hall. He chose  
to sit near the sage and unceremoniously raised a question, " **Bhagavan, what  
is your view on birth control?** " There was no answer, so the man explained  
at length the importance of the topic. Again getting no reply, he continued  
until he could say no more, and then fell silent. Silence reigned supreme in  
the hall. **In the midst of this silence, Maharshi asked, "Do you know death  
control?" There was no response.**   
One day it was suggested to Maharshi that no spiritual progress could ever be  
made without sadhana, or spiritual discipline. After a pause he made these  
observations:  **" Mind it is that binds man, and the same mind it is that liberates him.  
Mind is constituted of sankalpa and vikalpa, desire and disposition. Desire  
shapes and governs disposition. Desire is of two kinds  the noble and the  
base. The base desires are lust and greed. Noble desire is directed towards  
enlightenment and emancipation. Base desire contaminates and clouds the  
understanding. Sadhana is easy for the aspirant who is endowed with noble  
desires. Calmness is the criterion of spiritual progress. Plunge the purified  
mind into the Heart. Then the work is over. This is the essence of all  
spiritual discipline!"**   
During one of my visits I was seated at some distance from Maharshi. There  
were many devotees in the hall and the usual silence prevailed. **I remembered  
his injunction to "Plunge the pure mind into the Heart," and decided to  
practise it then.** I gazed at him and he gazed back at me. What followed was  
indescribable. His body seemed a glass case from which a blissful brilliance  
streamed out. More than half an hour passed this way. It was an experience  
unique and unforgettable.   
It confirmed Ramakrishna's statement that spiritual experience can be  
transmitted from one person to another in the manner in which material things  
are handed over.   
Bharata Varsha is ever the bestower of spirituality on mankind. **Ramana  
Maharshi is verily a true spiritual son of this holy land, who spontaneously  
and impersonally showered benediction on mankind.**   
 The Mountain Path, Jayanthi, 1998

Dear prasanth,   
Swami Chidbhavananda is quite popular in Tamizh Nadu. In fact,   
right from early 60's after he left SRK Math, he has been running   
a Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam, in a small town on the banks of   
Kaveri river, called Tirupparaithurai, about 20 kms from Tiruchy.   
He published a bulky hard bound book, a commentary on Srimad   
Bhagavad Gita, in Tamizh, which was priced at Rs 5.00. He has   
also done a similar commentary on Tiruvachakam, equally bulky   
and hard bound for Rs 5.00. These two books have seen about   
35 editions. The price is somewhat more now because of inflation.   
It should be priced around Rs 150 now. The commentaries have   
been interlaced with SRK's stories and anecdotes. He is running   
a orphanage in that small town, where Vedas and Tamizh bhakti   
literature are taught to the children.   
I am not sure whether he is still alive now. My father had met   
him several times, while we were in Tiruchy.   
Like Chidbhavananda, Sri Chinmayananda has also met Bhagavan   
Ramana, before his joining Swami Tapovan in Uttarakasi. He has   
said: All that I had learnt for 6 years in Uttarakasi, had been taught by  
Bhagavan in about 15 minutes of His gazing at me! He was   
then called Balakrishna Menon.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks a lot once again for your valuable information Subramanian garu.   
Sir, can you please let me know meaning of Tamizh sir?   
I am seeing in your posts these days you are using "Tamizh" instead of "tamil"  
so got this doubt sir.   
Is tamil nadu name now changed officially to Tamizh Nadu ?
