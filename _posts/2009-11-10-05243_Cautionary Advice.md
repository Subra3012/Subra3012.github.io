the american zen master bernie glassman, started to conduct meditaiton retreat  
in ausschwitz, in the symbol here in europe that stand for systematic killing  
of hte own brother and sister...the film follows 5 participants inot this  
retreat experience....   
they are from different faiths, one woman is the daughter of a nazi, a  
catholic priest, a rabbi, a buddhist. its wonderfull to watch, maybe for me  
(Iam austrian, the birhtplace of hitler is 1 and a half h away from were Iam  
tiping this) it is much deeper to see, but anyway if oyu have time look at it  
it is for free...

This board has been created at the request of a member.   
It is probably a good idea, but caution should be exercised when contacting  
strangers.   
Not everyone who visits forums, or attaches themselves to any faith structure  
is genuine or well-balanced.   
Please be careful.

This is to inform that we have created a Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi Satsang  
in Nova Friburgo RJ Brasil. We use material that we have received in 2007 from  
Ramanasraman. Our e-mail is mahabhutani@yahoo.com.br   
NamastÃª!
