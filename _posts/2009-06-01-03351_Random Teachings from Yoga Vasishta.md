## Random Teachings from Yoga Vasishta  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: June 01, 2009, 12:53:47 PM

Whenever the mind is occupied with the thought of   
any thing, it is immediately assimilated into the nature of that   
object, and assumes the same form on itself.   
upon seeing or thinking of an enemy, the mind   
turns to enmity, at the very sight or thought of its foe; as it   
assumes the nature of friendliness, on the visit and remembrance   
of a friend.   
Again the mind is sweetened (pleased) on relishing the   
sweets, and embittered by tasting the bitter. It becomes fond   
of the sweet, and averse to whatever is sour and bitter and unpalatable.   
So when a ravenous beast comes in the sight of a dispassionate   
Yogi, its envious nature is changed to dispassionateness,   
and it desists from doing him any injury.   
("Good company turns the wicked to goodness").   
Know the mind to be the root of all the miseries of life,   
and its desires as the sprouts of the forest of our calamities.   
Sage Vasishta to Sir Rama

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes. When Bhagavan Ramana was on the Hill, serpents   
and peacocks used to remain quiet, friendly to each other   
in His Presence. Panthers which came to tanks and ponds   
to drink water, finished their work and went away without   
harming anyone.   
Arunachala Siva.
