## Pure awareness--Ego awareness and Self-inquiry.

Suppose on a plain paper we mark a zero with a pencil,we feel   
that zero mark is really zero.If we carefully observe even when we think that  
mark of pencil indicates zero with no value   
its background is plain paper which is there even before marking zero by the  
pencil and it will be there even after   
erasing the pencil mark of zero.   
Similarly on the screen of awareness for functional purpose   
awareness mind is created whose essential nature is nothingness.That mind  
gives direction to the awareness   
so that awareness can function in the fleeting phenomenal reality.Mind has an  
utilitarian value in the phenomenal reality   
because awareness acts through it,just like pencil mark of zero on the plain  
paper has utilitarian value.Noe if we want   
have only plain paper we have to erase the pencil mark of zero.Similarly if we  
want to know the nature of awareness   
which is the background of mind,first we must know the   
nature of mind which is nothingness.Once we know that   
a gestalt in our attitude happens and we observe the   
nature of awareness which is the background of the mind.   
We direct our attention towards the source of mind   
which is awareness.The real can be known only through the false, so the ego is  
a must. One has to pass through it. It is a discipline. The real can be known  
only through the illusion. You cannot know the truth directly. First you have  
to know that which is not true. First you have to encounter the untrue.  
Through that encounter you become capable of knowing the truth. If you know  
the false as the false, truth will dawn upon you. So you have two centers. One  
center you come with, which is given by existence itself. That is the self.  
And the other center, which is created by the society, is the ego. It is a  
false thing - and it is a very great trick. Through the ego the society is  
controlling you. You have to behave in a certain way, because only then does  
the society appreciate you. You have to walk in a certain way; you have to  
laugh in a certain way; you have to follow certain manners, a morality, a  
code. Only then will the society appreciate you, and if it doesn't, you ego  
will be shaken. And when the ego is shaken, you don't know where you are, who  
you are.   
The others have given you the idea. That idea is the ego.   
That which is given by the existence is the screen of awareness.That which is  
written on your screen by the   
society is the false center of awareness or ego.If we are   
aware that our essential nature is screen of awareness   
that which is written on the screen will not affect us.   
Suppose there is news paper,we can see the letters on it   
and forget for the time being that writing and reading of   
letters are possible only because paper is there to write   
or read something on it.If we are aware of the fact then   
gestalt happens and we recognize that paper is the background of all these  
letters.Just as letters written with   
white chalk piece on a black board are very clear,we can see   
the contents of the mind,its thoughts,feelings with the background of  
awareness which is possible in Self-inquiry.   
The ego is not individual. Ego is a social phenomenon - it is society, its not  
you. But it gives you a function in the society, a hierarchy in the society.  
And if you remain satisfied with it, you will miss the whole opportunity of  
finding the self.   
And that's why you are so miserable. Try to understand it as deeply as  
possible, because this has to be thrown. And unless you throw it you will  
never be able to attain to the self. Because you are addicted to the center,  
you cannot move, and you cannot look at the self. This throwing is possible  
only through Self-inquiry.

## Inventions from the pure mind.

Dear sirs,   
Some people are born with pure mind (suddha manas). These people turned to  
Self realisation. But what about   
the great scienctists. They should also have suddha manas who invented many  
things for the world. Is not it?   
Therefore as the world is created from the impure mind, the great inventions  
also happened from the pure mind.   
So both mind is a veil from "Self:". Is it?   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 The Ekagrata(one pointedness) of Suddhamanas is selfwards in a saint,whereas it is directed outwards in a scientist.So Saint   
is a subjective scientist,whereas scientist is an objective scientist.The  
character of exploration is the same in both but directions are different.

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, the scientific inventions/   
discoveries are the objective experiences, and perhaps may   
fatten the egos of the scientists. I am not sure. But Dr. Einstein,   
after the discovery of general theory of relativity, has said: "These are all nothing. I want to know the God's mind. The rest   
are all details!"   
He has also said once the following, which are inscribed in his   
room in Syracuse University: "I believe in God who is very subtle!"   
Arunachala Siva.

it is a fact that alot of the great scientists like Einstein and others were  
and are mystics....   
einstein said some tings that can just come from an "inspired" mind, the same  
with mozart, beethoven etc..   
beethoven said: "what loftier mission is there to approach the godhead"   
even the great nietzsche who said "god is dead" also said something like the  
true desire of the human is to melt into the universe....

Yes. Great artists have also been mystics, in a way. But some of them were  
looking abnormal in their behavior. The power inside, which they know, were  
the outpourings of the arts and scientific discoveries. Van Gogh was in love  
with a girl. The girl complained that he has got ugly ears. So he cut them  
off and sent them to the girl friend. The same artist produced great  
paintings in later years. Wagner, the great musician, was deaf. Einstein  
started believing in god, after he discovered the General Theory of  
Relativity. Kekule who discovered the hexagonal structure of benzene, which  
the base for all aromatic compounds, could not succeed in his goal. One  
night, he prayed to God and had a dream where he found six serpents holding  
each others' tail through their mouths. He got up from sleep and drew the  
hexagonal closed structure of benzene!   
Alekhine the world champion chess player, was a mad man. But   
if he sits before a chess board, he would play wonderful games.   
He was beaten only a few times in his hundreds of games. (The   
Chess Mind by Gerald Abrams). Robert Fisher, the first non-American to become  
a world chess champion was also abnormal. He always preferred a room without  
windows!   
He had said that even the ceiling fan that was revolving over his   
head was a disturbance to him, while playing chess.   
Bhagavan Ramana who had no intention of writing any poems either   
for spreading bhakti or jnana, had one day, found that the words   
'Karunaiyal ennai aanada nee..... coming repeatedly in his mind   
and could not forget them till He completed the stroll on the Hill!   
On return, He wrote the first poem of Sri Arunachala Padigam. Then followed  
the other verses of Padigam, Ashtakam, Navamani Maalai   
and Pancharatnam!   
Arunachala Siva.
