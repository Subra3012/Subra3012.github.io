## Important Couplets From Tripura Rahasya - Part1  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 11, 2010, 06:37:49 PM  
---  
The feeling of a need to work in order to gain happiness (being the index of  
misery) is the misery of miseries. How can there be pleasure or removal of  
pain so long as it continues?   
Only those who need not engage in action, are happy; they are perfectly  
content, and self-contained, and they experience a happiness which extends to  
all the pores of the body.   
Wrongly do they ever engage in work, being deluded; such is the plight of  
humanity stupefied by the poison of the sense of obligation.   
Confounding dispassion (vairagya) with misery,and the pleasures of the world  
with happiness (sukha), a man suffers in the cycle of births and deaths, while  
powerful ignorance prevails.   
Association with the Sages is alone said to lead to the highest good. Your  
contact with Samvarta has led you to this stage of enlightenment, which is the  
forerunner of emancipation. On being approached, the Sages teach the greatest  
good.   
Misery is of two kinds, external and internal.The former pertains to the body  
and is caused by the nerves, etc.; the latter pertains to the mind and is  
caused by desire.   
Mental distraction is worse than physical pain and the whole world has fallen  
a victim to it. Desire is the seed of the tree of misery and never fails in  
its fruits.   
Respite gained by the fulfilment of one desire before another takes its place,  
is not happiness, because the seeds of pain are still latent. Such respite is  
enjoyed by the insects also (which certainly do not typify perfect  
happiness).Yet is their enjoyment distinctly better than that of men because  
their desires are less complex?   
Fatigue is certainly produced for everybody after the flurry (or passion) of  
copulation, just as there is fatigue for an animal carrying a load   
Beauty is only a mental concept, as is evident from the similar feeling in  
similar enjoyments of lovers in dreams.   
The idea of beauty lies in oneâs own desire innate in the mind.   
Even the most accomplished among men have fallen into the habit of seeking  
pleasure from woman, for all consider her the best hunting ground for  
delight.Similarly also a manâs body is thought by women to be the highest  
source of enjoyment.Shaped of fat and flesh, filled with blood,topped by the  
head, covered by skin, ribbed by bones,covered with hair, containing bile and  
phlegm, a pitcher of faeces and urine, generated from semen and ovum, and born  
from the opening from where urine is ejected â such is the body. Just think  
of it! Finding delight in such a thing, how are men any better than worms  
growing in offal?   
What is known as the mind is, after all, always like a restless monkey. So the  
ordinary man is always afflicted with troubles. Everybody knows that a  
restless mind is the channel of endless troubles; whereas one is happy in  
sleep in the absence of such restlessness.Hearing with a distracted mind is as  
good as not hearing, for the words serve no useful purpose, resembling the  
fruit-laden tree seen in a painting.   
Men earn their food, gods their nectar, pious ascetics the highest beatitude  
and others their desires, by individual exertion alone.   
Whatever has the impress of misery on it cannot be good. Such are wealth,  
children, wife, kingdom, treasury, army, fame, learning, intellect, body,  
beauty and prosperity. For they are all transient and already in the jaws of  
death, otherwise called time.   
Therefore worship the Primal Cause of the universe as the starting point; be  
devoted to Him; He will soon enable you to succeed in your attempts to destroy  
the illusion.   
Among the methods of approach to God, there are (1) worship to overcome  
troubles, (2) worship to gain wealth, etc., and (3) loving dedication of  
oneself. The last one is the best and surest in its results.   
A human master may take long to recognise unselfish work;but God, the Lord of  
the Universe, the Dweller in our hearts, knows everything and soon bestows  
appropriate fruits. In the case of other kinds of devotees, God has to await  
the course of destiny â that being His own ordainment; whereas for the  
selfless devotee, God, the   
Lord and the sole refuge, is all in all and takes care of him without  
reference to the devoteeâs predestiny or His own ordained laws. He  
compensates the devotee quickly, and that is because He is supreme and self-  
contained without depending on anything else.   
Predestiny or divine will is powerless before Him. Everyone knows how He set  
aside predestiny and divine laws in the case of His famous devotee,  
Markandeya.   
[Note: A Rishi, Mrikandu by name, who was childless,pleased Siva by his  
penance. When Siva appeared to him,he prayed that a son might be born to him.  
Siva asked him if he wished to have a dull boy long-lived, or a bright boy  
short-lived. Mrikandu preferred the latter. So Siva said âYou will have a  
very brilliant son; but he will only live for sixteen yearsâ. Accordingly a  
son was born who was very good and dutiful, and most intelligent and  
pious,charming all who saw him. The parents were delighted with him but grew  
sad as he grew up. He asked them the reason for their sadness and they told  
him of Sivaâs boon.He said, âNever mind. I will seeâ, and took to  
penance.Siva was pleased with his intense devotion and ordained that he should  
remain sixteen years of age for all eternity.]   
The current notion that one cannot escape oneâs destiny is applicable only  
to weak-minded and senseless wastrels.   
The Primal Being is Siva with five faces and three eyes, the Creator would in  
that case be like an ordinary potter making pots, endowed with a body and  
brain. True, there is no art found in the world, without a body and some  
intellect. In fact, the creative faculty in men belongs to something between  
the body and pure intelligence.   
[Note: Body being insentient cannot act of its own accord; nor can intellect  
do so without a tool.]   
Therefore the mind operates apart from the gross body,in dreams; being  
intelligent it creates an environment suitable to its latent desires. This  
clearly indicates that the body is only a tool for a purpose and the agent is  
intelligence.Instruments are necessary for human agents because their  
capacities are limited and they are not self-contained.Whereas the Creator of  
the universe is perfect in Himself and creates the whole universe without any  
external aid.This leads to the important conclusion that God has no body.  
Otherwise, He would be reduced to a glorified human being, requiring  
innumerable accessories for work and influenced by seasons and environments,  
in no way different from a creature, and not the Lord. Moreover, preexistence  
of accessories would quash His unique mastery and imply limits to His powers  
of creation. This is absurd, as being contrary to the original premises.  
Therefore, He has no body nor the other aids, yet He still creates the world,  
O Lord of my life! Fools are taken in by the notion of giving a body to the  
transcendental Being. Still, if devotees worship and contemplate Him with a  
body according to their own inclinations, He shows them grace, assuming such a  
body. For He is unique and fulfils the desires of His devotees.   
Nevertheless, the conclusion must be reached that He is pure intelligence and  
His consciousness is absolute and transcendental. Such is the consciousness-  
intelligence in purity,Absolute Being, the One Queen, Parameswari  
(Transcendental Goddess), overwhelming the three states and hence called  
Tripura. Though She is the undivided whole, the universe manifests in all its  
variety in Her, being reflected as it were,in a self-luminous mirror. The  
reflection cannot be apart from the mirror and is therefore one with it. Such  
being the case, there cannot be difference in degrees (e.g., Siva, or Vishnu  
being superior to each other). Bodies are mere conceptions in the lower order  
of beings and they are not to the point in the case of God. Therefore, be  
wise,and worship the one pure, unblemished Transcendence.   
As long as you are contaminated with notions of me or mine (e.g., my home, my  
body, my mind, my intellect),the Self will not be found, for it lies beyond  
cognition and cannot be realised as âmy Self â.   
Retire into solitude, analyse and see what those things are which are cognised  
as mine; discard them all and transcending them, look for the Real Self.   
Is there any moment when the Self is not the Self? Neither is control of mind  
used to gain it. I shall give you some examples: Just as things unseen in darkness are found on its removal by means of a lamp,  
and are therefore said to be recovered from oblivion.   
Just as a confused man forgets his purse, but remembers and locates it on  
keeping his mind unruffled and steady, yet still says that he has gained the  
lost purse,though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.   
So also the control of your mind is not the cause of your Self-realisation;  
though the Self is always there, it is not recognised by you even with a  
controlled mind because you are not conversant with it.   
Just as an infant tries to take hold of his own reflection being unaware of  
the mirror, so also common people are taken in by their mental reflections in  
the mirror of the pure, luminous Self and are not aware of the mirror, because  
they have no acquaintance with the Self.   
The mind should be brought to the condition of a newborn baby. Then he feels  
as if he were separate from all gross materials and only the feeling âI  
amâ persists.

SWAMI SRI RAMANANANDA SARASWATHI (Munagala S. Venkataramaiah)   
Tripura Rahasya is an ancient prime text on Advaita in Sanskrit and was highly  
commended by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi for study by seekers. There was no  
English translation of this scripture until the present one was made by  
Munagala Venkataramiah (Swami Ramanananda Saraswathi) in 1938.

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Welcome to the Forum. As far as I could recollect, there are a few   
ancient Tamil books tranlsated either in poetry or in prose in English.   
These are: 1\. Tirumantiram, Book X of Saiva Canons, by Tirumoolar. This has   
been translated by someone and published by Sri Ramakrishna Math,   
Chennai. This is about some years back. I do not know whether reprints or  
old edition is available.   
2\. Tiruvachakam, Book VIII of Saiva Canons, by Manikkavachagar.   
English translation of Dr. G.U. Pope is available. But I do not know   
whether the edition which came in 1890, has been reprinted.   
3\. Robert Butler, devotee of Bhagavan Ramana, has translated some of Sangam  
poems like KuRun Thohai. For the book, you have to check up with C/O Sri  
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai.   
4\. Periya Puranam, Book XII of Saiva Canons, by Sekkizhar has been translated  
in English prose. But I do not know who has published this translation.   
5\. Some of Azhwar's poems have been translated by A.K. Ramanujan. This is  
available in the book Hymns for the Drowning, published by Penguin. You have  
to check up for reprints from Penguin.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan,   
In the afternoon, I remembered two more good English translations of ancient  
Tamil texts. One is again, KuRun Thohai. Some of the   
poems in this Sangam Tamil work has been translated by A.K.   
Ramanujan, under the title, "Interior Landscape." AK Ramanujan   
was the Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy in   
Chicago University. He was a bilingual, knowing both Tamil and   
Kannada. This was published by Penguin. The other is the excellent   
translation of Saint Arunagiri Natha's Tiruppugazh, by one Mr.   
Gopala Sundaram. He has translated almost all the 1300 plus Tiruppugazh  
songs, in transliterated word-by-word prose and has   
included the musical rendering of Mr. S. Raghavan and his group of   
Tiruppugazh Devotees, New Delhi, for about 475 songs. This is available in  
the web www.kaumaram.com.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
There is an English version of Periya Puranam of Sekkizhaar published by Sri  
Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai. It is based on the condensed english  
version by G. Vanmikananathan.

Firstly, Thanks a lot for the post.   
And second, I stay in Bangalore, so is it possible to get those books here  
apart from books published by Penguin.   
I recently bought the book 'A search in secret India', it simple change my  
view on ancient India, although it speaks of India in 1930, it simply a great  
book.   
But Burton in his book says he has taken photos, is this book available.   
And are there any books similar to that of Burton ?   
I used to watch DD Podhigai, early morning some people used to speak of  
Nayanars,Alwars, I want to from where did these people get the in depth  
information, are these available in English.   
And also check this link http://www.dlshq.org/download/nayanar.htm which  
speaks about SIXTY-THREE NAYANAR SAINTS

Dear karthikeyan. M   
In Bangalore, books of religious types are available in Vedanta Book   
House, near Sri Ramakrishna Math. SRK Math themselves are selling books.  
Even certain large general stores like Gangarams, Sapna may   
have some of these books.   
As regards Brunton's A Search in Secret India, it was published by   
Rider and Co. I am not sure whether reprints are available. But the   
three chapters dealing with Bhgavan Ramana, are available as seperate book  
from Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamali, under the   
title "The Maharshi and His Message." Brunton has authored some   
more books. But these are less known to east and west.

Thanks for the post and sorry for delay in replying.   
I have bought a book on Ramanuja from Ramakrishna Math in Bangalore written by  
a Ramakrishna Math person in kolkata. But the book is translation from Bengali  
to English, uses more Sanskrit words and even more the names are given in  
Sanskrit equivalent to Tamil names. I don't like this.   
Some sentences speaks of Ramanjua receiving the mantra (8 syllables, OM NAMO  
NARAYANAYA) from disciple of Alavandar out of pity only.   
Do you agree with this.   
Recently last year end 2008 in DD-Podhigai TV a documentary of Ramanuja was  
telecast it was simply super. Do any body have a copy of that serial.   
Anyway, I planning a pilgrimage to Srirangam this March last week. so can  
anyone tell me important places in Srirangam temple and around to visit.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan.M   
Ramanuja took the mantra from ALvandar or his disciple not out of pity, but  
it was destined to happen like that. When Sankara preached   
to his four disciples, Mandanamisra was very much elder to him. Others  
excepting Hastmalaka, were of his age. Hastmalaka is the youngest. This  
happens.   
If you are a Vishnu devotee, Sri Rangam is the best temple to visit.   
There are a few other temples of Siva. Two kilometres from Sri Rangam is  
Jambukeswara Temple, in Tiruvanaika. He is Siva and his   
consort is Akhilandeswari. This is one of the five places representing five  
elements. Tiruvanaika represents the Water. There is a beautiful Ganapati  
Temple, on the rock, within another three kms. This is   
Tiruchirapalli town. There in the same rock strcuture, there is a Siva-Uma  
temple, called Mathrubhuteswara and Suganda Kundalambal.   
You can visit these two temples also. If you have got enough time and a  
little more money, say one week, you can visit another 10 temples of various  
gods.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
The Utsavar Vighraham in Sri Rangam Temple is the Kula Deivam (Ranganathar) of  
Sri Ramachandramurthy. It is believed that these Vighrahas were venerated by

Dear Subramanian R,   
The book published by Ramakrishna Math on Ramanuja thus speaks about Sri  
Ramanuja getting the mantra from a person my name Gothispuram (not exact name  
but a similar word in Sanskrit translation from Tamil).   
Its says that Ramanuja offers his services to this person who is a disciple of  
Alvandar, but Ramanuja's services don't please him to reveal the mantra, again  
the book says, that out of pity the disciple of Alvandar reveals the mantra to  
Sri Ramanuja.   
If this is what the book says, by your words,   
'' it was destined to happen like that'' you meant it happen out of pity,  
indeed ?   
But again this questions Sri Ramanuja himself of his services, if one goes by  
the way of book or the way you say.   
That is reason why I'm asking for a good Tamil books in English.   
I'm a devotee of both Bhagavan Ramana and Sri Ramanuja.   
Siva Chidambaram

Dear karthikeyan,   
Sri Ramakrishna Maths books are authentic. We do not have any   
recorded history of Sri Ramanuja. Even Sri Sankara's biography   
by Madhva Vidranya has got many versions. It may be out of pity   
or anything that Sri Ramanuja got the mantra. We may not know.   
Bhagavan Ramana volunteered to go out the Old Hall and told an   
unknown Harijan to chant Siva Siva. Why? We do not know. Is it   
out of pity or that Harijan's service? What service did the Harijan   
do for Bhagavan Ramana? It is called ahedu-karuna in Sanskrit.   
Mercy without any tangible reasons! Lalita Tripura Sundari is eulogzied in  
Sri Lalita Sahasranamam, like that. The last verse in   
the same book says: Abala gopa viditha.... One who blesses even   
the shepherds and cowherds! Why? The first "nama" answers this   
point. She is Srimata, the Mother of all. The mother does not feed her child  
out pity or asking. What can the newborn baby ask? It is not   
out of pity either. The new babe is Her own, why need for a pity?   
Saint Manikkavachagar says: " I am lowlier than a lowly dog, but you desired  
and took care of me..." Nayir kadaiyai kidanthenai nayanthu neeye  
atkondai.....

Dear Subramanian.R   
Thanks for the post, but you have not answered to the point of the question.   
Are there any other books published on Ramanuja, as i said I will be visiting  
Srirangam this Month end, are there any book stalls in the temple premise, in  
around Srirangam   
Books on Ramanuja other than the book published from Ramakrishna Maths.

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
Sri Ramanuja was a versatile scholar both in Tamil and Sanskrit.   
There a number of books by him. He has commented on Brahma   
Sutra Bhashyam. These are either in Tamil or in Sanskrit. In   
Sri Rangam, there are a number of bookshops near the temple and   
you may check up with them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
SRK Math has given an English translation of Sri Ramanuja's   
Brahma Sutra Bhashyam. This is mainly to compare him with   
Sri Sankara. As otherwise, there are not any other books of   
Sri Ramanuja from SRK Math.

Thanks for the post, You meant that SRK Math supports Sri Ramanuja and that is  
the reason why english translation from bengalee of life of Ramanuja is little  
different.   
Ok I have heard of Sri Bhashyam, what is Brahma Sutra Bhashyam, what Sri  
Ramanuja says in that book.   
but coming back to SRK Math book on Sri Ramanuja, I read the book, but in some  
sections the book comes heavily against Siva. Have you read the book.

Sri Bhashyam is a commentary of Brahma Sutras by Sri Ramanujacharya. Sutras or  
thread or Aphorism of Para Brahmam.   
The Vedas and Upanishads were neatly categorized by Badarayana or Vyasa or  
Krishnadvaipayana (He is known by these names) Before he categorized the Veda,  
upanishads etc... the great sages of the yore even before Vyasa, Vashishta,  
Vishwamitras. It was a time when there was no written record, teaching was  
only by listening to their Guru. these great sages transfered from generations  
to generations the sutras or Aphorisms of Brahma Gnana. They are very very  
abstract aphorisms and are the root of the entire Vedas themselves. Vedas  
themselves are birthless, Brahma Sutras are considered the roots of the Vedas.   
Greats like Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka and few others have written  
commentary on Brahma Sutras. It is so abstract that it is capable being  
interpreted in multiple ways. These commentaries were supported with evidences  
from Upanishads by Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva etc...   
The very fact that it is capable of being interpreted in multiple ways viz.  
Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, Dwaita proves that ultimate truth can be attained by  
any of the interpretations!   
Sri Ramanuja wrote a commentary on Sutras to as a proof(study) his system of  
doctrine Vishishtadvaita like Shankaras Advaita.   
proof or study here to find out what the Brahma Sutras say finally? do they  
really convey what the student has understood from the Vedanta!   
Shankara through his study of Vedas, understood Advaiata Bhava and through his  
study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras too conveyed the same  
doctrine of his Advaita   
Ramanuja through his study of Vedas, understood the Vishishtadvaita(Qualified  
Advaita) and through his study of the Sutras, he found that the Brahma Sutras  
too conveyed the same doctrine of his Vishishtadvaita   
Similarly, Anandatheertha or Madhvacharya his doctrine Dvaita   
No study of Vedanta is complete without close examination of these Brahma  
Sutras. They are also called as Nyaya Prasthana or logical standing point of  
Vedanta.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I have not yet read the book on Sri Ramakrishna published by RK Math. However  
I have read the story of Sri Ramanuja from different sources.   
Sri Ramanuja's reforms were rather too strong for his time. Admitting women  
and all castes in the maTams. He questioned the authority of Adi Sankara's  
maTams. There indeed was a lot of ideological opposition. Also he was not  
prepared to sign the declaration that "nothing is greater than Siva". The  
aazvaars accepted Siva, but accorded a higher status to Vishnu. Ramanuja  
considered naadhamuni, aaLavandhaar and the aazhvaars as his spiritual  
leaders.   
Even among the Vaishnavites, there are two groups, one follow Vedanta Desikan  
of 13th Century and others Sri Ramanuja.   
Since I have not read the book, to have a clear understanding, it would be  
great if you can share the exact text from the book on Sri Ramanuja so that we  
can investigate for our understanding   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M   
SRK Math as philosophy, approves only Advaita. But Sri Ramakrishna's  
religious tolerance is well known. He supported   
all religions and sects. Sri Ramakrishananda, who came to Madras   
and started the Madras Math, the second in the whole world, after   
Belur, wanted to know about Sri Ramanuja who is a Tamil scholar and  
visishtadvati. Hence, Sri Ramakrishananada, read Sri Ramanuja's books and  
wrote a biography on him. Sri Ramanuja's book naturally would consist ideas  
establishing Visishtadvata and also the Supremacy of Narayana. Sri  
Ramakrishnanada is faithful to Sri   
Ramanuja's philosophy while writing the biography. That is all.   
Srimad Bhagavatam, written by Sage Vyasa, speaks about the supremacy of  
Narayana. It says Narayana gave birth to Brahma and   
Brahma gave birth to ten sons, one of them is Siva. Sage Vyasa   
is neutral. That is why his Brahma Sutram, gives rise to interpretations by  
all the three great Saints. Sankara, Sri Ramanuja   
and Madhwa. Sri Ramanuja's Brahma Sutra Bhashyam, naturally interprets Brahma  
Sutram, as per qualified non dualism. Sage   
Vyasa's Skandam, extols the supremacy of Skanda. All devi slokas,   
and devi bhashyam extols the supremacy of Uma. This is not uncommon in Hindu  
philosophy. Abhirami Andati says She is one,   
and she became many. That sums up the whole thing. Sankara is   
par excellent, because he extolled Advaita, Non dual Brahman. But he also  
wrote numerous slokas on all the deities. You should read Sri   
Soundarya Lahari, of Sri Sankara. He says that Uma, Sri Lalita  
Tripurasundari, is the greatest, and all gods including Siva, remain as four  
legs of her sleeping cot and Siva her bed! Can you beat it?   
Arunachala Siva.

A little more to add from my previous post...   
Sri Vaishnavas understand the Vedas to teach that Sriman Narayana is the  
Supreme Brahman, and that meditation and surrender to him is the only means to  
moksha.   
The Tamil heritage of the Sri Vaishnavas also teaches them that Narayana alone  
is the supreme entity. With these as a background, the question of worshipping  
Siva as envisioned in temples and puraanas cannot even arise, since according  
to the Vaishnava tradition, Siva is not God as such.   
This is somewhat contrary to the smaarta view that both Vishnu and Siva are  
merely subjective and ultimately false conceptions of the formless,  
undifferentiated Absolute.   
According to me these differences arises form the doctrine stand point of  
view. Just like how Jesus is for Christians, Vishnu was to Vaishnavites, He is  
the only supreme God Vushnu is the only Brahman. Whereas from Shankaras stand  
point of view, Vishnu, Shiva are only representation or manifestation of the  
supreme reality or Bharman.

Thanks a lot,   
I have to admit, at the beginning I had little knowledge of siva and I was a  
devotee of Lord Vishnu. Until the age 22 or 23 for the first time I visited  
Arunachala, got introduce to Siva and importantly with Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi from there till now its no turning back (date: around 2004), honestly  
speaking it was Arunachala who made me to visit the Scared Chidambaram Temple.   
An interesting incident occur in my life i want to share with you people.   
We had our house shifted in 2007 August, while shifting there was a aluminum  
cast idol of Nataraja, while shifting I found this Idol and told my mother  
that let the idol be thrown or kept away in old house, my mother said it is  
siva and should be not thrown. Even at that moment I had no knowledge of  
''Dancer of the Cosmos, the Lord of the Universe', NATARAJA.   
Ok we moved to new house(rent), that same year December 2007 we visited Scared  
Chidambaram Temple, we went inside we were searching for main deity, we came  
across Lord Govinda, and asked for the main deity, an retired Professor made  
us to turn the otherside, suddenly all people lifted their hands up in  
salutation, and there was the Idol of Nataraja behind it was the Secret.   
But all i can say now is that I pray both Siva and Vishnu likewise giving more  
to Nataraja.   
\   
The quest for me was to understand our ancient Tamil works on Hinduism through  
books.   
But there seems to be many books.   
I'm a tamilian but being brought up in Bangalore, can speak tamil but cannot  
write or read it. Yes one day i will learn soon.   
Going by what Subramanian.R and Nagaraj post, it looks so complicated our  
Hinduism is. But for a common man hearing what Subramanian and Nagaraj words  
it is really difficult to understand and to accept which.   
More confusion has got into me.   
Siva Chidambaram

Dear Karthikeyan,   
I would say don't get too much into intellectual and complications in your  
efforts or sadhana. somehow I or we have landed here with so much study or  
readings. The reality is that there is no difference between you and me in  
spite of the complications and extra intellectual learning from my side.   
At the end of the day, if you are successful in tears dropping from your eyes  
out of devotion Bhakthi, nothing is equivalent to that. Just be as you are.  
Don't get caught in too much intellectualisation as well. Don't let yourself  
be confused. discard what is confusing as poison and keep going. Even mine or  
our posts. I would even go further saying don't even bother knowing further  
the doctrines of Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita and all. Just shower  
love.   
Swami Vivekananda has said: _It is a man-making religion that we want. It is man-making theories that  
we want. It is man-making education all round that we want. And here is the  
test of truth --anything that makes you weak physically, intellectually, and  
spiritually, reject as poison, there is no life in it, it cannot be true.  
Truth is strengthening. Truth is purity, truth is all knowledge; truth must  
be strengthening, must be enlightening, must be invigorating._**   
Keep it very simple, I have come to understand that love and loving others and  
above all **FORBEARANCE** is the ultimate realisation. thats what jnanis do.  
we should strive to relieve or help others of their pain, spread love. love is  
everything.   
Thirumular has said all that needs to be told in 2 simple beautiful words the  
sum of all knowledge of all Vedas and scriptures of all religions. Refer to a  
post on Auvaiyar's Aathichoodi simple teachings in this forum. they make best  
set of principles anyone needs to follow.   
 **Anbe Sivam** Love, indeed is the all pervading God!   
Truly there is nothing more to know at all even from Vedas or Upanisdhads or  
any other scriptures of the world.   
As the saying goes:  **PAROPARAKARYA PHALANTI VRIKSHAH - The trees bear fruits to serve  
others.   
PAROPAKARAYA VAHANTI NADYAH - The rivers flow to serve others   
PAROPAKARAYA DUHANTI GAVAH - Cows give milk to serve others.   
PAROPAKARTHAM IDAM SHAREERAM - This human body is meant to serve  
others.**   
We should never forget these in our life and even in our spiritual quests, we  
may tend to get lost in our search by forgetting our real purpose (above)   
Paropakaram is the beginning and the end of all knowledge and even Self  
Realisation.   
This body is not ours so it is only for Paropakaram

Thanks   
Going by the posts,   
Should I completely stop bothering about the books as Nagaraj quotes and go  
ahead with simply love to god.   
There arose a confusion in one of the posts, a post quoted Sankara stating  
Siva is one of the names of vishnu then the main thing what made the greats to  
divide gods, did it happen based on the rich and poor.   
But again if one comes across these great people it will certainly make them  
to know what they preached, why our Bhagavan Ramana himself has written many  
books, so if i come across Ashram book stall i will quite get one.   
My objective is to know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadwaita in simple  
terms, please

To know what is Advaita or Dwaita or Visishtadvaita is to know your Self. So  
why not find out your Self first and then you will know what is Advaita,  
Dwaita or Visishtadvaita. Bhagawan Ramana says first find out who is it that  
wants to know what is Advaita, Dwaita or Visishtadvaita.   
Who is the enquirer?

**Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita, Advaita**   
In short,   
Dvaita --> Devotee feels God is separate and worships God as a master.   
Vishishtadvaita --> Devotee feels God is whole and he is part of God.   
Advaita --> Devotee merges in God completely and no separateness remains.   
Here is a puranic story which shows that all the three ways of connecting to  
God can exist in the same devotee: Once Ramachandra, God-incarnate, said to his great devotee Hanuman,   
 _My son, tell Me in what relation you regard Me, and how you meditate upon  
Me._   
Hanuman replied:  _O Rama, at times I worship Thee as Purna, the undivided one.   
Then I look upon myself as an Amsa, a part, a fragment as it were, of  
Divinity.   
At other times I meditate upon Thee, O Rama, as my Divine Master and think of  
myself only as Thy servant.   
When however, I am blessed, O Rama, with Tattva Jnana, or true Knowledge, I  
realise that I am Thou and Thou art I._   
Om Shanti. .

Dear karthikeyan. M.   
There is no need for confusion. Bhagavan Ramana has used one   
simile. There are toffees. Some are green, some are yellow, some   
are red. Each child likes one particular colour and shape even though  
sweetness is same in all. And that is the simile which you should keep in  
mind, while praying to your god, your ishta devata. All are one. The only  
other thing is: You should not dislike or hate the other toffees, because  
some other child likes it! Do not hate other gods.   
You pray to your chosen deity and then do meditation and self enquiry. All  
gods merge in the Self within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the post,   
I have got book on Periya Puranam from Ramana Ashram Library.   
Subramanian R you have posted a numerous quotes and stories of Naynamars. I  
have readed Periya Puranam, but comparing my knowledge from the book to you,  
What you have known is more in detail. so are there any books on Naynamars and  
Alwars.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
The English prose rendering of Periya Puranam published by Sri   
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, is by one Rangachari. The original   
sources are Tiru Thondar Thohai by Sundaramoorthy, which lists all the 60 (the  
remaining three being Sundarmoorthy himself and his   
mother and father). This is part of his own composition which comes   
under Book VII of Saiva Canons. A slightly more elaborate Tamil composition  
is Tiruthondar Tiruvandati, by Nambi Andar Nambi, which comes in Book XI of  
Saiva Canons. A good prose version in Tamil is by   
Kripananda Variayar titled Sivan Arut Selvar. I go by original   
Tamil verses of Periya Puranam, by Sekkizhar, which is Book XII of   
Saiva Canons. This is a composition of about 4500 delightful verses.   
The English version of Rangachari and Tamil version of Kripananda   
Variyar would serve the purpose. The Tamil book is published by   
Vanadhi Padippagam, T Nagar, Chennai 600 017.   
Arunachala Siva.
