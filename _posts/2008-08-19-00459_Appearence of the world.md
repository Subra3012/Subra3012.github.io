Is it true that world is known or appears only when you attend to it?

Dear PSVNN Raju, The world appears and is known only when   
a man operates the mind. You can ask, if you do no operate the   
mind, will not the world appear for others? The relationship is   
only with a person and not with all the persons in the world.   
Imagine, some Martians come down to earth and kill every person!   
Then the world will not appear, because there is no one to operate   
the mind! The world appears only with the mind. This is what   
Bhagavan says in Who am I? So also is the case with individual   
soul and the personal gods. These appear only with the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.
