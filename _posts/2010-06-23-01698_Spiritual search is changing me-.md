## True Bhakthi

What is true bhakthi? Does it come on its own? Or we should cultivate? Does it  
come like a samskara?   
For some people it is like a passion. If so is it good? Then it would not be a  
true bhakthi? Does true bhakthi expect any thing like to mingle with God?   
(All from the mind come up.... )

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No doubt samskara plays a part. But the efforts are also necessary.   
Bhagavan Ramana tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: The one who sacrifices himself to the Swarupam inside and remains   
ever as Atma Nishtaparan is a true bhakata. The problem is our lack of  
efforts towards sacrificing our ego to the Swarupam within.   
Sirthuondar and Kannappar only displayed this highest bhakti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the same Who am I?, Bhagavan tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: " Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since   
the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we,   
without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry with thoughts   
as to what should be done and how and what should not be done   
and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after   
getting on it, why should we carry our small luggage on our head,   
to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at  
ease?"   
This attitude is true bhakti. ELLAM AVAN SEYAL.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Yes. We should have full surrender and faith on God. It may be lots of  
vasanas, and expecting always good result.   
At starting point first we surrender and put all the things on train and sit.  
Some times the train meet an accident and only our compartment will get  
derailed. It is hard to accept our destiny. All philosophy, atma vicharam will  
drown for some times. It is like snake and ladder game. That shows there is  
lack of true bhakti and surrender.   
To have such type of bhakti, we need His grace.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: Grace is always there. There is no   
niggardliness in Grace. But you should have no niggardliness in   
the vessel that you bring. The vessel means devotion. Our devotion should be  
large enough [or intense enough] to obtain the full   
Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
A Self Realized person (Brahma Jnani), will not have any doubts   
and he will not ask any questions. Bhagavan was in that state.   
Sometimes He would put a counter-question or ask "Find out who   
is the questioner?" or 'Doubt the doubter,' etc., These are all not   
questions but only to seek the stand of the questioner, more clearly.   
But the fact is all of us ask questions. Have doubts. This shows   
we are all not self realized though our levels of maturity to attain   
the goal may be different.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in His song Atma Viddai:-   
Verse 4: Of what avail is knowing things   
Other than the Self? And the Self being known   
What other thing is there to know?   
That One Light that shines as many selves,   
Seeing this Self within   
As Awareness' lightning flash;   
The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized person my have some doubts also   
for example if he does not know the way to a particular place... he may ask  
"what is the way to this place ?"   
and he may also have other doubts "where are you coming from? "   
or "how come u r doing this like this"   
lot of doubts can be there!   
why should a Self Realized person not have doubts?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Such simple doubts may arise in a Jnani too. It is like a Jnani   
eating, drinking water, attending to natural calls.   
But what is amazing in Bhagavan Ramana's life is He did not even   
ask these simple doubts! When He was traveling to Tiruvannamalai,   
it is one Moslem Moulvi who had said that He should get down at   
Tindivanam and catch a another train. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai and  
so He had no doubts as to the places where He   
had to go further. Whenever some new visitors came, He NEVER asked wherefrom  
he was coming or to which place he was going further.   
Narayana Guru came to see Bhagavan Ramana. He was in Virupaksha Cave.  
Narayana Guru saw Him from outside by looking into the cave. After some time,  
Bhagavan came out. Then He   
simply said "Let us take our lunch!" While Bhagavan took His usual   
ganji [rice gruel] served by Pazhaniswami, Narayana Guru took his special food  
brought by his disciples. They looked at each other for some minutes. Then  
Bhagavan Ramana simply left for stroll on the   
Hill!   
Narayana Guru was amazed. Here is a person, who does not   
ask wherefrom I am coming, what is my name, whereto I am going, what is my  
job, what is my caste.... He is ever in Nirvirtti! He   
is the Self which does not ask questions or doubts. This Narayanana writes  
this poem in reverence to this great Jnani!   
Like this he wrote five verses titled Nirvritti Panchakam, with a   
paper and pencil brought by his disciples and left the poem to   
Pazhaniswami. After this historic meeting, Narayana Guru stopped   
asking questions to his visitors and whenever someone had gone to Kerala from  
Tamizh Nadu, he only used to ask: "Did you meet   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi? Without meeting such a person,   
what is the point in running around to places and meeting gurus?"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
These story's of Ramana's life are excellent.   
There are many gurus and realized people, but none can compare to the effect  
Ramana had and still has on people.   
I wonder why Ramana is such a great force.

Dear Srkudai, I went trough many questioning,understanding... But i believe  
that everyone have its own way of "spiritual search". Yet,those are only  
words. But,i think, "to meet the self" many dont need to study scriptures at  
all. His way can be way of love. Or he can reach goal using some other path.  
So many souls and that much ways. Understanding is needed. But not necesary. I  
am not thalking about me,but generaly,in the way i am seeing things. For me  
spiritual search is love for God and faith. Those are first steps. After comes  
everything according to each person individualy. Dear Subramanian,Ramanaduli,  
I dont think doubt and questioning are the same. Question can be  
simple,without expectation what answer will be. And doubt is questioning is it  
something really like that,or not. I can ask "What is the soul?". Without  
expectation. Just ask. And i can ask "Is it soul that,or is it maybe something  
else?"

Dear Jewell,   
Doubts and questions can mean as you say, somewhat different   
things. But what is important is that one should not make curious   
inquiry on others. You are the Self and treat everyone as the Self.   
Bhagavan Ramana says, in Who am I?: "Without any important reason, do not  
interfere with others. Love and Hate - both should   
be eschewed. Whatever one gives to others, he gives it   
only to himself. If one truly knows this, who will not but give?   
The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects   
and what concerns other people. When one's self arises, all arise;   
when one's self becomes quiescent, all become quiescent. To   
the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result   
good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, You are correct. Only,the point is sometimes just in  
different looking on things. Without hate or love. But,i will say you are  
correct. Humility is needed. And dear Srkudai, Thank you for the link you sent
