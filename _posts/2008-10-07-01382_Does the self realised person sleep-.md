## Does the self realised person sleep.

Dear realised souls   
After one soul gets self realisation, does he sleep. So far he has the body it  
needs rest. Is not it. What is the difference   
in between his before his attainment and after attainment. I heard Shiridi sai  
baba and Bhagavan never slept.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Raamanaduli and Dr. Raju,   
I do not know about Shirdi Sai Baba. But Bhagavan did sleep and   
even snore. His sleep was quite peculiar. He never slept with his   
back on the couch. He was always slanting and slept for a few   
hours. He used to get up around 2.30 AM! There is one instance,   
where He has said that He has also got dreams. When someone   
asked what sort of dreams He had, He said He used to see Temples,   
Sivalingam and the caves inside the Hills and Siddhas and teasures   
inside the Hills.   
A Brahma Jnani can sleep, dream, wakefulness. He can eat and   
drink, go for natural calls, can have his teeth brushed, can take   
bath etc., He can show his joy, his pains, shed tears etc., These   
emotions are of course totally under the Jnani's control. When   
Echammal came to Bhagavan with her grandson and cried about   
her daughter's demise, Bhagavan cried profusely. He expressed   
joy, when rice gruel and avial were served in the Asram! He   
expressed pain, when the monkey, Nondi Paiyan was harmed.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
When Jananis also behave like us, what makes difference. I think we do only  
for ourself and for our family. HERE i ALSO EXAMINED MYSELF.   
i do feel more worry for my children than others. But my capacity is limitted.  
I cannot leave my family and go to others to   
help. Whereas sanyasi those do not have their own family they can have time.  
Am I correct.   
2ndly, I heard jananis stage is while sleeping they will be awake. How it is  
possible. Of course they are above our levels.   
thoongiyum thungadha nilai?

Dear Ramanaduli, Jnani's emotions are towards the whole universe   
and its inhabitants. This is called Cosmic Consciousness, by Swami   
Vivekananda. He once woke up from sleep suddenly and when   
people around him asked him what was the matter, he replied,   
"There is something wrong somewhere." Next morning, news   
papers flashed news about an earthquake in a far off place and   
several people had died. Bhagavan also displayed such emotions.   
Regarding sleep and wakefulness, Bhagavan once flabbergasted   
the devotees saying that it is sleepless sleep, wakeful sleep,   
wakeless wakefulness and sleeping wakefulness! Saint Tayumanavar   
asked Siva: "Thoongamal thoongi sugam peruvathu ekkalam?   
O Siva. when shall I get the bliss of sleepless sleep?   
This may perhaps be called Turiya or Turiuyateetham.   
Arunachala Siva.
