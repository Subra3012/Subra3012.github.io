34. I am indeed Brahman, 'That'. Brahman indeed am I, Lord of the universe.   
Brahman indeed am I without reflection. Brahman indeed am I, the affliction-  
less.   
35. Brahman indeed am I, the space of consciousness. Brahman indeed am I, the gap-less. Brahman indeed am I, the great joy. Brahman indeed am I, Self, ever.   
36. Brahman indeed am I, the end-less Self. Brahman indeed am I, the supremely   
silent and divested of all stories.   
37. Brahman indeed am I; 'this' is unreal. Brahman indeed am I; the world is   
naught. Brahman indeed am I, the body I am not. Brahman indeed am I, the   
great non-dual.   
38. Brahman alone shines as the mind. Brahman alone is Siva, ever. Brahman   
alone shines as intellect. Brahman, indeed, is the fruit by itself.   
39. Brahman alone always shines as the form. That itself is Brahman; of this,   
there can be no doubt. Brahman alone shines as time. Brahman alone takes   
the form of everything.   
40. Brahman alone shines as the sentient. Brahman alone shines by itself like   
the insentient. Brahman alone is everything as Om. Brahman alone is of the  
form   
of Om.   
41\. Sound Brahman is Brahman alone. There is no difference or no non-dual.   
It is the truth. There is no an iota apart from Brahman.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
