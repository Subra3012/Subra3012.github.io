## On Onam day...

On Onam day, remembering one of the most respected Brahma Jnani in Bhagavatha  
\- King Mahabali. I will always remember what Lord said after putting his feet  
on Mahabali's head in BHagavatha. Lord said to Indra : "You will never  
understand the greatness of Mahabali. I salute him for going beyond my Maya  
power, which is so far impossible for you".   
Lord covered the 14 worlds with two steps of his. And when he asked Mahabali : "For third step, there is still something more you can give me, something  
beyond all 14 worlds and that is what I want to put my third feet". Mahabali  
being a true Jnani knew what it was - Lord was hinting at putting his feet of  
"I-ness" of Mahabali. And the king bowed surrendering his "I" to the Lord. May  
we get the same strength...

Dear sanjaya_ganesh,   
Very nice. In Kerala, Onam is a big festival. The houses and temples are  
decorated with colorful flowers. Then there will   
be dance called Kaikottik KaLi. They will make sweets with milk and sugar and  
eat with feast for the lunch. Mahabali   
is a great character in Srimad Bhagavatam. Even Sri Krishna had to salute him  
for his noble philanthropy. When two feet   
of Sri Krishna (as Vamana and later Trivikrama), asked him where to keep his  
third step, Mahabali bowed his head and   
asked Krishna to place his third step on his head. That shows that his ego has  
been completely conquered. He became   
Jnani when ahankaram is vanquished.   
There were many Malayalee devotees for Sri Bhagavan. The earliest devotees  
were all Malayalees. Kunju Swami, Pazhani   
Swami, Ramakrishna Swami and later, K.K. Nambiar, were all Malayalees. Sri  
Bhagavan used to speak and write Malayalam.   
He has composed His Upadesa Saram as KiLip Pattu. Today Nochur Venkataraman,  
who is praised by the 'Asramam for his   
knowledge, understanding and practice of Sri Bhagavan's philosophy is a  
Malayalee. He has given beautiful discourses on   
Ulladu Narpadu, Bhagavad Gita, Atma Vidya Kirtanam, Sri Ramana Gita etc., in  
Tamizh - he is a bilingual.   
Arunachala Siva.
