Once I met one couple who went to kashi and Gaya. After meeting them I thought  
what a devotion both got and went to Kashi.But my surprise did not live long  
after hearing the story. Slowly we started the conversation. I asked them  
have you given up anything there, elders say that if you go to gaya you should  
give up one fruit, one leave and one vegitable. Here that lady told me with  
little sadness, that she gave up paharkai (bitter guard).I know mami loves  
bitter guard very much but her husband hates it. Then when I asked what about  
mama.(her husband)   
Immiedietly that gentle man told me, I cannot eat my favourite Koiya Pazhalm.  
I wondered how it happen. Then that lady told me   
there when the sastri asked mama to give up one vegetable, he told him we both  
give up paharkai which he does not like it, without asking me. In the same  
way, by accidently I told the sastri to give up the fruit koiya without asking  
mama. But both were laughing and told this is the play of God. In our hindu  
system when you grow old you should have control on your taste so they  
designed such things. But people do for the sake of sastra and continue the  
same style after coming from gaya.In general people leave which they do not  
like or easily not available. People who likes pan very much they should give  
up the pan leaves instead they give up the THEYAL ILLAI. i.e. in south they  
stich lotus leave and some trees leave and use like a plate to eat. They say  
"I went to Kashi so please do not serve on this leave". If we read  
Bhagavan's teaching it would help people to give up something slowly and  
completely.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What is the purpose behind giving up things? It is giving up desires.   
But in practice, the "devotees" try to cheat the god and themselves.   
These persons leave the items they desire the least. Is it really   
a non-attachment? Never. Persons should leave mango fruits,   
greens (for leaves) and beans or avaraikai. These are real   
non attachments. My sister left pine-apple which we rarely   
eat, betel leaves (OK) and bitter gourd. These are all cheating.   
Bhagavan Ramana, voluntarily stopped eating more than once in   
a day for 365 days, in Virupaksha Cave. He did not eat for 27 days   
at a stretch in Patala Lingam. Of course, these were not deliberate,   
but He just wanted to go without the botheration of eating! This   
is something very high in non-attachment.   
Non attachment should be followed in its real sense.   
In modern days, one should leave cigarettes, watching TV and   
wearing silk dhotis. How many can do this?   
Arunachala Siva.
