This question pops up again and again. And this needs to be scrutinized  
carefully.   
We have read Sri Ramana and yet we remain unrealized? The reason, too we all  
know...   
"Vasanas".   
The vasanas do not allow us to revel as the Self. We do achieve momentary  
peace in prayers, japa or meditation practices or even self inquiry. But very  
soon the peace is taken away from us by our vasanas.   
Vasanas are habit patterns in us. These need to be dealt with.   
So here is a way. .. go against vasanas and start living as the Self.   
For example, i am lazy and i wake up late. so for me. .. start waking up  
early. [need not over do it... one needs to observe caution, as if i start  
taking bath in cold water every day i might catch cold etc. one needs good  
health for spiritual practice].   
the vasanas create discomfort.   
And that moment inquire who feels uncomfortable?   
Who is suffering?   
Again. .. suppose i have a bad habit. .. stop doing it.   
Suppose i have a particular habit patter. .. stop going by it.   
do the opposite and see. ..   
[all the time noting that i should be careful not to spoil health and should  
never do anything agianst dharma].   
Thus slowly the vasanas lose hold over me... suppose i hate going somewhere or  
hate doing something. .. any vasana. .. catch the vasana. .. face it. .. and  
then inquire who has these vasanas   
This is the direct means to liberation.   
A Few times of test: 1) A simple vasana. .. just sit down without doing anything. .. see the mind  
asking you to move out. it says "i am bored". .. watch that. .. and then  
inquire who is bored, until the "I" is firmly established as the Self.   
2) Suppose i am physically ill. .. wonderful moment to inquire... who is  
feeling dissatisfied with the physical state. [but note that we should take  
the medicines none the less. .. as from practical perspective unless we are  
healthy we cannot continue self inquiry]   
3) Suppose someone is speaking against our beliefs. wonderful moment. .. see  
who is getting impatient with the person's argument. go to a group where  
people have opposite views and may even criticize ramana. .. and see who feels  
impatience in such a group.   
4) Suppose the climate is uncomfortable. see who feels discomfort and is  
disturbed by the climate.   
5) suppose the climate is comfortable. .. now see who feels better and  
impressed by the climate!   
6) suppose there is a powercut in the night just when i am sleeping. .. wow!  
That is the moment! We got it. .. its a wonderful time to test our  
understanding.   
There are numerous such times we can find to do sadhana. .. lets not miss  
them.   
Love!

Dear Srkudai,   
Very contemplative posts. You have raised some interesting points and  
situations. I do not disagree with all your points but at the same time as I  
was reading your post I had a different thoughts. Below is your post and my  
thoughts in blue. Also, it is not intended as a counter argument here but just  
for our reflection   
This question pops up again and again. And this needs to be scrutinized  
carefully.   
We have read Sri Ramana and yet we remain unrealized? The reason, too we all  
know...   
"Vasanas". _The very thought that we are not realised is the problem, that is  
the Vasana. inquire who needs to be realised, we ould find that its the false  
'I'_   
The vasanas do not allow us to revel as the Self. We do achieve momentary  
peace in prayers, japa or meditation practices or even self inquiry. But very  
soon the peace is taken away from us by our vasanas. _We have a preconceived  
idea about peace here. there is a wonderful saying - "If you do not know what  
happiness is, you will never be unhappy."_   
Vasanas are habit patterns in us. These need to be dealt with. Do we have  
Vasanas? _What makes us bealive that we have Vasanas?_   
So here is a way. .. go against vasanas and start living as the Self. can we  
live as Self? Self But is. _We need not make any effort to live as Self.   
We are the Self. What is it that wants to go against Vasanas? It again an idea  
here and hope that if we go against Vasanas we may be able to Live as Self?  
The mind just wants CHange, Why should the Self want to go against Vasanas?  
Its again only the False 'I' thats thinks if I go against Vasanas I can live  
as Self? Self needs nothing actually_   
For example, i am lazy and i wake up late. so for me. .. start waking up  
early. [need not over do it... one needs to observe caution, as if i start  
taking bath in cold water every day i might catch cold etc. one needs good  
health for spiritual practice].   
the vasanas create discomfort.   
And that moment inquire who feels uncomfortable?   
Who is suffering? _The very thought I am lazy, I wake up late is the problem?  
its the thought that It is wrong to lazy its wrong to wake up late, its good  
if I can take a cold water bath. Things are perfect as it is! why to change  
them? its the mind game which opinionates these actions as good and bad. just  
remaining as it is is to LIve as Self_   
Again. .. suppose i have a bad habit. .. stop doing it. _Why do we think its a  
bad habit? because the society says so_   
Suppose i have a particular habit patter. .. stop going by it. _Why do we  
think we have a particular bad habit?_   
do the opposite and see. .. _Thats all the false 'I' wants - CHange, the Self  
is not interested in whatever we do._   
[all the time noting that i should be careful not to spoil health and should  
never do anything agianst dharma].   
Thus slowly the vasanas lose hold over me... suppose i hate going somewhere or  
hate doing something. .. any vasana. .. catch the vasana. .. face it. .. and  
then inquire who has these vasanas - _Only the false 'I' is happy, Self is  
unaffected by all these efforts? does it change the Self? only the false 'I'  
is satisfied, the need for change is satisfied. Why Hate anything? why not let  
it be as it is? it wants to only satisfy the false 'I' There is nothing there  
to face anything in reality, even facing anything is also just an idea. who is  
satisfied after facing it? its again the false 'I' its is just satisfied with  
one more change of events. There are no Vasanas and the thought that we have  
vasanas itself is just an Idea, The Self does not have any of these_   
This is the direct means to liberation. - _This the False 'I' gives meanings  
to Liberation, False 'I' defines and sets ways for Liberation. There are no  
means for liberations no way as the Self is ever here and ever liberated. Its  
only the false 'I' that is seeking means for liberation   
_   
A Few times of test: 1) A simple vasana. .. just sit down without doing anything. .. see the mind  
asking you to move out. it says "i am bored". .. watch that. .. and then  
inquire who is bored, until the "I" is firmly established as the Self. _JUST  
SIT DOWN all the rest of activities are just the false 'I's games. Just Sit -  
thats all is required. _   
2) Suppose i am physically ill. .. wonderful moment to inquire... who is  
feeling dissatisfied with the physical state. [but note that we should take  
the medicines none the less. .. as from practical perspective unless we are  
healthy we cannot continue self inquiry] _only the false 'I' wants to inquire.  
The Self is never Ill. It never gets dissatisfied. only the false 'I' wants  
some game to play. _   
3) Suppose someone is speaking against our beliefs. wonderful moment. .. see  
who is getting impatient with the person's argument. go to a group where  
people have opposite views and may even criticize ramana. .. and see who feels  
impatience in such a group. _Its again only the false 'I', its preconceived  
ideas and thoughts are under threat, it is scared of dying. it tries to  
protect itself. _   
4) Suppose the climate is uncomfortable. see who feels discomfort and is  
disturbed by the climate. _CLimate change and discomfort is also just an idea  
for the False 'I' to play more games. The Self has no climates_   
5) suppose the climate is comfortable. .. now see who feels better and  
impressed by the climate!   
6) suppose there is a powercut in the night just when i am sleeping. .. wow!  
That is the moment! We got it. .. its a wonderful time to test our  
understanding. _The false 'I' is seeing changes in power cuts and all. it is  
fascinated by changes. The Self has no powercuts or day or night or even light  
or darkness. The false 'I' only wants to be engaged wants some Change, It just  
does not want to be_.   
There are numerous such times we can find to do sadhana. .. lets not miss  
them. _The False 'I' is making its master plan _   
_Why do any Sadhana? only the False 'I' wants to do Sadhana. The Self does not  
need any Sadhana. All the False 'I' wants is nothing but Change.   
One is naturally the Self. _   
_Biggest of them all_   
 **The False 'I' does not want to believe that it itself is the perfect Self**  
_it wants to be something different according to its own agenda, preconceived  
ideas of the past and like what is accepted by the large people in the  
society. It wants to be just like Ramana Maharshi, it wants to be just like  
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, it wants to be like Adi Shankara It wants to be like  
Nisargadatta Maharaj but it just does not want to be itSelf. Its own true  
self_

Why the "I" does not want to believe itself as the Real I? Because,   
it knows, it is shabby and dirty. The wife comes out of the kitchen,   
with all dirts of smoke, spilt coffee, rasam and asafoetida on her   
apron. She does not want to see the mirror. She goes to the bathroom, removes  
the apron, washes her face and limbs, set right   
her hair and then comes out to see the mirror and then serve the   
food!

Dear Ganesh,   
If you have seen it. .. that is beautiful. What ever you wrote is at once  
correct and incorrect.   
The questions you have raised are exactly what we see in Advaita Bodha  
Deepika.   
Advaita Bodha Deepika contains a very interesting question from the disciple  
....The disciple, through vichara, has known beyond all doubts that he is the  
Consciousness.[This has not yet transformed into living]   
So the master says "Meditate on I am Brahman"...   
The disciple asks: "Sir, now that i have known that i am the Brahman directly  
through vichara, why do i need to meditate on it?"   
The master explains very beautifully. without reproducing the text here, i  
shall explain the fundamental point clearly. you can refer to Advaita Bodha  
Deepika for further explanation its a wonderful text.   
The knowledge "I am Brahman". .. was not there before [meeting guru in the  
form of books or ]. This knowledge... the body does not require it. The Self,  
Brahman needs no knowledge. so first it "went" straight to the mind. The mind.   
Even if we do not test this knowledge, it gets tested. To be True to ourselves  
... when i say i am ANANDA RUPAM. .. i cannot be seeking "Bliss" in some  
external objects. if i am seeking, that needs correction. if i am not seeking  
... that is fine, this teaching is not for such a person. .. he is already  
realized : so this teaching is for a person who has this question lingering in  
mind "why do i not realize the truth".   
Love!

Dear Srkudai,   
You have made a very pertinent point. Its really like an eye opener. As you  
say the knowledge 'I am Brahman' never existed before we came into contacts  
with Gurus or books. True, the body or the Self does not requires it!   
Then who requires this knowledge here? My question here is if it 'went'  
straight into Mind, aren't we creating a Mind entity separate from Brahman? is  
there a mind separate from Brahman then? We have also come across teachings  
and understanding that Mind is also non existent. some confusion prevails. I  
need to grab a copy of Advaita Bodha Deepika.

i exist because i think i do....   
to experience existence or non-existence is an extremely personal journey...   
Ramana Maharishi's life history describes one such journey which we aspire to  
bring into the fold of our experience.   
but then each one of us has to travel "alone" and no experience can be shared.   
As for why i do not realise the Truth, there is no single answer.   
We have to go on asking questions and seeking answers....within...   
. ..as also in this forum...and outside it too

Dear Ganesh,   
Advaita bodha Deepika is available online: http://sriramanamaharshi.org/Allpub_demo.html   
Please see this...   
The body does not need this knowledge nor cares for it.   
The Self does not need it either.   
The mind needs it. If mind were not there in the first place, then that is  
fine. one need not be taught all this. But the mind is there now. The "I"  
thought is creating all sorts of troubles. .. so it is the "I" which seeks  
liberation. Otherwise who needs liberation?   
These teachings are for the "I" which seeks liberation. .. and this "I" is  
itself a fictious entity. And as long as this keeps seeking it cannot find,  
coz the seeker "I" ego, is the fundamental ignorance. So Ramana says. ..  
whenever "I" arises. .. just roll it back into the Consciousness. Just roll it  
back into its source. if no "I" thought arises, fine. dont need to do anything  
: just be.   
but if "I" thought is arising and creating all nonsense. .. then seek its  
source and remain established there !   
Now. .. "I" is all our past, all habits, all vasanas. There are some that are  
dormant. hidden within. we need to bringthem up and see them as mere illusions  
or shadows. the sooner the better. So, remaining independent of the fictious  
and dream "I" one remains as the Pure Self...   
Love!

Hi,   
When you say: "I didn't realize the Self" what do you mean? It is something  
concrete to be realized and is called the Self? If it is not, how do you  
realize that you didn't realize the Self? This is the very question to start  
with.   
Secondly, you say: "We do achieve momentary peace in prayers, japa or  
meditation practices or even self inquiry. But very soon the peace is taken  
away from us by our vasanas." There's no such a peace to be taken by vasanas.  
The peace you acquire through meditation japa and so forth is relative of its  
very nature. So it couldn't last long.

Dear avatar,   
The Self is the only concrete thing to realize. Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the Tamil word ULLadu, which means that which exists. When we   
realize the Self, the only concrete thing, then we become the Self,   
that concrete thing, which is everywhere, all present, without beginning and  
end, the One without a second.   
The prayers, japa, meditation etc., which gives Peace, because at that points  
of time, the mind is quelling in the Self. The Peace is not   
permanent and it is taken away by the vasanas. The withdrawal   
of the mind from the Self, is due to our tendencies, vasanas. If the   
vasanas are banished once and for all, then there is no withdrawal, Peace  
becomespermanent.   
I trust that what is described by srkudai, is correct and we have to only  
interpret/understand it, in the way Bhagavan Ramana has guided us.   
Arunachala Siva.

You asked: what is the reason why one remains unrealized?   
I know what the self is - awareness. But when one speaks about self uses words  
and he/she takes the words for the self. From this confusion raises all the  
rest - the false feeling the the self is not realized although he/she  
practices all kind of exercisess and reads carefully what Ramana said. Don't  
you see?   
To speak truly there's nothing to be practices in order to realize our  
spiritual nature. Because this nature is a given (natural) so all we have to  
do is to SEE it as it already is.   
"The withdrawal of the mind from the Self, is due to our tendencies, vasanas."  
you said. It is wrong. Te mind is the Self in its true nature. What hinders it  
to realize this are the words it uses to UNDERSTAND the self.   
"I trust that what is described by srkudai, is correct and we have to only  
interpret/understand it, in the way Bhagavan Ramana has guided us." you said.  
Don't trust anything just because you THINK it is true. See what this trust  
led you to? Then what are you intending to do about it?

## Re:[10] Why do i not realize the Truth ?  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 01, 2009, 08:10:56 AM

The last chapter of the Advaita Bodha Deepika speaks thus: D.: What is the nature of mind?   
M.: To think this and that. In the absence of thought, there   
can be no mind. On the thoughts being extinguished the mind   
will remain only in name like the horn of a hare; it will vanish as   
a non-entity like a barren womans son, or a hares horn, or a   
flower in the sky. This is also mentioned in the Yoga Vasishta.   
D.: How?   
M.: Vasishta says: Listen, O Rama, there is nothing to   
speak of as mind. Just as the ether exists without form, so also   
the mind exists as the blank insentience. It remains only in   
name; it has no form. It is not outside, nor is it in the heart. Yet   
like the ether, the mind though formless fills all.   
D.: How can this be?   
M.: Wherever thought arises as this and that, there is the   
mind.   
D.: If there be mind wherever there is thought, are thought   
and mind different?   
M.: Thought is the index of the mind. When a thought   
arises mind is inferred. In the absence of thought, there can be   
no mind. Therefore mind is nothing but thought. Thought is   
itself mind.   
D.: What is thought?   
M.: Thought is imagination. The thought-free state is   
Bliss Supreme (Sivasvarupa). Thoughts are of two kinds; the   
recalling of things experienced and unexperienced.   
11\. D.: To begin with, please tell me what is thought.   
M.: Sages say that it is nothing but to think of any external   
object as this or that, is or is not, this-wise or that-wise, etc.   
12-13. D.: How is this to be classified under the heads of   
things experienced and unexperienced?   
M.: Of objects of senses, such as sound, already experienced   
as I saw  I heard  I touched etc. to think of them as   
having been seen, heard, touched is the recollection of things   
already experienced. To call to mind unexperienced objects of   
senses is the thought of unexperienced things.   
14\. D.: That thoughts pertain to things already experienced   
is understandable. But how to think of those not so experienced   
unless they are reminiscences of things already experienced? One   
can never think of things not experienced. How then can we say   
 to think of things not already experienced is thought?   
15\. M.: Yes, it is quite possible. To think of things not   
experienced is also thought. Objects unexperienced appear as   
such only after thinking.

I also think that the very effort made to remove our Vasanas is taking us away  
from our real Self.   
Being thoughtlessness is not blank or no thoughts, as per my understanding its  
just spontaneous. Vasanas dont go away. I think Vasanas are also a thought  
only.   
When Krishna says you have rights only on action but not the fruits, then such  
action can only be spontaneous action without any thought process going on in  
our mind.   
Vyasa when he segregate the Vedas in 4 sections. He also has said not to  
believe whatever is written here unless you understand, feel and become the  
teachings itself.   
Thoughts are nothing but our mind itself, and when such mind itself is just a  
Mirage, why do we need to do something to remove a non existing mind. If this  
mind is deserving realization, then its only a mirage, A non existing thing  
wanting realization is only a thought.   
We have to just be.

Dear avatar, Nagaraj,   
We have seen new born children, just a few hours old inside the   
maternity ward, have died. These children might not have any   
thoughts, they have not seen the world, (some such children are   
even born blind and they die in a few hours). Such thoughtless   
children, are they all liberated or self realized?   
Arunachala Siva.

No, they are not. Just like cats and dogs (also beings without thoughts) are  
not realized.

according to my understanding, the birth or the child, its death, whether the  
child has thoughts no thoughts, their being blind etc... is all our own  
thoughts only (mind). Whether they are realized or liberated or still to  
realize or still to be liberated, all such thoughts (questions) are only mind.  
Why should it matter if they are realized or not realized?   
To this exercise of thought pattern, the sage in Advaita Bodha Deepika has  
replied thus for questoin 12-13: "Of objects of senses, such as sound, already experienced   
as I saw  I heard  I touched etc. to think of them as   
having been seen, heard, touched is the recollection of things   
already experienced. To call to mind unexperienced objects of   
senses is the thought of unexperienced things."   
So there is no child, no birth or death and all other observations are all  
only the thoughts - Mind.   
The Sage also says   
"M.: Wherever thought arises as this and that, there is the mind."
