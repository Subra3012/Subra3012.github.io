1\. Turn the mind inward and rest in your own Self.   
2\. Mind is the cause of bondage.   
3\. Give up one thing after another and rest in peace.   
 **4\. What we get, we shall lose, so desire not.**   
5\. There are two kinds of meditation. The first is to be practised by  
advanced aspirants  nirguna dhyana  where one seeks to know the Meditator  
himself. The second kind is to be practised by those less advanced  a some  
what round about course  saguna dhyana  where the meditator, meditation and  
the object of meditation get merged ultimately into one.   
 **6\. When I come to know that I was never born, I shall never die. Death is  
for one who is born. I was never born. I have no body and so I shall never  
die. I am everywhere; where am I to go and where am I to come?**   
 **7\. When a mans mind is dead, he will not die again.**   
8\. Attain the sushupti (state of sleep) in the jagrat (waking) state, and you  
become a jnani.

SHRI BHAGAVANS GRACE By Gouriammal   
One instance of his grace to his devotees is his recommendation of two songs  
from Tiruppugazh to help them get their daughters married. The devotees of  
Bhagavan believed firmly that it was enough to sing the two songs from  
Tiruppugazh before Bhagavan to have the marriage arranged in the best way  
possible. There is another song in Tiruppugazh in which God is invited to come  
to the house as a newborn child. When anyone approached Bhagavan praying for a  
child he would tell them to sing that song.

This Tiruppugazh song recommended by Bhagavan Ramana to Gauriamamal is quite  
famous. This was earnestly sung by some   
devotees who had difficulties in getting their daughters married,   
and in some cases, even the would-be-brides themselves took it   
up in all faith and sang these songs.   
One such song is given in full by Sri Devaraja Mudaliar in his book,   
"Thaayum neeye, thanthaiyum neeye" [You are the Mother and You   
are the Father.]   
The song reads as under: On the peacock that resembles,   
the blueness of the rain clouds,   
I saw your coming and I seek You,   
I, this poor me, am mad with love for You,   
Please give me your bridal garland and grace me!   
O the Courageous, who shot the Javelin on the Krouncha hill,   
The very god of death to the demons, are You!   
You are the purport of all the four Vedas.   
"I -I" \- you beat your chest to devotees.   
Arunachala Siva.
