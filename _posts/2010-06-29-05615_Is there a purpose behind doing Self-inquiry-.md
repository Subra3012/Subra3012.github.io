## Is there a purpose behind doing Self-inquiry?

Unlike other spiritual methods which keeps ego for doing spiritual  
discipline,in Self-inquiry we doubt the   
very existence of ego by watchfulness,witnessing,observing without the  
observer as the center of   
observation,the contents of the ego,its thoughts,its feelings and just being a  
watcher without   
judging,measuring,evaluating, categorizing.So Self-inquiry is "not a doing  
process",it is a process of   
"being a watcher,witnessing,observing" what so ever happening in the mind.So  
we no longer give   
strength to thoughts and feelings and when energy is not given by us,they will  
fall by themselves.   
Being false they require continuous energy supply from us for their sustenance  
because they cannot   
sustain on their own.So giving energy to thoughts and emotions is curtailed in  
Self-inquiry.   
"Self-inquiry is a process of non-doing" and mind is put aside in Self-  
inquiry.So it is a state of   
simple observation without any observer,just a state of  
watchfulness,witnessing.   
If one tries to do Self-inquiry through effort which is very common,mind comes  
into operation   
and when mind enters the duality is created,"today i am not realized and  
sometime in the future   
i shall be the Self".This a process of becoming,desiring,and in this there is  
duality,contradiction,   
strife,misery.So any effort in Self-inquiry implies duality and so  
contradiction and existence of   
process of minding is possible when there is duality and contradiction.Not  
knowing what to do   
with the state of duality,contradiction,strife,misery because mind itself is  
the cause of   
all these,it invents so many ideals and spiritual disciplines and Self-inquiry  
one such for them.   
In the name of all these so called spiritual disciplines it avoids facing and  
observing this   
contradiction.So if mind enters the Self-inquiry which is essentially non-  
dualistic watchfulness   
of the contents of the mind,converts Self-inquiry into a dualistic process by  
creating a goal,   
a purpose which is nothing but a projection of mind itself to reach the Self  
through the   
dimension of time.Is discovery of Self a time bound process or it there for  
you to be?   
If there is a purpose behind Self-inquiry mind is not free to inquire,we  
cannot have witnessing   
consciousness,watchfulness to observe the thoughts and feelings because  
purpose interferes   
with such free observation.Purpose presumes a direction and in freedom we  
cannot have   
any direction because anything directed is limited and not free,and so  
direction must always be   
in ignorance in which there is no freedom for observation and so direction of  
purpose lead us no   
where.Hence to have a purpose in Self-inquiry is to create a false goal.In  
Self-inquiry the clouds   
of thoughts and emotions which so far veiled the splendor of the ultimate  
reality which is the Self   
are put aside and we realize that we are that splendor of the Self.In this  
there is no purpose   
implied.Is there any purpose in being happy,blissful,or observing a beautiful  
flower? just   
observing them itself is enough unto itself.Creation of a purpose is the trick  
of the mind to avoid   
being in the present moment.Any purpose takes us away from the present moment  
and so   
from our source of being.Being is always in the present tense and purpose has  
its roots in the   
past and projecting into future thus missing the present.The sole purpose of  
Self-inquiry is   
to shed the purpose created by the mind which brings so much conflict and  
misery in our daily   
life.So the purpose of Self-inquiry is to become purposeless.Purpose is the  
progeny of ignorance   
and purposelessness is the progeny of wisdom.Being real,infinite and eternal  
Self cannot have any   
purpose and it is slf existing.The intelligence of awareness in Self-inquiry  
is devoid of all purpose   
and goal and it is a divine spark that sets fire to all purposes of the  
mind.There is gestalt from   
"becoming"(minding) to "being"(no mind) in Self-inquiry.In Self-inquiry the  
focus of attention is diverted   
from thoughts to the gaps between them.You dissolve in that gap and be the  
gap.In the gap "you are"   
here and now. Doubting the ego is the vestibule which we all must pass through  
before we can enter   
the truth.This is Self-inquiry.

Self inquiry is only for mind.   
its a correction in the mind.   
The Self does not need Self inquiry   
The Body does not understand it either.   
So only mind.   
Self inquiry is a way to remain in Samadhi, if i may use the word.   
And Samadhi is a practice to purify mind. To make mind Pure... to dissolve the  
form aspect of mind.   
Dissolution of form aspect of mind means dissolving the idea that "I am form"  
in mind. Nothing else.

Dear Udai,Namaste. Iam posting Bhagawan's opinion on Self-inquiry.   
SELF-ENQUIRY.   
This is the direct method. All other methods are practised   
while retaining the ego and therefore many doubts arise and   
the ultimate question still remains to be tackled in the end. But   
in this method the final question is the only one and is raised   
from the very beginning.   
Self-enquiry leads directly to Self-realisation by removing the   
obstacles which make you think that the Self is not already realised.   
Meditation requires an object to meditate on, whereas in   
Self-enquiry there is only the subject and no object. That is the   
difference between them.   
Devotee: Why should Self-enquiry alone be considered the direct   
path to Realisation?   
Bhagavan: Because every kind of path except Self-enquiry   
presupposes the retention of the mind as the instrument for   
following it, and cannot be followed without the mind. The   
ego may take different and more subtle forms at different stages   
of one's practice but it is never destroyed. The attempt to destroy   
the ego or the mind by methods other than Self-enquiry is like   
a thief turning policeman to catch the thief that is himself. Self-enquiry   
alone can reveal the truth that neither the ego nor the   
mind really exists and enable one to realise the pure,   
undifferentiated Being of the Self or the Absolute.   
This statement that the mind is not used by the method of   
Self-enquiry was not always understood, and therefore   
Bhagavan, when asked, explained that it means that the mind   
is not taken for granted as a real entity but its very existence is   
questioned, and that this is the easiest way to dispel the illusion   
of its existence.

Dear Raju,   
 Its very nice to see you posting again.   
Let us, for a while, put aside what Ramana said. We will return to it a little  
later.   
Firstly, Self Inquiry is not for someone who is in Just Be State. isnt it?  
Someone who is already reveling as Self, Self Inquiry is not required.   
Self Inquiry is for one who has mistaken the rope to be a snake. I am mind or  
I am body. .. who ever thinks thus, he requires Self Inquiry. Who ever is  
already reveling as Self, does not require Self Inquiry.   
Second, Self inquiry is an action. One has to "Do" it. "Doing" is only of  
mind. It just is withdrawing the mind from all subjects and resting it in  
Consciousness.   
So Self inquiry is just what Ashtavakra Said in the verse: yadi deham prtak kritya [if we detach ourselves from our body (mind)], chitti  
vishramya tistasi [and sit relaxed as consciousness]   
adhunaiva sukhi santho [immediately, we become restful and peaceful], bandha  
mukto bhavishyathi [and liberated from all bondage]   
that is Self inquiry.   
To turn the mind away from external entities and body and remain relaxed as  
Consciousness. Its immediate result: Peace, Restfulness and liberation from  
bondage.   
So withdrawal has to be done. And the process of withdrawal is self inquiry.  
when i am lost in the body & mind. .. the external objects, withdrawing from  
the external entities and asking "who am i", I just remain as who i am: Consciousness.   
infact, one can turn one's japa into Self inquiry or a prayer into Self  
inquiry. if one is, through the prayer or japa, withdrawing from the sense  
objects and remaining established as Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Dr. Raju,   
I am happy to see such posts as yours. I wish only to add [not in   
substitution] the following:-   
1\. About modifications or activity of the mind:-   
Maharshi's Gospel:-   
Although the concept of "I"-ness or "I am"-ness is by usage is   
known as aham vritti, it is not really a vritti. [modification or   
activity of the mind] like other vrittis of the mind. Because,   
unlike other vrittis, which no essential inter-relation, the aham-   
vritti is equally and essentially relatede to each and every vritti   
of the mind. Without aham-vritti there can be no other vritti, but the aham  
vritti can subsist by itself without depending on any other vritti of the  
mind. The aham vritti is therefore fundamentally different from other  
vrittis.   
2\. Whether Vichara is a search? The Character of this search:-   
Sat Darsana Bhashyam:-   
Question: You say one can realize the Self by a search for it.   
What is the character of this search?   
Bhagavan: You are the mind or think that you are the mind. The mind is  
nothing but thoughts. Now behind every particular thought   
there is a general thought, which is the "I" that is yourself. Let us call  
this "I" as the first thought. Stick to this "I"-thought and question it to  
find out what it is. When this question takes strong   
hold on you, you cannot think of other thoughts.   
Question: I would like this and cling to my self, i.e. the I-thought,   
other thoughts do come and go, but I say to myself 'Who am I?'   
and there is no answer forthcoming. To be in this condition is the sadhana.  
Is it so?   
Bhagavan: THIS IS A MISTAKE THAT OFTEN PEOPLE MAKE. What happens when you  
make a SERIOUS quest for the Self, is that the   
"I"-thought as a thought disappears, something else from the depths take hold  
of you and that is not the "I" which commenced the   
quest.   
Question: What is that 'something else'?   
Bhagavan: That is the real Self, the import of "I". It is not the ego. It  
is the supreme being itself.   
3\. The purpose of Self enquiry - or the Benefits from Self enquriy:-   
Padamalai Verses: Verse 620: Only vichara removes the desire for the numerous   
enjoyments of the senses by revealing them to be insubstantial.   
Verse 621: Only beneficial vichara will confer upon you, as your own form,  
the limitless expanse of supreme bliss.   
Sri Ramana Gita, Ch. 7 Verse 6: The result of self enquiry is freedom from all suffering. This is the highest  
of all fruits. There is nothing higher than this.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Udai,i sincerely feel that Self-inquiry is for transforming the mind but  
it is not done by the mind.   
I am posting another article now,go through it and then you can give your  
opinion.
