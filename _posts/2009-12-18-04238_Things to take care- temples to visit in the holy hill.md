Hi All - finally the time has come! I'm visiting the holy hill for the 1st  
time. I've been trying to plan for the visit for a long time, and suddenly it  
got planned today. I'm going this weekend (19, 20 december 2009).   
Here is my plan: 1\. Arrive in T.Malai by Saturday evening by 6   
2\. Book a room, fresh up - visit the temple   
3\. Start girivalam sunday early morning   
4\. Visit the temple again   
5\. Visit the ramana ashram in the afternoon, and be there till the night, and  
leave   
Is there any best practices during the girivalam? temples to visit, etc?  
mantras to chant during the girivalam? Please share.

Dear seachingme,   
1\. If you land at T.malai by 6 PM, you should check in fast into   
the hotel and have a wash and visit the temple. Being the month   
of Dhanur, the Temple will close by 9 pm.   
2\. Next morning, if you visit the Asramam and then go for circumambulation,  
it will be better, since the Asramam including   
the shrines of Mother and Son will close by 11.30 AM., i.e. mmediately after  
lunch time. In fact the bookshop will be closed   
even before the lunch time, say 11.20 AM. If you visit the Asramam,   
and then go for pradakshina, it is good, because though somewhat   
warmer, (but not hot since it is December), it will be nice to do   
pradakshina at that time. A very early morning December pradakshina, say  
from 4 am, it will be very cold, and unless you are   
used to such weather, it is better to go late.   
3. Visit to the temple again is possible only in the evening since   
the Temple also closes at 12 Noon. Preferably go to the Temple,   
by 5 PM. A detailed visit of the Temple, needs 3 hours.   
Wish you a very pleasant visit.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the reply Subramaniam.   
I'm back from the holy hill, and I don't have any words to describe my  
experience. I was so weak to complete the girivalam, and my legs started  
paining a lot, but it is the magnet (hill) which attracted me to complete the  
girivalam.   
I, infact went to T.Malai by 7 PM on Saturday night itself, and started the  
girivalam by 4 AM in the morning. I too expected it to be very cold  
considering marghazhi, but it wasn't cold at all - it was like walking on a  
sunny day.   
Visited ramanasraman, and grabbed the books you mentioned in the other thread.   
Thank again! I'm planning to write a long note on my visit soon.

Dear searchingme,   
It is wonderful to note that your maiden (?) visit was quite   
exhilarating. If you can make another trip and stay for say,   
7 days, you can cover the following:-   
1\. Gurumurtham, about 3 KMs from the Asramam. This is where   
Bhagavan Ramana and Uddandi Nayanar stayed for about 6   
months, when there was acute water scarcity on the Hill.   
2\. Pachiamman Kovil, about 2 KMs into the town, where there is   
a temple for Uma, Pachaiamman, the green mother, where again,   
Bhagavan Ramana and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri were staying   
for about 6 months. Here is where, Bhagavan Ramana 'dictated'   
about 300 verses of Uma Sahasram, through the medium of   
Ganapati Sastri, in about 4 hours time, between 8 PM and 12 MN,   
since Ganapati Sastri was to stage the poetry reading of Uma   
Sahasram in the Big Temple, next morning. Four disciples were   
taking down and the speed was tremendous. Kavyakanta Ganapati   
Sastri, did not make any alterations in these last 300 verses, even   
though he made many corrections in the first 700 verses.   
3. Isanya Desikar Matam, where there is a Samadhi for Isanya   
Desikar. He was a Jnani and an ardent devotee of Annamalai-   
Unnamalai. Bhagavan Ramana used to praise him for his penance.   
Here presently the adminstrators of Kovilur Math and their families   
stay. Bhagavan Ramana was dragged and placed on a bullock cart   
to this place for food one day by the then Math President.   
4. Virupaksha Cave, on the Hill, where Bhagavan Ramana stayed   
for 16 years. It is where Varkala Narayana Guru met Him.   
5. Skandasramam, where Bhagavan Ramana stayed for 6 years,   
where Mother Azhagamma joined Him and where He was given   
hot rice and rasam, by Mother everyday after a long break of   
two decades.   
6\. Patala Lingam Shrine inside the Temple. Where Bhagavan   
Ramana stayed for 27 days without food. Seshadri Swami brought Him out  
through one Mudaliar. This Shrine was renovated by   
Madam Talyarkhan in 1949.   
7. Summit of the Hill, where one hears Samaveda at nights.   
8. Palakottu, about 1 KM into the forest, behind Mother's   
Temple, where stalwarts like Chadwick, Osborne, Annamalai   
Swami and others stayed in cottages.   
9\. Manakkula Vinayakar Street - Here there is Samadhi for   
Sri Sadhu Om.   
10. Behind Cow Lakshmi's Samadhi - Here there are five   
Samadhis for Viswanatha Swami, Kunju Swami, Ramasamy   
Pillai, Rajeswarananda and one more person.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the info Subramanian. Yes, it was my maiden visit. I'm getting  
married in about 5 months, but already planning for a visit before marriage,  
and also after. Let's see what bhagvan has in store for me.   
Om Namo Namashivaya!
