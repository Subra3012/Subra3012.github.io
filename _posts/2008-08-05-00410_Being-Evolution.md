Dear DRPVSSN Raju, there is only Being and there is   
no evolution, sustenance or dissolution. It is all   
products of the mind, Maya. Please see Maandukya   
Upanishad and Gaudapada's Karika, the famous   
verse commentary on the Upanishad.   
Arunachala Siva.

Science says due to the evolution we are so progressed. Darwin also accepts  
this evolution. I have a doubt in Siva puranam   
saint Manikavachagar also says same thing.... like he says he evolved from  
stone, earth,tree, snake man, ghost at last he   
took this human form. But during this time his self is not changed only forms  
changed. That is his Being not changed.   
Therefore evolution always is there. It is from my poor knowledge

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Forgetting the original reality and seeing the reality as multiplicity is the process of evolution.Evolution is possible only in a state   
of self-forgetfulness in which there is becoming.Reality is "being" there is  
no "becoming" in it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
As per Gaudapada, Sankara and Bhagavan Ramana, there is no   
evolution and cessation, since we are the Self and we have no   
beginning and end. But what Manikkavachagar says in Siva   
Puranam, (Pullagi, poodai, puzhuvai, marmagi, pal virugamagi,   
paravaiyay paampagi.....) is the evolution of the individual soul,   
the non self, (with no self realization yet!). Both are correct.   
Arunachala Siva.
