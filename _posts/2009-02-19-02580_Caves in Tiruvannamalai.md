Has anybody been to any caves in Arunachala hill? I have read there are so  
many caves and still so many Siddhas are still meditating for so many years  
and many invisible sadhus go around there   
I also have a desire to visit some caves and walk around in the hill. But is  
it ok to go around the hill?   
O Bhagwan I love you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
There are many many caves in the Arunachala Hill. Siva as   
Arunagiri Siddha along with many many other Siddhas are   
said to live there in their invisible form. Bhagavan Ramana   
describes this in His Arunachala Mahatmyam Verse 3. There   
are also many many treasures inside these caves. Bhagavan   
Ramana lived in Virupaksha Cave, for 17 years and He mentions   
only about this Cave. He does not recommend exploring other   
caves and also the Great Banyan Tree.   
Arunachala Siva.

My dear Munagala,   
Before I explain, in the matter of Caves, there are two other caves   
mentioned by Bhagavan apart from Virupaksha Cave. I forgot to   
mention them. One is Mango Tree Cave, where Bhagavan Ramana lived for  
sometime. This must be at a lower height. The second is   
Parrot Cave, which got its name when a parrot was interred after its   
death in that cave, by Bhagavan Ramana.   
As regards the Banyan Tree, Bhagavan while strolling on the Hill,   
found one day, a very huge banyan leaf, as big as a leaf plate.   
He became curious to know the tree and proceeded further. He   
was then stung by bees on his left leg, when He accidentally trampled on the  
bees-nest. He allowed the bees to sting that left leg and then returned  
without seeing the Banyan Tree. He also felt that it was a warning for Him,  
not to find out the Banyan Tree. During later years, Muruganar, Kunju Swami  
and one Mr. Thomson a Westerner, wanted to see that tree and went without  
telling Bhagavan Ramana and seeking his blessings. They lost their way   
and were in deep trouble. All of them were severely bruised by thorny bushes.  
Muruganar was gasping for breath and was moving on all fours. Everyone became  
afraid for their lives and prayed to   
Bhagavan! They were shown the way by a woodcutter and returned without  
success. Bhagavan Ramana chided them and told everyone   
not to attempt to explore that mysterious tree!   
I think, Muruganar has written a poem on that incident and it is in   
Guru Vachaka Kovai. He also believed that the woodcutter who showed the way  
to return to the Asramam was Bhagavan Himself!   
No one thereafter attempted to explore the Tree, even though Major Chadwick,  
S.S. Cohen and Arthur Osborne had wanted. Arunagiri Siddha is said to stay at  
the foot of that Tree!   
Arunachala Siva.

Really fascinating stuffs, There is also one such cave near Madurai in a place  
called Vathraap. Itseems no one dares to enter this cave inside. even now many  
people hear Veda chanting very mildly and some of them who have ventured  
inside have either not returned back and if returned back then they have lost  
their speech. Abhinava Vidya Theertha 35th Sringeri Aacharyal when in Madurai  
ventured inside and after few hours returned back and told people to never  
venture inside that cave.   
O Bhagwan I love you

Dear Ganesh_b01,   
When you mention about Vatrap, I remember my younger days,   
in Srivilliputtur, where my father was working as Inspector of Schools. I  
went with my father, to one Kizhavan Kovil, literally,   
the Temple of the Old. We used to go by walk or horse carriage,   
get into the thick jungles. Everyone will be given oil and soap nut   
and all will take bath. There will be some yaga like affair, without   
animal sacrifice. After that, around 12 Noon, there would be a gala   
vegetarian lunch. All will return without seeing the back, that is the  
temple. I vividly remember Vatrap and Kizhavan Kovil and the Iyengarian  
splendour of Srivilliputtur. Vatrap is a place from where   
one great Tamil writer called Naa. Parthasarathy came. He was a very learned  
man in classical Tamil. His novel Kurinji Malar, which I read in my college  
days, was an idealistic but a great creation. The   
scene of action is Madurai. He is a Sri Vaishnavite.   
Arunachala Siva.
