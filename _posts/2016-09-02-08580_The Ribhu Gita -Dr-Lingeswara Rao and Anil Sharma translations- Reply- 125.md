60. Everything is verily of the nature of the Self - the visible and the invisible, the moving and the non moving. Hearing that all is the Self, man attains liberation.   
61\. Bhagavan Siva, who is the consort of Uma Parvati, is the immutable Lord.  
He alone His own power   
of Maya is the true cause behind the waking world of wondrous beings and the  
succession of phenomena.   
Thus concludes the chapter 13 a dialogue between Ribhu and Nidagha entitled  
All is the Self.   
in Siva Rahasyam.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
