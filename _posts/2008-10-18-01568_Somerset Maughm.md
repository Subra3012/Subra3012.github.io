Once Somerset Maughm,a very famous novelist from west wanted to meet Bhagawan  
through one his western friend.By then Bhagawan is also famous.   
Some devotee told Bhagawan that Somerset Maughm is coming to meet you.Bhagawan  
to everybody's surprise started walking to meet Maughm.   
Maughm suddenly encountered Bhagawan on the way and he has not expected this  
development and he suddenly lost relative consciousness and fell down.   
Bhagawan focussed his attention on the left shoulder of Maughm for 45 mts and  
later went away.After some time Maughm gained relative consciousness but he   
became fearful of Bhagawan.Some devotees told him that he is lucky to get the  
state of Samadhi through Bhagawan.But Maughm refuted it by saying that it is   
just due to sun stroke.Just before leaving Tiruvannamalai he has not met  
Bhgawan face to face but he saw Bhagawan through window of old hall and went  
away.

Somerset maughm felt some experiences but he could not realise what it is.  
Because after meeting Bhagavan he wrote the novel Razor's Edge.   
He tried to tell some spiritual experiences through his character Larry  
Darrell but it is not clear.

Dear Dr. Raju, and Ramanaduli,   
Somerset Maugham came to Tiruvannamalai and was staying in   
Major Chadwick's (Sadhu Arunachala) room. Since he was unwell,   
Chadwick requested Bhagavan whether He could come and meet.   
Bhagavan agreed and went to the room. Somerset Maugham, stood   
up from his bed and Bhagavan looked at him for about 20 minutes.   
Maugham went into a state of "tranquility" and no words were   
exchanged. When Chadwick asked Maugham to talk something,   
Bhagavan said in broken English: Hear Talk. No need to talk!   
This is reported by Chadwick, in his book Sadhu's Reminscences.   
Chadwick did not confirm that Maugham went into a state of   
bliss or trance. But Annamalai Swami, in his book Sri Ramana   
Reminsicences said that Maugham went into a state of samadhi.   
The tragic part of this stroy. Maugham himself has said later   
that he was only in a state of swoon, because of heat of Tiruvannamalai.   
When some books were sent to him abroad by Asram, Maugham   
had reported that these books were sent to him by the Asram,   
to spread Bhagavan's message. That is all was his experience   
of Bhagavan Ramana. What to do?   
Arunachala siva.
