## The Good and the Capable  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 26, 2009, 08:04:16 AM

In this world, we see people who are either good or capable   
in worldly activities. The great combination is quite rare.   
People who are good (in spiritual outlook and dharmic disposition),   
are not capable in the worldly activities. My wife is a classic   
example. She may chant Soundarya Lahari from Verse 100 to   
Verse 1 in the reverse order, but can never operate the computer   
excepting typing an email to my son. She may just cook for two   
of us, but may not be able to arrange a dinner for 25 people.   
There are people who are capable but definitely not good in their   
disposition. They end up like Harshad Mehtas, Prabhakarans   
and George Bush-s in their lives.   
People who are good and capable are quite rare. Like Chozha   
Kings who were great Siva bhaktas but destroyed the enemies   
who wanted to invade them, like "flies to wanton boys."   
At the end of the day, I consider the people are good are the   
salt of the earth. The earth lives because of them and rains   
pour due to them.   
Arunachala Siva.
